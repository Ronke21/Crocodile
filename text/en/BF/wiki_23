<text>Heather Renée Sweet (born September 28, 1972), known professionally as Dita Von Teese, is an American vedette, burlesque dancer, model, actress, and businesswoman. She is credited with re-popularizing burlesque performance, earning the moniker &quot;Queen of Burlesque&quot;.

Von Teese has been seen in &quot;&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race,&quot; &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;, &quot;The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell&quot;, among other television productions. She is also known for her short marriage to singer Marilyn Manson as well as performing in his music videos. Von Teese has released two books on burlesque history, fetishism and beauty. She has toured the world with her burlesque shows in cities like London, Berlin, New York and Paris. Among her special guests on the tours are Dirty Martini, Perle Noire, Ginger Valentine, Jett Adore and Playboy model Gia Genevieve. Von Teese has been a special guest at the Parisian venue Crazy Horse several times. From 2007 to 2013, she was a global ambassador for Cointreau and in 2010–2011 she was the face of Perrier. She has also created four perfumes under the brand Dita Von Teese Perfumes. She also has her own brand of lingerie, as well as stockings under the name Secrets in Lace and luxurious cardigans for Australian online store Wheels &amp; Dollbaby.

==Early life==
Von Teese was born in West Branch, Michigan, the second of three daughters. When describing her hometown, she says, &quot;It&#x27;s a universe away from the colored Klieg lights of Hollywood and Paris. But on weekend afternoons, my mom and I had a front seat on a rocket ship to those faraway worlds by way of the old movies starring the most glamorous creatures – Betty Grable, Mae West, Carmen Miranda, Marlene Dietrich... They were our muses.&quot; Her father was a machinist and her mother a manicurist. She is of English, Scottish, Armenian, and German heritage. Von Teese has stated that one of her grandmothers was half-Armenian and adopted into an Anglo-Saxon American family. Von Teese is known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden Age-era Hollywood films, and from her, Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable.

She was classically trained as a ballet dancer from an early age, and danced solo at age 13 for a local ballet company. Though she originally wanted to be a ballerina, Von Teese states that &quot;by 15, I was as good as I&#x27;d ever be.&quot; She was later to incorporate this element into her burlesque shows, where she frequently goes &quot;en pointe&quot;. The family relocated from Michigan to Orange County, California, when her father&#x27;s job moved. Von Teese attended University High School in Irvine, California.

When Von Teese was a teenager, her mother took her to buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, and gave her a plastic egg containing a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.

At 18, Von Teese had her famous beauty mark tattooed on her left cheek. She originally intended to have a star tattooed but the tattoo parlor refused. In her first book, she states that she visited a strip club for the first time at age 19 and was soon hired alongside her job at a beauty counter. She was stunned by the other strippers&#x27; lack of originality and wanted to incorporate vintage and fetish style to her performance.

==Career==
Von Teese chose her stage name by adopting the name Dita as a tribute to silent film actress Dita Parlo. For her breakthrough December 2002 &quot;Playboy&quot; cover, she was required to have a surname, so she chose &quot;Von Treese&quot; from the phonebook. &quot;Playboy&quot; misspelled it &quot;Von Teese&quot;, a name which she then kept. Von Teese is known for her signature painted eyes, heavily penciled brows, swipe of crimson lipstick, and blue-black locks. She says, &quot;I have my signature look and I&#x27;m sticking to it, because it&#x27;s the look that is one hundred percent me, and one hundred percent created by me. I might be a one-trick for it. But it&#x27;s a pretty good trick!&quot;

===Fetish and glamour modeling===
Von Teese achieved some level of recognition in the fetish world as a tightlacer. Through the wearing of a corset for many years, she had reduced her waistline to , and can be laced down as far as .

Von Teese appeared on numerous fetish magazine covers, including &quot;Bizarre&quot; and &quot;Marquis&quot;. It was around this time when she appeared on the cover of Midori&#x27;s book, &quot;The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage&quot;. Von Teese was featured in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1999, 2001, and 2002, with a cover-featured pictorial in 2002. German metal band Atrocity chose her as the cover model for their 2008 album, &quot;Werk 80 II&quot;.

She has stated in print, &quot;I love fetish for its powers of transformation and also for its beauty.&quot; Among her heroes of vintage fetish history are John Willie, Bettie Page, and Irving Klaw.

===Burlesque===

Von Teese is best known for her burlesque routines and is frequently dubbed the &quot;Queen of Burlesque&quot; in the press. Von Teese began performing burlesque in 1992, and, as a proponent of Neo-Burlesque, has helped to popularize its revival. In her own words, she &quot;puts the tease back into striptease&quot; with long, elaborate dance shows with props and characters, often inspired by 1930s and 1940s musicals and films. Some of her more famous dances have involved a carousel horse, a giant powder compact, a filigree heart and a clawfoot bathtub with a working shower head. Her feather fan dance, inspired by burlesque dancer Sally Rand, featured the world&#x27;s largest feather fans, now on display in Hollywood&#x27;s Museum of Sex.

Von Teese&#x27;s signature acts feature:

* The Martini Glass
* The Opium Den
* Le Bain Noir (re-invented for the 2009 Crazy Horse show)
* Bird of Paradise
* Lazy (based on Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s performance in &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;)
* The Champagne Glass
* The Black Swan (based on the ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky)

Her burlesque career has included some memorable performances. She once appeared at a benefit for the New York Academy of Art wearing nothing but $5 million worth of diamonds. Additionally, Von Teese became the first guest star at the Crazy Horse cabaret club in Paris with her appearance in October 2006. In 2006, Von Teese appeared on an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; (cycle 7) doing a workshop to teach the contestants about sensuality by means of burlesque dancing and posing. In 2007, Von Teese performed at the adult entertainment event Erotica 07 in London alongside Italian rock band Belladonna.

Von Teese&#x27;s first book (in collaboration with Bronwyn Garrity), which consisted of her opinions on the history of burlesque and fetish, &quot;Burlesque and the Art of the Teese / Fetish and the Art of the Teese&quot;, was published in 2006 by HarperCollins (and in New York by Regan Books). &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called her a &quot;Burlesque Superheroine&quot;.

Von Teese participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia, as part of the stage performance for the German entry &quot;Miss Kiss Kiss Bang&quot;. The act placed 20th out of 25 participants in the final round of the contest. Later, she said her cleavage was censored during the show because it was too voluptuous.

Von Teese has toured the world with four full-length revues: &quot;Strip, Strip Hooray&quot;, &quot;The Art of the Teese&quot;, &quot;Dita Von Teese and the Copper Coupe&quot; and the 2019 &quot;Glamonatrix&quot; tour (postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic), which continued in Europe and the UK in 2022 and the US in 2023.

=== Television and acting ===

Von Teese has performed in adult and mainstream films. In her early years, she appeared in fetish-related, softcore pornographic movies, such as &quot;Romancing Sara&quot;, &quot;Matter of Trust&quot; (in which she is billed under her real name of Heather Sweet), and also in two Andrew Blake hard-core fetish films, &quot;Pin Ups 2&quot; and &quot;Decadence.&quot;

She has appeared in more mainstream features such as the 2005 short film, &quot;The Death of Salvador Dali&quot;, written by Delaney Bishop, which won best screenplay and best cinematography at SXSW, Raindance Film Festival, and Mill Valley Film Festival, and won Best Actress at Beverly Hills Film Festival. She starred in the feature film &quot;Saint Francis&quot; in 2007.

In addition, she has appeared in a number of music videos, including the video for the Green Day song &quot;Redundant,&quot; the video for &quot;Zip Gun Bop&quot; by swing band Royal Crown Revue, Agent Provocateur&#x27;s video for their cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot;, and (performing her martini-glass burlesque routine) the video for &quot;Mobscene&quot; by Marilyn Manson. She was featured in a striptease/burlesque act in George Michael&#x27;s live tour 2008, for the song &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good&quot;. In addition to this, she appeared at the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 as the central feature of Germany&#x27;s entry, Miss Kiss Kiss Bang by Alex Swings, Oscar Sings. She also appeared in the music video &quot;Up in the Air&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars in 2013.

She stated in 2007, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why women feel the need to go into acting as soon as they become famous ... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, then maybe I could consider it.&quot;

In January 2011, Von Teese guest starred in the CBS police procedural drama series &quot;&quot;, in which her friend Eric Szmanda starred, in the episode &quot;A Kiss Before Frying&quot;. She played Rita von Squeeze, a femme fatale version of herself, who seduces Szmanda&#x27;s character, Greg Sanders, in a plot inspired by film noir.

In 2021, Von Teese appeared on the British version of the Fox TV series &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;, masked as Beetroot. She was the third celebrity to be unmasked, on May 31. In September, Von Teese was a contestant in the eleventh season of &quot;Danse avec les stars&quot;, the French version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with professional dancer Christophe Licata. On November 12, 2021, they were eliminated finishing 5th out of 13.

In 2022, Von Teese appeared in the music video for Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Bejeweled&quot; from her tenth studio album &quot;Midnights&quot; (2022).

=== Fashion and modeling ===
Von Teese has appeared on a number of best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, &quot;Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has a lot of the same obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!&quot;

She has also done catwalk work. During Los Angeles Fashion Week for spring 2004, she modeled for former club kid Richie Rich&#x27;s fashion label, Heatherette. In 2005, she appeared in the Autumn/Winter Ready-to-Wear show for Giambattista Valli, a former designer for Ungaro, in Paris. In the 2006 Milan Fashion Week, Von Teese was on the runway, opening for the Moschino diffusion label, Moschino Cheap &amp; Chic, autumn/winter 2006/7 show. In 2007, she appeared twice in the Jean Paul Gaultier haute couture show during the Paris Fashion Week, and again in 2014. She has starred in several ad campaigns. She appeared in Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s spring/summer 2005 collection adverts and became the face of Australian clothing range Wheels &amp; Dollbaby for their 2006/7 Spring/Summer advertising campaign. She was an ambassador/spokesmodel for HIV/AIDS awareness when she was selected (along with Eve, Debbie Harry, and Lisa Marie Presley) for MAC Cosmetics&#x27; Viva Glam VI campaign (a collection of lipsticks and lipgloss where 100% of the proceeds are for worldwide AIDS charities and to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS). Von Teese has appeared in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, and international issues of nearly every fashion magazine.

Von Teese states that she never uses a stylist. &quot;The one time I hired a stylist, they picked up a pair of my 1940s shoes and said, &#x27;These would look really cute with jeans.&#x27; I immediately said, &#x27;You&#x27;re out of here.&#x27;&quot; She does her own make-up, and dyes her naturally blonde hair black at home. Von Teese&#x27;s unique style is &quot;inspired by eccentric women like Luisa Casati, Anna Piaggi, and Isabella Blow.&quot; She also says, &quot;Doing it myself is a matter of integrity and pride. I look forward to stepping out of the world and honestly stating &quot;Yes, I did this.&quot; I love the confidence it gives me. I would feel a fraud otherwise. Truth is, it takes less time [than a stylist] for me to do it myself. It is also so much more fun! Why would I deny myself such pure pleasure?&quot;

She has designed a new lingerie range with Wonderbra.
One of Von Teese&#x27;s trademark items is the garter belt with six garters instead of the usual four, with two each at the front, side seams and back. In May 2012, Von Teese launched her makeup collection &quot;Classics&quot; in partnership with the German cosmetic brand Art Deco. Compact powder, blushers, eye styler, eye shadows, mascara and lipstick were produced to recreate the burlesque performer&#x27;s retro look.

In 2012, Von Teese launched her own clothing line and underwear line called Von Follies. In 2013, she was both model and muse for the &#x27;Dita&#x27; 3D printed gown designed by Michael Schmidt and Francis Bitonti and 3D printed by Shapeways exactly to fit her body. Constructed of over 3,000 interlocked 3D printed components and over 12,000 Swarovski crystals it is one of the first fully articulated 3D printed garments to take the technology from haute couture to a sensual fabric-like form.

Von Teese has also worked creating her own fragrances. Her first was named &quot;Dita Von Teese&quot; (released Fall 2011) and is described by her as &#x27;mood setting for glamour&#x27;. Her second was named &quot;Rouge&quot; (released November 2012) and is described as &#x27;mood setting for seduction&#x27;. The third &quot;FleurTeese&quot; (released Spring 2013) is for romance and &quot;Erotique&quot; (released Fall 2013) is mood setting to be erotic. She says, &quot;I lusted after something that would appeal to those of us not reluctant to proclaim we are women. Too many best-selling scents are so fruity and vanilla with a sweetly cloying air that a mere spritz gives me a toothache. Or they smell like cake. I do not want to smell like cake!&quot;

In 2014, Von Teese began working with Myer, an Australian department store, on a lingerie line fronted by Australian model Stefania Ferrario.

On January 22, 2020, Von Teese walked in Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s final couture fashion show in Paris.

==Personal life==
Von Teese lives in Los Angeles, in a Tudor revival residence in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood. The house features early 20th-century décor, including antique taxidermy, a room dedicated to shoes, a pub house, and no white walls, something Von Teese claims she is afraid of. Among the shoes she has collected are Bettie Page&#x27;s vintage fetish shoes, which she has called the &quot;holy grail&quot; of shoes.

She is a collector of vintage china, particularly egg cups and tea sets, and drives vintage cars. Among other vintage cars, she owned a 1939 Chrysler New Yorker from 1997 to 2010. She says, &quot;I live to surround myself with everyday things that are beautiful. I serve my home-baked petit fours on porcelain pedestals and sip tea from flowery tea cups, charming gems from my flea market treasure hunts. I keep cosmetic brushes in vintage vase cast like the heads of ladies, complete with glamour dos and makeup. I always carry a pretty compact, maybe one scored for next to nothing on eBay.&quot;

After her marriage to Marilyn Manson ended in 2007, Von Teese dated French Count Louis-Marie de Castelbajac from 2009 to 2012. In 2012, she had a brief relationship with singer Theo Hutchcraft.

Von Teese has been in a relationship with graphic designer Adam Rajcevich since 2014.

Among Von Teese&#x27;s famous best friends are shoe designer Christian Louboutin, who designs shoes for her shows, burlesque performer and seamstress Catherine D&#x27;lish and writer Liz Goldwyn. Von Teese practices Pilates and dressage.

===Marriage to Marilyn Manson===
Marilyn Manson had been a longtime fan of hers and was a member of her website. They first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos, and though she was unable to, the two remained in contact. On Manson&#x27;s 32nd birthday, in 2001, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe and they became a couple. Manson proposed on March 22, 2004, and gave her a 1930s, , European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, they were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3 at Castle Gurteen de la Poer in Kilsheelan (County Tipperary), Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky. The event was featured in &quot;Vogue&quot;. Dita wore a royal purple silk taffeta gown, made by Vivienne Westwood and a tri-cornered hat designed by Stephen Jones and matching Mr. Pearl corset. Christian Louboutin designed her shoes.

On December 29, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce from Manson citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Von Teese left their house empty-handed on Christmas Eve, and was not able to get in touch with Manson to inform him of her intention to divorce him. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Von Teese stated, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him, I wasn&#x27;t going to be part of that.&quot; Von Teese also stated that she gave Manson an ultimatum, and said that &quot;it didn&#x27;t work. Instead, it made me the enemy.&quot; Von Teese did not seek spousal support and expressed no interest in his assets. The news broke for the public and for Manson on his birthday on January 5, 2007, when he was served the divorce papers.

In an interview in 2016, Von Teese said &quot;I was with him for seven years, we were married for only a year and I feel like getting married was sort of like the &#x27;kiss of death&#x27; for us because it was sort of like the nail in the coffin. I felt kind of obliged to go through with the ceremony in a way because there was so much riding on it. &quot;Vogue&quot; was photographing it and it was in this castle and it was like this theater...I&#x27;m not going to beat myself up for being in different relationships and not finding a person I&#x27;m with until the end of my days.&quot;

<text>Lingotto is a building complex on Via Nizza in Turin, Italy. It once housed a car factory built by Italian automotive company Fiat and today houses the administrative headquarters of the manufacturer and a multipurpose centre projected by architect Renzo Piano. 

== History ==
Construction of the complex started in 1916 and it was inaugurated in 1923. The design by the young architect Giacomo Matté-Trucco, was unusual in that it had five floors, with raw materials going in at the ground floor, and cars built on a line that went up through the building. Finished cars emerged at rooftop level to go onto the 1.5km long test track. The construction was carried out by the company of G A Porcheddu. It was the largest car factory in the world at that time. For its time, the Lingotto building was avant-garde, influential and impressive—Le Corbusier called it &quot;one of the most impressive sights in industry&quot;, and &quot;a guideline for town planning&quot;. 80 different models of car were produced there in its lifetime, including the Fiat Topolino of 1936.

By the late 1970s, the factory had become obsolete — having been superseded by the larger and more advanced Fiat Mirafiori factory — and a decision was made to finally close it in 1982. The closure of the plant led to much public debate about its future, and how to recover from industrial decline in general. An architectural competition was held, which was eventually awarded to Renzo Piano, who envisioned an exciting public space for the city. The old factory was restored into a modern complex, with concert halls, theatre, a convention centre, shopping arcades and a hotel. The eastern portion of the building is the headquarters of the Automotive Engineering faculty of the Polytechnic University of Turin. The work was completed in 1989. The track was retained, and can still be visited today on the top floor of the shopping mall and hotel.

Similar rooftop tests tracks exist, including; at Impéria in Nessonvaux in Belgium, and Palacio Chrysler in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From 1928 to 1958, Impéria had a track over 1 km long which was built partially on top of the factory.

==In popular culture==
The Lingotto building is featured extensively in the Alberto Lattuada film &quot;Mafioso&quot; (1962).

The original Lingotto rooftop test track features briefly in the getaway sequence in the film &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969).

The building is also featured in the fourth episode of the 20th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, originally aired in the United States on March 11, 2012.

The building and test track was featured on the first episode of James May&#x27;s &quot;Cars of the People&quot;.

<doc id="296018" wikidata="Q294092" url="?curid=296018" title="Critias">
<text>Critias (; , &quot;Kritias&quot;; – 403 BC) was an ancient Athenian poet, philosopher and political leader. He is known today for being a student of Socrates, a writer of some regard, and for becoming the leader of the Thirty Tyrants, who ruled Athens for several months after the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War in 404/403.

==Ancestry==
Critias was the scion of one of the premier families in Athens. The evidence for his lineage comes from several sources and there are numerous gaps in what they have to say. The reconstruction in Davies&#x27; &quot;Athenian Propertied Families&quot; is the most reliable and his discussion covers all the unknowns and suppositions. Without detailing the uncertainties here, as best we know, his ancestors were:

The progenitor of the family was Dropides, who lived in the 7th century BCE. He had two sons: Critias I and Dropides II. The latter was a &quot;relative and a dear friend&quot; of Solon, the lawgiver of Athens. Both men were in their prime at the beginning of the 6th century BCE and Dropides served as &quot;archon eponymous&quot; shortly after Solon held that position in 594/3.  Solon died in the late 560s; presumably Dropides did as well.

Dropides II was the father of Critias II, who lived into the late 6th century. The son of Critias II was Leaides, who is known only from an ostracon dating to the 480s, which named &quot;Critias [III] son of Leaides&quot; as the miscreant deserving of exile. It was discovered in a well near a road southwest of the Athenian &quot;agora&quot; in 1936. Critias III in turn had Callaeschus, the father of Critias IV, the tyrant.

The family clearly had a long and illustrious (if at times contentious) history in Athenian politics. In addition to the Solon connection, they were related to Plato&#x27;s family, equally well established among the Athenian elite, and also to the family of the orator Andocides.

==Early life==
Little is known of Critias&#x27; early years. Athenaeus reported that he was a trained aulos player.  He was best attested as a poet, with a variety of forms to his credit: hexameters, elegies, and dramas. Among the plays tentatively assigned to him are &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Rhadamanthys&quot;, &quot;Pirithus&quot;, and the satyr play &quot;Sisyphus&quot;. All of these, however, have been contested by both ancient and modern scholars, with Euripides proposed as the most likely alternate author. (The &quot;Sisyphus fragment&quot; presumably comes from the satyr play – again, attributed to either Critias or Euripides.)

Critias also wrote prose. Among his most important works were a series of &quot;Commonwealths&quot; or treatises on the governments of various city-states. Athens, Lacedaemonia (Sparta), and Thessaly are specific mentions made in ancient sources. Other works include &quot;Aphorisms&quot;, &quot;Lectures&quot;, &quot;On the Nature of Desires or of Virtues&quot;, and &quot;Proems&quot;(Prologues) &quot;for Public Speaking&quot;.

He believed religion could play an important role in achieving obedience to the state. According to pseudo-Plutarch, he was among those who criticized the logographer Antiphon, though there is little evidence that he (or Antiphon) participated in Athenian politics during the years that the latter was active (430s and 420s). What little there is was provided by Cicero, who names him as an orator, along with Lysias and Theramenes.Hard upon them (the orators Pericles, Alcibiades, and Thucydides [not the historian]) came Critias, Theramenes, and Lysias. Much was written down by Lysias, some things by Critias; we hear of Theramenes.In terms of style, he was described as &quot;lofty of sentiment, also pride&quot;, &quot;stately, much like Antiphon, and sublime, verging on majesty, and says much in the negative, yet is rather pure in style&quot;.

In general he appears to have stayed in the background, or perhaps on the periphery of Athenian politics – dabbling rather than plunging headlong. All this began to change in 415.

===Student of Socrates===
The philosopher Socrates was well known for attracting the young men of Athens&#x27; elite. He questioned democracy, conventional morality and challenged the certainty with which many intellectuals propounded their thoughts endeared him to the rebellious adolescent minds of the younger generation. Critias was among those who gravitated to him, and the two formed a friendship that was to last many years, though eventually they drifted apart. Plato, who cast Socrates as the protagonist of most of his dialogues, included Critias as an interlocutor in two of them. Though these were written many years after both Socrates and Critias were dead, Plato made no mention in them of the activities that tarnished Critias’ reputation in his later years.

===Mutilation of the Herms===
In the spring of 415, the Athenians decided to send an armada to Sicily to counter a perceived threat from the city of Syracuse. Just before it was to sail, one of the social clubs in Athens staged a city-wide raid where they mutilated statues of the god Hermes that stood outside homes and in various locations around Athens. The citizens were outraged and saw this event as a bad omen. Even though the fleet sailed on schedule, the search for the perpetrators went on relentlessly afterwards. Among those arrested was Critias. While many of the accused were summarily executed or left town to escape prosecution, Critias was eventually exonerated when the testimony of his accuser was discredited by Andocides and then withdrawn. As a member of Athens’ elite and in view of his later actions, it is not clear whether he was involved or not, but he was freed nonetheless.

==The Four Hundred==
The failure of the Sicilian expedition in 413, in which tens of thousands of Athenian soldiers were killed or captured, rocked the city&#x27;s political and social stability. In 411, as Athenian prosecution of the Peloponnesian War limped along, a junta of oligarchic sympathizers contrived to take over the government and end the war. They succeeded in convincing the Athenian Assembly that governmental change was necessary and instituted in place of it the council of the Four Hundred. The coup was put down a few months later and democracy gradually restored.

Critias has been suspected by some modern scholars as being a member of the Four Hundred, but there is little evidence of this. Arguing against that possibility is that in the days following their deposition he was recorded as proposing two decrees before the reconstituted Assembly: one to hold a post-mortem trial of one of the perpetrators of the coup, one Phrynichus, the other to repatriate his friend Alcibiades, who had been exiled at the start of the Sicilian expedition for mocking the Eleusinian Mysteries, the most sacred religious cult at Athens. The playboy-general was at that time assisting the Athenian fleet at Samos and attempting to ingratiate himself with those who had banished him a few years earlier. These two actions, while not clearly exonerating Critias, show that he was politically adept enough to shed the stigma of participating in the takeover, if he indeed had.

Alcibiades&#x27; rapprochement with his fellow citizens was not to last. In 407, while commanding a fleet in the eastern Aegean, he temporarily handed over some of his ships to a subordinate, who proceeded to instigate and then lose an encounter with the Spartan fleet in the area. Alcibiades was held responsible and banished once again. As his advocate, Critias was subsequently banished as well, and he spent the next few years in Thessaly.

While there, he was reported by Xenophon to be &quot;setting up a democracy in Thessaly and was arming the serfs against their overlords&quot;. Also, he &quot;consorted with men subject to lawlessness rather than to a sense of justice&quot;. Countering this, Philostratus said, &quot;he rendered their oligarchies the more grievous by conversing with those in power there and by attacking all democracy. He slandered the Athenians, claiming that they, of all mankind, erred the most&quot;.

==Tyranny of the Thirty==
After the battle of Aigospotami in 405, in which the Athenian fleet was destroyed, the city was besieged by the Spartans and eventually capitulated. The Spartans demanded that the city take down its walls, recall its exiles (oligarchic sympathizers all), and restore the ancient government – i.e., dismantle its democracy. At their &quot;suggestion&quot;, a ruling body of thirty governors was selected, mimicking Sparta&#x27;s own ruling board of thirty, the &quot;gerousia&quot;. Critias had returned from Thessaly as part of the recall of the exiles and now became one of the leaders of the &quot;Thirty&quot;. One source said that they also appointed five men to supervise this group, called &quot;ephors&quot; after the similar body at Sparta. Critias was one of the five. A third body was designated: the Three Thousand – those of the cavalry (hippeis) and infantry (hoplite) classes, who were allowed to keep their armor and weapons after the rest of the citizens had been forcibly disarmed. This body would constitute the &quot;citizenry&quot; of the new Athens. Socrates and Xenophon (our source for much of this history) were among this group.

During the next few months, as the Thirty consolidated their hold on the institutions of government, they arrested, confiscated the property of, and summarily executed a wider and wider swath of Athenian citizens and resident aliens (metics). At every step, Critias was the leading advocate for more extreme levels of violence, to the point where he was getting resistance even from within the Thirty. The leading &quot;moderate&quot; was Theramenes, and his continued cautioning against the continuing destruction ultimately got him arrested and executed at Critias&#x27; direction.

Critias&#x27; relationship with Socrates withered during these months. At one point, the Thirty compelled the Three Thousand to begin arresting metics so they could be stripped of their property and executed – this so the citizens would become complicit in the slaughter. With blood on their hands, they would be less likely to attempt an overthrow of the oligarchy. When Socrates was ordered to go with three others to arrest one Leon of Salamis, he ignored the order and simply &quot;went home&quot;. He was later recorded as offering this not-so-oblique criticism of Critias:

It seems enough to me that a herdsman who lets his cattle decrease and go to the bad should not admit that he is a poor cowherd; but stranger still that a statesman, when he causes the citizens to decrease and go to the bad, should feel no shame nor think himself a poor statesman.

At another point, his critique became more personal. Xenophon related that Socrates took his old friend to task for being overly enamored with a young man.

Critias seems to have the feelings of a pig: he can no more keep away from Euthydemus than pigs can help rubbing themselves against stones.

Socrates&#x27; reputation and general popularity protected him from the punishment meted out to Theramenes. Nonetheless:

Now Critias bore a grudge against Socrates for this; and when he was … drafting laws with Charicles, he bore it in mind. He inserted a clause which made it illegal &quot;to teach the art of words.&quot; It was a calculated insult to Socrates, whom he saw no means of attacking except by imputing to him the practice constantly attributed to philosophers, and so making him unpopular.

When Critias and Charicles confronted Socrates with the new law, the latter did what he had done so many times before and began to probe its actual meaning. Who could he talk to, or not talk to, and about what? After several minutes of this, Socrates summarized:

&quot;Then must I keep off the subjects of which these supply illustrations: Justice, Holiness, and so forth?&quot;

&quot;Indeed yes,&quot; said Charicles, &quot;and cowherds too: else you may find the cattle decrease.&quot;

Many Athenians had left the city when the attacks of the Thirty began. In the spring of 403, they returned under the leadership of Thrasyboulus and eventually commandeered the fortress called Munichia in Peiraieus, Athens&#x27; port city. When the Thirty brought their forces to Piraeus to root them out, the two armies fought in the streets. During this confrontation Critias was killed, which left the oligarchs without their strongest leader. This spelled doom for their reign, and they were soon deposed and democracy reestablished.

==Legacy==
Critias was in ancient times castigated for his activities under the Thirty. Philostratus, in his &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;, had much to say about him. His most damning comments were:

In cruelty and in bloodthirstiness he outdid the Thirty. He also collaborated with the Spartans in absurd resolution in order that Attica, emptied of its flock of men, might become a grazing-ground for sheep. Hence it seems to me that he is the worst of all the men who have gained a reputation for wickedness…

It appears to some that he became a good man toward the end of his life, inasmuch as he employed tyranny as his winding-sheet [burial shroud]. But let it be declared on my part that none among men died well in behalf of a poor choice. And it seems to me that for this reason the man&#x27;s wisdom and his thoughts were taken less seriously by the Greeks. Unless speech corresponds to character, we shall appear to be discoursing in an alien language, as though we were playing flutes.

Xenophon lumped Critias in with his friend Alcibiades in his criticism:

Critias and Alcibiades became disciples of Socrates and did the city much harm. For, in the oligarchy, Critias turned into the most thievish and violent and murderous of all, while Alcibiades, in the democracy, was of all men the most uncontrolled and wanton and violent. If the two of them did the city harm, I shall not offer a defense.

Plato, on the other hand, said nothing disparaging about Critias directly – either about his exile in Thessaly or his time in the Thirty. Yet, the philosopher was loath to join the oligarchy because of its violent means. In his seventh letter, he said:

In the days of my youth my experience was the same as that of many others. I thought that as soon as I should become my own master I would immediately enter into public life. But it so happened, I found, that the following changes occurred in the political situation. In the government then existing, reviled as it was by many, a revolution took place; and the revolution was headed by fifty-one leaders, of whom eleven were in the City and ten in the Piraeus (each of these sections dealing with the market and with all municipal matters requiring management) and Thirty were established as irresponsible rulers of all. &quot;Now of these some were actually connections and acquaintances of mine; and indeed they invited me at once to join their administration, thinking it would be congenial&quot;. The feelings I then experienced, owing to my youth, were in no way surprising: for I imagined that they would administer the State by leading it out of an unjust way of life into a just way, and consequently I gave my mind to them very diligently, to see what they would do. And indeed I saw how these men within a short time caused men to look back on the former government as a golden age; and above all how they treated my aged friend Socrates, whom I would hardly scruple to call the most just of men then living, when they tried to send him, along with others, after one of the citizens, to fetch him by force that he might be put to death—their object being that Socrates, whether he wished or no, might be made to share in their political actions; he, however, refused to obey and risked the uttermost penalties rather than be a partaker in their unholy deeds. So when I beheld all these actions and others of a similar grave kind, I was indignant, and I withdrew myself from the evil practices then going on.

For all the condemnation he received from his contemporaries, Critias was soon forgotten by most people. By the late 4th century, Aristotle could write:

The many do not demand a statement of the case if you wish to extol Achilles, for all know his deeds; yet it is necessary to make use of them. Also, if you wish to extol Critias, it is necessary. For not many know his deeds.

As for Critias&#x27; efforts as a poet and essayist, his works survived for several centuries, as the above citations attest, but his repute as a writer eventually faded. Philostratus, writing in the 3rd century CE, said of Critias:

He wrote tragedies, elegies, and prose works, of which not enough has survived for any sure estimate to be made of his talent. He was greatly admired by the later sophists, especially by Herodes Atticus.

Herodes Atticus, a 2nd-century CE Roman senator and rhetorician, attempted a revival of Critias’ works in the 2nd century CE. Among his extensive comments on Herodes, Philostratus inserted this:

For while he devoted himself to the study of all the older writers, from Critias he was inseparable, and he made the Greeks better acquainted with him, since he had hitherto been neglected and overlooked.

Our judgment today would not be much different than that of Philostratus, since Critias&#x27; extant works have diminished still further. What fragments survive were collected by the German historian Herman Diels and first published in his &quot;Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker&quot; in 1903 – in Greek. This seminal work was later revised several times, most recently by Walter Kranz in 1959.

<doc id="296020" wikidata="Q57445" url="?curid=296020" title="Günter Schabowski">
<text>Günter Schabowski (; 4 January 1929 – 1 November 2015) was a German politician who served as an official of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot; abbreviated &quot;SED&quot;), the ruling party during most of the existence of East Germany. After climbing up the party ladder, he became the regime&#x27;s unofficial spokesman. He gained worldwide fame in November 1989 when he improvised a slightly mistaken answer to a press conference question about the future of the Berlin Wall, that seemed to announce the Wall&#x27;s immediate end and raised popular expectations much more rapidly than the government planned. Massive crowds gathered at the Wall the same night, which forced its opening after 28 years. Soon afterward, the entire inner German border was opened; not much later, East Germany ceased to exist.

==Early career==

Schabowski was born in Anklam, Pomerania (then in the Free State of Prussia, now part of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). After completing his &quot;Abitur&quot;, Schabowski joined the Free German Trade Union Federation &quot;Zentralorgan&quot; newspaper, &quot;Tribüne&quot; as an editor in 1947. He studied journalism at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig&#x27;s &quot;Red Monastery&quot;, the only institution in the GDR offering training to become a journalist, after which he became deputy editor-in-chief of &quot;Tribüne&quot;. In 1952, he became a member of the SED, having been a candidate member and member of the Free German Youth since 1950.

==SED career==
From 1967 to 1968, he attended the party academy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, he began a career in the newspaper (&quot;New Germany&quot;), which as the official organ of the SED was considered to be the leading newspaper in the GDR. He first was a deputy editor-in-chief before becoming First Deputy in 1974. In 1978, he rose to the position of editor-in-chief when Joachim Herrmann became a full member of the Politburo and Central Committee Secretary for Agitation, replacing the deceased Werner Lamberz.

In 1981, he became a member of the Volkskammer, the SED Central Committee and candidate member of its Politburo.

In November 1985, he rose to become the First Secretary of the East Berlin chapter of the SED and a full member of the SED Politburo, replacing Konrad Naumann, who had been deposed.

Before the Peaceful Revolution, Schabowski was not known as a reformer. In 2009, writer Christa Wolf called Schabowski &quot;one of the worst&quot; East German politicians before the &quot;Wende&quot;, saying: &quot;I remember a few appearances of him in front of the writer&#x27;s guild. You were scared of him.&quot;

== Opening of Berlin Wall ==

In October 1989, Schabowski, along with several other members of the Politbüro, turned on the longtime SED leader Erich Honecker and forced him to step down in favor of Egon Krenz. As part of the effort to change the regime&#x27;s image, Schabowski was named the regime&#x27;s unofficial spokesman and he held several daily press conferences to announce changes. He had already been in charge of media affairs for the Politbüro. He was also reportedly named the second man in the SED, Krenz&#x27;s old role. Schabowski had spent most of his career in communist-style journalism in which reporters were told what to write after events had already happened. Thus, he found it somewhat difficult to get used to Western-style media practice.

On 9 November 1989, shortly before that day&#x27;s press conference, Krenz handed Schabowski a text containing new, temporary travel regulations. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and it allowed for permanent emigration across all border crossings, including those between East and West Berlin. The text was supposed to be embargoed until the next morning.

Schabowski had not been on hand when Krenz read the text earlier in the day to several Politbüro members during a cigarette break at that day&#x27;s Central Committee plenum or when it was discussed before the full committee. However, he felt comfortable discussing it at the press conference; he said later that all one needed to do to conduct a press conference was to be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes. Accordingly, he read the note aloud at the end of the press conference. One of the reporters asked when the regulations would come into effect. Schabowski assumed that it would be the same day based on the wording of the note, and he replied after a few seconds&#x27; pause: &quot;As far as I know... effective immediately, without delay.&quot; () Accounts differ on who asked that question. Both Riccardo Ehrman, the Berlin correspondent of the ANSA news agency, and the German &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot; (a tabloid) reporter Peter Brinkmann were sitting in the front row at the press conference and claimed to have asked when the regulations would come into force.

Later, when asked whether the new regulations also applied to travel between East and West Berlin, Schabowski looked at the text again and discovered that they did. When Daniel Johnson of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; asked what that meant for the Berlin Wall, Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.

After the press conference, Schabowski sat down for a live interview with NBC&#x27;s Tom Brokaw. When Brokaw asked him if it was indeed true that East Germans could now travel without having to go through a third country, Schabowski replied in broken English that East Germans were &quot;not further forced to leave GDR by transit through another country,&quot; and could now &quot;go through the border.&quot; When Brokaw asked if this meant &quot;freedom of travel,&quot; Schabowski replied, &quot;Yes of course,&quot; and added that it was not &quot;a question of tourism&quot; but &quot;a permission of leaving GDR.&quot;

The West German public national television channels showed parts of Schabowski&#x27;s press conference in their main evening news reports at 19:17 on ZDF&#x27;s &quot;heute&quot; and at 20:00 on ARD&#x27;s &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, which meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany as well, where West German television was widely watched. The news then spread like wildfire, with news reports continuing to repeat the news throughout the night.

As the night progressed, thousands of East Berliners began proceeding to the six border crossings along the Berlin Wall and demanded to be let through. Live television reported on the gathering people which only increased the numbers of East Berliners coming to the gates. The crowds vastly outnumbered the border guards, who tried initially to stall for time. However, no one was willing to order deadly force. Finally, at 23:30, Stasi Officer Harald Jäger decided to open the gates at the Bornholmer Straße border crossing and to allow people into West Berlin.

The fall of the Berlin Wall was the key event leading to the end of the East German regime, a state that had been crumbling for many weeks as citizens had been fleeing through intermediate countries surrounding East Germany. Indeed, Victor Sebestyen later wrote that when the gates were opened, for all intents and purposes, East Germany &quot;ceased to exist&quot;. He also wrote that many of Schabowski&#x27;s colleagues suspected he was either an American or West German agent and could not believe that he had made &quot;a simple cock-up&quot;. In 2014, his wife claimed that Schabowski had been well aware of the possible consequences of what he said in the press conference.

In the following purges of the &quot;party&#x27;s old guard&quot;, Schabowski was quickly expelled from the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the SED, in an attempt to improve the party&#x27;s image.

==Political life after reunification==

After German Reunification, Schabowski became highly critical of his own actions in East Germany and those of his fellow Politbüro members as well as of Soviet-style socialism in general. He worked again as a journalist and between 1992 and 1999, as editor for &quot;Heimat-Nachrichten&quot;, a weekly local paper that he co-founded with a West German journalist in Rotenburg an der Fulda.

His support for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) prompted some of his former comrades to call him a wryneck (German: &quot;Wendehals&quot;). The word refers to a bird that can turn its head almost 180 degrees; it became a popular term used to mock communists who had turned capitalist.

Together with other leading figures of the GDR regime, he was charged with the murders of East Germans attempting to flee the GDR. In January 1995, Berlin prosecutors pressed charges against him. In August 1997, Schabowski was convicted along with Egon Krenz and Günther Kleiber. Because he accepted his moral guilt and denounced the GDR, he was sentenced to only three years in prison. In December 1999, he began serving his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison in Spandau. However, in September 2000, he was pardoned by Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and released in December 2000 after he had served only a year. He was critical of the PDS/Left Party, the successor to the Socialist Unity Party. In 2001, he collaborated with Bärbel Bohley as advisor to Frank Steffel (CDU).

==Death==
According to his wife, Schabowski lived in a Berlin nursing home during the last years of his life, after a number of heart attacks and strokes. He died in Berlin, after a long illness, on the morning of 1 November 2015, aged 86.

<text>The Thirty Tyrants (, &quot;hoi triákonta týrannoi&quot;) were an oligarchy that briefly ruled Athens from 404 BC to 403 BC. Installed into power by the Spartans after the Athenian surrender in the Peloponnesian War, the Thirty became known for their tyrannical rule, first being called &quot;The Thirty Tyrants&quot; by Polycrates. Although they maintained power for only eight months, their reign resulted in the killing of 5% of the Athenian population, the confiscation of citizens&#x27; property, and the exile of other democratic supporters.

== Background ==
After the Athenian navy was destroyed at the battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, Lysander led the Spartan and Peloponnesian League naval force to Athens for the final destruction of the city. The Athenians prepared for a siege, but without a navy to defend them or import food, many Athenian citizens starved. After the Spartans began cutting them off by occupying Decelea, the Athenians decided to surrender in March 404 BC. After initial negotiations of surrender failed, Athenian general Theramenes asked the Ecclesia for permission to speak with Lysander, believing that he could get the best possible conditions from the Spartans. His request was granted, and he met with Lysander at Samos, who then sent him to Sparta. Before the Spartan assembly and representatives of the Peloponnesian League, Theramenes negotiated a final surrender of Athens, ending the Peloponnesian War.

While some members of the Peloponnesian League called for Athens to be completely destroyed, the Spartans refused to do so, arguing that Athens was one of the great cities of Greece. The terms agreed on called for Athens to destroy the long walls of Piraeus, allow exiles back into the city, and reduce their navy to only twelve vessels, surrendering all remaining ones to the Spartans. The Athenians were also to recraft their government on one dictated by the Spartans and to submit to Sparta in both &quot;peace and war,” recalling their ambassadors from other city states.

=== Formation of the Thirty ===
To reform their laws as the Spartans instructed, Athens appointed five ephors to organize all voting through the phylarchoi, the tribal council representing the eleven tribes of Athens. The Ecclesia split into different factions on what the new government should be, with some favoring an oligarchic model while Theramenes became the de facto leader of those who wanted a democratic system. The debate led to deadlock and the Spartans intervened and demanded that the Athenians appoint thirty men to oversee the drafting of new laws and a new constitution. It was determined that Theramenes would choose ten, the five Ephors would choose ten, and the Ecclesia would choose the final ten. The final thirty selected men were tasked with drawing up the laws under which they would govern.

== Members of the Thirty ==
The names of the Thirty are listed by Xenophon:

* Aeschines of Athens, of the Kekropis tribe (not the famous orator)
* Anaetius
* Aresias
* Aristoteles (also a member of the Four Hundred and mentioned in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot;; not the philosopher, born twenty years later)
* Chaereleos
* Charicles, son of Apollodorus
* Chremo
* Cleomedes, son of Lycomedes
* Critias
* Diocles
* Dracontides
* Erasistratus of Acharnae
* Eratosthenes (not the well-known scholar)
* Eucleides
* Eumathes
* Hiero
* Hippolochus
* Hippomachus
* Melobius
* Mnesilochus
* Mnesitheides
* Onomacles
* Peison
* Phaedrias
* Pheido
* Polychares
* Sophocles (an Athenian orator, not the playwright)
* Theogenes
* Theognis
* Theramenes, son of Hagnon, of the tribe Pandionis, in the deme of Steiria
==The rule of the Thirty==
With Spartan support, the Thirty established an interim government in Athens. They reestablished the Boule, a council composed of 500 members. They appointed other officials, including 10 men who would rule the port town of Piraeus on behalf of the Thirty, and hired 300 mastigophoroi, whip bearers who would act as a police force. The Thirty oversaw trials in the Boule against Athenian leaders who had opposed the peace with Sparta and sentenced them to death. They then tried and executed a number of &quot;undesirables&quot; within Athens. Around this time, Thirty members Aeschines and Aristoteles travelled to Sparta and met with Lysander, requesting that a Spartan garrison be stationed in Athens. Lysander dispatched a garrison to the city, with the Thirty stating that it was a temporary measure until they finished their trials against criminals, but members of the Thirty started using Spartan soldiers as personal bodyguards in the city.

Instead of drafting a new constitution, the Thirty ruled Athens themselves, similar to the Spartan Gerousia. They limited citizenship and the right &quot;to share in the government&quot; to only 3,000 selected Athenians. These hand-selected individuals had the right to carry weapons, to have a jury trial, and to reside within city limits. The list of the selected 3,000 was constantly revised. Although little is known about these 3,000 men, for a complete record was never documented ‒ it is hypothesised that the Thirty appointed these select few as the only men the Thirty could find who were devotedly loyal to their regime.

Led by Critias, the Thirty Tyrants presided over a reign of terror in which they executed, murdered, and exiled hundreds of Athenians, seizing their possessions afterward. Both Isocrates and Aristotle (the latter in the &quot;Athenian Constitution&quot;) have reported that the Thirty executed 1,500 people without trial. Critias, a former pupil of Socrates, has been described as &quot;the first Robespierre&quot; because of his cruelty and inhumanity; he evidently aimed to end democracy, regardless of the human cost. The Thirty removed criminals as well as many ordinary citizens whom they considered &quot;unfriendly&quot; to the new regime for expressing support for democracy. One of their targets was one of their own, Theramenes, whom Xenophon depicts as revolted by Critias&#x27; excessive violence and injustice and trying to oppose him. Critias accused Theramenes of conspiracy and treason and then forced him to drink hemlock. Many wealthy citizens were executed simply so the oligarchs could confiscate their assets, which were then distributed among the Thirty and their supporters. They also hired 300 &quot;lash-bearers,” or whip-bearing men to intimidate Athenian citizens.

The Thirty&#x27;s regime did not meet with much overt opposition, although many Athenians disliked the new form of government. Those who did not approve of the new laws could either fight, risking exile or execution, or accept the Thirty&#x27;s rule. Some supporters of democracy chose to fight and were exiled, among them Thrasybulus, a trierarch in the Athenian navy and noted supporter of democratic government. The uprising that overthrew the Thirty in 403 BCE was orchestrated by a group of exiles led by Thrasybulus. Critias was killed in the fighting at the doors of Athens.

==Aftermath==
The Thirty Tyrants&#x27; brief reign was characterized by violence and corruption. Historian Sian Lewis argues that the violence and brutality the Thirty carried out in Athens was necessary to transition Athens from a democracy to an oligarchy. However, the more violent the Thirty&#x27;s regime became, the more opposition they faced.

The increased level of opposition ultimately led to the overthrow of the Thirty&#x27;s regime by Thrasybulus&#x27; rebel forces. After the revolution, Athens needed to decide the best way to govern the liberated city-state and to reconcile the atrocities committed by the Thirty. It was decided to give amnesty to all of the members of the selected 3,000, except for the Thirty themselves, the Eleven (a group of prison magistrates appointed by lot who reported directly to the Thirty), and the ten who ruled in Piraeus. After the revolution that overthrew the Thirty Tyrants, Athens and its citizens struggled to reconcile and rebuild.

==Mention of the Thirty==
Plato, in the opening portion of his &quot;Seventh Letter&quot; (the authenticity of which is questioned by several modern scholars), recounts the rule of the Thirty Tyrants during his youth. He explains that following the revolution, fifty-one men became rulers of a new government, with a specific group of thirty in charge of the public affairs of Athens. Ten of the fifty-one were to rule the city, and eleven were sent to rule Piraeus. Plato corroborates the general consensus found in other sources: the rule of the Thirty was &quot;reviled as it was by many.&quot; The rule of the Thirty made the former democracy resemble a golden age in comparison. Plato also includes an account of the interaction between Socrates and the Thirty.

In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato mentions Lysias, one of the men from Athens who escaped the Thirty&#x27;s reign of terror. Lysias&#x27; brother Polemarchus &quot;fell victim to the Thirty Tyrants.&quot;

In &quot;On the Tranquility of the Mind&quot;, Seneca discusses the Athenians and the Thirty Tyrants in regards to the role of Socrates.

==Socrates and the Thirty==
Due to their desire to remain in complete control over Athens, the Thirty sought to exile or kill anyone who outwardly opposed their regime. Socrates remained in the city through this period, which caused the public to associate him with the Thirty and may have contributed to his eventual death sentence, especially since Critias had been his student.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates recounts an incident in which the Thirty once ordered him (and four other men) to bring before them Leon of Salamis, a man known for his justice and upright character, for execution. While the other four men obeyed, Socrates refused, not wanting to partake in the guilt of the executioners. However, he did not attempt to warn or save Leon of Salamis. By disobeying, Socrates may have been placing his own life in jeopardy, and he claimed it was only the disbanding of the oligarchy soon afterward that saved his life.

When the oligarchy came into power, the Thirty Commissioners, in their turn, summoned me and four others to the Round Chamber and instructed us to go and fetch Leon of Salamis from his home for execution. This was, of course, only one of many instances in which they issued such instructions, their object being to implicate as many people as possible in their crimes. On this occasion, however, I again made it clear, not by my words but by my actions, that the attention I paid to death was zero (if that is not too unrefined a claim); but that I gave all my attention to avoiding doing anything unjust or unholy. As powerful as it was, the government did not terrify me into doing a wrong action. When we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to Salamis and arrested Leon, but I simply went home.

Later on, in his &quot;Seventh Letter&quot;, Plato describes the interaction between the Thirty and Socrates from his own point of view:

They tried to send a friend of mine, the aged Socrates, whom I should scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day, with some other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution, in order that, whether he wished it, or not, he might share the guilt of their conduct; but he would not obey them, risking all consequences in preference to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deeds.

The Italian historian Luciano Canfora has inferred that another of Socrates&#x27; students, Xenophon, might have played an important part in the rule of the Thirty, as one of the two commanders of the cavalry, which were the Thirty&#x27;s militia. Indeed, in his book &quot;Hipparchos&quot; (Commander of the cavalry), Xenophon mentions just one of the commanders (there were always two), only to revile him, while never mentioning the other.

In his &quot;Memorabilia&quot; (Bk 1, Ch 2), Xenophon reports a contentious confrontation between Socrates and the Thirty, Critias included. Socrates is summoned before the group and ordered not to instruct or speak to anyone, whereupon Socrates mocks the order by asking sarcastically whether he will be allowed to ask to buy food in the marketplace. Xenophon uses the episode to illustrate both Socrates&#x27; own critique of the slaughtering of Athenian citizens by the Thirty, as well as make the case that the relationship between Critias and Socrates had significantly deteriorated by the time Critias obtained power.

<text>Carmen Sandiego is a series of American educational mystery video games that spawned an edutainment franchise of the same name. The game released in 1985, &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, started off both the video game series and the franchise as a whole, which has continued up to the present day. Each game of the series has a particular theme and subject, where the player must use their knowledge to find Carmen Sandiego or any of her innumerable henchmen. This series was originally owned by Broderbund, but is now owned by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Since its initial release the series has won over 125 awards and accolades.

==Design==
===Background===

In 1983, the founders of Broderbund Software, Gary and Doug Carlston, publicly discussed a plan to make edutainment one of their company&#x27;s three focus areas. The character of Carmen Sandiego was developed by David Siefkin, who drafted the first script of the game for Broderbund beside the Strawberry Canyon swimming pool of the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. Siefkin combined the character&#x27;s first and last names from the Brazilian singer and actress Carmen Miranda and the city of San Diego, California. Carmen Sandiego was just one of several villains in the original script. She was chosen for the title role by the early project manager Katherine Bird because her name suggested mystery and exoticism, as well as humor. Siefkin departed the project shortly after writing the first script to become a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. State Department, and served as a press and cultural attaché.

===Gameplay===
The first game in the series released in 1985, &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, was designed and written by Gene Portwood and Lauren Elliott, and programmed by Dane Bigham. It established an original formula that was followed very faithfully in all &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; games. This formula involves a series of missions in which the computer player tracks and apprehends each of Carmen Sandiego&#x27;s underlings. Each case begins with the player being alerted that a spectacular theft has been committed. Immediately transported to the scene of the crime, the player must find clues to infer the suspect&#x27;s next destination and to create an arrest warrant describing the guilty party&#x27;s attributes. The culprit travels through a series of different locations around the world in an attempt to shake off any pursuers, so the player will have to continue tracking the thief for some time. The game continues in this manner until the player catches up with the culprit, at which point the thief is arrested, and if the warrant is correct, the player puts the thief in ACME prison. As more and more thieves are arrested, the player rises up through ACME&#x27;s ranks, and the later cases assigned to the player will become more difficult. On the final case, the perpetrator is revealed to be Carmen Sandiego herself, and the game ends when the player successfully captures her and is later inducted into the ACME Hall of Fame.

With the release of &quot;Word Detective&quot;, &quot;Math Detective&quot;, and &quot;Great Chase Through Time&quot;, Broderbund began to abandon the original formula in 1997. &quot;Word Detective&quot; and &quot;Math Detective&quot; involves the player infiltrating V.I.L.E. hideouts around the world and therefore maintain the globe-hopping element of previous games. However, &quot;Great Chase Through Time&quot; completely abandoned the series&#x27; original formula and has the player spending each mission in one time period, where the goal is to create makeshift solutions to any historical problems that the theft has caused and find the thief whom Carmen Sandiego has dropped off. The final mission of the game involves the player to track down Carmen Sandiego similar to the traditional formula, although the player does not construct a warrant.

===Style of humor===
The games created by Broderbund featured silly humor with a distinctive style of word play with extensive use of puns, rhymes, and alliteration. This style of word play was also present, in varying degrees, in all three &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; television shows.

Gag names (&quot;Hardley Worthit&quot;, &quot;Rob M. Blind&quot;, &quot;Ruth Less&quot;, &quot;Joy Ryder&quot;, &quot;M. T. Pockets&quot;, etc.) were quite frequently used in the games, often to the point where Carmen herself seemed to be the only person without such a name. Clues about the suspect&#x27;s next destination often used extended puns (example: &quot;I pumped her for information, but her unrefined answer only suggested a crude plan to visit oil wells near Ahvaz&quot;) or rhyming couplets. Even as the games began to abandon their original formula, this word play was still retained. For example, a news report on massive blackouts from &quot;Carmen Sandiego Math Detective&quot; quotes an official as saying, &quot;We&#x27;re taking a dim view of the situation&quot;.

Although Carmen&#x27;s V.I.L.E. gang members were often portrayed as cartoonish buffoons, they seemed to be capable of &quot;stealing&quot; landmarks, cities, national parks, notable cultural exports (such as &quot;stealing all the sushi from Japan&quot;) and the like. Her thieves have also been known to steal geographic features and even nonexistent map features such as the Mason–Dixon line. Some thefts were even &quot;non sequiturs&quot; based on word play, such as &quot;robbing the banks of the Nile&quot; or plays on the word &quot;steal&quot; such as &quot;stealing the show&quot;.

==Video games by Broderbund==
===&quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1985, 1996)===
The original version was released in 1985. The goal of this game is to track Carmen&#x27;s villains around the world and arrest them and later ultimately arrest Carmen herself. In order to make an arrest, the user had to have a warrant for the correct villain. The player began the game by visiting the city and country where the crime took place, and then obtaining hints from the bystanders on where the thief went next, leading them on a chase around the world to find the thief before they &quot;get away&quot;. In the process, the player collected clues about the villain’s identity to determine who the culprit is. When the player reached their final destination, the player presented the accurate warrant to arrest the villain.

The deluxe version was released in 1992 and featured additional animation and a reworked interface. Sarah Nade was added to this version of Carmen Sandiego Software. CD-ROM versions for DOS and Macintosh were released in 1993, and a Windows version was released in 1994. The Windows version was later re-released as &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Classic Edition&quot;.

The reboot version was released in 1996 with a new gameplay interface and animated characters. This version features QuickTime videos of actress Lynne Thigpen reprising her role as &quot;The Chief&quot; from the eponymous PBS game show, a role she would also play in the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; reboot games released during that same period.

===&quot;Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1986, 1996)===
This title was released in 1986. Similar to &quot;World&quot;, the goal of this game is to track Carmen&#x27;s villains around the United States, and arrest them and later ultimately arrest Carmen herself. In order to make an arrest, the user must have a warrant and, obviously, it has to be the correct warrant. The user gets information from the bystanders on where the thief went next and what the thief looks like. When the user reaches his/her final destination where the villain is going to pass off the loot to Carmen, he/she has to arrest them.

===&quot;Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1988)===

&quot;Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; is one of the many games in the Carmen Sandiego series. It focuses on the European history and geography. The gameplay is very similar to that of &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, meaning that the player is sent to a location, has to find clues to lead them to the next location, and builds up a warrant along the way. This was the first of the games to have a database built into the crime computer, where players could narrow down their next stop by entering information such as flag colors, currency used, and languages mentioned. Production of the game was discontinued in 1990 due to the fall of the Eastern Bloc and drastic border and government changes that resulted.

===&quot;Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;===
===&quot;Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1989, 1997)===

The original version was released in 1989. The goal of this game is to track Carmen&#x27;s villains through history and arrest them and later ultimately capture Carmen herself.

The reboot version was released in 1997 and later renamed &quot;Carmen Sandiego&#x27;s Great Chase Through Time&quot;. This version was heavily influenced by and features villains from the short-lived PBS game show.

===&quot;Carmen Sandiego in Japan&quot;===
===&quot;Where in America&#x27;s Past Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1991)===

This game is widely considered the most informational game of the entire series. Though it may contain some minute differences from the main series, it remains true to it. This game&#x27;s aim is to capture Carmen&#x27;s gang of thieves, one by one until all of her henchmen have been caught. This is done by searching for clues, trailing them, identifying them and finally, bringing them in for trial. After all of the henchmen have been caught, the player must then go after Carmen herself. One of the main differences is that the player can receive in-game help. 

===&quot;Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1993)===

The intention of this game is to teach astronomy. The player flies in a rocket ship throughout the solar system, interrogating various alien lifeforms in order to solve the theft of an important part of the solar system (e.g. Saturn&#x27;s rings). There was only a limited amount of fuel available for travel. So if the player did not ask the right questions on the right planets, or followed the wrong clues, the criminal(s) would get away, leaving the player to start anew with another crime. This version is somewhat similar to &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;. Kneemoi was introduced in this installment.

===&quot;Junior Detective Edition&quot; (1995)===

This title was released in 1995 and features characters from the &quot;Earth&quot; animated series. It uses a simplified version of the standard gameplay designed for younger players.

===&quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (2008)===
&quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; was released by Gameloft around 2008–2009. This game sees the titular thief Carmen Sandiego and her VILE gang steal jewels from museums around the world and to try to find out the famous confession of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s brother Ruperta. The player&#x27;s goal is to stop Carmen and capture her thieves. Starting as an inexperienced rookie, the player&#x27;s first quest is to retrieve the Napoleon bowl that was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris and apprehend the thief. It is then revealed that the bowl has spaces for 8 jewels, and it is the players&#x27; task to find these treasures. The game is an arcade game combined with an adventure game, consisting of twelve increasingly difficult cases to solve.

Each investigation sends the player to various cities around the world. Their task is to interrogate witnesses, find out what the perpetrator looks like (three clues are required to obtain an arrest warrant), and obtain clues about their whereabouts. Players have seven days to solve each case. The player chooses the next destination on a map: if they choose incorrectly they lose time.

As the player gains experience, they gain access to two useful gadgets - the almanac (which contains detailed information about the city) and a scanner (which helps to find clues in the city). The game includes 3 mini-games: &quot;World Chase&quot; - selecting the capital of a given country, &quot;Flag Quiz&quot; - recognizing the flag of a given country, and &quot;Face Match&quot; - remembering then indicating facial features.

On September 1, 1999, Internet solutions firm Rare Medium created a Carmen Sandiego website for The Learning Company which included a &quot;Where on the Web is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; game that took kids through educational links.

&quot;Where on the Web Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; was a free online adventure for grades 4-8. The game built reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. Student teams completed one cross-curricular mission per week during the six-week challenge. Teams could save their progress for later completion. Every class that completed four of six missions would have a chance to win a new computer loaded with The Learning Company educational software. The program began in February 2000. The synopsis says: &quot;As special agents of the ACME Detective Agency, kids will embark on missions to track down the devious Carmen Sandiego and her cohorts, collecting clues and learning about the world (and the Internet) to solve the case&quot;. The project was design directed by Eric Wood.

==Unofficial games==
===&quot;Where in Hell Is Carmen Santiago?&quot;===

&quot;Where in Hell Is Carmen Santiago?&quot; is a 1990 game developed by St. John M. Morrison, which has players hunt down Carmen in the afterlife. Broderbund never recognized this as a part of the series. It has the status of &quot;a Copyrighted FreeWare&quot;. The title screen started with the word &quot;Heck&quot;, which was rubbed off and replaced with &quot;HELL&quot;. The creator of the game had never played a Carmen Sandiego game, but was very familiar of the franchise due to its constant appearance in gaming magazines. He crafted a first person adventure game based on this premise and copied the naming scheme of the titles.

The beginning of the plot is as follows: &quot;You are a famous crimebuster hot on the trail of that world-renowned thief, Carmen Santiago (sic), and her latest gang. The rumors that she had died in a bizarre accident don&#x27;t deter you; after all, it might just be misdirection. So you track her to the Dark Woods of I/O Error, where you encounter three hideous beasts and lose your way in the night&quot;.

In &quot;Where in Hell is Carmen Santiago?&quot;, the players need to use detective skills and knowledge of facts from Canticle One of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot;: &quot;Inferno&quot;. Players have 140 turns to be successful, and can do the following commands per turn: move up, move down, view map, inventory, call a name, use an item, look around, search for items, save, restart, quit, and sound off.

===Sandiego Inc.===
Sandiego Inc. is an app in the same vein as the Carmen Sandiego series. AndroidGuys wrote the title &quot;preys on people&#x27;s nostalgia for the Carmen Sandiego series&quot;.

<text>Technicolor theories are models of physics beyond the Standard Model that address electroweak gauge symmetry breaking, the mechanism through which W and Z bosons acquire masses. Early technicolor theories were modelled on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the &quot;color&quot; theory of the strong nuclear force, which inspired their name.

Instead of introducing elementary Higgs bosons to explain observed phenomena, technicolor models were introduced to dynamically generate masses for the W and Z bosons through new gauge interactions. Although asymptotically free at very high energies, these interactions must become strong and confining (and hence unobservable) at lower energies that have been experimentally probed. This dynamical approach is natural and avoids issues of quantum triviality and the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. 

However, since the Higgs boson discovery at the 
CERN LHC in 2012, the original models are largely ruled out. Nonetheless, it remains a possibility that the Higgs boson is a composite state.

In order to produce quark and lepton masses, technicolor or composite Higgs models have to be &quot;extended&quot; by additional gauge interactions. Particularly when modelled on QCD, extended technicolor was challenged by experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral current and precision electroweak measurements. The specific extensions of particle dynamics for technicolor 
or composite Higgs bosons are unknown.

Much technicolor research focuses on exploring strongly interacting gauge theories other than QCD, in order to evade some of these challenges. A particularly active framework is &quot;walking&quot; technicolor, which exhibits nearly conformal behavior caused by an infrared fixed point with strength just above that necessary for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Whether walking can occur and lead to agreement with precision electroweak measurements is being studied through non-perturbative lattice simulations.

Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider have discovered the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e., the Higgs boson, with mass approximately ; such a particle is not generically predicted by technicolor models. However,
the Higgs boson may be a composite state, e.g., built of top and anti-top quarks
as in the Bardeen–Hill–Lindner theory.
Composite Higgs models are generally solved by the top quark infrared fixed point,
and may require a new dynamics at extremely high energies such as topcolor.

== Introduction ==
The mechanism for the breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry in the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions remains unknown. The breaking must be spontaneous, meaning that the underlying theory manifests the symmetry exactly (the gauge-boson fields are massless in the equations of motion), but the solutions (the ground state and the excited states) do not. In particular, the physical &quot;W&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; gauge bosons become massive. This phenomenon, in which the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; bosons also acquire an extra polarization state, is called the &quot;Higgs mechanism&quot;. Despite the precise agreement of the electroweak theory with experiment at energies accessible so far, the necessary ingredients for the symmetry breaking remain hidden, yet to be revealed at higher energies.

The simplest mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking introduces a single complex field and predicts the existence of the Higgs boson. Typically, the Higgs boson is &quot;unnatural&quot; in the sense that quantum mechanical fluctuations produce corrections to its mass that lift it to such high values that it cannot play the role for which it was introduced. Unless the Standard Model breaks down at energies less than a few TeV, the Higgs mass can be kept small only by a delicate fine-tuning of parameters.

Technicolor avoids this problem by hypothesizing a new gauge interaction coupled to new massless fermions. This interaction is asymptotically free at very high energies and becomes strong and confining as the energy decreases to the electroweak scale of 246 GeV. These strong forces spontaneously break the massless fermions&#x27; chiral symmetries, some of which are weakly gauged as part of the Standard Model. This is the dynamical version of the Higgs mechanism. The electroweak gauge symmetry is thus broken, producing masses for the W and Z bosons.

The new strong interaction leads to a host of new composite, short-lived particles at energies accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This framework is natural because there are no elementary Higgs bosons and, hence, no fine-tuning of parameters. Quark and lepton masses also break the electroweak gauge symmetries, so they, too, must arise spontaneously. A mechanism for incorporating this feature is known as extended technicolor. Technicolor and extended technicolor face a number of phenomenological challenges, in particular issues of flavor-changing neutral currents, precision electroweak tests, and the top quark mass. Technicolor models also do not generically predict Higgs-like bosons as light as ; such a particle was discovered by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. Some of these issues can be addressed with a class of theories known as &quot;walking technicolor&quot;.

== Early technicolor ==
Technicolor is the name given to the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking by new strong gauge-interactions whose characteristic energy scale is the weak scale itself, . The guiding principle of technicolor is &quot;naturalness&quot;: basic physical phenomena should not require fine-tuning of the parameters in the Lagrangian that describes them. What constitutes fine-tuning is to some extent a subjective matter, but a theory with elementary scalar particles typically is very finely tuned (unless it is supersymmetric). The quadratic divergence in the scalar&#x27;s mass requires adjustments of a part in formula_1, where bare is the cutoff of the theory, the energy scale at which the theory changes in some essential way. In the standard electroweak model with (the grand-unification mass scale), and with the Higgs boson mass , the mass is tuned to at least a part in 10.

By contrast, a natural theory of electroweak symmetry breaking is an asymptotically free gauge theory with fermions as the only matter fields. The technicolor gauge group G is often assumed to be SU(). Based on analogy with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is assumed that there are one or more doublets of massless Dirac &quot;technifermions&quot; transforming vectorially under the same complex representation of G, formula_2. Thus, there is a chiral symmetry of these fermions, e.g., , if they all transform according to the same complex representation of G. Continuing the analogy with QCD, the running gauge coupling () triggers spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, the technifermions acquire a dynamical mass, and a number of massless Goldstone bosons result. If the technifermions transform under as left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets, three linear combinations of these Goldstone bosons couple to three of the electroweak gauge currents.

In 1973 Jackiw and Johnson and Cornwall and Norton studied the possibility that a (non-vectorial) gauge interaction of fermions can break itself; i.e., is strong enough to form a Goldstone boson coupled to the gauge current. Using Abelian gauge models, they showed that, &quot;if&quot; such a Goldstone boson is formed, it is &quot;eaten&quot; by the Higgs mechanism, becoming the longitudinal component of the now massive gauge boson. Technically, the polarization function () appearing in the gauge boson propagator, 
: formula_3 
develops a pole at with residue , the square of the Goldstone boson&#x27;s decay constant, and the gauge boson acquires mass . In 1973, Weinstein showed that composite Goldstone bosons whose constituent fermions transform in the &quot;standard&quot; way under SU(2) ⊗ U(1) generate the weak boson masses
: formula_4

This standard-model relation is achieved with elementary Higgs bosons in electroweak doublets; it is verified experimentally to better than 1%. Here, and are SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings and formula_5 defines the weak mixing angle.

The important idea of a &quot;new&quot; strong gauge interaction of massless fermions at the electroweak scale driving the spontaneous breakdown of its global chiral symmetry, of which an SU(2) ⊗ U(1) subgroup is weakly gauged, was first proposed in 1979 by Weinberg. This &quot;technicolor&quot; mechanism is natural in that no fine-tuning of parameters is necessary.

== Extended technicolor ==
Elementary Higgs bosons perform another important task. In the Standard Model, quarks and leptons are necessarily massless because they transform under as left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets. The Higgs doublet couples to these fermions. When it develops its vacuum expectation value, it transmits this electroweak breaking to the quarks and leptons, giving them their observed masses. (In general, electroweak-eigenstate fermions are not mass eigenstates, so this process also induces the mixing matrices observed in charged-current weak interactions.)

In technicolor, something else must generate the quark and lepton masses. The only natural possibility, one avoiding the introduction of elementary scalars, is to enlarge TC to allow technifermions to couple to quarks and leptons. This coupling is induced by gauge bosons of the enlarged group. The picture, then, is that there is a large &quot;extended technicolor&quot; (ETC) gauge group in which technifermions, quarks, and leptons live in the same representations. At one or more high scales ETC, ETC is broken down to TC, and quarks and leptons emerge as the TC-singlet fermions. When TC() becomes strong at scale TC ≈ EW, the fermionic condensate formula_6 forms. (The condensate is the vacuum expectation value of the technifermion bilinear formula_7. The estimate here is based on naive dimensional analysis of the quark condensate in QCD, expected to be correct as an order of magnitude.) Then, the transitions formula_8 can proceed through the technifermion&#x27;s dynamical mass by the emission and reabsorption of ETC bosons whose masses ETC ≈ ETC ETC are much greater than TC. The quarks and leptons develop masses given approximately by
: formula_9

Here, formula_10 is the technifermion condensate renormalized at the ETC boson mass scale,
: formula_11
where m() is the anomalous dimension of the technifermion bilinear formula_12 at the scale . The second estimate in Eq. (2) depends on the assumption that, as happens in QCD, TC() becomes weak not far above TC, so that the anomalous dimension m of formula_12 is small there. Extended technicolor was introduced in 1979 by Dimopoulos and Susskind, and by Eichten and Lane. For a quark of mass  ≈ 1 GeV, and with TC ≈ 246 GeV, one estimates ETC ≈ 15 TeV. Therefore, assuming that formula_14, ETC will be at least this large.

In addition to the ETC proposal for quark and lepton masses, Eichten and Lane observed that the size of the ETC representations required to generate all quark and lepton masses suggests that there will be more than one electroweak doublet of technifermions. If so, there will be more (spontaneously broken) chiral symmetries and therefore more Goldstone bosons than are eaten by the Higgs mechanism. These must acquire mass by virtue of the fact that the extra chiral symmetries are also explicitly broken, by the standard-model interactions and the ETC interactions. These &quot;pseudo-Goldstone bosons&quot; are called technipions, T. An application of Dashen&#x27;s theorem gives for the ETC contribution to their mass
: formula_15

The second approximation in Eq. (4) assumes that formula_16. For EW ≈ TC ≈ 246 GeV and ETC ≈ 15 TeV, this contribution to T is about 50 GeV. Since ETC interactions generate formula_17 &quot;and&quot; the coupling of technipions to quark and lepton pairs, one expects the couplings to be Higgs-like; i.e., roughly proportional to the masses of the quarks and leptons. This means that technipions are expected to predominately decay to the heaviest possible formula_18 and formula_19 pairs.

Perhaps the most important restriction on the ETC framework for quark mass generation is that ETC interactions are likely to induce flavor-changing neutral current processes such as , , and formula_20 interactions that induce formula_21 and formula_22 mixing. The reason is that the algebra of the ETC currents involved in formula_17 generation imply formula_24 and formula_25 ETC currents which, when written in terms of fermion mass eigenstates, have no reason to conserve flavor. The strongest constraint comes from requiring that ETC interactions mediating formula_26 mixing contribute less than the Standard Model. This implies an effective ETC greater than 1000 TeV. The actual ETC may be reduced somewhat if CKM-like mixing angle factors are present. If these interactions are CP-violating, as they well may be, the constraint from the -parameter is that the effective ETC &gt; 104 TeV. Such huge ETC mass scales imply tiny quark and lepton masses and ETC contributions to T of at most a few GeV, in conflict with LEP searches for T at the 0.

Extended technicolor is a very ambitious proposal, requiring that quark and lepton masses and mixing angles arise from experimentally accessible interactions. &quot;If&quot; there exists a successful model, it would not only predict the masses and mixings of quarks and leptons (and technipions), it would explain why there are three families of each: they are the ones that fit into the ETC representations of , formula_27, and . It should not be surprising that the construction of a successful model has proven to be very difficult.

== Walking technicolor ==
Since quark and lepton masses are proportional to the bilinear technifermion condensate divided by the ETC mass scale squared, their tiny values can be avoided if the condensate is enhanced above the weak-TC estimate in Eq. (2), formula_28.

During the 1980s, several dynamical mechanisms were advanced to do this. In 1981 Holdom suggested that, if the TC() evolves to a nontrivial fixed point in the ultraviolet, with a large positive anomalous dimension m for formula_7, realistic quark and lepton masses could arise with ETC large enough to suppress ETC-induced formula_30 mixing. However, no example of a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in a four-dimensional gauge theory has been constructed. In 1985 Holdom analyzed a technicolor theory in which a &quot;slowly varying&quot; TC() was envisioned. His focus was to separate the chiral breaking and confinement scales, but he also noted that such a theory could enhance formula_31 and thus allow the ETC scale to be raised. In 1986 Akiba and Yanagida also considered enhancing quark and lepton masses, by simply assuming that TC is constant and strong all the way up to the ETC scale. In the same year Yamawaki, Bando, and Matumoto again imagined an ultraviolet fixed point in a non-asymptotically free theory to enhance the technifermion condensate.

In 1986 Appelquist, Karabali and Wijewardhana discussed the enhancement of fermion masses in an asymptotically free technicolor theory with a slowly running, or &quot;walking&quot;, gauge coupling. The slowness arose from the screening effect of a large number of technifermions, with the analysis carried out through two-loop perturbation theory. In 1987 Appelquist and Wijewardhana explored this walking scenario further. They took the analysis to three loops, noted that the walking can lead to a power law enhancement of the technifermion condensate, and estimated the resultant quark, lepton, and technipion masses. The condensate enhancement arises because the associated technifermion mass decreases slowly, roughly linearly, as a function of its renormalization scale. This corresponds to the condensate anomalous dimension m in Eq. (3) approaching unity (see below).

In the 1990s, the idea emerged more clearly that walking is naturally described by asymptotically free gauge theories dominated in the infrared by an approximate fixed point. Unlike the speculative proposal of ultraviolet fixed points, fixed points in the infrared are known to exist in asymptotically free theories, arising at two loops in the beta function providing that the fermion count f is large enough. This has been known since the first two-loop computation in 1974 by Caswell. If f is close to the value formula_32 at which asymptotic freedom is lost, the resultant infrared fixed point is weak, of parametric order formula_33, and reliably accessible in perturbation theory. This weak-coupling limit was explored by Banks and Zaks in 1982.

The fixed-point coupling IR becomes stronger as f is reduced from formula_32. Below some critical value fc the coupling becomes strong enough (&gt;  SB) to break spontaneously the massless technifermions&#x27; chiral symmetry. Since the analysis must typically go beyond two-loop perturbation theory, the definition of the running coupling TC(), its fixed point value IR, and the strength  SB necessary for chiral symmetry breaking depend on the particular renormalization scheme adopted. For formula_35; i.e., for f just below fc, the evolution of TC(μ) is governed by the infrared fixed point and it will evolve slowly (walk) for a range of momenta above the breaking scale TC. To overcome the formula_36-suppression of the masses of first and second generation quarks involved in formula_37 mixing, this range must extend almost to their ETC scale, of formula_38. Cohen and Georgi argued that m = 1 is the signal of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, i.e., that m( SB) = 1. Therefore, in the walking-TC region, m ≈ 1 and, from Eqs. (2) and (3), the light quark masses are enhanced approximately by formula_39.

The idea that TC() walks for a large range of momenta when IR lies just above  SB was suggested by Lane and Ramana. They made an explicit model, discussed the walking that ensued, and used it in their discussion of walking technicolor phenomenology at hadron colliders. This idea was developed in some detail by Appelquist, Terning, and Wijewardhana. Combining a perturbative computation of the infrared fixed point with an approximation of  SB based on the Schwinger–Dyson equation, they estimated the critical value fc and explored the resultant electroweak physics. Since the 1990s, most discussions of walking technicolor are in the framework of theories assumed to be dominated in the infrared by an approximate fixed point. Various models have been explored, some with the technifermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group and some employing higher representations.

The possibility that the technicolor condensate can be enhanced beyond that discussed in the walking literature, has also been considered recently by Luty and Okui under the name &quot;conformal technicolor&quot;. They envision an infrared stable fixed point, but with a very large anomalous dimension for the operator formula_7. It remains to be seen whether this can be realized, for example, in the class of theories currently being examined using lattice techniques.

== Top quark mass ==
The enhancement described above for walking technicolor may not be sufficient to generate the measured top quark mass, even for an ETC scale as low as a few TeV. However, this problem could be addressed if the effective four-technifermion coupling resulting from ETC gauge boson exchange is strong and tuned just above a critical value. The analysis of this strong-ETC possibility is that of a Nambu–Jona–Lasinio model with an additional (technicolor) gauge interaction. The technifermion masses are small compared to the ETC scale (the cutoff on the effective theory), but nearly constant out to this scale, leading to a large top quark mass. No fully realistic ETC theory for all quark masses has yet been developed incorporating these ideas. A related study was carried out by Miransky and Yamawaki. A problem with this approach is that it involves some degree of parameter fine-tuning, in conflict with technicolor&#x27;s guiding principle of naturalness.

A large body of closely related work in which the Higgs is a composite state, composed of top and anti-top quarks, is the top quark condensate, topcolor and top-color-assisted technicolor models, in which new strong interactions are ascribed to the top quark and other third-generation fermions.

== Technicolor on the lattice ==
Lattice gauge theory is a non-perturbative method applicable to strongly interacting technicolor theories, allowing first-principles exploration of walking and conformal dynamics. In 2007, Catterall and Sannino used lattice gauge theory to study &quot;SU&quot;(2) gauge theories with two flavors of Dirac fermions in the symmetric representation, finding evidence of conformality that has been confirmed by subsequent studies.

As of 2010, the situation for &quot;SU&quot;(3) gauge theory with fermions in the fundamental representation is not as clear-cut. In 2007, Appelquist, Fleming, and Neil reported evidence that a non-trivial infrared fixed point develops in such theories when there are twelve flavors, but not when there are eight. While some subsequent studies confirmed these results, others reported different conclusions, depending on the lattice methods used, and there is not yet consensus.

Further lattice studies exploring these issues, as well as considering the consequences of these theories for precision electroweak measurements, are underway by several research groups.

== Technicolor phenomenology ==
Any framework for physics beyond the Standard Model must conform with precision measurements of the electroweak parameters. Its consequences for physics at existing and future high-energy hadron colliders, and for the dark matter of the universe must also be explored.

=== Precision electroweak tests ===
In 1990, the phenomenological parameters , , and were introduced by Peskin and Takeuchi to quantify contributions to electroweak radiative corrections from physics beyond the Standard Model. They have a simple relation to the parameters of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. The Peskin–Takeuchi analysis was based on the general formalism for weak radiative corrections developed by Kennedy, Lynn, Peskin and Stuart, and alternate formulations also exist.

The , , and -parameters describe corrections to the electroweak gauge boson propagators from physics beyond the Standard Model. They can be written in terms of polarization functions of electroweak currents and their spectral representation as follows:
: formula_41
where only new, beyond-standard-model physics is included. The quantities are calculated relative to a minimal Standard Model with some chosen reference mass of the Higgs boson, taken to range from the experimental lower bound of 117 GeV to 1000 GeV where its width becomes very large. For these parameters to describe the dominant corrections to the Standard Model, the mass scale of the new physics must be much greater than and , and the coupling of quarks and leptons to the new particles must be suppressed relative to their coupling to the gauge bosons. This is the case with technicolor, so long as the lightest technivector mesons, T and T, are heavier than 200–300 GeV. The -parameter is sensitive to all new physics at the TeV scale, while is a measure of weak-isospin breaking effects. The -parameter is generally not useful; most new-physics theories, including technicolor theories, give negligible contributions to it.

The and -parameters are determined by global fit to experimental data including &quot;Z&quot;-pole data from LEP at CERN, top quark and -mass measurements at Fermilab, and measured levels of atomic parity violation. The resultant bounds on these parameters are given in the Review of Particle Properties. Assuming = 0, the and parameters are small and, in fact, consistent with zero:
: formula_42
where the central value corresponds to a Higgs mass of 117 GeV and the correction to the central value when the Higgs mass is increased to 300 GeV is given in parentheses. These values place tight restrictions on beyond-standard-model theories – when the relevant corrections can be reliably computed.

The parameter estimated in QCD-like technicolor theories is significantly greater than the experimentally allowed value. The computation was done assuming that the spectral integral for is dominated by the lightest T and T resonances, or by scaling effective Lagrangian parameters from QCD. In walking technicolor, however, the physics at the TeV scale and beyond must be quite different from that of QCD-like theories. In particular, the vector and axial-vector spectral functions cannot be dominated by just the lowest-lying resonances. It is unknown whether higher energy contributions to formula_43 are a tower of identifiable T and T states or a smooth continuum. It has been conjectured that T and T partners could be more nearly degenerate in walking theories (approximate parity doubling), reducing their contribution to . Lattice calculations are underway or planned to test these ideas and obtain reliable estimates of in walking theories.

The restriction on the -parameter poses a problem for the generation of the top-quark mass in the ETC framework. The enhancement from walking can allow the associated ETC scale to be as large as a few TeV, but – since the ETC interactions must be strongly weak-isospin breaking to allow for the large top-bottom mass splitting – the contribution to the parameter, as well as the rate for the decay formula_44, could be too large.

=== Hadron collider phenomenology ===
Early studies generally assumed the existence of just one electroweak doublet of technifermions, or of one techni-family including one doublet each of color-triplet techniquarks and color-singlet technileptons (four electroweak doublets in total). The number D of electroweak doublets determines the decay constant needed to produce the correct electroweak scale, as = = . In the minimal, one-doublet model, three Goldstone bosons (technipions, T) have decay constant = EW = 246 GeV and are eaten by the electroweak gauge bosons. The most accessible collider signal is the production through formula_18 annihilation in a hadron collider of spin-one formula_46, and their subsequent decay into a pair of longitudinally polarized weak bosons, formula_47 and formula_48. At an expected mass of 1.5–2.0 TeV and width of 300–400 GeV, such T&#x27;s would be difficult to discover at the LHC. A one-family model has a large number of physical technipions, with = = 123 GeV. There is a collection of correspondingly lower-mass color-singlet and octet technivectors decaying into technipion pairs. The T&#x27;s are expected to decay to the heaviest possible quark and lepton pairs. Despite their lower masses, the T&#x27;s are wider than in the minimal model and the backgrounds to the T decays are likely to be insurmountable at a hadron collider.

This picture changed with the advent of walking technicolor. A walking gauge coupling occurs if  SB lies just below the IR fixed point value IR, which requires either a large number of electroweak doublets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, e.g., or a few doublets in higher-dimensional TC representations. In the latter case, the constraints on ETC representations generally imply other technifermions in the fundamental representation as well. In either case, there are technipions T with decay constant formula_49. This implies formula_50 so that the lightest technivectors accessible at the LHC – T, T, T (with = 1+ 1−−, 0− 1−−, 1− 1++) – have masses well below a TeV. The class of theories with many technifermions and thus formula_49 is called low-scale technicolor.

A second consequence of walking technicolor concerns the decays of the spin-one technihadrons. Since technipion masses formula_52 (see Eq. (4)), walking enhances them much more than it does other technihadron masses. Thus, it is very likely that the lightest T &lt; 2T and that the two and three-T decay channels of the light technivectors are closed. This further implies that these technivectors are very narrow. Their most probable two-body channels are formula_53, L L, T and L. The coupling of the lightest technivectors to L is proportional to . Thus, all their decay rates are suppressed by powers of formula_54 or the fine-structure constant, giving total widths of a few GeV (for T) to a few tenths of a GeV (for T and T).

A more speculative consequence of walking technicolor is motivated by consideration of its contribution to the -parameter. As noted above, the usual assumptions made to estimate TC are invalid in a walking theory. In particular, the spectral integrals used to evaluate TC cannot be dominated by just the lowest-lying T and T and, if TC is to be small, the masses and weak-current couplings of the T and T could be more nearly equal than they are in QCD.

Low-scale technicolor phenomenology, including the possibility of a more parity-doubled spectrum, has been developed into a set of rules and decay amplitudes. An April 2011 announcement of an excess in jet pairs produced in association with a boson measured at the Tevatron has been interpreted by Eichten, Lane and Martin as a possible signal of the technipion of low-scale technicolor.

The general scheme of low-scale technicolor makes little sense if the limit on formula_55 is pushed past about 700 GeV. The LHC should be able to discover it or rule it out. Searches there involving decays to technipions and thence to heavy quark jets are hampered by backgrounds from formula_56 production; its rate is 100 times larger than that at the Tevatron. Consequently, the discovery of low-scale technicolor at the LHC relies on all-leptonic final-state channels with favorable signal-to-background ratios: formula_57, formula_58 and formula_59.

=== Dark matter ===
Technicolor theories naturally contain dark matter candidates. Almost certainly, models can be built in which the lowest-lying technibaryon, a technicolor-singlet bound state of technifermions, is stable enough to survive the evolution of the universe. If the technicolor theory is low-scale (formula_49), the baryon&#x27;s mass should be no more than 1–2 TeV. If not, it could be much heavier. The technibaryon must be electrically neutral and satisfy constraints on its abundance. Given the limits on spin-independent dark-matter-nucleon cross sections from dark-matter search experiments (formula_61 for the masses of interest), it may have to be electroweak neutral (weak isospin  = 0) as well. These considerations suggest that the &quot;old&quot; technicolor dark matter candidates may be difficult to produce at the LHC.

A different class of technicolor dark matter candidates light enough to be accessible at the LHC was introduced by Francesco Sannino and his collaborators. These states are pseudo Goldstone bosons possessing a global charge that makes them stable against decay.

<text>The Kharijites (, singular ) were an Islamic sect which emerged during the First Fitna (656–661). The first Kharijites were supporters of Ali who rebelled against his acceptance of arbitration talks to settle the conflict with his challenger, Mu&#x27;awiya, at the Battle of Siffin in 657. They asserted that &quot;judgment belongs to God alone&quot;, which became their motto, and that rebels such as Mu&#x27;awiya had to be fought and overcome according to Qur&#x27;anic injunctions. Ali defeated the Kharijites at the Battle of Nahrawan in 658, but their insurrection continued. Ali was assassinated in 661 by a Kharijite dissident seeking revenge for the defeat at Nahrawan.

After Mu&#x27;awiya established the Umayyad Caliphate in 661, his governors kept the Kharijites in check. The power vacuum caused by the Second Fitna (680–692) allowed for the resumption of the Kharijites&#x27; anti-government rebellion, and the Kharijite factions of the Azariqa and Najdat came to control large areas in Persia and Arabia. Internal disputes and fragmentation weakened them considerably before their defeat by the Umayyads in 696–699. In the 740s, large-scale Kharijite rebellions broke out across the caliphate, but all were eventually suppressed. Although the Kharijite revolts continued into the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258), the most militant Kharijite groups were gradually eliminated. They were replaced by the non-activist Ibadiyya, who survive to this day in Oman and some parts of North Africa. They, however, deny any links with the Kharijites of the Second Muslim Civil War and beyond, condemning them as extremists.

The Kharijites believed that any Muslim, irrespective of his descent or ethnicity, qualified for the role of caliph, provided he was morally irreproachable. It was the duty of Muslims to rebel against and depose caliphs who sinned. Most Kharijite groups branded as unbelievers (; sing. ) Muslims who had committed a grave sin, and the most militant declared killing of such unbelievers to be licit, unless they repented. Many Kharijites were skilled orators and poets, and the major themes of their poetry were piety and martyrdom. The Kharijites of the eighth and ninth centuries participated in theological debates and, in the process, contributed to mainstream Islamic theology.

What is known about Kharijite history and doctrines derives from non-Kharijite authors of the ninth and tenth centuries and is hostile toward the sect. The absence of the Kharijite version of their history has made unearthing their true motives difficult. Traditional Muslim historical sources and mainstream Muslims viewed the Kharijites as religious extremists who left the Muslim community. The term Kharijites is often used by modern mainstream Muslims to describe Islamist extremist groups that have been compared to the Kharijites for their radical ideology and militancy. On the other hand, some modern Arab historians have stressed the egalitarian and proto-democratic tendencies of the Kharijites. Modern, academic historians are generally divided in attributing the Kharijite phenomenon to purely religious motivations, economic factors, or a Bedouin (nomadic Arab) challenge to the establishment of an organized state, with some rejecting the traditional account of the movement having started at Siffin.

==Etymology==
The term was used as an exonym by their opponents for leaving the army of Caliph Ali during the First Fitna. The term comes from the Arabic root , which has the primary meaning &quot;to leave&quot; or &quot;to get out&quot;, as in the basic word , , &quot;to go out&quot;. The term is anglicized to &#x27;Kharijites&#x27; from the singular . They called themselves (&quot;the Exchangers&quot;), which they understood within the context of Islamic scripture () and philosophy to mean &quot;those who have traded the mortal life () for the other life [with God] ()&quot;.

==Primary and classical sources==
Almost no primary Kharijite sources survive, except for works by authors from the sole surviving Kharijite sect of Ibadiyya, and excerpts in non-Kharijite works. As the latter are the main sources of information and date to later periods, the Kharijite material has suffered alterations and distortions during transmission, collection, and classification.

Non-Kharijite sources fall mainly into two categories: histories and heresiographical works—the so-called (sects) literature. The histories were written significantly later than the actual events, and many of the theological and political disputes among the early Muslims had been settled by then. As representatives of the emerging orthodoxy, the Sunni as well as Shia authors of these works looked upon the original events through the lens of this orthodox viewpoint. The bulk of information regarding the Kharijites, however, comes from the second category. These sources are outright polemical, as the authors tend to portray their own sect as the true representative of original Islam and are consequently hostile to the Kharijites. Although the authors in both categories used earlier Kharijite as well as non-Kharijite sources, which are no longer extant, their rendering of the events has been heavily altered by literary topoi.

Based on a hadith (saying or tradition attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) prophesying the emergence of 73 sects in Islam, of which one would be saved () and the rest doomed as deviant, the heresiographers were mainly concerned with classifying what they considered to be deviant sects and their heretical doctrines. Consequently, views of certain sects were altered to fit into classification schemes, and sometimes fictitious sects were invented. Moreover, the reports are often confused and contradictory, rendering a reconstruction of &#x27;what actually happened&#x27; and the true motives of the Kharijites, which is free of later interpolations, especially difficult. According to the historians Hannah-Lena Hagemann and Peter Verkinderen, the sources sometimes used the Kharijites as a literary tool to address other issues, which were otherwise unrelated to the Kharijites, such as &quot;the status of Ali, the dangers of communal strife, or the legal aspects of rebellion&quot;. The Ibadi sources, on the other hand, are hagiographical and are concerned with preserving the group identity. Toward this purpose, stories are sometimes created, or real events altered, in order to romanticize and valorize early Kharijite revolts and their leaders as the anchors of the group identity. These too are hostile to other Kharijite groups. The sources, whether Ibadi, historiographical, or heresiographical, do not necessarily report events as they actually happened. They rather show how their respective authors viewed, and wanted their readers to view, these events.

The sources in the historiographical category include the &quot;History&quot; of al-Tabari (d. 923), of al-Baladhuri (d. 892), of al-Mubarrad (d. 899), and of al-Mas&#x27;udi (d. 956). Other notable sources include the histories of Ibn Athir (d. 1233), and Ibn Kathir (d. 1373), but these have drawn most of their material from al-Tabari. The core of the information in these historiographical sources is based on the works of earlier historians like Abu Mikhnaf (d. 773), Abu Ubayda (d. 825), and al-Mada&#x27;ini (d. 843). The authors of the heresiographical category include al-Ash&#x27;ari (d. 935), al-Baghdadi (d. 1037), Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), and others. Notable among the surviving Ibadi works is the eighth-century heresiographical writing of Salim ibn Dhakwan. It distinguishes Ibadism from other Kharijite groups which it treats as extremists. &quot;Al-Kashf wa&#x27;l-Bayan&quot;, a 12th-century work by al-Qalhati, is another example of Ibadi heresiographies and discusses the origins of the Kharijites and the divisions within the Kharijite movement.

==Origin==

The Kharijites were the first sect to arise within Islam. They originated during the First Fitna, the struggle for political leadership over the Muslim community (), following the assassination in 656 of the third caliph Uthman ().

The later years of Uthman&#x27;s reign were marked by growing discontent from multiple groups within the Muslim community. His favoritism and enrichment of his Umayyad relatives was disdained by the Muslim elite in Medina. The early Muslim settlers of the garrison towns of Kufa and Fustat, in the conquered regions of Iraq and Egypt, felt their status threatened by several factors during this period. These were Uthman&#x27;s interference in provincial affairs, overcrowding of the garrison towns by a continuous tribal influx from Arabia, diminishing revenue from the conquests, and the growing influence of the pre-Islamic tribal nobility. Opposition by the Iraqi early-comers, who became known as the (which probably means &#x27;the Qur&#x27;an reciters&#x27;), and the Egyptians turned into open rebellion in 656. Encouraged by the disaffected Medinese elite, the rebels marched on Medina, killing Uthman in June 656. His murder sparked the civil war.

Afterward, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law Ali became caliph with the help of the people of Medina and the rebels. He was soon challenged by Muhammad&#x27;s widow, A&#x27;isha, and Muhammad&#x27;s early companions, Talha ibn Ubayd Allah and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, who held that his election was invalid as it involved Uthman&#x27;s murderers and hence a (consultative assembly) had to be called to elect a new caliph. Ali defeated them in November 656 at the Battle of the Camel. Later, Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, Uthman&#x27;s kinsman and the governor of Syria, denounced Ali&#x27;s election, holding that Uthman&#x27;s murderers were in Ali&#x27;s camp and evaded punishment. The two faced each other at the Battle of Siffin in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu&#x27;awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist leaves of the Qur&#x27;an () on their lances, a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The in Ali&#x27;s army were moved by the gesture, which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God, and demanded that Ali halt the fighting immediately. Although initially unwilling, he yielded under pressure and threats of violence against him by the . An arbitration committee composed of representatives of Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya was established with a mandate to settle the dispute according to the Qur&#x27;an and the . While most of Ali&#x27;s army accepted the agreement, one group, which included many Tamim tribesmen, vehemently objected to the arbitration and raised the slogan &#x27;judgment belongs to God alone&#x27; ().

===Harura===

As Ali marched back to his capital at Kufa, widespread resentment toward the arbitration developed in his army. As many as 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and set up camp in Harura, a place near Kufa. They thus became known as the Harurites. They held that Uthman had deserved his death because of his nepotism and not ruling according to the Qur&#x27;an, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu&#x27;awiya was a rebel. They believed that the Qur&#x27;an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu&#x27;awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the Qur&#x27;anic verse:

They held that in agreeing to arbitration, Ali committed the grave sin of rejecting God&#x27;s judgment () and attempted to substitute human judgment for God&#x27;s clear injunction, which prompted their motto &#x27;judgment belongs to God alone&#x27;. From this expression, which they were the first to adopt as a motto, they became known as the .

Ali visited the Harura camp and attempted to regain the dissidents&#x27; support, arguing that it was they who had forced him to accept the arbitration proposal despite his reservations. They acknowledged that they had sinned but insisted that they repented and asked him to do the same, which Ali then did in general and ambiguous terms. The troops at Harura subsequently restored their allegiance to Ali and returned to Kufa, on the condition that the war against Mu&#x27;awiya be resumed within six months.

===Nahrawan===

Ali refused to denounce the arbitration proceedings, which continued despite the reconciliation with the troops at Harura. In March 658, Ali sent a delegation, led by Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari, to carry out the talks. The troops opposed to the arbitration thereafter condemned Ali&#x27;s rule and elected the pious Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi as their caliph. In order to evade detection, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of the Tigris. Some five hundred of their Basran comrades were informed and joined them in Nahrawan, numbering reportedly up to 4,000 men. They declared Ali and his followers as unbelievers, and are held to have killed several people who did not share their views.

In the meantime, the arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. They could not agree on any other substantive matters and the process collapsed. Ali denounced the conduct of Abu Musa and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s lead arbitrator Amr ibn al-As as contrary to the Qur&#x27;an and the , and rallied his supporters for a renewed war against Mu&#x27;awiya. He invited the Kharijites to join him as before. They refused, pending his acknowledgement of having gone astray and his repentance. Seeing no chance of reconciliation, Ali decided to depart for Syria without them. On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites&#x27; murder of a traveler, which then was followed by murder of his envoy, who had been sent to investigate. He was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first. After the Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers, Ali&#x27;s men attacked their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the Battle of Nahrawan (July 658), in which al-Rasibi and most of his supporters were slain. Around 1,200 Kharijites surrendered and were spared. The bloodshed sealed the split of the Kharijites from Ali&#x27;s followers, and they continued to launch insurrections against the caliphate. Five small Kharijite revolts following Nahrawan, involving about 200 men each, were suppressed during Ali&#x27;s rule. The Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali&#x27;s assassination by the Kharijite dissident Ibn Muljim. The latter killed Ali with a poisoned sword while Ali was leading morning prayers on 26 January 661 in the Great Mosque of Kufa.

== Later history ==
===Under Mu&#x27;awiya===
The accession of Mu&#x27;awiya, the original enemy of the Kharijites, to the caliphate in August 661 provided the new impetus for Kharijite rebellion. Those Kharijites at Nahrawan who had been unwilling to fight Ali and had left the battlefield, rebelled against Mu&#x27;awiya. Under the leadership of Farwa ibn Nawfal al-Ashja&#x27;i of the Banu Murra, some 500 of them attacked Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s camp at Nukhayla (a place outside Kufa) where he was taking the Kufans&#x27; oath of allegiance. In the ensuing battle, the Kharijites repelled the initial sortie by Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s troops, but were eventually defeated and most of them killed. Seven more Kufan Kharijite uprisings, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 20 and 400, were defeated by the governor al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba. The best known of these revolts was that of al-Mustawrid ibn Ullafa, who was recognized as caliph by the Kufan Kharijites in 663. With about 300 followers, he left Kufa and moved to Behrasir. There, he confronted the deputy governor Simak ibn Ubayd al-Absi and invited him to denounce Uthman and Ali &quot;who had made innovations in the religion and denied the holy book&quot;. Simak refused and al-Mustawrid, instead of engaging him directly, decided to exhaust and fragment Simak&#x27;s forces by forcing them into pursuit. Moving onto Madhar near Basra, al-Mustawrid was overtaken by a 300-strong advance party of Simak&#x27;s forces. Although al-Mustawrid was able to withstand this small force, he fled again toward Kufa when the main body of Simak&#x27;s forces, under the command of Ma&#x27;qil ibn Qays, arrived. Eluding Ma&#x27;qil&#x27;s advance guard of 600 men, al-Mustawrid led a surprise attack on Ma&#x27;qil&#x27;s main force, destroying it. The advance guard returned in the meantime and attacked the Kharijites from the rear. Nearly all of them were slain.

Kufan Kharijism died out around 663, and Basra became the center of Kharijite disturbances. Ziyad ibn Abihi and his son Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, who successively became governors of Iraq, dealt harshly with the Kharijites, and five Kharijite revolts, usually involving around 70 men, were suppressed. Notable among these was that of the cousins Qarib ibn Murra al-Azdi and Zuhhaff ibn Zahr al-Tayyi. In 672/673 they rebelled in Basra with a 70-strong band. They are reported to have been involved in the random killing () of people in the streets and mosques of Basra before being cornered in a house, where they were eventually killed and their bodies crucified. Afterward, Ziyad is reported to have severely persecuted their followers. Ibn Ziyad jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly denounced him. Between their successive reigns, Ziyad and his son are said to have killed 13,000 Kharijites. As a result of these repressive measures, some of the Kharijites abandoned military action, adopting political quietism and concealing their religious beliefs. Of the quietists, the best known was Abu Bilal Mirdas ibn Udayya al-Tamimi. One of the earliest Kharijites who had seceded at Siffin, he was held in the highest esteem by the Basran quietists. Provoked by the torture and murder of a Kharijite woman by Ibn Ziyad, Abu Bilal abandoned Basra and revolted in 680/681 with 40 men. Shortly after defeating a 2,000-strong Basran force in Ahwaz, he fell to a larger army of 3,000 or 4,000 in Fars in southern Persia. His fate is said to have aroused the quietists and contributed to the increased Kharijite militancy in the subsequent period.

===Second Fitna===
After the death of Mu&#x27;awiya in 680, civil war ensued over leadership of the Muslim community. The people of the Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son and successor, Yazid. The Mecca-based Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, a son of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, was the most prominent Hejazi opponent of Yazid. When Yazid sent an army to suppress the rebellion in 683 and Mecca was besieged, Kharijites from Basra reinforced Ibn al-Zubayr. After Yazid&#x27;s death in November, Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph and publicly condemned Uthman&#x27;s murder. Both acts prompted the Kharijites to abandon his cause. The majority, including Nafi ibn al-Azraq and Najda ibn Amir al-Hanafi, went to Basra, while the remainder left for the Yamama, in central Arabia, under the leadership of Abu Talut Salim ibn Matar. In the meantime, Ibn Ziyad was expelled by tribal chiefs in Basra, where inter-tribal strife ensued. Ibn al-Azraq and other militant Kharijites took over the city, killed the deputy left by Ibn Ziyad and freed 140 Kharijites from prison. Soon afterwards, the Basrans recognized Ibn al-Zubayr, who appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma&#x27;mar as the city&#x27;s governor. Umar drove out Ibn al-Azraq&#x27;s men from Basra and they escaped to Ahwaz.

====Azariqa====

From Ahwaz, Ibn al-Azraq raided Basra&#x27;s suburbs. His followers are called Azariqa after their leader, and are described in the sources as the most fanatic of the Kharijite groups, for they approved the doctrine of : indiscriminate killing of the non-Kharijite Muslims, including their women and children. An army sent against them by the Zubayrid governor of Basra in early 685 defeated the Azariqa, and Ibn al-Azraq was killed. The Azariqa chose Ubayd Allah ibn Mahuz as their new leader, regrouped, forced the Zubayrid army to retreat, and resumed their raids. After more defeats, Ibn al-Zubayr deployed his most able commander, Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, against the Azariqa. Muhallab defeated them at the battle of Sillabra in May 686 and killed Ibn Mahuz. The Azariqa retreated to Fars. In late 686, Muhallab discontinued his campaign as he was sent to rein in the pro-Alid ruler of Kufa, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, and was afterward appointed governor of Mosul to defend against possible Umayyad attacks from Syria. The Azariqa plundered al-Mada&#x27;in and then besieged Isfahan, but were defeated. They fled and eventually regrouped in Kirman. Reinvigorated by a new leader, Qatari ibn al-Fuja&#x27;a, the Azariqa attacked Basra&#x27;s environs afterward and Muhallab was redeployed to suppress them. Although the Azariqa were not dislodged from Fars and Kirman, Muhallab prevented their advance into Iraq. Qatari minted his own coins and adopted the caliphal title (commander of the faithful). After the Umayyads reconquered Iraq from the Zubayrids in 691, Umayyad princes took over the command from Muhallab, but were dealt severe defeats by the Azariqa. In 694 the commander Hajjaj ibn Yusuf was appointed governor of Iraq and reinstated Muhallab to lead the war against the Azariqa. Muhallab forced their retreat to Kirman, where they split into two groups and were subsequently destroyed in 698–699.

====Najdat====

During his time in Ahwaz, Najda broke with Ibn al-Azraq over the latter&#x27;s extremist ideology. Najda, with his followers, moved to the Yamama, the homeland of his Banu Hanifa tribe. He became leader of Abu Talut&#x27;s Kharijite faction, which became known as the Najdat after him. Najda took control of Bahrayn, repulsing a 14,000-strong Zubayrid army deployed against him. His lieutenant, Atiyya ibn al-Aswad, captured Oman from the local Julanda rulers, though the latter reasserted their control after a few months. Najda seized Hadramawt and Yemen in 687 and later captured Ta&#x27;if, a town close to Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s capital Mecca, leaving the latter cornered in the Hejaz, as Najda controlled most of Arabia. Not long after, his followers became disillusioned with him for his alleged correspondence with the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik, irregular pay to his soldiers, his refusal to punish a soldier who had consumed wine, and his release of a captive granddaughter of caliph Uthman. He was thus deposed for having gone astray and subsequently executed in 691. Atiyya had already broken from Najda and moved to Sistan in eastern Persia, and was later killed there or in Sind. In Sistan, his followers split into various sects, including the Atawiyya and the Ajarida. In Arabia, Abu Fudayk Abd Allah ibn Thawr took over the leadership of the Najdat and defeated several Zubayrid and later Umayyad attacks. He was eventually killed along with 6,000 followers in 692 by Umayyad forces in Bahrayn. Politically exterminated, the Najdat retreated into obscurity and disappeared around the tenth century.

===Moderate Kharijites and their fragmentation===
According to the heresiographers&#x27; accounts, the original Kharijites split into four principal groups (; the mother sects of all the later Kharijites sects), during the Second Fitna. A moderate group, headed by Abd Allah ibn Saffar (or Asfar) and Abd Allah ibn Ibad, disagreed with the radical Azariqa and Najdat on the question of rebellion and separation from the non-Kharijites. Ibn Saffar and Ibn Ibad then disagreed amongst themselves as to the faith of the non-Kharijites, and thus came the two other sects: the Sufriyya and Ibadiyya. All the other uncategorized Kharijite subgroups are considered offshoots of the Sufriyya. In this scheme, the Kharijites of the Jazira region (north-western Iraq), including the ascetic Salih ibn Mussarih and the tribal leader Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani are associated with the Sufriyya, as well as the revolt of Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani during the Third Fitna (744–750). After Ibn Ibad&#x27;s death, the Ibadiyya are considered to have been led into the late Umayyad period successively by Jabir ibn Zayd and Abu Ubayda Muslim ibn Abi Karima. Jabir, a respected scholar and traditionist, had friendly relations with Abd al-Malik and Hajjaj. Following the death of Abd al-Malik, relations between the Ibadiyya leaders and Hajjaj deteriorated, as the former became inclined towards activism (). Hajjaj consequently exiled some of them to Oman and imprisoned others. Abu Ubayda, who was released after the death of Hajjaj in 714, became the next leader of the Ibadiyya. After unsuccessfully attempting to win over the Umayyad caliphs to the Ibadi doctrine, he sent missionaries to propagate the doctrine in different parts of the empire. Almost simultaneously, the Sufriyya also spread into North Africa and southern Arabia through missionary activity. Through absorption into the Ibadiyya, the Sufriyya eventually became extinct. Ibadi sources too are more or less in line with this scheme, where the Ibadiyya appear as the true successors of the original Medinese community and the early, pre-Second-Fitna Kharijites, though Ibn Ibad does not feature prominently and Jabir is asserted as the leader of the movement following Abu Bilal Mirdas.

Modern historians consider Ibn Saffar to be a legendary figure, and assert that the Sufriyya and Ibadiyya sects did not exist during the seventh century. The heresiographers, whose aim was to categorize the divergent beliefs of the Kharijites, most likely invented the Sufriyya to accommodate those groups who did not fit neatly anywhere else. As such, there was only one moderate Kharijite current, which might have been called &quot;Sufri&quot;. According to the historian Keith Lewinstein, the term probably originated with the pious early Kharijites because of their pale-yellow appearance () caused by excessive worship. The moderates condemned the militancy of the Azariqa and Najdat, but otherwise lacked a set of concrete doctrines. Jabir and Abu Ubayda may have been prominent figures in the moderate movement. The moderates further split into the true Sufriyya and Ibadiyya only during the eighth century, with the main difference being tribal affiliations rather than doctrinal differences.

During the Second Fitna, the moderates remained inactive. However, in the mid-690s they also started militant activities in response to persecution by Hajjaj. The first of their revolts was led in 695 by Ibn Musarrih, and ended in defeat and Ibn Musarrih&#x27;s death. Afterward, this Kharijite group became a major threat to Kufa and its suburbs under Shabib. With a small army of a few hundred warriors, Shabib defeated several thousands-strong Umayyad armies in 695–696, looted Kufa&#x27;s treasury and occupied al-Mada&#x27;in. From his base in al-Mada&#x27;in, Shabib moved to capture Kufa. Hajjaj had already requested Syrian troops from Abd al-Malik, who sent a 4,000-strong army which defeated Shabib outside Kufa. Shabib drowned in a river during his flight, his band was destroyed, but the Kharijites continued to maintain a presence in the Jazira.

====Sufriyya====
Distinct Sufriyya and Ibadiyya sects are attested from the early eighth century in North Africa and Oman. The two differed in association with different tribal groups and competed for popular support. During the last days of the Umayyad empire, a major Sufri revolt erupted in Iraq in 744. It was at first led by Sa&#x27;id ibn Bahdal al-Shaybani, and after his death from plague, Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani. Joined by many more Sufriyya from other parts of the empire, he captured Kufa in April 745 and later Wasit, which had replaced Kufa as the regional capital under Hajjaj. At this stage even some Umayyad officials, including two sons of former caliphs (Sulayman, son of Hisham and Abd Allah, son of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz), recognized him as caliph and joined his ranks. Dahhak captured Mosul, but was killed by the forces of the Caliph Marwan II in 746. His successor, Shayban ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Yashkuri, was driven out from Mosul by Marwan II and fled to Fars to join the Alid leader Abd Allah ibn Mu&#x27;awiya, who ruled in opposition to the Umayyads. Attacked there by the Umayyads, they dispersed and Shayban fled to Oman, where he was killed by the local leaders around 751. Under the Abbasids, who had toppled the Umayyads in 750, Sufri revolts in the eastern parts of the empire continued for almost two centuries, though at a small scale and were easily put down. However, in revolts led by Abd al-Hamid al-Bajali in 866–877 and by Harun ibn Abd Allah al-Bajali in 880–896, the Kharijites gained control of northern Mesopotamia from the Abbasids and collected taxes.

By the mid-8th century, the quietist Kharijites appeared in North Africa. They were mostly of Berber origin and were recruited through missionary activity. With the Ibadi–Sufri distinction emergent in this period, the groups with no Ibadi affiliation were associated with the Sufriyya. Around 740, the Sufriyya under the leadership of Maysara al-Matghari had revolted in Tangiers and captured the city from the Umayyads. They marched onto the provincial capital Kairouan, but were unable to capture it. Nevertheless, Sufri disturbances in North Africa continued throughout the Umayyad period. Around 750, the Sufri Midrarids established a dynasty in Sijilmasa, in modern Morocco. The dynasty survived until the Fatimid capture of the city in 909. Nonetheless, the Midrarids continued governing the city under intermittent Fatimid suzerainty until 976. The North African Sufriyya later disappeared, and their remnants were absorbed into the Ibadiyya around the tenth or 11th century.

====Ibadiyya====
In the early eighth century, a proto-Ibadi movement emerged from the Basran moderates. Missionaries were sent to propagate the doctrine in different parts of the empire including Oman, Yemen, Hadramawt, Khurasan, and North Africa. During the final years of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Ibadi propaganda movement caused several revolts in the periphery of the empire, though the leaders in Basra adopted the policy of (also called ); concealing beliefs so as to avoid persecution.

In 745, Abd Allah ibn Yahya al-Kindi established the first Ibadi state in Hadramawt, and captured Yemen in 746. His lieutenant, Abu Hamza Mukhtar ibn Aws al-Azdi, later conquered Mecca and Medina. The Umayyads defeated and killed Abu Hamza and Ibn Yahya in 748 and the first Ibadi state collapsed. An Ibadi state was established in Oman in 750 after the fall of Abu Yahya, but fell to the Abbasids in 752. It was followed by the establishment of another Ibadi state in 793, which survived for a century until the Abbasid recapture of Oman in 893. Abbasid influence in Oman was mostly nominal, and Ibadi imams continued to wield considerable power. Around a century later, Ibadi leader al-Khalil ibn Shathan al-Kharusi () reasserted control over the central Oman, whereas his successor Rashid ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Yahmadi () drove the then Abbasid patrons Buyids out of the coastal region, thereby restoring the Ibadi control of Oman. Internal splits led to fall of the third Ibadi imamate in the late 12th century. Ibadi imamates were reestablished in subsequent centuries. Ibadis form the majority of the Omani population to date.

Ibadi missionary activity met with considerable success in North Africa. In 757, Ibadis seized Tripoli and captured Kairouan the next year. Driven out by an Abbasid army in 761, Ibadi leaders founded a state, which became known as the Rustamid dynasty, in Tahart. It was overthrown in 909 by the Fatimids. Ibadi communities continue to exist today in the Nafusa Mountains in northwestern Libya, Djerba island in Tunisia and the M&#x27;zab valley in Algeria. In East Africa they are found in Zanzibar. Ibadi missionary activity also reached Persia, India, Egypt, Sudan, Spain and Sicily, although Ibadi communities in these regions disappeared over time. The total numbers of the Ibadis in Oman and Africa are estimated to be around 2.5 million and 200,000 respectively.

==Beliefs and practices==
The Kharijites did not have a uniform and coherent set of doctrines. Different sects and individuals held different views. Based on these divergences, heresiographers have listed more than a dozen minor Kharijite sects, in addition to the four main sects discussed above.

===Governance===
In addition to their insistence on rule according to the Qur&#x27;an, the view common to all Kharijite groups was that any Muslim was qualified to become caliph, regardless of origin, if he had the credentials of belief and piety. They rejected Qurayshite descent or close kinship with Muhammad as a prerequisite for the office, a view espoused by most Muslims at the time. This differs from the position of both Sunnis, who accepted the leadership of those in power provided that they were Qurayshite, and Shi&#x27;a, who asserted that the leadership belonged to Ali and his descendants. The Kharijites held that the first four caliphs had not been elected for their Qurayshite descent or kinship with Muhammad, but because they were among the most eminent and qualified Muslims for the position, and hence were all legitimate caliphs. In particular, they had a high regard for Abu Bakr () and Umar () as, according to them, they governed justly. Uthman, on the other hand, had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the latter half of his caliphate and was thus liable to be killed or deposed, whereas Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed to the arbitration with Mu&#x27;awiya. In contrast to the Umayyad idea that their rule was ordained by God, the Kharijite idea of leadership lacked any divine sanctioning; only correct attitude and piety granted the leader authority over the community. If the leader committed a sin and deviated from the right path or failed to manage Muslims&#x27; affairs through justice and consultation, he was obliged to acknowledge his mistake and repent, or else he forfeited his right to rule and was subject to deposition. In the view of the Azariqa and the Najdat, Muslims had the duty to revolt against such a ruler.

Almost all Kharijite groups considered the position of a leader (imam) to be necessary. Many Kharijite leaders adopted the title of , which was usually reserved for caliphs. An exception are the Najdat, who, as a means of survival, abandoned the requirement of war against non-Kharijites after their defeat in 692, and rejected that the imamate was an obligatory institution. The historian Patricia Crone has described the Najdat&#x27;s philosophy as an early form of anarchism.

===Other doctrines===
The Kharijites also asserted that faith without accompanying deeds is useless, and that anyone who commits a major sin is an unbeliever (; pl. ) and must repent to restore the true faith. However, the Kharijite notion of unbelief () differed from the mainstream Muslim definition, which understood a as someone who was a non-Muslim. To the Kharijites, implied a defective Muslim, or pseudo-Muslim, who rejected true Islam. The Azariqa held a more extreme position that such unbelievers were in fact polytheists and apostates who could not reenter Islam and could be killed, along with their women and children. Intermarriage between the Kharijites and such unbelievers was forbidden in the Azariqa doctrine. The Najdat allowed marriages with non-Kharijites. Of the moderates, the Sufriyya and Bayhasiyya considered all non-Kharijite Muslims as unbelievers, but also abstained from taking up arms against them, unless necessary, and allowed intermarriage with them. The Ibadiyya, on the other hand, did not declare the non-Kharijites as polytheists or unbelievers in the general sense, rather as hypocrites (), or ungrateful for God&#x27;s blessings (). They also permitted marriages outside their own sect.

The Azariqa and Najdat held that since the Umayyad rulers, and all non-Kharijites in general, were unbelievers, it was unlawful to continue living under their rule (), for that was in itself an act of unbelief. It was thus obligatory to emigrate, in emulation of Muhammad&#x27;s Hijra to Medina, and establish a legitimate dominion of their own (). The Azariqa prohibited the practice of dissimulation of their faith () and branded non-activist Kharijites (i.e. those who did not emigrate to their camp) as unbelievers. The Najdat allowed and quietism, but labeled their practitioners as hypocrites. The Islamicist Montgomery Watt attributes this moderation of the Najdat stance to practical necessities which they encountered while governing Arabia, as the administration of a large area required flexibility and allowance for human imperfection. The Sufriyya and Ibadiyya held that while the establishment of a legitimate dominion was desirable, it was legal to employ and continue living among the non-Kharijites if rebellion was not possible.

The Kharijites espoused that all Muslims were equals, regardless of ethnicity and advocated for equal status of the (sing. ; non-Arab, free Muslims of conquered lands, especially Iraq and Persia) with the Arabs. The Najdat chose a , a fruit seller named Thabit, as their leader after Najda&#x27;s execution. This choice, however, conflicted with their feelings of ethnic solidarity and they soon asked him to step down and choose an Arab leader for them; he chose Abu Fudayk. The leader of the Azariqa, Ibn al-Azraq, is said to have been the son of a of Greek origin. The imams of the North African Kharijites from 740 onwards were all non-Arabs. The Kharijites also advocated for the equality of women with men. On the basis of women fighting alongside Muhammad, the Kharijites viewed jihad as incumbent upon women. The warrior and poet Layla bint Tarif is a famous example. Shabib&#x27;s wife Ghazala participated in his battles against the troops of Hajjaj. The Kharijites had a scrupulous attitude towards non-Muslims, respecting their dhimmi (protected) status more seriously than others.

Some of the Kharijites rejected the punishment of adultery with stoning, which is prescribed in other Islamic legal schools. Although the Qur&#x27;an does not prescribe this penalty, Muslims of other sects hold that such a verse existed in the Qur&#x27;an, which was then abrogated. A hadith is ascribed to Umar, asserting the existence of this verse in the Qur&#x27;an. These Kharijites rejected the authenticity of such a verse. The heresiographer al-Ash&#x27;ari attributed this position to the Azariqa, who held a strict scripturalist position in legal matters (i.e. following only the Qur&#x27;an and rejecting commonly held views if they had no Qur&#x27;anic basis), and thus also refused to enforce legal punishment on slanderers when the slander was targeted at a male. The Azariqa instituted the practice of testing the faith of new recruits (), which is said to have involved giving them a prisoner to kill. It was either an occasional practice, as held by Watt, or a later distortion by the heresiographers, as held by Lewinstein. One of the Kharijite groups also refused to recognize the sura (Qur&#x27;anic chapter) of as being an original part of the Qur&#x27;an, for they considered its content to be worldly and frivolous.

==Poetry==
Many Kharijites were well-versed in traditional Arabic eloquence and poetry, which the orientalist Giorgio Levi Della Vida attributes to the majority of their early leaders being from Bedouin stock. The sermons and poems of many Kharijite leaders were compiled into collections (diwans). Kharijite poetry is mainly concerned with religious beliefs, with piety and activism, martyrdom, selling life to God (), and afterlife being some of the most prominent themes, though the themes of heroism and courage are also evident. Referring to his rebellion, Abu Bilal Mirdas said: &quot;Fear of God and the dread of the fire made me go out, and selling my soul for which has no price [paradise]&quot;.

Some poems encouraged militant activism. Imran ibn Hittan, whom the Arabist Michael Cooperson calls the greatest Kharijite poet, sang after Abu Bilal&#x27;s death: &quot;Abū Bilāl has increased my disdain for this life; and strengthened my love for the khurūj [rebellion]&quot;. The poet Abu&#x27;l-Wazi al-Rasibi addressed Ibn al-Azraq, before the latter became activist, with the lines: 

The government was often labelled as tyrannical and obedience to it was criticized. The Kharijite poet Isa ibn Fatik al-Khatti thus sang: 

Many poems were written to eulogize fallen Kharijite activists, and thus represent the romanticized version of actual historical events. The Muhakkima are thus valorized and remembered at many places. The poet Aziz ibn al-Akhnas al-Ta&#x27;i eulogized them in the following lines: 

Similarly, Ali&#x27;s assassin Ibn Muljam was exalted by the poet Ibn Abi Mayyas al-Muradi in the following: 

Kharijite poetry has survived mainly in the non-Kharijite sources, and hence may have been subject to alteration by its transmitters. Nevertheless, the historian Fred Donner believes that Kharijite poetry may have suffered a lesser and &quot;different kind&quot; of interpolation than the historical accounts about the Kharijites. According to Hagemann, poetry is seemingly &quot;the only genuinely Khārijite material&quot; in existence. A modern compilation of Kharijite poetry was published by Ihsan Abbas in 1974.

==Tribal affiliations==

Most Kharijite leaders in the Umayyad period were Arabs. Of these, the northern Arabs were the overwhelming majority. Only six or seven revolts led by a southern Arab have been reported, their leaders hailing from the tribes of Tayy, Azd, and Kinda. Among the northern Arabs, the Rabi&#x27;a group produced most of the Kharijite leaders. Of the 48 identified Rabi&#x27;a leaders, 46 were from the Bakr ibn Wa&#x27;il branch (17 from the Shayban sub-tribe, 12 from Yashkur, five from Hanifa, and 12 from other sub-tribes). Among the northern Arab Mudar group, the Tamim accounted for the majority, with 16 of the 21 Mudar leaders hailing from the tribe; the other leaders were from the Qays. Three or four revolts were led by a or a Berber.

The Rabi&#x27;a were associated with the early Jaziran Kharijites (whom the sources label as Sufriyya), and the eighth-century Sufriyya, though the Hanifa subtribe of the Rabi&#x27;a were mainly represented in the Azariqa and the Najdat. The Tamim were also represented among the early Jaziran Kharijites, as well as the Azariqa. The southerners, especially the Kinda and Azd, were drawn to the Ibadiyya in the eighth century. Nonetheless, it was individuals, rather than whole tribes, who joined the Kharijite ranks, the majority being younger or otherwise of obscure origins. Few, if any, of the (tribal nobility) were among them. The historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship considers the Rabi&#x27;a affinity to Kharijism as rooted in their lower military and social status. They were considered by the Umayyad administration as being poor military leaders, and otherwise backward. Their relatively late conversion to Islam also resulted in them finding only low-ranking military roles, as the higher positions had already been filled by men from other tribes. As such, Blankinship views Kharijism as a political protest cloaked in religious zeal, and considers the Kharijites as no more than rebels. Watt has suggested that the northern Arabs, having had no experience of central administration and government, were more susceptible to Kharijism as opposed to the southerners. The culture and collective thinking of the latter was influenced by the ancient kingdoms of South Arabia, where kings were seen as charismatic leaders with superhuman qualities. As a result, they were drawn more to Shia Islam than to Kharijism.

===Historical analysis===
According to Rudolf Ernst Brünnow (1858–1917), the first academic historian to systematically study the Kharijites, the supported the arbitration proposal because, as pious believers in the Qur&#x27;an, they felt obliged to respond to the call of making the Qur&#x27;an the arbitrator. The people who objected to the treaty were Bedouin Arabs, and hence separate from the who had settled in Kufa and Basra following the wars of conquest. They had devoted themselves to the cause of Islam and perceived the arbitration by two people as an acute religious injustice, which drove them into secession and later into open rebellion.

The orientalist Julius Wellhausen (1844–1918) criticized Brünnow&#x27;s hypothesis because all Basrans and Kufans of that time were Bedouin, and since Brünnow regards these Bedouin as pious anyway, it distinguishes them little from the . Hence, the same group of people first favored and then rejected the arbitration. They initially accepted arbitration of the Qur&#x27;an, but some later realized and acknowledged this was a mistake, repented, and demanded the same from Ali. In Wellhausen&#x27;s view, the Kharijites thus emanated from the . He argues that the Kharijite dogmatism was based on enforcement of the rule of God on Earth—an otherwise Islamic principle, taken too far by the Kharijites: &quot;By tightening onto the principles of Islam, they are taken beyond Islam itself&quot;. They gave precedence to it over the integrity of the community as it was openly opposing God&#x27;s commands in their view. Wellhausen rejects the notion of the Kharijites as anarchists, for they strove to build their own pious communities. But their goals were impractical and hostile to culture.

According to Donner, the might have been motivated by fears that the arbitration could result in them being held accountable for their involvement in Uthman&#x27;s murder. Analyzing early Kharijite poetry, Donner has further suggested that the Kharijites were pious believers who often expressed their piety in militant activism. Their religious worldview was based on Qur&#x27;anic values, and they may have been the &quot;real true believers&quot; and &quot;authentic representatives of the earliest community&quot; of Muslims, instead of a divergent sect as presented by the sources. Their militancy may have been caused by the expectation of the imminent end of the world, for the level of violence in their revolts and their extreme longing for martyrdom cannot be explained solely on the basis of belief in the afterlife. In Donner&#x27;s view, it rather implies a level of urgency.

Several modern historians also reject the traditional view that Kharijism originated at Siffin as a militant protest to the arbitration, without having any prior causes. According to Crone, the story of the dispute over the arbitration is inadequate, and perhaps there was more to the dispute between Ali and the Kharijites than reported in the sources. G. R. Hawting has suggested that the use of the slogan by the Kharijites to denounce the arbitration is a later reworking by the Muslim sources. In his view, the Kharijites originally espoused the slogan, amid the religious disputes among the Muslims over the scriptural authority, in order to reject the authority of the and the oral law in favor of the Qur&#x27;an.

The historians M. A. Shaban and Martin Hinds consider socioeconomic factors the root of Kharijite rebellions. Rejecting the notion that the were the Qur&#x27;an readers, Shaban holds that they were villagers who had gained status in Iraq during the caliphate of Umar for their loyalty to the state during the Wars of Apostasy that followed Muhammad&#x27;s death, and were thus awarded the trusteeship of the fertile lands of Iraq. They were dissatisfied with the economic policies of Uthman and saw Ali&#x27;s caliphate as a means of restoring their status. When he agreed to talks with Mu&#x27;awiya they felt their status threatened and consequently rebelled. According to Shaban, the main role in forcing Ali to accept the arbitration was not played by the but by the tribal chiefs, as the latter group had benefited from the policies of Uthman. They were not enthusiastic supporters of Ali, and considered the prospect of continued war as contrary to their interests. In Shaban&#x27;s thesis, the Kharijite rebellions after Siffin also had economic origins. In Hinds&#x27;s view, the status of the was based on Umar&#x27;s principle of (early conversion to Islam) and their participation in the early conquests. They hoped that Ali would continue Umar&#x27;s system and accordingly backed him. They supported the arbitration because they assumed it would bring an end to the war, with Ali retaining the caliphate and returning to Medina, leaving the administration of Iraq in the hands of the local population, including themselves. They denounced the arbitration upon realizing that Ali was not recognized as caliph in the document, and that the arbiters could use their own judgment in addition to the Qur&#x27;anic principles.

In the view of Watt, it was neither religious grounds, nor economic factors that gave rise to the Kharijites. His view is that Kharijism was the nomadic response to the newly established organized state. The nomads, accustomed to the independent lifestyle of the desert, suddenly found their freedoms curtailed by the powerful bureaucracy of a &quot;vast administrative machine&quot;. The rebellion at Siffin was thus an expression of this rejection of state control. From then on, they strove to recreate the pre-Islamic tribal structure and Bedouin lifestyle, on a religious basis. The historian Hugh N. Kennedy describes the Kharijites as ultra-pious people who were dissatisfied with perceived laxity in religion on the part of other people and the state, and felt that the religion was being exploited for personal gains. They thus came to reject both the traditional tribal society and the urban lifestyle that the state had forced upon the people by relocating them to the garrison towns. The movement was an attempt to find a third way: an independent, egalitarian, nomadic society based on unadulterated religion. The Islamicist Chase F. Robinson describes the Jaziran Kharijites as disgruntled army commanders with tribal followings, who adopted Kharijism to provide a religious cover to their banditry.

Hagemann and Verkinderen differentiate between intellectual and militant Kharijism. In their view, the former was concerned with the rule of God and rejection of corrupt government. The latter was not always a protest of the former as the sources assert; in many cases it had variety of causes such as increased taxation, state control of resources, and discrimination against the . They explain the diversity of views by other historians as stemming from the historians&#x27; focus on one particular group of Kharijites with the assumption that it represented the Kharijite movement in general.

In the long term, the activism of the militant Kharijites and their consistent suppression by the government resulted in their disappearance. No militant Kharijite sect survived beyond the 12th century. The quietists&#x27; more nuanced and practical approach, in which they preferred over , engaged in organized and sustainable military campaigns and institution-building, as opposed to aggressive pursuit of martyrdom, all contributed to their survival.

===Contribution to Muslim theology===
According to Della Vida, despite its popular outlook, the Kharijite movement was not devoid of intellectualism. Wellhausen has argued that Kharijite dogmatism influenced the development of the mainstream Muslim theology, in particular their debates in relation to faith and deeds, and legitimate leadership. In Della Vida&#x27;s view, the Mu&#x27;tazila, a rationalist school of thought in early Islam that originated in the eighth century, in particular were likely influenced by them. The influence on the mainstream dogma could have been direct adaptation of some Kharijite ideas, or that Kharijite views confronted mainstream theologians to the questions of faith.

In the eighth and ninth centuries, Kharijite, especially Ibadi, theologians contributed to the debates concerning the problems of divine unity versus multiplicity of divine attributes, and predestination versus free will. Concerning divine attributes, they agreed with the Mu&#x27;tazila in that the attributes of essence (attributes that God must have; e.g. knowledge and power) are different from the attributes of act (those that exist outside of him; such as creation and speech), but held that divine will was an attribute of essence. As such God wills from eternity, which means that everything is predetermined. Consequently, they rejected the doctrine of human free will. According to Wilferd Madelung, they were likely the first group to hold the view of the divine will being an attribute of essence, which was eventually adopted by the Sunni theologians. The Kharijite theologians also rejected anthropomorphist theology, and agreed with the Mu&#x27;tazila on the created nature of the Qur&#x27;an.

The Kharijites were the first group to declare other Muslims , a designation previously reserved for non-Muslims. The influence of this led to the transformation of the concept of in later Sunni theology; in addition to unbelief, acquired the meaning of heterodoxy and heresy. In the view of Watt, the Kharijite insistence on the rule according to the Qur&#x27;an prevented the early Muslim empire from turning into a purely secular Arab state. The rest of the Muslims eventually adopted this view that all political and social life of the Muslims should be based on the divine law (Sharia) derived from the Qur&#x27;an, although they added to its sources the of Muhammad.

===Traditional Muslim view===
The Kharijites drew condemnation by traditional Muslim historians and heresiographers of subsequent centuries. In order to make clearer the distinction between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, the mainstream sources attempted to portray the Kharijites as a monolithic, identifiable group, with the characteristics and practices of the most radical sect, the Azariqa, being presented as representative of the whole. The term , which originally meant those who went out of Kufa to gather at Nahrawan during the time of Ali, was subsequently understood as &#x27;outsiders&#x27;—those who went out of the fold of the Muslim community—rebels, and brutal extremists.

The non-Kharijite Muslims attribute several hadiths to Muhammad, prophesying the emergence of the Kharijites. After the Battle of Hunayn in 630, a man known as Dhu al-Khuwaysira is reported to have accused Muhammad of unjustly distributing the spoils. Umar reportedly asked for Muhammad&#x27;s permission to kill the man, but the latter declined, saying: A similar hadith attributed to Muhammad is: Other hadiths with themes of &quot;arrow through the target&quot; or &quot;the Qur&#x27;an not going beyond throats&quot; are reported. Although the hadiths do not name the Kharijites or any particular Kharijite individual, they are generally viewed by non-Kharijite Muslims as references to the Kharijites. Some hadiths of this type encouraged other Muslims to eliminate the Kharijites.

===Modern times===
In the modern era, many Muslim theologians and clerics have compared the beliefs and actions of modern Islamist extremists such as the Islamic State, al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan to those of the Kharijites, labeling them as modern or neo-Kharijites. In particular, the groups are alleged to share the militant Kharijites&#x27; anarchist and radical approach, whereby self-described Muslims are declared unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death. However, Islamic State and al-Qaeda preachers reject being compared to the Kharijites, instead calling themselves the true Muslims and their opponents lax Muslims. The intended effect of these accusations is usually to deny the Islamists any widespread public support, given the very unpopular image of the Kharijites among the Muslims. The comparison is criticized by modern historians, who argue that the socio-political context and environment giving rise to the modern militants differs widely from that of the Kharijites to warrant any justifiable comparison between the two, and that such comparisons often result from a superficial understanding of the doctrines of either group.

Although most modern Arab historians have been critical of the Kharijites, some have presented a more favorable view. The latter group argue that the Kharijites rebelled against economic injustice and had valid grievances. They compare the Kharijite ideals of ethnic and gender equality with the modern equivalents of these values and consider them representatives of proto-democratic thought in early Islam. Modern Ibadi scholars have attempted to soften the image of the Kharijites, in order to reconcile their differences with rest of the Muslims. They assert that mainstream Muslim accounts of the Kharijite history are distorted and present the early Kharijites unfairly, as they were simply protesting against injustice. At the same time, Ibadis also protest against being labelled as a Kharijite sect. They associate the term with the Azariqa, Najdat, and the Sufriyya, whom they condemn; the Muhakkima, on the other hand, they hold in high regard. One modern Ibadi author claims that the Muhakkima did not rebel against Ali but only had a difference of opinion with him. It was not Ali who fought them at Nahrawan, but the Kufan nobleman al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays.

<text>Oblomov (, ) is the second novel by Russian writer Ivan Goncharov, first published in 1859. Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is the central character of the novel, portrayed as the ultimate incarnation of the superfluous man, a symbolic character in 19th-century Russian literature. Oblomov is a young, generous nobleman who seems incapable of making important decisions or undertaking any significant actions. Throughout the novel, he rarely leaves his room or bed. In the first 50 pages, he only manages to move from his bed to a chair. 

The novel was popular when it came out, and some of its characters and devices have imprinted on Russian culture and language.

== Creation and publication ==
Goncharov first thought of writing &quot;Oblomov&quot; in the mid-1840s, soon after publishing his first novel &quot;A Common Story&quot;. In 1849 he wrote &quot;Episode from an Unfinished Novel: Oblomov&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a short story that was published in the literary journal &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. At that point Goncharov had just started writing his novel, and &quot;Oblomov&quot; was published ten years later, with &quot;Oblomov&#x27;s Dream&quot; as Chapter 9 in Part 1.

The character that would become Oblomov originally appeared in 1838 in the Maikovs&#x27; handwritten magazine written by Goncharov, as one of the protagonists in &quot;Likhaia bolest&quot;. Nikon Ustinovich Tiazhelemko, or the pre-&quot;Oblomov&quot; Oblomov, was a slothful but rather endearing man whose name evokes in Russian the attribute &quot;heavy&quot; (, tjažólyj) and the expression &quot;slow to move&quot; (, tjažólyj na podʺjóm). The work on &quot;Oblomov&quot; continued for several years after the publication of &quot;Oblomov&#x27;s Dream&quot; but was first interrupted by the death of Goncharov&#x27;s mother, and then his decision to join the around the world voyage of the naval frigate &quot;Pallas&quot;. When &quot;Pallas&quot; finally ended its journey in August 1854 in Russia&#x27;s far east, Goncharov spent another half a year getting acquainted with Siberia and slowly making his way back to St. Petersburg. Although Goncharov was not working on &quot;Oblomov&quot; during his long journey it appears he was thinking about the book, as Oblomov shows up in many of his letters home. When he tried to begin writing again in February 1855, he blamed his delays and inability to write on exhaustion, loss of momentum, and a new and more demanding job as a censor. The summer of 1857 finally found Goncharov, alone in Marienbad, completely exhilarated and writing &quot;Oblomov&quot; in full swing. By the end of August the novel was complete. He spent the following year revising and rewriting the novel until finally, on January 14, 1859, &quot;Oblomov&quot; was published serially in &quot;Otechestvennye zapiski&quot;.

A later edition in 1862 included a number of changes made by Goncharov. An 1887 edition also featured revisions to the 1859 text and was his last approved edition. Scholars do not agree on which text should be considered canonical.

==Plot summary==
The novel focuses on the life of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov. Oblomov is a member of the landed gentry and the son of a member of Russia&#x27;s nineteenth-century landed gentry. Oblomov&#x27;s distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business from his bed.

The first part of the book finds Oblomov in bed one morning. He receives a letter from the manager of his country estate, Oblomovka, explaining that the financial situation is deteriorating and that he must visit to make some major decisions. But Oblomov can barely leave his bedroom, much less journey a thousand miles into the country.

As he sleeps, a dream reveals Oblomov&#x27;s upbringing in Oblomovka. He is never required to work or perform household duties, and his parents constantly pull him from school for vacations and trips or for trivial reasons. In contrast, his friend Andrey Stoltz, born to a German father and a Russian mother, is raised in a strict, disciplined environment, and he is dedicated and hard-working.

Stoltz visits at the end of Part 1, finally rousing Oblomov from sleep. As the story develops, Stoltz introduces Oblomov to a young woman, Olga, and the two fall in love. However, his apathy and fear of moving forward are too great, and she calls off their engagement when it is clear that he will keep delaying their wedding and avoiding putting his affairs in order.

Oblomov is swindled repeatedly by his &quot;friends&quot; Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich, his landlady&#x27;s brother, and Stoltz has to undo the damage each time. The last time, Oblomov ends up living in penury because Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are blackmailing him out of all of his income from the country estate, which lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich to his supervisor. Meanwhile, Olga leaves Russia and visits Paris, where she bumps into Stoltz on the street. The two strike up a romance and end up marrying.

However, not even Oblomov could go through life without at least one moment of self-possession and purpose. When Taranteyev&#x27;s behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him, and finally kicks him out of the house. Sometime before his death he is visited by Stoltz, who had promised to his wife a last attempt at bringing Oblomov back to the world. During this visit Stoltz discovers that Oblomov has married his widowed landlady, Agafia Matvievna, and had a child – named Andrey, after Stoltz. Stoltz realizes that he can no longer hope to reform Oblomov, and leaves. Oblomov spends the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka, continuing to be taken care of by Agafia Matvievna as he used to be taken care of as a child. She can prepare the food he likes, cares for the household, and makes sure that Oblomov does not have a single worrisome thought.

By then Oblomov had already accepted his fate, and during the conversation he mentions &quot;Oblomovitis&quot; as the real cause of his demise. Oblomov dies in his sleep, finally fulfilling his wish to sleep forever. Stoltz adopts his son upon his death.

==Characters==
* Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is the eponymous character of the novel. Raised to never worry about his education or the running of his inherited estate, Oblomov spends the novel attempting to recreate his childhood idyll. By the beginning of the story, his inactivity and fear of responsibility have led to the disrepair of his estate and personal affairs. Part I of the novel follows Oblomov&#x27;s morning, as he refuses to take care of his estate and apartment in favor of sleeping and dreaming about his childhood home. Only Stoltz can get him out of bed, but cannot convince Oblomov to revisit his estate. Oblomov gradually falls in love with Stoltz&#x27;s friend Olga and the two become engaged as she attempts to continue Stoltz&#x27;s mission of improving Oblomov. Olga eventually breaks off the engagement when she realizes that Oblomov is unable to change his ways. While he sincerely attempts to follow Stoltz&#x27;s and Olga&#x27;s advice throughout the novel, he ultimately resists their changes and lives out the rest of his life with Agafia Matvievna and their children, having never gone back to Oblomovka.
* Andrey Ivanovich Stoltz is Oblomov&#x27;s best friend from childhood, and is married to Olga by the end of the novel. The only child of a German father and Russian mother, Stoltz went to the same school as Oblomov and frequently visited Oblomov&#x27;s family. While Stoltz&#x27;s father instilled ideals of efficiency and practicality, Stoltz&#x27;s mother often attempted to ease her husband&#x27;s lessons by pampering Stoltz and teaching him music. The influence of Stoltz&#x27;s father leaves him a practical and work-oriented man, but his childhood days in Oblomovka cause him to be lifelong friends with Oblomov. Stoltz spends much of the novel attempting to help Oblomov, both by solving Oblomov&#x27;s financial and other problems and trying to mold Oblomov in his image. His efforts center mainly around getting Oblomov to regain control of his estate. Ultimately Stoltz himself handles Oblomovka&#x27;s renovation, modernizing it and investing in new infrastructure. His final attempt to bring Oblomov back to Oblomovka fails when he realizes that Oblomov has married Agafia Matvievna, and instead he adopts Oblomov&#x27;s son upon Oblomov&#x27;s death.
* Olga Ilyinsky is introduced to Oblomov by Stoltz and is included in Stoltz&#x27;s attempts to reform Oblomov. Olga spends much of her time throughout the novel determined to change Oblomov&#x27;s ways. She and Oblomov fall in love, and her efforts seem to be successful for a time, as Oblomov reads more novels and attends more social events. The two become engaged, but Oblomov&#x27;s deep-set fear of moving forward prevent him from taking necessary steps toward actual marriage, and Olga breaks off the engagement. Olga then travels to Paris with her aunt, where she runs into Stoltz. The two fall in love and marry, moving to the Crimea.
* Zakhar is Oblomov&#x27;s servant. He constantly tries to get Oblomov to get his life in order by reminding him about the dues of his estate. He is an ineffective servant but extremely devoted to his master, and he holds the Oblomov family in high esteem. He becomes a beggar after Oblomov&#x27;s death until Stoltz finds and takes care of him.
* Agafia Matvievna is Oblomov&#x27;s widowed landlady, who falls in love with him and holds him in high regard as a nobleman. She is also Ivan Matveyevich&#x27;s sister. At the end of the story, it is revealed to Stoltz that Oblomov and Agafia are married with a son.
* Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are Oblomov&#x27;s &quot;friends&quot;, who repeatedly swindle him. Taranteyev and Ivan end up blackmailing Oblomov out of all of his income from the country estate. This stunt lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich and Taranteyev to his supervisor. When Taranteyev&#x27;s behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him around a bit and finally kicks him out of the house.

==Style==
=== Narrator ===
The narrator of &quot;Oblomov&quot; appears as a rather traditional third-person narrator. In the beginning of the novel he is largely invisible and lets the characters do the talking. As the novel progresses he comes far less neutral and actually begins to not only describe the characters but he begins to judge them, like criticizing Oblomov&#x27;s family for being overly protective of Ilya as a child, or calling Oblomov&#x27;s false friends &quot;parasites&quot;. The narrator&#x27;s strongly developed moralizing tendencies are constantly upset by an equally strong note of ambivalence that undermines his judgements. The narrator seems to be someone who may wish he knew the answers but is honest enough to admit that he does not. Goncharov is eager by the end of the novel to make a distinction between himself and the narrator by making the narrator an invented character. However, Goncharov chooses to reveal the identity of the narrator only when the revelation would not affect our reading of the novel. There are many moments when the narrator reveals himself to be uncharacteristically chatty, digressive, and not entirely &quot;reliable&quot;.

=== Characterizations and depictions ===
Goncharov used a lot of dialogue within his works. Therefore, the characters in &quot;Oblomov&quot; reveal themselves primarily through their own speech, with very limited comments by the author. &quot;The colloquial exchanges here coexist with long passages that characterize the novel&#x27;s inhabitants more directly&quot;.

==Themes==

=== Stages of life ===
Goncharov wrote three novels over the course of his life: &quot;The Same Old Story&quot;, &quot;Oblomov&quot;, and &quot;The Precipice&quot;. Each novel was based heavily on autobiographical material, focusing on different epochs of life – specifically, infancy and childhood as influenced by the mother; then the &quot;awakening of adolescence&quot;; and finally adulthood as associated with St. Petersburg, government work, and marriage. The main characters of all three books share multiple important similarities: their fathers have either been absent or largely insignificant in their upbringings, they rely heavily on their mothers even past childhood, and they travel to St. Petersburg during their university years. Goncharov himself lost his father at the age of seven, and worked in St. Petersburg as a translator after graduating from Moscow State University. Aduev, the protagonist of &quot;The Same Old Story&quot;, also isolates himself from reality and prefers to live within his imagination much like Oblomov does.

With these thematically linked protagonists, Goncharov envisioned &quot;Oblomov&quot; as part of a thematic &quot;trilogy&quot;, fitting between his other two novels. Goncharov imagined his novels as different reflections of a single personality; &quot;they are but one tremendous structure, one mirror reflecting in miniature three epochs: Old Life, Sleep, and Awakening.&quot; Aduev, Oblomov, and Raysky (the protagonist of &quot;The Precipice&quot;) therefore form &quot;but one personality in its successive rebirths.&quot; Oblomov represents the epoch of &quot;Sleep&quot; in Goncharov&#x27;s vision. Yet many literary critics have found Goncharov&#x27;s vision to be lacking. Belinsky and Dobrolyubov, two well-known literary critics who wrote famous reviews of Goncharov&#x27;s works, failed to recognize a larger connection between Oblomov and Goncharov&#x27;s other novels.

==== Childhood ====
Oblomov spends much of his adult life attempting to remain within his childhood, a time that he remembers for its peacefulness and the safety provided by his mother. His memory of childhood in Oblomovka is dominated by its cyclical time, with &quot;births, celebrations, feasts...new faces take the places of the old, baby boys grow into marriageable young men who duly marry and reproduce themselves. Such is the pattern according to which life weaves itself this seamless length of identical fabric to be snipped gently only at the grave itself.&quot; The Oblomovka of his childhood keeps track of time through the cyclical events of birth, death, and natural seasons, relying on the repetition of events to pass through life. Even Oblomov&#x27;s name and patronymic, Ilya Ilyich, reveal him as a repeat of his father instead of just a son. This instilling of contentment through repetition renders Oblomov ill-equipped for the expectations placed on his adulthood in a rapidly changing society.

==== Adulthood ====
Adulthood constantly discourages Oblomov, whose main desire is to retreat into the safety of his childhood sense of time. He attempts to take on jobs and responsibilities for Oblomovka, but upon realizing the tasks these require, he becomes easily defeated and retreats into metaphorical and literal sleep. Even his desire to return to Oblomovka cannot be realized, as the estate has fallen into disarray and has now become a responsibility instead of a safe haven. His main foray into adulthood comes about through Olga, who attempts to motivate him to take on responsibilities out of love for her. Particularly for Oblomov, adulthood means changing his cyclical sense of time to continually look forward instead of back. Yet he remains stuck within his childhood desire for things to stay put; loving Olga means that he does not wish to change her like she wishes to change him, but his sense of time prevents him from thinking of the future, and he therefore cannot progress into adulthood by marrying her.

Stoltz, in contrast, exemplifies society&#x27;s expectations for adulthood in his eagerness to move forward. His own childhood is marked heavily by his father&#x27;s insistence on treating him as an adult and teaching him the importance of accomplishment, which carries into his adulthood. Stoltz, unlike Oblomov, sees his life as a straight line and is therefore driven by the desire to continually move forward.

=== Oblomovism ===
The words &quot;Oblomovism&quot; and &quot;Oblomovitis&quot; (translations of , &quot;oblomovshchina&quot;) refer to the fatalistic slothfulness that Oblomov exhibits.

Nikolai Dobrolyubov, in his 1859 article &quot;What is Oblomovism?&quot;, described the word as an integral part of Russian avos&#x27;. Stolz suggests that Oblomov&#x27;s death was the result of &quot;Oblomovism&quot;.

However, Elaine Blair argues in &quot;The Short Happy Life of Ilya Ilyich Oblomov&quot; that Oblomov is &quot;not merely lazy&quot;. She simply says &quot;our hero favors very short-term pleasures over long-term ones&quot;; &quot;he is self-conscious in a way that no farcical character or Rabelaisian grotesque would be&quot;, and, &quot;to Oblomov, to be absorbed in any task is to lose something of oneself; a person can maintain his full dignity only in repose&quot;.

A character named &quot;Oblomov&quot; in art patron Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s memoir &quot;Out of This Century&quot; was identified by poet Stephen Spender as Samuel Beckett, her one-time lover.

=== Social changes in Russia ===
Oblomov&#x27;s place in the context of Russian history became the focus of much literary criticism when it was first published. Goncharov himself thought of Oblomov more as a treatise on human nature than as commentary on Russian society, but Dobrolyubov focused heavily on Oblomov and Stoltz as social and ethical antitheses; Oblomov became an allegory for the superfluousness of Russian aristocracy in a time when serfdom was soon to be abolished. This contrast is further drawn by the name Stoltz, or pride in German. As a member of the old nobility, Oblomov&#x27;s inertia and fear of change represent old socioeconomic ideals that become out of place throughout the 19th century. Stoltz and Olga become Oblomov&#x27;s main connections to present Russia, but Oblomov ultimately rejects the social changes they represent when he marries Agafya and lives the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka.

Despite Oblomov&#x27;s own inertia, Oblomovka successfully integrates into present Russia thanks to Stoltz&#x27;s efforts at modernization. Stoltz introduces new infrastructure and education for the peasants at Oblomovka, and revitalizes its profits. Yet just as Russia no longer has a place for Oblomov, Russia similarly does not yet have a place for Stoltz as a leader of social change, and Stoltz continuously travels to different countries instead of staying in Russia for business. Olga, therefore, becomes the link between past and future Russia, in her love for Oblomov and her marriage to Stoltz.

== Literary criticism ==
Almost immediately upon its release in 1859, &quot;Oblomov&quot; became the subject of much discussion and literary criticism, due in large part to Dobrolyubov&#x27;s essay &quot;What is Oblomovism?&quot;. Today it is still seen as a classic of 19th-century Russian literature, and a quintessential Russian novel.

&quot;What is Oblomovism?&quot; focused heavily on the social significance of the novel, interpreting Stoltz and Olga as social ideals in contrast to Oblomov&#x27;s reliance on the past. Dobrolyubov, a follower of Vissarion Belinsky and a leading literary critic, believed strongly that literature should promote positive change, and his essay praised &quot;Oblomov&quot; as an effective warning against the Russian social disease of &quot;Oblomovism&quot;. Aside from introducing &quot;Oblomov&quot; to a large literary circle, the essay catalyzed &quot;Oblomov&quot;″s presence as a novel of social significance and became Dobrolyubov&#x27;s best-known work. Goncharov himself was happy with Dobrolyubov&#x27;s interpretation, writing that &quot;there is nothing left to be said about Oblomovism, that is its meaning, after the publication of this article.&quot;

Another critic, Alexander Druzhinin, focused on the psychological and literary aspects of &quot;Oblomov&quot;, instead of the historical context. Rather than interpreting characters as either warnings or ideals of society, Druzhinin praised the portrayal of Stoltz and Olga as psychological and artistic foils to Oblomov. Druzhinin believed that Oblomov, not Oblomovism, was the focus of the novel; characters and readers alike loved Oblomov, making him deserving of recognition as a unique character within Russian literary canon.

==Adaptations==
=== Spike Milligan play ===

The novel was adapted for the stage by Italian writer Riccardo Aragno. Aragno&#x27;s script for &quot;Oblomov&quot; was bought by Spike Milligan&#x27;s production company in early 1964. Milligan had long nurtured hopes of transitioning from comedy to serious drama. To this end, Milligan rehearsed for seven weeks with director Frank Dunlop and castmates Joan Greenwood, Bill Owen, and Valentine Dyall. 

The play opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, on October 7, 1964. During the first performance Milligan was struck by stage fright and forgot nearly all of his lines. He quickly began making up things to say to the cast, turning the drama into an impromptu improv session. Noticing that a drama critic who&#x27;d given rave reviews to Milligan&#x27;s other stage comedies was in the audience, Milligan ended the first performance by shouting &quot;Thank God, Milton Shulman&#x27;s in!&quot;

The play was savaged in the theatrical press. However, &quot;Oblomov&quot;&#x27;s producers had booked the play into the Lyric for three weeks. Anxious to recoup their investment by any means, they gave Milligan carte-blanche on stage. Milligan&#x27;s antics included starting the play while sitting with the audience, yelling for his castmates to entertain him. Another night he wore a false arm that fell out of his sleeve when co-star Ian Flintoff, playing Oblomov&#x27;s doctor, shook Milligan&#x27;s hand. When Flintoff complained to Bill Kerr, a longtime friend of Milligan, that Spike was making a mockery of their hard work Kerr replied, &quot;We have to put up with all the shit, mate, because it pays the rent.&quot;

The play kept running as an improv comedy. This decision soon caused it to break all box office records at the Lyric. After five weeks it was rechristened &quot;Son of Oblomov&quot; and on December 2, 1964, moved to the Comedy Theatre in the West End. It would run there for a total of 559 performances. As the play was substantially new for each performance it drew record numbers of repeat traffic.

On April 22, 1965, Queen Elizabeth and her family attended as part of her 39th birthday celebration. Shortly after the play began, a group of four latecomers attempted to slink to their seats directly in front of the royal family. Milligan immediately shouted &quot;Turn up the house lights! Start everything again!&quot; He pointed to the blushing foursome and cried &quot;That&#x27;s cost you your knighthood!&quot;

Then, noticing that Peter Sellers was seated between Prince Charles and Princess Margaret, Milligan asked in a loud voice &quot;Is there a Sellers in the house?&quot; Sellers immediately shouted &quot;Yes!&quot; Milligan launched into a vaudeville routine about Prince Phillip&#x27;s suspenders, with Sellers participating from his seat with the royals. This culminated in Milligan giving a high-kick, lobbing one of his bedroom slippers at Sellers, nearly missing Prince Phillip&#x27;s head. Once back in bed with co-star Joan Greenwood, Milligan spent the rest of the performance mocking the Queen for bringing her son to such a racy play. The play ended with Milligan unsheathing a katana on stage and asking the Queen to knight him for his efforts that night. She declined. The performance ran 45 minutes over its scheduled ending. Prince Charles reportedly saw the play five times.

=== Film adaptations ===
&quot;Oblomov&quot; was adapted to the cinema screen in the Soviet Union by Nikita Mikhalkov in 1980, as &quot;A Few Days from the Life of I. I. Oblomov&quot;. This film was later named Best Foreign Language Film for 1981 by the U.S. National Board of Review.

In 1989 BBC TV made an English language dramatisation of the novel, with George Wendt in the title role. In this version, Oblomov was a lazy modern-day Communist Party boss.

=== Radio adaptations ===
In 2005 BBC Radio 4 made a two-part English language dramatisation, heralding the lead character as &quot;a tragic-comic hero for a couch potato generation&quot;. It was adapted by Stephen Wyatt, produced and directed by Claire Grove and starred Toby Jones as the lead, supported by Trevor Peacock, Claire Skinner, Clive Swift, Gerard McDermott, Nicholas Boulton, and Richenda Carey. Olga&#x27;s singing voice was provided by Olivia Robinson, with Helen Crayford on piano.

In 2008 an adaptation was produced for the English service of the Russian national broadcaster, the Voice of Russia.

The defining characteristics of libertarian legal theory are its insistence that the amount of governmental intervention should be kept to a minimum and the primary functions of law should be enforcement of contracts and social order, though social order is often seen as a desirable side effect of a free market rather than a philosophical necessity.

Historically, the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek is the most important libertarian legal theorist. Another important predecessor was Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century American individualist anarchist and lawyer. John Locke was also an influence on libertarian legal theory (see &quot;Two Treatises of Government)&quot;.

Ideas range from anarcho-capitalism to a minimal state providing physical protection and enforcement of contracts. Some advocate regulation, including the existence of a police force, military, public land and public infrastructure. Geolibertarians oppose absolute ownership of land on Georgist grounds.

<doc id="296046" wikidata="Q51719" url="?curid=296046" title="Joscelin I, Count of Edessa">
<text>Joscelin I (died 1131) was a Frankish nobleman of the House of Courtenay who ruled as the lord of Turbessel, prince of Galilee (1112–1119) and count of Edessa (1118–1131). The County of Edessa reached its zenith during his rule. Captured twice, Joscelin continued to expand his county, even participating in the Battle of Azaz in 1125. Gravely injured during the collapse of a sapper mine, Joscelin marched his army to relieve the besieged fortress of Kaysun, and died soon after.

==Early career==
Joscelin was the son of Joscelin I of Courtenay and Elizabeth, daughter of Guy I of Montlhéry. He arrived in the Holy Land during the Crusade of 1101, and entered first into the service of his cousin Count Baldwin II of Edessa (in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon), who invested him with the lordship of Turbessel. Later Joscelin served in the army of Stephen of Blois. In 1104, he was captured at the Battle of Harran. After passing into the hands of Ilghazi, ruler of Mardin, Joscelin was ransomed for 20,000 dinars in 1107.

By 1113, Joscelin had carved out a semi-autonomous state around Turbessel to the west of the Euphrates, while his cousin Baldwin controlled the territory east of the Euphrates around Edessa itself, which was continually harassed by the Seljuk Turks. That year, Baldwin dispossessed him of Turbessel, while Joscelin travelled to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, where he was made the prince of Galilee.
==Countship==
In 1118, Joscelin&#x27;s cousin Baldwin II succeeded Baldwin I as king of Jerusalem. Despite their former hostility, Joscelin fully endorsed Baldwin II over the candidacy of Baldwin I&#x27;s brother Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Joscelin was rewarded with the County of Edessa.

Joscelin was taken prisoner along with Waleran of Le Puiset in 1122 near Saruj by Belek Ghazi. Later he was joined in captivity at Kharput by King Baldwin II, who had been captured in April 1123. They were rescued by fifty Armenian soldiers hired by Queen Morphia; they disguised themselves as merchants and infiltrated the fortress where the prisoners were kept. The Armenians killed the guards and freed the hostages. However, the castle was soon besieged by a large Artuqid force and it was decided that Joscelin should seek assistance. Baldwin stayed in the fortress and after some time it was reclaimed by the Artuqids.

After returning to Edessa Joscelin was able to enlarge the territory of the county, and in 1125 he participated in the Battle of Azaz, a Crusader victory against the atabeg of Mosul, who were led by Aq-Sunqur il-Bursuqi.

In 1131, during the siege of a small castle north-east of Aleppo, a sapper&#x27;s mine collapsed and Joscelin was gravely injured. Following this he received word that emir Gazi Gümüshtigin was besieging the fortress town of Kaysun. When his own son, Joscelin II, refused to attack Gazi, he commanded that his own army should march to Kaysun. Joscelin was borne on a litter, and when Gazi heard that Joscelin&#x27;s army was approaching, he lifted the siege and retreated. Joscelin won his final battle and died soon after.

==Marriage and issue==
Joscelin married an Armenian noblewoman named Beatrice, daughter of Prince Constantine I of Armenia. They had a son, Joscelin II of Edessa. She died in 1119.

In 1122, Joscelin married Maria, daughter of Richard of Salerno and sister of Roger, regent of the Principality of Antioch. They had a daughter, Stephanie.

<doc id="296047" wikidata="Q189665" url="?curid=296047" title="Ivan Goncharov">
<text>Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov ( , ; ; – ) was a Russian novelist best known for his novels &quot;The Same Old Story&quot; (1847, also translated as &quot;A Common Story&quot;), &quot;Oblomov&quot; (1859), and &quot;The Precipice&quot; (1869, also translated as &quot;Malinovka Heights&quot;). He also served in many official capacities, including the position of censor.

Goncharov was born in Simbirsk into the family of a wealthy merchant; as a reward for his grandfather&#x27;s military service, they were elevated to Russian nobility status. He was educated at a boarding school, then the Moscow College of Commerce, and finally at Moscow State University. After graduating, he served for a short time in the office of the Governor of Simbirsk, before moving to Saint Petersburg where he worked as government translator and private tutor, while publishing poetry and fiction in private almanacs. Goncharov&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Same Old Story&quot;, was published in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; in 1847.

Goncharov&#x27;s second and best-known novel, &quot;Oblomov&quot;, was published in 1859 in &quot;Otechestvennye zapiski&quot;. His third and final novel, &quot;The Precipice&quot;, was published in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot; in 1869. He also worked as a literary and theatre critic. Towards the end of his life Goncharov wrote a memoir called &quot;An Uncommon Story&quot;, in which he accused his literary rivals, first and foremost Ivan Turgenev, of having plagiarized his works and prevented him from achieving European fame. The memoir was published in 1924. Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others, considered Goncharov an author of high stature. Anton Chekhov is quoted as stating that Goncharov was &quot;...ten heads above me in talent.&quot;

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Goncharov was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk). His father, Aleksander Ivanovich Goncharov, was a wealthy grain merchant and a state official who served several terms as mayor of Simbirsk. The family&#x27;s big stone manor in the town center occupied a large area and had all the characteristics of a rural manor, with huge barns (packed with wheat and flour) and numerous stables. Alexander Ivanovich died when Ivan was seven years old. He was educated first by his mother, Avdotya Matveevna, and then his godfather Nikolay Nikolayevich Tregubov, a nobleman and a former Russian Navy officer.

Tregubov, a man of liberal views and a secret Masonic lodge member, who knew some of the Decembrists personally, and who was one of the most popular men amongst the Simbirsk intelligentsia, was a major early influence upon Goncharov, who particularly enjoyed his seafaring stories. With Tregubov around, Goncharov&#x27;s mother could focus on domestic affairs. &quot;His servants, cabmen, the whole household merged with ours; it was a single family. All the practical issues were now mother&#x27;s, and she proved to be an excellent housewife; all the official duties were his,&quot; Ivan Goncharov remembered.

===Education===

In 1820–1822 Goncharov studied at a private boarding-school owned by Rev. Fyodor S. Troitsky. It was here that he learned the French and German languages and started reading European writers, borrowing books from Troitsky&#x27;s vast library. In August 1822, Ivan was sent to Moscow and entered the College of Commerce. There he spent eight unhappy years, detesting the low quality of education and the severe discipline, taking solace in self-education. &quot;My first humanitarian and moral teacher was Nikolai Karamzin&quot;, he remembered. Then Pushkin came as a revelation; the serial publication of his poem &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; captured the young man&#x27;s imagination. In 1830, Goncharov decided to quit the college, and in 1831 (having missed one year because of a cholera outbreak in Moscow), he enrolled in Moscow State University&#x27;s Philology Faculty to study literature, arts, and architecture.

At the University, with its atmosphere of intellectual freedom and lively debate, Goncharov&#x27;s spirit thrived. One episode proved to be especially memorable: when his then-idol Alexander Pushkin arrived as a guest lecturer to have a public debate with professor Mikhail T. Katchenovsky on the authenticity of &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;. &quot;It was as if sunlight lit up the auditorium. I was enchanted by his poetry at the time...it was his genius that formed my aesthetic ideas – although the same, I think, could be said of all the young people of the time who were interested in poetry&quot;, Goncharov wrote. Unlike Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky or Nikolay Ogaryov, his fellow Moscow University students, Goncharov remained indifferent to the ideas of political and social change that were gaining popularity at the time. Reading and translating were his main occupations. In 1832, the &quot;Telescope&quot; magazine published two chapters of Eugène Sue&#x27;s novel &quot;Atar-Gull&quot; (1831), translated by Goncharov. This was his debut publication.

In 1834, Goncharov graduated from the University and returned home to enter the chancellery of Simbirsk governor A. M. Zagryazhsky. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry&#x27;s Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He became a member of the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs&#x27; house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs&#x27; almanac &quot;Snowdrop&quot; featured many of Goncharov&#x27;s poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether. Some of those early verses were later incorporated into the novel &quot;The Same Old Story&quot; as Aduev&#x27;s writings, a sure sign that the author had stopped taking them seriously.

===Literary career===

His first piece of prose appeared in an issue of &quot;Snowdrop&quot;, a satirical novella called &quot;Evil Illness&quot; (1838), ridiculing romantic sentimentalism and fantasizing. Another novella, &quot;A Fortunate Blunder&quot;, a &quot;high-society drama&quot; in the tradition set by Marlinsky, Vladimir Odoevsky, and Vladimir Sollogub, tinged with comedy, appeared in another privately published almanac, &quot;Moonlit Nights&quot;, in 1839. In 1842 Goncharov wrote an essay called &quot;Ivan Savvich Podzhabrin&quot;, a natural school psychological sketch. Published in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; six years later, it failed to make any impact, being very much a period piece, but later scholars reviewed it positively, as something in the vein of the Nikolay Gogol-inspired genre known as the &quot;physiological essay&quot;, marked by a fine style and precision in depicting the life of the common man in the city. In the early 1840s Goncharov worked on a novel called &quot;The Old People&quot;, but the manuscript has been lost.

====&quot;The Same Old Story&quot;====
Goncharov&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Same Old Story&quot;, was published in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; in 1847. It dealt with the conflict between the excessive romanticism of a young Russian nobleman who has recently arrived in Saint Petersburg from the provinces, and the sober pragmatism of the emerging commercial class of the capital. &quot;The Same Old Story&quot; polarized critics and made its author famous. The novel was a direct response to Vissarion Belinsky&#x27;s call for exposing a new type, that of the complacent romantic, common at the time; it was lavishly praised by the famous critic as one of the best Russian books of the year. The term &quot;aduyevschina&quot; (after the novel&#x27;s protagonist Aduyev) became popular with reviewers who saw it as synonymous with vain romantic aspirations. Leo Tolstoy, who liked the novel, used the same word to describe social egotism and the inability of some people to see beyond their immediate interests.

In 1849 &quot;Sovremennik&quot; published &quot;Oblomov&#x27;s Dream&quot;, an extract from Goncharov&#x27;s future second novel &quot;Oblomov&quot; (known under the working title &quot;The Artist&quot; at the time), which worked well on its own as a short story. Again it was lauded by the &quot;Sovremennik&quot; staff. Slavophiles, while giving the author credit for being a fine stylist, reviled the irony aimed at patriarchal Russian ways. The novel itself, though, appeared only ten years later, preceded by some extraordinary events in Goncharov&#x27;s life.

In 1852 Goncharov embarked on a long journey through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia, on board the frigate &quot;Pallada&quot;, as a secretary for Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin, whose mission was to inspect Alaska and other distant outposts of the Empire, and also to establish trade relations with Japan. The log-book which it was Goncharov&#x27;s duty to keep served as a basis for his future book. He returned to Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1855, after traveling through Siberia and the Urals, this continental leg of the journey lasting six months. Goncharov&#x27;s travelogue, &quot;Frigate &quot;Pallada&quot;&quot; (&quot;Pallada&quot; is the Russian spelling of &quot;&quot;), began to appear, first in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; (April 1855), then in &quot;The Sea Anthology&quot; and other magazines.

In 1858, &quot;Frigate &quot;Pallada&quot;&quot; was published as a separate book; it received favourable reviews and became very popular. For the mid-19th-century Russian readership, the book came as a revelation, providing new insights into the world, hitherto unknown. Goncharov, a well-read man and a specialist in the history and economics of the countries he visited, proved to be a competent and insightful writer. He warned against seeing his work as any kind of political or social statement, insisting it was a subjective piece of writing, but critics praised the book as a well-balanced, unbiased report, containing valuable ethnographic material, but also some social critique. Again, the anti-romantic tendency prevailed: it was seen as part of the polemic with those Russian authors who tended to romanticize the &quot;pure and unspoiled&quot; life of the uncivilized world. According to Nikolay Dobrolyubov, &quot;The Frigate Pallada&quot; &quot;bore the hallmark of a gifted epic novelist.&quot;

====&quot;Oblomov&quot;====

Throughout the 1850s Goncharov worked on his second novel, but the process was slow for many reasons. In 1855 he accepted the post of censor in the Saint Petersburg censorship committee. In this capacity, he helped publish important works by Ivan Turgenev, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a fact that brought resentment from some of his bosses. According to Pisemsky, Goncharov was officially reprimanded for permitting his novel &quot;A Thousand Souls&quot; to be published. Despite all this, Goncharov became the target of many satires and received a negative mention in Herzen&#x27;s &quot;Kolokol&quot;. &quot;One of the best Russian authors shouldn&#x27;t have taken this sort of job upon himself,&quot; critic Aleksander Druzhinin wrote in his diary. In 1856, as the official publishing policy hardened, Goncharov quit.

In the summer of 1857, Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote &quot;Oblomov&quot;, almost in its entirety. &quot;It might seem strange, even impossible that in the course of one month the whole of the novel might be written... But it&#x27;d been growing in me for several years, so what I had to do then was just sit and write everything down,&quot; he later remembered. Goncharov&#x27;s second novel &quot;Oblomov&quot; was published in 1859 in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. It had evolved from the earlier &quot;Oblomov&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, &quot;oblomovshchina&quot;, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.

In his essay &quot;What Is Oblomovshchina?&quot; Nikolay Dobrolyubov provided an ideological background for the type of Russia&#x27;s &#x27;new man&#x27; exposed by Goncharov. The critic argued that, while several famous classic Russian literary characters – Onegin, Pechorin, and Rudin – bore symptoms of the &#x27;Oblomov malaise&#x27;, for the first time one single feature, that of social apathy, a self-destructive kind of laziness and unwillingness to even try and lift the burden of all-pervading inertia, had been brought to the fore and subjected to a thorough analysis.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky, among others, considered Goncharov a noteworthy author of high stature. Anton Chekhov is quoted as stating that Goncharov was &quot;...ten heads above me in talent.&quot; Turgenev, who fell out with Goncharov after the latter accused him of plagiarism (specifically of having used some of the characters and situations from &quot;The Precipice&quot;, whose plan Goncharov had disclosed to him in 1855, in &quot;Home of the Gentry&quot; and &quot;On the Eve&quot;), nevertheless declared: &quot;As long as there is even one Russian alive, &quot;Oblomov&quot; will be remembered!&quot;

====&quot;The Precipice&quot;====

A moderate conservative at heart, Goncharov greeted the emancipation reform of 1861, embraced the well-publicized notion of the government&#x27;s readiness to &quot;be at the helm of [social] progress&quot;, and found himself in opposition to the revolutionary democrats. In the summer of 1862 he became an editor of &quot;Severnaya Potchta&quot; (The Northern Post), an official newspaper of the Interior Ministry, and a year later returned to the censorship committee.

In this second term Goncharov proved to be a harsh censor: he created serious problems for Nekrasov&#x27;s &quot;Sovremennik&quot; and &quot;Russkoye Slovo&quot;, where Dmitry Pisarev was now a leading figure. Openly condemning &#x27;nihilistic&#x27; tendencies and what he called &quot;pathetic, imported doctrines of materialism, socialism, and communism&quot;, Goncharov found himself the target of heavy criticism. In 1863 he became a member of the State Publishing Council and two years later joined the Russian government&#x27;s Department of Publishing. All the while he was working on his third novel, &quot;The Precipice&quot;, which came out in extracts: &quot;Sophia Nikolayevna Belovodova&quot; (a piece he himself was later skeptical about), &quot;Grandmother&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot;.

In 1867, Goncharov retired from his censorial position to devote himself entirely to writing &quot;The Precipice&quot;, a book he later called &quot;my heart&#x27;s child&quot;, which took him twenty years to finish. Towards the end of this tormenting process Goncharov spoke of the novel as a &quot;burden&quot; and an &quot;insurmountable task&quot; that blocked his development and made him unable to advance as a writer. In a letter to Turgenev he confessed that, after finishing Part Three, he had toyed with the idea of abandoning the whole project.

In 1869, &quot;The Precipice&quot;, a story of the romantic rivalry among three men, condemning nihilism as subverting the religious and moral values of Russia, was published in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;. Later critics came to see it as the final part of a trilogy, each part introducing a character typical of Russian high society of a certain period: first Aduev, then Oblomov, and finally Raisky, a gifted man, his artistic development halted by &quot;lack of direction&quot;. According to scholar S. Mashinsky, as a social epic, &quot;The Precipice&quot; was superior to both &quot;The Same Old Story&quot; and &quot;Oblomov&quot;.

The novel had considerable success, but the leftist press turned against its author. Saltykov-Shchedrin in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; (&quot;The Street Philosophy&quot;, 1869), compared it unfavorably to &quot;Oblomov&quot;. While the latter &quot;had been driven by ideas assimilated by its author from the best men of the 1840s&quot;, &quot;The Precipice&quot; featured &quot;a bunch of people wandering to and fro without any sense of direction, their lines of action having neither beginning nor end,&quot; according to the critic. Yevgeny Utin in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot; argued that Goncharov, like all writers of his generation, had lost touch with the new Russia. The controversial character Mark Volokhov, as leftist critics saw it, had been concocted to condemn &#x27;nihilism&#x27; again, thus making the whole novel &#x27;tendentious&#x27;. Yet, as Vladimir Korolenko later wrote, &quot;Volokhov and all things related to him will be forgotten, as Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence&quot; has been forgotten, while Goncharov&#x27;s huge characters will remain in history, towering over all of those spiteful disputes of old.&quot;

===Later years===

Goncharov planned a fourth novel, set in the 1870s, but it failed to materialize. Instead he became a prolific critic, providing numerous theater and literature reviews; his &quot;Myriad of Agonies&quot; (Milyon terzaniy, 1871) is still regarded as one of the best essays on Alexandr Griboyedov&#x27;s &quot;Woe from Wit&quot;. Goncharov also wrote short stories: his &quot;Servants of an Old Age&quot; cycle as well as &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot;, &quot;Ukha&quot; and others, described the life of rural Russia. In 1880 the first edition of &quot;The Complete Works of Goncharov&quot; was published. After the writer&#x27;s death, it became known that he had burnt many later manuscripts.

Towards the end of his life Goncharov wrote an unusual memoir called &quot;An Uncommon Story&quot;, in which he accused his literary rivals, first and foremost Ivan Turgenev, of having plagiarized his works and prevented him from achieving European fame. Some critics claimed that the book was the product of an unstable mind, while others praised it as an eye-opening, if controversial piece of writing. It wasn&#x27;t published until 1924.

Goncharov, who never married, spent his last days absorbed in lonely and bitter recriminations because of the negative criticism some of his work had received. He died in Saint Petersburg on 27 September 1891, of pneumonia. He was buried at the Novoye Nikolskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. In 1956 his ashes were moved to the Volkovo Cemetery in Leningrad.

The western portion of Thornhill is within the City of Vaughan and its eastern portion is within the City of Markham, with Yonge Street forming the boundary between Vaughan and Markham. Thornhill is situated along the northern border of Toronto, centred on Yonge, and is also immediately south of the City of Richmond Hill. Once a police village, Thornhill is still a postal designation. As of 2016, its total population, including both its Vaughan and Markham sections, was 112,719.

==History==
===Early history===
Thornhill was founded in 1794. The original boundaries were the northern bounds of the Ladies Golf Club on the east side of Yonge and further north on the west side of Yonge; southern end between John Street and Arnold Avenue/Elgin Street. Its first settlers on Yonge Street in Thornhill were Asa Johnson (who settled on the Vaughan side) and Nicholas Miller (c. 1760–1810; who settled on the Markham side). Of particular importance was the arrival of Benjamin Thorne (January 4, 1794 – July 2, 1848) in 1820 from Dorset, England, who was operating a gristmill, a sawmill, and a tannery in the community. The settlement came to be known as Thorne&#x27;s Mills, and later, Thorne&#x27;s Hill, from which its current name is derived. (Thorne committed suicide in 1848, after a serious wheat market crash.)

Between 1830 and 1848, Thornhill experienced a period of continued growth and prosperity. The business district of Thornhill developed on its portion of Yonge Street, between Centre Street and John Street. Stagecoaches travelled between Holland Landing (Lake Simcoe) and York (Toronto) as Yonge Street&#x27;s road conditions improved with new stonework. During this prosperous period, several churches, many of which are still standing today, were constructed.

Thornhill&#x27;s location along Yonge Street, a major transportation route, proved beneficial to the community&#x27;s growth throughout much of the twentieth century. The implementation of the electric radial Metropolitan line along Yonge Street in 1898 running north to Sutton and south to Toronto meant that, for the first time, people could reside in Thornhill and work in Toronto. By the 1920s, automobiles also facilitated travel along Yonge Street.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1931, Thornhill became a &quot;Police Village&quot;; before that time, Thornhill had no independent status and was split between the townships of Vaughan and Markham along Yonge Street, since the creation of municipal government in 1850. Before 1931, each township administered its half of the village. The creation of the Police Village gave Thornhill its own political boundaries. The village was headed by a reeve.

In 1971, York Region was created, part of a wave of municipal re-organization which converted many townships into towns and eliminated many of the municipal forms of organization which had existed within those townships. The establishment of a regional administration effectively eliminated the Police Village of Thornhill. Thornhill&#x27;s administration reverted to Markham and Vaughan, which were enlarged in territory and upgraded to Town status at this time.

However, many social institutions remained organized around the former municipal entities eliminated in 1971. Like neighbouring communities such as Woodbridge, Maple, and Unionville – and more so than was the case for historic suburban communities within the City of Toronto – community organizations such as local newspapers, and sports teams continued to operate under a Thornhill administrative structure. As an example, until the mid-1990s residents of Thornhill who wanted to play high-level hockey were required to play for a Thornhill team.

While the old village of Thornhill revolved around Yonge Street between Centre and John Streets, the neighbourhood is typically thought to be between Dufferin Street to the west, Highway 7 to the north, Steeles Avenue to the south, and Highway 404 to the east.

====Suburbanization====
Thornhill&#x27;s growth since the 1960s and 1970s has been largely connected to its location bordering what is now the City of Toronto.

Growth has continued apace. Developments have sprung up across various areas of Thornhill in each of the municipal districts which encompass Thornhill, following the development patterns of the Greater Toronto Area.

====Coyote problem====
In the summer of 2020, after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the area around Hefhill Park, near Bathurst and Centre Streets, began experiencing a problem with its coyote population. As reported by the Toronto Star, Thornhill residents&#x27; &quot;daily routines have been completely altered after a pack of coyotes living nearby appears to have lost its fear of humans&quot;. The issue exacerbated when dogs began mysteriously disappearing and a 14-year-old girl was chased by one of the coyotes.

As stated by the Toronto Star &quot;the coyotes’ behaviour has changed [in 2020]. Before 2020 the animals were not aggressive and usually only seen by those living directly next to them. Now they are frequently spotted in people’s yards, residential streets and on major intersections, the residents said&quot;. Residents of Thornhill continue to report sightings and attacks by coyotes to their local and regional governments as the issue remains unresolved.

==Demographics==

===Ethnicity===
Thornhill has a very ethnically diverse population. It is home to a significant number of Jewish, Chinese, Korean, Iranian, Indian, and Italian people.
According to 2001 Federal Census data, the electoral district of Thornhill (which is not entirely congruent with the neighbourhood) consists of Chinese, the largest visible minority, accounting for almost 11% of total residents (12,610), followed by South Asian (6,595), Black (2,665), Korean (2,660), Filipino (2,535), and West Asian (2,355).

According to the 2009 Report of Canada&#x27;s Demographic Task Force, Thornhill-Vaughan was in 2001 home to more than 33,000 members of the Jewish community out of 55,000 in this area.

==Government==
Thornhill is split into Wards 4 and 5 in the City of Vaughan and Ward 1 in the City of Markham. It is represented by Chris Ainsworth (Vaughan Ward 4), Gila Martow (Vaughan Ward 5), and Keith Irish (Markham Ward 1).

Thornhill is also a federal and provincial riding. The Member of Parliament for Thornhill is Melissa Lantsman (Conservative), and the Member of Provincial Parliament is Laura Smith (Progressive Conservative).

==Infrastructure==
===Healthcare===
There are no general hospitals in Thornhill, but a private hospital, Shouldice Hernia Centre, is located there.

===Thornhill Community Centre===

Located at Bayview and John Street (on the Markham side), the community centre features a double arena (home to the Thornhill Skating Club, Markham Majors and Islanders hockey clubs (with an east rink named for Bib Sherwood in 1999), therapy pool, gym room, running track, multi-purpose rooms and Markham Public Library branch. The complex was opened in 1975. 

Thornhill Community Centre is home to the Markham Cat Adoption Centre &amp; Education Centre, which was launched in 2016 and is partnered with the Ontario SPCA. It was the first cat adoption and education centre in the Greater Toronto Area, and the first cat adoption centre to be municipally funded in Ontario. The centre has housing for 18 cats and provides an accessible space for education in the area. 

The Thornhill Seniors Club, also located in the community centre, was established in 2004 following expansions to the centre that began in 2003. It features a variety of activities for seniors in a space that boasts a TV lounge with a fireplace, full kitchen, activity rooms, and more.

The community centre hosted the Markham Thunder of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League from 2017 to 2019.

Thornlea Pool is a public swimming pool located further north of the community centre near Thornlea Secondary School.

It hosted the 1945 Canadian Open.

Uplands Golf Course opened in 1922 and also designed by Stanley Thompson as a 18 hole course. In the 1980s it lost half to development, the land is now owned by city but lease to the club. Uplands Ski Centre was opened in 1989 from part of the former course not used for housing.

Ladies Golf Club of Toronto opened in 1924 is also a Stanley Thompson designed course.

<doc id="296057" wikidata="Q463164" url="?curid=296057" title="Ira von Fürstenberg">
<text>Princess Virginia von Fürstenberg (&quot;Virginia Carolina Theresa Pancrazia Galdina Prinzessin zu Fürstenberg&quot;; 17 April 1940 – 18 February 2024), known as Ira von Fürstenberg, was an Italian socialite, actress, jewelry designer, and public relations manager for the fashion designer Valentino Garavani. She was a member by birth of the princely family of Fürstenberg and a member by marriage of the princely family of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

==Family and early life==
The daughter of Prince Prince Tassilo zu Fürstenberg from the house of Fürstenberg and his first wife, Clara Agnelli of the FIAT Agnelli family, she was born in Rome, Italy, on 17 April 1940. The elder of her two brothers, Prince Egon von Fürstenberg, became a fashion designer. She also had a younger brother, Prince Sebastian. Her former sister-in-law is the fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, and an uncle was Gianni Agnelli, the chairman of FIAT.

During the Second World War, she lived in Switzerland, later in Italy and Austria. When her parents separated she was educated in a boarding school in England for a while. She spoke several languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian.

She became the patron of a number of charities, including the Children of Africa Foundation set up by Dominique Ouattara.

==Career==
Ira von Fürstenberg started a modeling career at age 13, walking down the runway for Emilio Pucci, and later collaborating with Diana Vreeland. She posed for Helmut Newton and Cecil Beaton.

She was well-known by the tabloid press. Film producer Dino De Laurentiis thought of a career in film for her and offered her a role in his &quot;Matchless&quot;, a 1968 parody of James Bond, co-starring Patrick O&#x27;Neal. It became the first of 28 films, some of them European coproductions of genre films. She never trained as an actor. In 1968 Roger Vadim offered her &quot;Barbarella&quot;, but she declined, and Jane Fonda landed a success. Her appearances included &quot;I Killed Rasputin&quot; (1967), &quot;Dead Run&quot; (1967, co-starring Peter Lawford), &quot;&quot; (1968), &quot;The Vatican Affair&quot; (1968), &quot;The Battle of El Alamein&quot; (1969), &quot;Five Dolls for an August Moon&quot; (1970), &quot;No desearás al vecino del quinto&quot; (1970), &quot;Hello-Goodbye&quot; (1970) alongside Curd Jürgens, and &quot;The Fifth Cord&quot; (1971).

She co-hosted the 20th edition of the Sanremo Music Festival with Nuccio Costa and Enrico Maria Salerno in 1970. She returned to fashion, with a post of president of the Italian branch of the cosmetics company Germaine Montell, and from 1978 general director of Valentino. In 1992, she founded a fashion house, the &quot;Ira von Fürstenberg Collection&quot;, and designed jewelry titled &quot;Objets Uniques&quot;. She presented a television show in German, &quot;&quot;Palastgeflüster&quot;, on SAT.1 from 1992.

==Personal life==
Her first husband was Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1924–2003), who founded the Marbella Club, a Spanish resort. They married in Venice on 17 September 1955, when she was aged 15 and the groom, 31. The wedding was a lavish feast, attended by international society. 

The couple had two children:
* Christoph Victorio Egon Humberto (known as &quot;Kiko&quot;; 8 November 1956 – 6 August 2006), who died of massive organ failure a few days after being imprisoned in Klongprem Central Prison in Bangkok on charges of suspicion of illegally altering a visa. His health had been weakened from a weight-loss regimen at a Thai wellness center.
* Hubertus Rudolph (known as &quot;Hubi&quot;; born 2 February 1959), a musician and photographer who was on Mexico&#x27;s Olympic skiing team in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 2010, and 2014. Married to Simona Gandolfi on 17 June 2019 in Vaduz.

They lived in Mexico City, because her husband had family ties there, and introduced the VW Beetle into Latin America. She left with the children in 1960. They were divorced in 1960, and the marriage was annulled in 1969.

Her second husband was Francisco &quot;Baby&quot; Pignatari (1916–1977), a Brazilian industrialist. They married in Reno, Nevada, on 12 January 1961. They divorced in Las Vegas in January 1964.

Von Fürstenberg died on 18 February 2024, at the age of 83, from injuries sustained in a &quot;domestic accident&quot; at her residence in Rome. The funeral service took place on 23 February 2024 in the Church of Santa Maria in Rome. In addition to the family, John Elkann and his wife Lavinia, Tomás Terry and Marisela Federici were also present. Her grave is located in the cemetery in Strobl am Wolfgangsee.

<doc id="296058" wikidata="Q944090" url="?curid=296058" title="Coherer">
<text>The coherer was a primitive form of radio signal detector used in the first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era at the beginning of the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Édouard Branly and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two electrodes spaced a small distance apart with loose metal filings in the space between. When a radio frequency signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or &quot;&quot;, reducing the initial high resistance of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse paper tape recorder to make a record of the received signal. The metal filings in the coherer remained conductive after the signal (pulse) ended so that the coherer had to be &quot;decohered&quot; by tapping it with a clapper actuated by an electromagnet, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors.

==History==
The behavior of particles or metal filings in the presence of electricity or electric sparks was noticed in many experiments well before Édouard Branly&#x27;s 1890 paper and even before there was proof of the theory of electromagnetism. In 1835 Swedish scientist Peter Samuel Munk noticed a change of resistance in a mixture of metal filings in the presence of spark discharge from a Leyden jar. In 1850 Pierre Guitard found that when dusty air was electrified, the particles would tend to collect in the form of strings. The idea that particles could react to electricity was used in English engineer Samuel Alfred Varley&#x27;s 1866 lightning bridge, a lightning arrester attached to telegraph lines consisting of a piece of wood with two metal spikes extending into a chamber. The space was filled with powdered carbon that would not allow the low voltage telegraph signals to pass through but it would conduct and ground a high voltage lightning strike. In 1879 the Welsh scientist David Edward Hughes found that loose contacts between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone he was developing responded to sparks generated in a nearby apparatus. Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti in Italy began studying the anomalous change in the resistance of thin metallic films and metal particles at Fermo/Monterubbiano. He found that copper filings between two brass plates would cling together, becoming conductive, when he applied a voltage to them. He also found that other types of metal filings would have the same reaction to electric sparks occurring at a distance, a phenomenon that he thought could be used for detecting lightning strikes. Calzecchi-Onesti&#x27;s papers were published in il Nuovo Cimento in 1884, 1885 and 1886.

In 1890, French physicist Édouard Branly published &quot;On the Changes in Resistance of Bodies under Different Electrical Conditions&quot; in a French Journal where he described his thorough investigation of the effect of minute electrical charges on metal and many types of metal filings. In one type of circuit, filings were placed in a tube of glass or ebonite, held between two metal plates. When an electric discharge was produced in the neighbourhood of the circuit, a large deviation was seen on the attached galvanometer needle. He noted the filings in the tube would react to the electric discharge even when the tube was placed in another room 20 yards away. Branly went on to devise many types of these devices based on &quot;imperfect&quot; metal contacts. Branly&#x27;s filings tube came to light in 1892 in Great Britain when it was described by Dr. Dawson Turner at a meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh. The Scottish electrical engineer and astronomer George Forbes suggested that Branly&#x27;s filings tube might be reacting in the presence of Hertzian waves, a type of air-borne electromagnetic radiation proven to exist by German physicist Heinrich Hertz (later called radio waves).

In 1893 physicist W.B. Croft exhibited Branly&#x27;s experiments at a meeting of the Physical Society in London. It was unclear to Croft and others whether the filings in the Branly tube were reacting to sparks or the light from the sparks. George Minchin noticed the Branly tube might be reacting to Hertzian waves the same way his solar cell did and wrote the paper &quot;The Action of Electromagnetic Radiation on Films containing Metallic Powders&quot;. These papers were read by English physicist Oliver Lodge who saw this as a way to build a much improved Hertzian wave detector. On 1 June 1894, a few months after the death of Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge delivered a memorial lecture on Hertz where he demonstrated the properties of &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; (radio), including transmitting them over a short distance, using an improved version of Branly&#x27;s filings tube, which Lodge had named the &quot;coherer&quot;, as a detector. In May 1895, after reading about Lodge&#x27;s demonstrations, the Russian physicist Alexander Popov built a &quot;Hertzian wave&quot; (radio wave) based lightning detector using a coherer. That same year, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated a wireless telegraphy system using Hertzian waves (radio), based on a coherer. The Russian radio pioneer Simeon Aisenstein used a coherer in his initial laboratory which established as hobby pursuit in 1904.

The coherer was replaced in receivers by the simpler and more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors around 1907, and became obsolete.

One minor use of the coherer in modern times was by Japanese tin-plate toy manufacturer Matsudaya Toy Co. who beginning 1957 used a spark-gap transmitter and coherer-based receiver in a range of radio-controlled (RC) toys, called Radicon (abbreviation for Radio-Controlled) toys. Several different types using the same RC system were commercially sold, including a Radicon Boat (very rare), Radicon Oldsmobile Car (rare) and a Radicon Bus (the most popular).

==Operation==
Unlike modern AM radio stations that transmit a continuous radio frequency, whose amplitude (power) is modulated by an audio signal, the first radio transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy (radiotelegraphy), the transmitter was turned on and off (on-off keying) to produce different length pulses of unmodulated carrier wave signal, &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot;, that spelled out text messages in Morse code. As a result, early radio receiving apparatus merely had to detect the presence or absence of the radio signal, not convert it to audio. The device that did this was called a detector. The coherer was the most successful of many detector devices that were tried in the early days of radio.

The operation of the coherer is based on the phenomenon of electrical contact resistance. Specifically as metal particles (cling together), they conduct electricity much better after being subjected to radio frequency electricity. The radio signal from the antenna was applied directly across the coherer&#x27;s electrodes. When the radio signal from a &quot;dot&quot; or &quot;dash&quot; came in, the coherer would become conductive. The coherer&#x27;s electrodes were also attached to a DC circuit powered by a battery that created a &quot;click&quot; sound in earphones or a telegraph sounder, or a mark on a paper tape, to record the signal. Unfortunately, the reduction in the coherer&#x27;s electrical resistance persisted after the radio signal was removed. This was a problem because the coherer had to be ready immediately to receive the next &quot;dot&quot; or &quot;dash&quot;. Therefore, a decoherer mechanism was added to tap the coherer, mechanically disturbing the particles to reset it to the high resistance state. If a dash is being transmitted then the radio frequency is still being received when the tap happens, and the coherer immediately becomes conductive again and the whole process repeats for another mark on the tape. As a result, dash is marked on the tape as multiple dots close together.

Coherence of particles by radio waves is an obscure phenomenon that is not well understood even today. Recent experiments with particle coherers seem to have confirmed the hypothesis that the particles cohere by a micro-weld phenomenon caused by radio frequency electricity flowing across the small contact area between particles. The underlying principle of so-called &quot;imperfect contact&quot; coherers is also not well understood, but may involve a kind of tunneling of charge carriers across an imperfect junction between conductors.

==Application==
The coherer used in practical receivers was a glass tube, sometimes evacuated, which was about half filled with sharply cut metal filings, often part silver and part nickel. Silver electrodes made contact with the metal particles on both ends. In some coherers, the electrodes were slanted so the width of the gap occupied by the filings could be varied by rotating the tube about its long axis, thus adjusting its sensitivity to the prevailing conditions.

In operation, the coherer is included in two separate electrical circuits. One is the antenna-ground circuit shown in the untuned receiver circuit diagram below. The other is the battery-sounder relay circuit including battery &quot;B1&quot; and relay &quot;R&quot; in the diagram. A radio signal from the antenna-ground circuit &quot;turns on&quot; the coherer, enabling current flow in the battery-sounder circuit, activating the sounder, &quot;S&quot;. The coils, &quot;L&quot;, act as RF chokes to prevent the RF signal power from leaking away through the relay circuit.

One electrode, &quot;A&quot;, of the coherer, (&quot;C&quot;, in the left diagram) is connected to the antenna and the other electrode, &quot;B&quot;, to ground. A series combination of a battery, &quot;B1&quot;, and a relay, &quot;R&quot;, is also attached to the two electrodes. When the signal from a spark gap transmitter is received, the filings tend to cling to each other, reducing the resistance of the coherer. When the coherer conducts better, battery &quot;B1&quot; supplies enough current through the coherer to activate relay &quot;R&quot;, which connects battery &quot;B2&quot; to the telegraph sounder &quot;S&quot;, giving an audible click. In some applications, a pair of headphones replaced the telegraph sounder, being much more sensitive to weak signals, or a Morse recorder which recorded the dots and dashes of the signal on paper tape.

The problem of the filings continuing to cling together and conduct after the removal of the signal was solved by tapping or shaking the coherer after the arrival of each signal, shaking the filings and raising the resistance of the coherer to the original value. This apparatus was called a decoherer. This process was referred to as &quot;decohering&quot; the device and was subject to much innovation during the life of the popular use of this component. Tesla, for example, invented a coherer in which the tube rotated continually along its axis.

In later practical receivers the decoherer was a clapper similar to an electric bell, operated by an electromagnet powered by the coherer current itself. When the radio wave turned on the coherer, the DC current from the battery flowed through the electromagnet, pulling the arm over to give the coherer a tap. This returned the coherer to the nonconductive state, turning off the electromagnet current, and the arm sprang back. If the radio signal was still present, the coherer would immediately turn on again, pulling the clapper over to give it another tap, which would turn it off again. The result was a constant &quot;trembling&quot; of the clapper during the period that the radio signal was on, during the &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; of the Morse code signal.

An automatic braking system for rail locomotives, patented in 1907, used a coherer to detect electrical oscillations in a continuous aerial running along the track. If the block ahead of the train were occupied the oscillations were interrupted and the coherer, acting through a relay, showed a warning and applied the brakes.

==Imperfect junction coherer==
There are several variations of what is known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899. The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small iron disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering.

In 1899, Bose announced the development of an &quot;&quot;iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector&quot; in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London. He also later received , &quot;Detector for electrical disturbances&quot;&quot; (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver.

==Anticoherer==

==Limitations of coherers==
Because they are threshold voltage detectors, coherers had difficulty discriminating between the impulsive signals of spark-gap transmitters, and other impulsive electrical noise:

Coherers were also finicky to adjust and not very sensitive. Another problem was that, because of the cumbersome mechanical &quot;decohering&quot; mechanism, the coherer was limited to a receiving speed of 12 – 15 words per minute of Morse code, while telegraph operators could send at rates of 50 WPM, and paper tape machines at 100 WPM.

More important for the future, the coherer could not detect AM (radio) transmissions. As a simple switch that registered the presence or absence of radio waves, the coherer could detect the on-off keying of wireless telegraphy transmitters, but it could not rectify nor demodulate the waveforms of AM radiotelephone signals, which began to be experimented with in the first years of the 20th century. This problem was solved by the rectification capability of the hot wire barretter and electrolytic detector, developed by Reginald Fessenden around 1902. These were replaced by the crystal detector around 1907, and then around 1912–1918 by vacuum tube technologies such as Fleming&#x27;s oscillation valve and Lee De Forest&#x27;s Audion (triode) tube.

<text>In moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek: + ) is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules and principles, rather than based on the consequences of the action. It is sometimes described as duty-, obligation-, or rule-based ethics. Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences.

The term &quot;deontological&quot; was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by C. D. Broad in his 1930 book, &quot;Five Types of Ethical Theory&quot;. Older usage of the term goes back to Jeremy Bentham, who coined it prior to 1816 as a synonym of &quot;dicastic&quot; or &quot;censorial ethics&quot; (i.e., ethics based on judgement). The more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term &quot;code de déontologie&quot; (ethical code), in the context of professional ethics.

Depending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a &quot;moral obligation&quot; may arise from an external or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe (ethical naturalism), religious law, or a set of personal or cultural values (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires).

==Deontological philosophies==
There are numerous formulations of deontological ethics.

===Kantianism===
Immanuel Kant&#x27;s theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons. First, Kant argues that in order to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (&quot;Pflicht&quot;). Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong, but the motives of the person who carries out the action.

Kant&#x27;s first argument begins with the premise that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification. Something is &quot;good in itself&quot; when it is intrinsically good; and is &quot;good without qualification&quot; when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as intelligence, , and pleasure, fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:
Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when they &quot;act out of respect for the moral law.&quot; People &quot;act out of respect for the moral law&quot; when they act in some way &quot;because&quot; they have a duty to do so. Thus, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person&#x27;s duty; i.e., out of respect for the law. He defines &quot;respect&quot; as &quot;the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love.&quot;

Kant&#x27;s three significant formulations of the categorical imperative (a way of evaluating motivations for action) are:
* Act only according to that maxim by which you can also will that it would become a universal law;
* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end;
* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.

Kant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim—e.g., &#x27;I will lie&#x27;—then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.

In his essay, &quot;On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns&quot;, arguing against the position of Benjamin Constant, &quot;Des réactions politiques&quot;, Kant states that:Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (&quot;mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius&quot;). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [].… All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth.… This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles.

===Divine command theory===

Although not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the &quot;divine command theory&quot;, which is actually a cluster of related theories that essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right. According to English philosopher Ralph Cudworth, William of Ockham, René Descartes, and 18th-century Calvinists all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God&#x27;s commands.

The &quot;divine command theory&quot; is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on Sabbath, then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath &quot;because God has commanded that they do not do so&quot;. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not, truly speaking, &quot;right&quot; even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour&#x27;s goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.

One thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.

===Ross&#x27;s deontological pluralism===
W. D. Ross objects to Kant&#x27;s monistic deontology, which bases ethics in only one foundational principle, the categorical imperative. He contends that there is a plurality (7, although this number is seen to vary to interpretation) of prima facie duties determining what is right.

These duties are identified by W. D. Ross:

# &quot;the duty of fidelity&quot; (to keep promises and to tell the truth)
# &quot;the duty of reparation&quot; (to make amends for wrongful acts) 
# &quot;the duty of gratitude&quot; (to return kindnesses received)
# &quot;the duty of non-injury&quot; (not to hurt others)
# &quot;the duty of beneficence&quot; (to promote the maximum of aggregate good)
# &quot;the duty of self-improvement&quot; (to improve one&#x27;s own condition)
# &quot;the duty of justice&quot; (to distribute benefits and burdens equably). 

One problem the deontological pluralist has to face is that cases can arise where the demands of one duty violate another duty, so-called moral dilemmas. For example, there are cases where it is necessary to break a promise in order to relieve someone&#x27;s distress. Ross makes use of the distinction between &quot;prima facie duties&quot; and &quot;absolute duty&quot; to solve this problem. The duties listed above are &quot;prima facie duties&quot; (moral actions that are required unless a greater obligation trumps them); they are general principles whose validity is self-evident to morally mature persons.They are factors that do not take all considerations into account. &quot;Absolute duty&quot;, on the other hand, is particular to one specific situation, taking everything into account, and has to be judged on a case-by-case basis. It is &quot;absolute duty&quot; that determines which acts are right or wrong.

===Contemporary deontology===
Contemporary deontologists (i.e., scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include Józef Maria Bocheński, Thomas Nagel, T. M. Scanlon, and Roger Scruton.

Bocheński (1965) makes a distinction between &quot;deontic&quot; and &quot;epistemic&quot; authority:

* A typical example of epistemic authority in Bocheński&#x27;s usage would be &quot;the relation of a teacher to her students.&quot; A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey.
* An example of deontic authority would be &quot;the relation between an employer and her employee.&quot; An employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.

Scruton (2017), in his book &quot;On Human Nature&quot;, is critical of consequentialism and similar ethical theories, such as hedonism and utilitarianism, instead proposing a deontological ethical approach. He implies that proportional duty and obligation are essential components of the ways in which we decide to act, and he defends natural law against opposing theories. He also expresses admiration for virtue ethics, and believes that the two ethical theories are not, as is frequently portrayed, mutually exclusive.

===Deontology and consequentialism===
==== Principle of permissible harm ====
Frances Kamm&#x27;s &quot;Principle of Permissible Harm&quot; (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint that coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative. The principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people&#x27;s considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. For instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five innocent, immobile people, onto a sidetrack where only one innocent and immobile person will be killed. Kamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends—such as in the organ harvesting case.

In 2007, Kamm published &quot;Intricate Ethics&quot;, a book that presents a new theory, the &quot;Doctrine of Productive Purity&quot;, that incorporates aspects of her &quot;Principle of Permissible Harm&quot;. Like the &quot;Principle&quot;, the &quot;Doctrine of Productive Purity&quot; is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.

==== Reconciling deontology with consequentialism ====
Various attempts have been made to reconcile deontology with consequentialism. Threshold deontology holds that rules ought to govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the consequences become so dire that they cross a stipulated threshold, consequentialism takes over. Theories put forth by Thomas Nagel and Michael S. Moore attempt to reconcile deontology with consequentialism by assigning each a jurisdiction. Iain King&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot; uses quasi-realism and a modified form of utilitarianism to develop deontological principles that are compatible with ethics based on virtues and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which is more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book.

===Secular deontology===

Intuition-based deontology is a concept within secular ethics. A classical example of literature on secular ethics is the Kural text, authored by the ancient Tamil Indian philosopher Valluvar. It can be argued that some concepts from deontological ethics date back to this text. Concerning ethical intuitionism, 20th century philosopher C.D. Broad coined the term &quot;deontological ethics&quot; to refer to the normative doctrines associated with intuitionism, leaving the phrase &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; free to refer to the epistemological doctrines.

<doc id="296060" wikidata="Q1137397" url="?curid=296060" title="Vacuum expectation value">
<text>In quantum field theory the vacuum expectation value (also called condensate or simply VEV) of an operator is its average or expectation value in the vacuum. The vacuum expectation value of an operator O is usually denoted by formula_1 One of the most widely used examples of an observable physical effect that results from the vacuum expectation value of an operator is the Casimir effect.

This concept is important for working with correlation functions in quantum field theory. It is also important in spontaneous symmetry breaking. Examples are:
*The Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value of 246 GeV. This nonzero value underlies the Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model. This value is given by formula_2, where &quot;MW&quot; is the mass of the W Boson, formula_3 the reduced Fermi constant, and the weak isospin coupling, in natural units. It is also near the limit of the most massive nuclei, at v = 264.3 Da.
*The chiral condensate in quantum chromodynamics, about a factor of a thousand smaller than the above, gives a large effective mass to quarks, and distinguishes between phases of quark matter. This underlies the bulk of the mass of most hadrons.
*The gluon condensate in quantum chromodynamics may also be partly responsible for masses of hadrons.

The observed Lorentz invariance of space-time allows only the formation of condensates which are Lorentz scalars and have vanishing charge. Thus, fermion condensates must be of the form formula_4, where ψ is the fermion field. Similarly a tensor field, Gμν, can only have a scalar expectation value such as formula_5.

In some vacua of string theory, however, non-scalar condensates are found. If these describe our universe, then Lorentz symmetry violation may be observable.

<text>Legal realism is a naturalistic approach to law; it is the view that jurisprudence should emulate the methods of natural science; that is, it should rely on empirical evidence. Hypotheses must be tested against observations of the world.

Legal realists believe that legal science should only investigate law with the value-free methods of natural sciences, rather than through philosophical inquiries into the nature and meaning of the law that are separate and distinct from the law as it is actually practiced. Indeed, legal realism asserts that the law cannot be separated from its application, nor can it be understood outside of its application. As such, legal realism emphasizes law as it actually exists, rather than law as it ought to be. Locating the meaning of law in places such as legal opinions issued by judges and their deference to or dismissal of precedent and the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, it stresses the importance of understanding the factors involved in judicial decision-making. 

In Scandinavia Axel Hägerström developed another realist tradition that was influential in European jurisprudential circles for most of the 20th century.

==Overview==

Legal realism is associated with American jurisprudence during the 1920s and 1930s, particularly among federal judges and lawyers within the Roosevelt administration. Notable jurists associated with legal realism include Felix Cohen, Morris Cohen, Arthur Corbin, Walter Wheeler Cook, Robert Hale, Wesley Hohfeld, Karl Llewellyn, Underhill Moore, Herman Oliphant and Warren Seavey, many of whom were associated with Yale Law School. As Keith Bybee argues, &quot;legal realism exposed the role played by politics in judicial decision-making and, in doing so, called into question conventional efforts to anchor judicial power on a fixed, impartial foundation.&quot; Contemporary legal scholars working within the Law and Society tradition have expanded upon the foundations set by legal realism to postulate what has been referred to as new legal realism.

As a form of jurisprudence, legal realism is defined by its focus on the law as it actually exists in practice, rather than how it exists in books. To this end, it was primarily concerned with the actions of judges and the factors that influenced processes of judicial decision making. As Karl Llewellyn argues, “[b]ehind decisions stand judges; judges are men; as men they have human backgrounds.” The law, therefore, did not exist in a metaphysical realm of fundamental rules or principles, but was inseparable from human action and the power of judges to determine the law. In order to understand the decisions and actions of legal actors, legal realists turned to the ideas of the social sciences in order to understand the human behavior and relationships that culminated in a given legal outcome.

American legal realists believe that there is more to adjudication than the &quot;mechanical&quot; application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding in line with the arguments of legal formalism. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and law identified in the judge&#x27;s reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge&#x27;s reasons can often be relied upon, but not always. Realists believe that the legal principles that legal formalism treats as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.

Due to their value-free approach, legal realists oppose natural law traditions. Legal realists contend that these traditions are historical and social phenomena and should be explained by psychological and sociological hypotheses, conceiving of legal phenomena as determined by human behavior that should be investigated empirically, rather than according to theoretical assumptions about the law. 

Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to H. L. A. Hart&#x27;s misunderstanding of the theory. Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in the conceptual analysis of concepts such as &quot;law.&quot; This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept of &quot;law.&quot; When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept of &quot;law.&quot; Legal theorists tend to recognize that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges&#x27; decisions with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.

Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the legal formalism of the late 19th century and early 20th century and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said, so that it is often said that &quot;we are all realists now.&quot; However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.

A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century is broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually &quot;do&quot; in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing. The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don&#x27;t make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules. American legal realism has aptly been described as &quot;the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century&quot;.

==Forerunners==
Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as Roscoe Pound, John Chipman Gray, and Benjamin Cardozo. Philosophers such as John Dewey had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general &quot;revolt against formalism,&quot; a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences. But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

===Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.===
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous prediction theory of law, his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his &quot;realist&quot; insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, prejudices, and experience. In the opening paragraph of &quot;The Common Law&quot;, he wrote:The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, and even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation&#x27;s development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.

All these themes can be found in Holmes&#x27;s famous 1897 essay, &quot;The Path of the Law&quot;. There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision-making and states a pragmatic definition of law: &quot;The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law&quot;. If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of &quot;text writers&quot; who tell us that law &quot;is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions&quot;.

Holmes introduced the &quot;bad-man&quot; theory of law: &quot;[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws&quot; about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, &quot;legal duty&quot; signifies only &quot;a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment&quot;. The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of pragmatism, Holmes suggests that this is a useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.

The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of &quot;The Path of the Law&quot; also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: &quot;I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.&quot; Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor. One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it. For example, in his dissent in &quot;Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen&quot;, Holmes wrote, &quot;The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky, but the articulate voice of some sovereign ... that can be identified,&quot; thereby arguing in favor of a pragmatic and more realistic approach to judicial interpretation of common law.

==Key themes==
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank, Herman Oliphant, Underhill Moore, Walter Wheeler Cook, Leon Green, and Felix Cohen. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

* &quot;A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law&quot;. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically. Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably &quot;indeterminate&quot;.
* &quot;A belief in the instrumental nature of the law&quot;. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.
* &quot;A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law&quot;. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms. The idea that legal talk of &quot;duty&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into &quot;realistic&quot; talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.

==Criticisms==
In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of &quot;reasoned elaboration&quot; and claimed that appeals to &quot;legislative purpose&quot; and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book &quot;The Concept of Law&quot;, British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a &quot;decisive blow&quot; to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, &quot;How will I decide this case?&quot; As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to &quot;guide&quot; their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.

Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is &quot;riddled&quot; with gaps, contradictions, and so forth. Other critics, such as Ronald Dworkin and Lon Fuller, have faulted legal realists for their attempt to sharply separate law and morality.

==Influence and continuing relevance==
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute &quot;formalist&quot; or &quot;mechanical&quot; notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about judicial activism and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to &quot;make law&quot;, as opposed to merely &quot;following&quot; or &quot;applying&quot; existing law. But few would disagree with the realists&#x27; core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.

A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%. A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: &quot;In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases.&quot;

<text>Michael Stephen Levey (May 28, 1948 – August 2, 2003) was an American infomercial host. He was best known for hosting &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot;, a series of infomercials that aired on late night television from 1989 to 1997.

==Career==
A former electrical engineer and copy writer for mail advertisements, Levey started a Dial-A-Joke line in the 1970s called &quot;The Mainline&quot; in Los Angeles. In 1988, Levey and two partners founded Positive Response Television, a company that produced infomercials.

Levey rose to fame as the host of &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot;, a series of episodic infomercials that began airing in 1989. &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot; consisted of over 100 episodes and aired in more than 60 countries in 12 languages. His onscreen persona as the enthusiastic &quot;Sweater Man&quot; was often 
parodied in films like &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and on the comedy sketch series &quot;MADtv&quot;. Levey also appeared as himself on episodes of &quot;Sliders&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;.

At the height of his fame, Levey received 500 fan letters a week and was dubbed &quot;the most viewed person on television&quot;. The success of the &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot; infomercials also led to a spin-off infomercial series titled &quot;Ask Mike&quot;. Levey&#x27;s company, Positive Response Television, was bought by National Media in 1997. &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot; aired its final episode the following year.

==Death==
On August 2, 2003, Levey died from cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His private memorial was held on August 6 at Mount Sinai Memorial Park. He was survived by his wife Lisa Levey and their three children.

<doc id="296071" wikidata="Q1225106" url="?curid=296071" title="Raphael Semmes">
<text>Raphael Semmes ( ; September 27, 1809 – August 30, 1877) was an officer in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. He had served as an officer in the United States Navy from 1826 to 1860.

During the American Civil War, Semmes was captain of the cruiser , the most successful commerce raider in maritime history, taking 65 prizes. Late in the war, he was promoted to rear admiral. He also acted as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army from April 5 to April 26, 1865, although this appointment was never submitted to or officially confirmed by the Confederate Senate.

== Early life and education ==
Semmes was born in Charles County, Maryland, on Tayloe&#x27;s Neck. He was a cousin of future Confederate general Paul Jones Semmes and of future Union Navy Captain Alexander Alderman Semmes.

He graduated from Charlotte Hall Military Academy
and entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in 1826. Semmes first served on the &quot;Lexington,&quot; cruising the Caribbean and the Mediterranean until September 1826, when he was placed on leave for ill health. After a short convalescence, he served on the USS &quot;Erie&quot; for part of 1829 and on the USS &quot;Brandywine&quot; (formerly &quot;Susquehanna&quot;) for the rest of 1829 and the first nine months of the following year. On September 29, 1830, he was posted to the USS &quot;Porpoise&quot; of the West Indies squadron, which was attempting to suppress piracy in the Caribbean. Semmes then studied law and was admitted to the bar. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1837.

== Career ==
During the Mexican–American War, he commanded the in the Gulf of Mexico. In December 1846, a squall hit the ship while under full sail in pursuit of a vessel off Veracruz. &quot;Somers&quot; capsized and was lost along with 37 sailors. Semmes then served as first lieutenant on the , accompanied the landing force at Veracruz, and was dispatched inland to catch up with Army forces proceeding to Mexico City.

Following the war, Semmes went on extended leave at Mobile, Alabama, where he practiced law and wrote &quot;Service Afloat and Ashore During the Mexican War&quot;. He became extremely popular, and the nearby town of Semmes, Alabama, was named after him. He also maintained a home in Josephine, Alabama, on Perdido Bay. He was promoted to commander in 1855 and was assigned to lighthouse duties until 1860. After Alabama seceded from the Union, Semmes was offered a Confederate naval appointment by the provisional government; he resigned from the U.S. Navy the next day, February 15, 1861.

=== Confederate service ===

After appointment to the Confederate Navy as a commander and a futile assignment to purchase arms in the North, Semmes was sent to New Orleans to convert the steamer &quot;Habana&quot; into the cruiser/commerce raider . In June 1861, Semmes, in &quot;Sumter&quot;, outran the , breaching the Union blockade of New Orleans, and then launched a brilliant career as one of the greatest commerce raider captains in naval history.

Semmes&#x27; command of CSS &quot;Sumter&quot; lasted only six months, but during that time he ranged wide, raiding US commercial shipping in both the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean; his actions accounted for the loss of 18 merchant vessels, while always eluding pursuit by Union warships. By January 1862, &quot;Sumter&quot; required a major overhaul. Semmes&#x27; crew surveyed the vessel while in neutral Gibraltar and determined that the repairs to her boilers were too extensive to be completed there. Semmes paid off the crew and laid up the vessel. US Navy vessels maintained a vigil outside the harbor until she was disarmed and sold at auction in December 1862, eventually being renamed and converted to a blockade runner.

Semmes and several of his officers traveled to England, where he was promoted to captain. He then was ordered to the Azores to take up command and oversee the coaling and outfitting with cannon of the newly built British steamer &quot;Enrica&quot; as a sloop-of-war, which thereafter became the Confederate commerce raider . Semmes sailed on &quot;Alabama&quot; from August 1862 to June 1864. His operations carried him from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico, around Africa&#x27;s Cape of Good Hope, and into the Pacific to the East Indies. During this cruise, &quot;Alabama&quot; captured 65 US merchantmen and quickly destroyed the , off Galveston.

&quot;Alabama&quot; finally sailed back to the Atlantic and made port in Cherbourg, France, for a much-needed overhaul; she was soon blockaded by the pursuing Union steam sloop-of-war . Captain Semmes took &quot;Alabama&quot; out on June 19, 1864, and met the similar &quot;Kearsarge&quot; in one of the most famous naval engagements of the Civil War.

The commander of &quot;Kearsarge&quot; had, while in port at the Azores the year before, turned his warship into a makeshift partial ironclad; of the ship&#x27;s port and starboard midsection were stepped-up-and-down to the waterline with overlapping rows of heavy chain armor, hidden behind black-painted wooden deal board covers. &quot;Alabama&quot;″s much-too-rapid gunnery and misplaced aim, combined with the deteriorated state of her gunpowder and shell fuses, enabled a victory for both of &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s Dahlgren smoothbore cannon. While &quot;Alabama&quot; opened fire at long range, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; steamed straight at her, exposing the Union sloop-of-war to potentially devastating raking fire. In their haste, however, &quot;Alabama&#x27;s&quot; gunners fired many shells too high.

At , &quot;Kearsarge&quot; turned broadside to engage and opened fire. Soon the heavy Dahlgren cannon began to find their mark. After receiving a fatal shell to the starboard waterline, which tore open a portion of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s hull, causing her steam engine to explode from the shell&#x27;s impact, Semmes was forced to order the striking of his ship&#x27;s Stainless Banner battle ensign and later to display a hand-held white flag of surrender to finally halt the engagement.

As the commerce raider was going down by the stern, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; stood off at a distance and observed at the orders of her captain, John Ancrum Winslow, who eventually sent rescue boats for survivors after taking aboard &quot;Alabama&quot; survivors from one of the raider&#x27;s two surviving longboats. As his command sank, the wounded Semmes threw his sword into the sea, depriving &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s Winslow of the traditional surrender ceremony of having it handed over to him as victor. Semmes was eventually rescued, along with 41 of his crewmen, by the British yacht &quot;Deerhound&quot; and three French pilot boats. He and his men were taken to England where all but one recovered; while there they were hailed as naval heroes, despite the loss of &quot;Alabama.&quot;
From England, Semmes made his way back to America via Cuba and from there a safe shore landing on the Texas gulf coast. It took his small party many weeks of journeying through the war-devastated South before he was finally able to make his way to the Confederate capital. He was promoted to rear admiral in February 1865, and during the last months of the war he commanded the boxed-in James River Squadron from his flagship, the heavily armored ironclad .

With the fall of Richmond, in April 1865, Semmes supervised the destruction of all the squadron&#x27;s nearby warships and thereafter acted as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army, the implication being that he was appointed to that grade. Historians John and David Eicher show Semmes as appointed to the grade of temporary brigadier general (unconfirmed) on April 5, 1865.

Semmes&#x27; appointment as a brigadier general was at most an informal arrangement made four days before General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse on April 9, 1865. That appointment was not and could not have been submitted to or confirmed by the Confederate Senate, since the Second Confederate Congress adjourned for the last time on March 18, 1865. Historian Bruce Allardice notes that Semmes was vague about this appointment in his memoirs and considered his naval rank of rear admiral to be the equivalent of a brigadier general.

After the destruction of the naval squadron, Semmes&#x27; sailors were turned into an infantry unit and dubbed the &quot;Naval Brigade&quot;; Semmes was then placed in command. His intention for the brigade was to join Lee&#x27;s army after burning their vessels. Lee&#x27;s army, however, was already cut off from Richmond, so most of Semmes&#x27; men boarded a train and escaped to join General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army in North Carolina. A few men of the Naval Brigade were able to join with Lee&#x27;s rear guard and fought at the Battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek.

Semmes and the Naval Brigade were surrendered to Union Major General William T. Sherman with Johnston&#x27;s army at Bennett Place near Durham Station, North Carolina; he was subsequently paroled on May 1, 1865. Semmes&#x27; parole notes that he held commissions as both a brigadier general and rear admiral in the Confederate service when he surrendered with General Johnston&#x27;s army. He insisted on his parole being written to include the brigadier general commission in anticipation of being charged with piracy by the United States government.

=== After the war ===
The U.S. briefly held Semmes as a prisoner after the war, but released him again on a second parole, then later rearrested him for treason on December 15, 1865. After a good deal of behind-the-scenes of legal and political machinations, all charges were eventually dropped, and he was released on April 7, 1866. 

In October 1866, the Louisiana State Seminary (today&#x27;s Louisiana State University) offered Semmes a position as Professor of Moral Philosophy and English Literature. The position paid $3,000 per year. Semmes assumed this role on January 1, 1867. His fellow faculty-members described him as &quot;dignified and easy to talk with&quot;. His teaching consisted mainly of formal lectures, with very little open discussion or questions. After only five months on campus, Semmes resigned from academia to take over as editor of the &quot;Memphis Bulletin&quot; newspaper in Memphis, Tennessee.

He defended his actions of warfare at sea and the political actions of the seceded southern states in his 1869 &quot;Memoirs of Service Afloat During The War Between the States&quot;. The book was viewed by some, including &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, as one of the most cogent but bitter defenses of the South&#x27;s &quot;Lost Cause&quot;. Semmes is credited with helping to popularize the term “War Between the States&quot;.

In 1871, the citizens of Mobile presented Semmes with the Raphael Semmes House, an 1858 brick townhouse at 804 Government Street. He lived there until he died in 1877, from complications that followed food poisoning from eating some contaminated shrimp. Semmes was interred in Mobile&#x27;s Old Catholic Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Semmes is a member of the Alabama Hall of Fame. One of the streets on the current Louisiana State University campus once carried his full name, as does Semmes Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. A life-sized statue of Admiral Semmes was removed by the city of Mobile early on June 5, 2020. A suburban area of western Mobile County is named for him, as well as a hotel in downtown Mobile, The Admiral Hotel.

When Semmes returned to the South from England, he brought a ceremonial &quot;Stainless Banner&quot; (the second national flag of the Confederacy, used 1863-1865) with him. It was inherited by his grandchildren, Raphael Semmes III and Mrs. Eunice Semmes Thorington. After his sister&#x27;s death, Raphael Semmes III donated the ensign to the state of Alabama on September 19, 1929. Today, the battle ensign resides in the collection of the Alabama Department of Archives and History among its Confederate Naval collection, listed as &quot;Admiral Semmes&#x27; Flag, Catalogue No. 86.1893.1 (PN10149-10150)&quot;. Their provenance reconstruction shows that it was presented to Semmes in England sometime after the sinking of the &quot;Alabama&quot; by &quot;Lady Dehogton and other English ladies&quot;.

== Claimed references to Semmes in literature ==

In 1998, William Butcher identified a possible link between the Birkenhead, England-built CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and Captain Nemo&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot; from the 1869 Jules Verne novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.&quot; Butcher said, &quot;The Alabama, which claimed to have sunk 75 merchantmen, was destroyed by the Unionist Kearsarge off Cherbourg on 11th June 1864….This battle has clear connections with Nemo’s final attack, also in the English Channel.&quot; Verne had himself made a comparison between the &quot;Alabama&quot; and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; in a letter to his publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel in March 1869. Other authors have made further arguments, including connections to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1883 adventure novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

<text>The Westminster Quarters, from its use at the Palace of Westminster, is a melody used by a set of four quarter bells to mark each quarter-hour. It is also known as the Westminster Chimes, Cambridge Quarters, or Cambridge Chimes, from its place of origin, the Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge.

==Description==

The Westminster Quarters are sounded by four quarter bells hung next to Big Ben in the Elizabeth Tower belfry in the Palace of Westminster. These are:
The quarters consist of five changes, permutations of the four pitches provided by these quarter bells (G4, F4, E4, B3) in the key E major. This generates five unique changes as follows: 

# G4, F4, E4, B3
# E4, G4, F4, B3
# E4, F4, G4, E4
# G4, E4, F4, B3
# B3, F4, G4, E4

Each of the five changes is played as three crotchets (quarter note) and a minim (half note) and are always played in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This sequence of five changes is used twice every hour as follows:

:First quarter, change 1.
:Half hour, changes 2 and 3.
:Third quarter, changes 4, 5 and 1
:The full hour, changes 2, 3, 4 and 5 followed by one strike for each hour past 12 midnight or 12 noon struck on the Great Bell known as Big Ben in E3.
The number of changes used matches the number of quarter hours passed.

Because the five changes are used twice, and in the same sequence, the mechanism that trips the hammers needs to be programmed with only five changes instead of ten, reducing its complexity.

Both the third quarter and the full hour require the fourth quarter bell, B3, to be rung twice in quick succession (changes 4,5,1 and 2,3,4,5); too quick for the hammer to draw back for the second strike. To address this, the fourth quarter bell is equipped with two hammers on opposite sides and becomes, effectively, a fifth bell for the mechanism to play.

The first and third quarters finish on the dominant, B, while the half and full hours finish on the tonic, E, producing the satisfying musical effect that has contributed to the popularity of the chimes.

The following sounds have been recreated as electronic, MIDI files and do not necessarily represent the actual sounds of the bells and that the pitch of the Big Ben clip is closer to F than E in modern concert pitch. An actual recording may be heard in the summary section above.

&lt;/score&gt;
|Half-hour:
|&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;tubular bells&quot; \time 5/4 \key e \major e4^&quot;2&quot; gis fis b,2 | e4^&quot;3&quot; fis gis e2\bar &quot;|.&quot;|}&lt;/score&gt;
|Third quarter:
|&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;tubular bells&quot; \time 5/4 \key e \major gis4^&quot;4&quot; e fis b,2 | b4^&quot;5&quot; fis&#x27; gis e2 | gis4^&quot;1&quot; fis e b2\bar &quot;|.&quot;|}&lt;/score&gt;
|Full hour (3 o&#x27;clock example):
|&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;tubular bells&quot; \time 5/4 \key e \major e4^&quot;2&quot; gis fis b,2 | e4^&quot;3&quot; fis gis e2 | gis4^&quot;4&quot; e fis b,2 | b4^&quot;5&quot; fis&#x27; gis e2 | R1*5/4\fermata \bar &quot;||&quot; \clef bass \time 4/4 e,1^&quot;Big Ben&quot; | e1| e1 \bar &quot;|.&quot;| }&lt;/score&gt;

==Words associated with the melody==
The prayer inscribed on a plaque in the Big Ben clock room reads:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;All through this hour
Lord be my guide
That by Thy power
No foot shall slide.&lt;/poem&gt;

The conventional prayer is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;O Lord our God
Be Thou our guide
That by Thy help
No foot may slide.&lt;/poem&gt;

An alternative prayer changes the third line:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;O Lord our God
Be Thou our guide
So by Thy power
No foot shall slide.&lt;/poem&gt;

A variation on this, to the same tune, is prayed at the end of Brownie meetings in the UK and Canada:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;O Lord our God
Thy children call
Grant us Thy peace
And bless us all. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

==History==
The Westminster Quarters were originally written in 1793 for a new clock in Great St Mary&#x27;s, the University Church in Cambridge. There is some doubt over exactly who composed it: Joseph Jowett, Regius Professor of Civil Law, was given the job, but he was probably assisted by either John Randall (1715–1799), who was the Professor of Music from 1755, or his undergraduate pupil, William Crotch (1775–1847). This chime is traditionally, though without substantiation, believed to be a set of variations on the four notes that make up the fifth and sixth bars of &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. This is why the chime is also played by the bells of the so-called &quot;Red Tower&quot; in Halle, the native town of Handel.

In 1851, the chime was adopted by Edmund Beckett Denison (an amateur horologist, and graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, who was familiar with the Great St Mary&#x27;s chime) for the new clock at the Palace of Westminster, where the bell Big Ben hangs. From there its fame spread. It is now one of the most commonly used chimes for striking clocks.

According to the church records of Trinity Episcopal Church (Williamsport, Pennsylvania), this chime sequence was incorporated into a tower clock mechanism by E. Howard &amp; Co., Boston, Massachusetts. The clock and chime in Trinity&#x27;s steeple base was dedicated in December 1875. It holds the distinction of being the first tower clock in the United States to sound the Cambridge Quarters.

==Other uses==
* &quot;A London Symphony&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams incorporates the half-hour changes, 2 and 3, near the beginning of the work and the first three changes of the hour, 2, 3 and 4, near the end.
* Light music composer Eric Coates incorporated the music into &quot;Westminster&quot;, the Meditation and second part of his &quot;London Suite&quot; (1933).
* &quot;The Westminster Waltz&quot;, a light orchestral piece by Robert Farnon (1956) uses the music of the chimes.
* The theme music by Ronnie Hazlehurst for the satirical TV series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (1980–1984) and its sequel &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (1986–1988), about a British politician and his interactions with the civil servants who nominally serve him, is largely based on the chimes (though with a longer duration for the first note of each quarter, which arguably makes the derivation less obvious). When asked in an interview about its Westminster influence, Hazlehurst replied, &quot;That&#x27;s all it is. It&#x27;s the easiest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;
* A piece called &quot;Carillon de Westminster&quot; based on the chimes was written for organ by the French composer and organist Louis Vierne.
* The song &quot;11 O&#x27;Clock Tick Tock&quot; (1980) by rock band U2 incorporates the Third Quarter chime as a guitar harmonic.
* The song &quot;Clock Strikes Ten&quot; by Cheap Trick incorporates a guitar solo based on changes 4 and 5.

* The song &quot;Cider&quot;, , by Akai Ko-en (2014) incorporates the Third Quarter chime.

* A composition based on the chimes was written in the &quot;ladrang&quot; form for central Javanese gamelan. It is named variously as &quot;ladrang Wesminster&quot;, &quot;ladrang Wesmister&quot;, &quot;ladrang Wèsmèster&quot;, etc.
* The football chant known as &quot;Pompey&quot; by local association football fans in Portsmouth, England, is a variation of the Westminster Quarters. &quot;Pompey&quot; is the nickname of the city of Portsmouth and the &quot;Pompey Chimes&quot; chant originated from the nearby chiming clock of Portsmouth Guildhall built in 1890.
* At Yankee Stadium, the chimes are played whenever a member of the New York Yankees scores a run, a tradition that began at their original ballpark (the beginning of &quot;Workaholic&quot; by 2 Unlimited).
* Indonesian train stations play the chimes as a sign of train departures and arrivals. Upon arrival, the chimes are looped continuously until departure, which may last up to 15 minutes.
* Most schools in Japan and Taiwan play the chimes to signal the end and beginning of classes.
* At the close of the Warner Bros. cartoons &quot;Now Hear This&quot; (1963), the first four notes of the Westminster Quarters play to bring on the four elements of the abstract &quot;WB&quot; lettering, then as the words &quot;A Warner Bros. CartOOn&quot; scroll appear, Big Ben chimes, and then as the letters &quot;OO&quot; in &quot;Cartoon&quot; separate from the words, a bicycle horn is heard squeaking three times. Big Ben gives one more chime as the words finish appearing on the screen before the fadeout.
* The chime can be heard in the 6 o’clock victory screens of several &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; games, specifically in games &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Custom Night&quot;.
* The Academy Battle theme in &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; for the Nintendo 64 begins with the half-hour change.
* For the millennium New Year, a recording of the clock was released by London Records in 1999, titled &quot;Millennium Chimes&quot;, with the artist labelled as Big Ben. It reached number 53 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 8 January 2000 (which included purchases prior to 31 December 1999).
* The Dutch progressive rock band Focus (band) quotes the Third Quarter chime at the end of the title song from their 1974 Hamburger Concerto album.

<text>An instanton (or pseudoparticle) is a notion appearing in theoretical and mathematical physics. An instanton is a classical solution to equations of motion with a finite, non-zero action, either in quantum mechanics or in quantum field theory. More precisely, it is a solution to the equations of motion of the classical field theory on a Euclidean spacetime.

In such quantum theories, solutions to the equations of motion may be thought of as critical points of the action. The critical points of the action may be local maxima of the action, local minima, or saddle points. Instantons are important in quantum field theory because:

* they appear in the path integral as the leading quantum corrections to the classical behavior of a system, and
* they can be used to study the tunneling behavior in various systems such as a Yang–Mills theory.

Relevant to dynamics, families of instantons permit that instantons, i.e. different critical points of the equation of motion, be related to one another. In physics instantons are particularly important because the condensation of instantons (and noise-induced anti-instantons) is believed to be the explanation of the noise-induced chaotic phase known as self-organized criticality.

== Mathematics ==
Mathematically, a &quot;Yang–Mills instanton&quot; is a self-dual or anti-self-dual connection in a principal bundle over a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold that plays the role of physical space-time in non-abelian gauge theory. Instantons are topologically nontrivial solutions of Yang–Mills equations that absolutely minimize the energy functional within their topological type. The first such solutions were discovered in the case of four-dimensional Euclidean space compactified to the four-dimensional sphere, and turned out to be localized in space-time, prompting the names &quot;pseudoparticle&quot; and &quot;instanton&quot;.

Yang–Mills instantons have been explicitly constructed in many cases by means of twistor theory, which relates them to algebraic vector bundles on algebraic surfaces, and via the ADHM construction, or hyperkähler reduction (see hyperkähler manifold), a geometric invariant theory procedure. The groundbreaking work of Simon Donaldson, for which he was later awarded the Fields medal, used the moduli space of instantons over a given four-dimensional differentiable manifold as a new invariant of the manifold that depends on its differentiable structure and applied it to the construction of homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic four-manifolds. Many methods developed in studying instantons have also been applied to monopoles. This is because magnetic monopoles arise as solutions of a dimensional reduction of the Yang–Mills equations.

== Quantum mechanics ==
An &quot;instanton&quot; can be used to calculate the transition probability for a quantum mechanical particle tunneling through a potential barrier. One example of a system with an &quot;instanton&quot; effect is a particle in a double-well potential. In contrast to a classical particle, there is non-vanishing probability that it crosses a region of potential energy higher than its own energy.

=== Motivation of considering instantons ===
Consider the quantum mechanics of a single particle motion inside the double-well potential formula_1
The potential energy takes its minimal value at formula_2, and these are called classical minima because the particle tends to lie in one of them in classical mechanics. There are two lowest energy states in classical mechanics.

In quantum mechanics, we solve the Schrödinger equation

:formula_3

to identify the energy eigenstates. If we do this, we will find only the unique lowest-energy state instead of two states. The ground-state wave function localizes at both of the classical minima formula_2 instead of only one of them because of the quantum interference or quantum tunneling.

Instantons are the tool to understand why this happens within the semi-classical approximation of the path-integral formulation in Euclidean time. We will first see this by using the WKB approximation that approximately computes the wave function itself, and will move on to introduce instantons by using the path integral formulation.

=== WKB approximation ===
One way to calculate this probability is by means of the semi-classical WKB approximation, which requires the value of formula_5 to be small. The time independent Schrödinger equation for the particle reads

:formula_6

If the potential were constant, the solution would be a plane wave, up to a proportionality factor,

:formula_7

with

:formula_8

This means that if the energy of the particle is smaller than the potential energy, one obtains an exponentially decreasing function. The associated tunneling amplitude is proportional to

:formula_9

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the beginning and endpoint of the tunneling trajectory.

=== Path integral interpretation via instantons ===
Alternatively, the use of path integrals allows an &quot;instanton&quot; interpretation and the same result can be obtained with this approach. In path integral formulation, the transition amplitude can be expressed as

:formula_10

Following the process of Wick rotation (analytic continuation) to Euclidean spacetime (formula_11), one gets

:formula_12

with the Euclidean action

:formula_13

The potential energy changes sign formula_14 under the Wick rotation and the minima transform into maxima, thereby formula_15 exhibits two &quot;hills&quot; of maximal energy.

Let us now consider the local minimum of the Euclidean action formula_16 with the double-well potential formula_17, and we set formula_18 just for simplicity of computation. Since we want to know how the two classically lowest energy states formula_19 are connected, let us set formula_20 and formula_21. 
For formula_20 and formula_23, we can rewrite the Euclidean action as

:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26

The above inequality is saturated by the solution of formula_27 with the condition formula_28 and formula_29. Such solutions exist, and the solution takes the simple form when formula_30 and formula_31. The explicit formula for the instanton solution is given by

:formula_32

Here formula_33 is an arbitrary constant. Since this solution jumps from one classical vacuum formula_34 to another classical vacuum formula_35 instantaneously around formula_36, it is called an instanton.

=== Explicit formula for double-well potential===

The explicit formula for the eigenenergies of the Schrödinger equation with double-well potential has been given by Müller–Kirsten with derivation by both a perturbation method (plus boundary conditions) applied to the Schrödinger equation, and explicit derivation from the path integral (and WKB). The result is the following. Defining parameters of the Schrödinger equation and the potential by the equations

:formula_37

and

:formula_38

the eigenvalues for formula_39 are found to be:

:formula_40
:formula_41

Clearly these eigenvalues are asymptotically (formula_42) degenerate as expected as a consequence of the harmonic part of the potential.

=== Results ===
Results obtained from the mathematically well-defined Euclidean path integral may be Wick-rotated back and give the same physical results as would be obtained by appropriate treatment of the (potentially divergent) Minkowskian path integral. As can be seen from this example, calculating the transition probability for the particle to tunnel through a classically forbidden region (formula_43) with the Minkowskian path integral corresponds to calculating the transition probability to tunnel through a classically allowed region (with potential −&quot;V&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) in the Euclidean path integral (pictorially speaking – in the Euclidean picture – this transition corresponds to a particle rolling from one hill of a double-well potential standing on its head to the other hill). This classical solution of the Euclidean equations of motion is often named &quot;kink solution&quot; and is an example of an &quot;instanton&quot;. In this example, the two &quot;vacua&quot; (i.e. ground states) of the double-well potential, turn into hills in the Euclideanized version of the problem.

Thus, the &quot;instanton&quot; field solution of the (Euclidean, i. e., with imaginary time) (1 + 1)-dimensional field theory – first quantized quantum mechanical description – allows to be interpreted as a tunneling effect between the two vacua (ground states – higher states require periodic instantons) of the physical (1-dimensional space + real time) Minkowskian system. In the case of the double-well potential written

:formula_44

the instanton, i.e. solution of

:formula_45

(i.e. with energy formula_46), is

:formula_47

where formula_48 is the Euclidean time.

&quot;Note&quot; that a naïve perturbation theory around one of those two vacua alone (of the Minkowskian description) would never show this &quot;non-perturbative tunneling effect&quot;, dramatically changing the picture of the vacuum structure of this quantum mechanical system. In fact the naive perturbation theory has to be supplemented by boundary conditions, and these supply the nonperturbative effect, as is evident from the above explicit formula and analogous calculations for other potentials such as a cosine potential (cf. Mathieu function) or other periodic potentials (cf. e.g. Lamé function and spheroidal wave function) and irrespective of whether one uses the Schrödinger equation or the path integral.

Therefore, the perturbative approach may not completely describe the vacuum structure of a physical system. This may have important consequences, for example, in the theory of &quot;axions&quot; where the non-trivial QCD vacuum effects (like the &quot;instantons&quot;) spoil the Peccei–Quinn symmetry explicitly and transform massless Nambu–Goldstone bosons into massive pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone ones.

===Periodic instantons===

In one-dimensional field theory or quantum mechanics one defines as &quot;instanton&quot; a field configuration which is a solution of the classical (Newton-like) equation of motion with Euclidean time and finite Euclidean action. In the context of soliton theory the corresponding solution is known as a kink. In view of their analogy with the behaviour of classical particles such configurations or solutions, as well as others, are collectively known as pseudoparticles or pseudoclassical configurations. The &quot;instanton&quot; (kink) solution is accompanied by another solution known as &quot;anti-instanton&quot; (anti-kink), and instanton and anti-instanton are distinguished by &quot;topological charges&quot; +1 and −1 respectively, but have the same Euclidean action.

&quot;Periodic instantons&quot; are a generalization of instantons. In explicit form they are expressible in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions which are periodic functions (effectively generalisations of trigonometrical functions). In the limit of infinite period these periodic instantons – frequently known as &quot;bounces&quot;, &quot;bubbles&quot; or the like – reduce to instantons.

The stability of these pseudoclassical configurations can be investigated by expanding the Lagrangian defining the theory around the pseudoparticle configuration and then investigating the equation of small fluctuations around it. For all versions of quartic potentials (double-well, inverted double-well) and periodic (Mathieu) potentials these equations were discovered to be Lamé equations, see Lamé function. The eigenvalues of these equations are known and permit in the case of instability the calculation of decay rates by evaluation of the path integral.

=== Instantons in reaction rate theory ===
In the context of reaction rate theory, periodic instantons are used to calculate the rate of tunneling of atoms in chemical reactions. The progress of a chemical reaction can be described as the movement of a pseudoparticle on a high dimensional potential energy surface (PES). The thermal rate constant formula_49 can then be related to the imaginary part of the free energy formula_50 by

formula_51

whereby formula_52 is the canonical partition function, which is calculated by taking the trace of the Boltzmann operator in the position representation.

formula_53

Using a Wick rotation and identifying the Euclidean time with formula_54, one obtains a path integral representation for the partition function in mass-weighted coordinates:

formula_55

The path integral is then approximated via a steepest descent integration, which takes into account only the contributions from the classical solutions and quadratic fluctuations around them. This yields for the rate constant expression in mass-weighted coordinates

formula_56

where formula_57 is a periodic instanton and formula_58 is the trivial solution of the pseudoparticle at rest which represents the reactant state configuration.

===Inverted double-well formula===

As for the double-well potential one can derive the eigenvalues for the inverted double-well potential. In this case, however, the eigenvalues are complex. Defining parameters by the equations
:formula_59
the eigenvalues as given by Müller-Kirsten are, for formula_60
:formula_61
The imaginary part of this expression agrees with the well known result of Bender and Wu. In their notation formula_62

== Quantum field theory ==

In studying quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum structure of a theory may draw attention to instantons. Just as a double-well quantum mechanical system illustrates, a naïve vacuum may not be the true vacuum of a field theory. Moreover, the true vacuum of a field theory may be an &quot;overlap&quot; of several topologically inequivalent sectors, so called &quot;topological vacua&quot;.

A well understood and illustrative example of an &quot;instanton&quot; and its interpretation can be found in the context of a QFT with a non-abelian gauge group, a Yang–Mills theory. For a Yang–Mills theory these inequivalent sectors can be (in an appropriate gauge) classified by the third homotopy group of SU(2) (whose group manifold is the 3-sphere formula_63). A certain topological vacuum (a &quot;sector&quot; of the true vacuum) is labelled by an unaltered transform, the Pontryagin index. As the third homotopy group of formula_63 has been found to be the set of integers,

:formula_65formula_66formula_67

there are infinitely many topologically inequivalent vacua, denoted by formula_68, where formula_69 is their corresponding Pontryagin index. An &quot;instanton&quot; is a field configuration fulfilling the classical equations of motion in Euclidean spacetime, which is interpreted as a tunneling effect between these different topological vacua. It is again labelled by an integer number, its Pontryagin index, formula_70. One can imagine an &quot;instanton&quot; with index formula_70 to quantify tunneling between topological vacua formula_72 and formula_73. If &quot;Q&quot; = 1, the configuration is named BPST instanton after its discoverers Alexander Belavin, Alexander Polyakov, Albert S. Schwarz and Yu. S. Tyupkin. The true vacuum of the theory is labelled by an &quot;angle&quot; theta and is an overlap of the topological sectors:

:formula_74

Gerard &#x27;t Hooft first performed the field theoretic computation of the effects of the BPST instanton in a theory coupled to fermions in . He showed that zero modes of the Dirac equation in the instanton background lead to a non-perturbative multi-fermion interaction in the low energy effective action.

== Yang–Mills theory ==

The classical Yang–Mills action on a principal bundle with structure group &quot;G&quot;, base &quot;M&quot;, connection &quot;A&quot;, and curvature (Yang–Mills field tensor) &quot;F&quot; is

:formula_75

where formula_76 is the volume form on formula_77. If the inner product on formula_78, the Lie algebra of formula_79 in which formula_50 takes values, is given by the Killing form on formula_78, then this may be denoted as formula_82, since

:formula_83

For example, in the case of the gauge group U(1), &quot;F&quot; will be the electromagnetic field tensor. From the principle of stationary action, the Yang–Mills equations follow. They are

:formula_84

The first of these is an identity, because d&quot;F&quot; = d2&quot;A&quot; = 0, but the second is a second-order partial differential equation for the connection &quot;A&quot;, and if the Minkowski current vector does not vanish, the zero on the rhs. of the second equation is replaced by formula_85. But notice how similar these equations are; they differ by a Hodge star. Thus a solution to the simpler first order (non-linear) equation

:formula_86

is automatically also a solution of the Yang–Mills equation. This simplification occurs on 4 manifolds with :formula_87 so that formula_88 on 2-forms. Such solutions usually exist, although their precise character depends on the dimension and topology of the base space M, the principal bundle P, and the gauge group G.

In nonabelian Yang–Mills theories, formula_89 and formula_90 where D is the exterior covariant derivative. Furthermore, the Bianchi identity

:formula_91

is satisfied.

In quantum field theory, an &quot;instanton&quot; is a topologically nontrivial field configuration in four-dimensional Euclidean space (considered as the Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime). Specifically, it refers to a Yang–Mills gauge field &quot;A&quot; which approaches pure gauge at spatial infinity. This means the field strength

:formula_92

vanishes at infinity. The name &quot;instanton&quot; derives from the fact that these fields are localized in space and (Euclidean) time – in other words, at a specific instant.

The case of instantons on the two-dimensional space may be easier to visualise because it admits the simplest case of the gauge group, namely U(1), that is an abelian group. In this case the field &quot;A&quot; can be visualised as simply a vector field. An instanton is a configuration where, for example, the arrows point away from a central point (i.e., a &quot;hedgehog&quot; state). In Euclidean four dimensions, formula_93, abelian instantons are impossible.

The field configuration of an instanton is very different from that of the vacuum. Because of this instantons cannot be studied by using Feynman diagrams, which only include perturbative effects. Instantons are fundamentally non-perturbative.

The Yang–Mills energy is given by

:formula_94

where ∗ is the Hodge dual. If we insist that the solutions to the Yang–Mills equations have finite energy, then the curvature of the solution at infinity (taken as a limit) has to be zero. This means that the Chern–Simons invariant can be defined at the 3-space boundary. This is equivalent, via Stokes&#x27; theorem, to taking the integral

:formula_95

This is a homotopy invariant and it tells us which homotopy class the instanton belongs to.

Since the integral of a nonnegative integrand is always nonnegative,

:formula_96

for all real θ. So, this means

:formula_97

If this bound is saturated, then the solution is a BPS state. For such states, either ∗&quot;F&quot; = &quot;F&quot; or ∗&quot;F&quot; = − &quot;F&quot; depending on the sign of the homotopy invariant.

In the Standard Model instantons are expected to be present both in the electroweak sector and the chromodynamic sector, however, their existence has not yet been experimentally confirmed. Instanton effects are important in understanding the formation of condensates in the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and in explaining the mass of the so-called &#x27;eta-prime particle&#x27;, a Goldstone-boson which has acquired mass through the axial current anomaly of QCD. Note that there is sometimes also a corresponding soliton in a theory with one additional space dimension. Recent research on &quot;instantons&quot; links them to topics such as D-branes and Black holes and, of course, the vacuum structure of QCD. For example, in oriented string theories, a Dp brane is a gauge theory instanton in the world volume (&quot;p&quot; + 5)-dimensional &quot;U&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) gauge theory on a stack of &quot;N&quot; 
D(&quot;p&quot; + 4)-branes.

== Various numbers of dimensions ==

Instantons play a central role in the nonperturbative dynamics of gauge theories. The kind of physical excitation that yields an instanton depends on the number of dimensions of the spacetime, but, surprisingly, the formalism for dealing with these instantons is relatively dimension-independent.

In 4-dimensional gauge theories, as described in the previous section, instantons are gauge bundles with a nontrivial four-form characteristic class. If the gauge symmetry is a unitary group or special unitary group then this characteristic class is the second Chern class, which vanishes in the case of the gauge group U(1). If the gauge symmetry is an orthogonal group then this class is the first Pontrjagin class.

In 3-dimensional gauge theories with Higgs fields, &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopoles play the role of instantons. In his 1977 paper Quark Confinement and Topology of Gauge Groups, Alexander Polyakov demonstrated that instanton effects in 3-dimensional QED coupled to a scalar field lead to a mass for the photon.

In 2-dimensional abelian gauge theories worldsheet instantons are magnetic vortices. They are responsible for many nonperturbative effects in string theory, playing a central role in mirror symmetry.

In 1-dimensional quantum mechanics, instantons describe tunneling, which is invisible in perturbation theory.

== 4d supersymmetric gauge theories ==

Supersymmetric gauge theories often obey nonrenormalization theorems, which restrict the kinds of quantum corrections which are allowed. Many of these theorems only apply to corrections calculable in perturbation theory and so instantons, which are not seen in perturbation theory, provide the only corrections to these quantities.

Field theoretic techniques for instanton calculations in supersymmetric theories were extensively studied in the 1980s by multiple authors. Because supersymmetry guarantees the cancellation of fermionic vs. bosonic non-zero modes in the instanton background, the involved &#x27;t Hooft computation of the instanton saddle point reduces to an integration over zero modes.

In &quot;N&quot; = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories instantons can modify the superpotential, sometimes lifting all of the vacua. In 1984, Ian Affleck, Michael Dine and Nathan Seiberg calculated the instanton corrections to the superpotential in their paper Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric QCD. More precisely, they were only able to perform the calculation when the theory contains one less flavor of chiral matter than the number of colors in the special unitary gauge group, because in the presence of fewer flavors an unbroken nonabelian gauge symmetry leads to an infrared divergence and in the case of more flavors the contribution is equal to zero. For this special choice of chiral matter, the vacuum expectation values of the matter scalar fields can be chosen to completely break the gauge symmetry at weak coupling, allowing a reliable semi-classical saddle point calculation to proceed. By then considering perturbations by various mass terms they were able to calculate the superpotential in the presence of arbitrary numbers of colors and flavors, valid even when the theory is no longer weakly coupled.

In &quot;N&quot; = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories the superpotential receives no quantum corrections. However the correction to the metric of the moduli space of vacua from instantons was calculated in a series of papers. First, the one instanton correction was calculated by Nathan Seiberg in Supersymmetry and Nonperturbative beta Functions. The full set of corrections for SU(2) Yang–Mills theory was calculated by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten in &quot;Electric – magnetic duality, monopole condensation, and confinement in N=2 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory,&quot; in the process creating a subject that is today known as Seiberg–Witten theory. They extended their calculation to SU(2) gauge theories with fundamental matter in Monopoles, duality and chiral symmetry breaking in N=2 supersymmetric QCD. These results were later extended for various gauge groups and matter contents, and the direct gauge theory derivation was also obtained in most cases. For gauge theories with gauge group U(N) the Seiberg–Witten geometry has been derived from gauge theory using Nekrasov partition functions in 2003 by Nikita Nekrasov and Andrei Okounkov and independently by Hiraku Nakajima and Kota Yoshioka.

In &quot;N&quot; = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories the instantons do not lead to quantum corrections for the metric on the moduli space of vacua.

== Explicit solutions on R4 ==
An ansatz provided by Corrigan and Fairlie provides a solution to the anti-self dual Yang–Mills equations with gauge group SU(2) from any harmonic function on formula_93. The ansatz gives explicit expressions for the gauge field and can be used to construct solutions with arbitrarily large instanton number.

Defining the antisymmetric formula_99-valued objects formula_100 as
formula_101
where Greek indices run from 1 to 4, Latin indices run from 1 to 3, and formula_102 is a basis of formula_99 satisfying formula_104. Then
formula_105
is a solution as long as formula_106 is harmonic.

In four dimensions, the fundamental solution to Laplace&#x27;s equation is formula_107 for any fixed formula_108. Superposing formula_109 of these gives formula_69-soliton solutions of the form
formula_111
All solutions of instanton number 1 or 2 are of this form, but for larger instanton number there are solutions not of this form.

<text>A tunnelling shield is a protective structure used during the excavation of large, human-made tunnels. When excavating through ground that is soft, liquid, or otherwise unstable, there is a potential health and safety hazard to workers and the project itself from falling materials or a cave-in. A tunnelling shield can be used as a temporary support structure. It is usually in place for the short-term from when the tunnel section is excavated until it can be lined with a permanent support structure. The permanent structure may be made up of, depending on the period, bricks, concrete, cast iron, or steel. Although modern shields are commonly cylindrical, the first &quot;shield&quot;, designed by Marc Isambard Brunel, was actually a large, rectangular, scaffold-like iron structure with three levels and twelve sections per level, with a solid load-bearing top surface. The structure protected the men from cave-ins as they laboured within it, digging the tunnel out in front of the shield.

==History==
The first successful rectangular tunnelling shield was developed by Marc Isambard Brunel and patented by him and Lord Cochrane in January 1818. Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel used it to excavate the Thames Tunnel beginning in 1825 (though the tunnel was not opened until 1843). Brunel is said to have been inspired in his design by the shell of the shipworm, a mollusc whose efficiency at boring through submerged timber he observed while working in a shipyard. The shield was built by Maudslay, Sons &amp; Field of Lambeth, London, who also built the steam pumps for de-watering the tunnel.

In 1840, Alfred Ely Beach, editor of &quot;Scientific American&quot; journal, was the first to suggest a circular design would be superior to Brunel&#x27;s rectangular design. In 1868 Beach built a circular shield - a picture of which was printed in a New York news article about his pneumatic tunnel system idea. The design was based upon Brunel&#x27;s shield lattice and screw-jacked forwards as the face advanced manually.

In 1864 Peter W. Barlow applied for a design patent that had a circular cross-section. Theoretically this made the shield easier to build and better able to support surrounding soil; theoretically, because no shield was ever built using this design. The 1864 Barlow patent was further improved and given a provisional patent in 1868 but never ratified as Barlow died a short time afterwards.

Brunel&#x27;s original design was substantially improved upon by James Henry Greathead who was granted three patents for different shield designs. Additionally, he invented the concept of sprayed concrete grout to stabilise earthworks with injected concrete, a gritting pan that hydraulically injected reinforcing grout into the cavities between the constructed lining and the circular tunnel wall.

Greathead was the first to ever use a cylindrical tunnelling shield, which he did in the course of the construction of the Tower Subway under the River Thames in central London in 1869. The Greathead shield was in diameter. Similarly, Alfred Ely Beach opened his tunnel to the public on March 1, 1870

Greathead also used one in the construction of the City and South London Railway (today part of London Underground&#x27;s Northern line) in 1884, with tunnels in diameter. His shield was also used in the driving of the diameter running tunnels for the Waterloo &amp; City Railway which opened in 1898. The station tunnels at the City station (now known as Bank) were the largest diameter tunnelling shields in the world at the time, measuring .

An original Greathead shield used in the excavation of the deep London Underground lines remains in place in disused tunnels beneath Moorgate station.

Most tunnelling shields are still loosely based on Greathead&#x27;s design.

==Manual shield tunnelling==

In early shield tunnelling, the shield functioned as a way to protect labourers who performed the digging and moved the shield forward, progressively replacing it with pre-built sections of tunnel wall. The early deep tunnels for the London Underground were built in this way. The shield divided the workface into overlapping portions that each worker could excavate.

==Modern tunnel boring machines==

A tunnel boring machine (TBM) consists of a shield (a large metal cylinder) and trailing support mechanisms.

A rotating cutting wheel is located at the front end of the shield. Behind the cutting wheel there is a chamber where the excavated soil is either mixed with slurry (so-called slurry TBM) or left as-is (earth pressure balance or EPB shield), depending on the type of the TBM. The choice of TBM type depends on the soil conditions. Systems are also present for removal of the soil (or the soil mixed with slurry).

Behind the chamber there is a set of hydraulic jacks supported by the finished part of the tunnel which are used to push the TBM forward. Once a certain distance has been excavated (roughly ), a new tunnel ring is built using the erector. The erector is a rotating system which picks up precast concrete segments and places them in the desired position.

Several support mechanisms can be found behind the shield, inside the finished part of the tunnel, which are part of the TBM: dirt removal, slurry pipelines if applicable, control rooms, rails for transport of the precast segments, etc.

==Lining==
The tunnel lining is the wall of the tunnel. It usually consists of precast concrete segments which form rings. Cast iron linings were traditionally used in the London Underground tunnels, while steel liners were sometimes used elsewhere. The concept of using precast moulded lining sections is not new and was first patented in 1874 by James Henry Greathead.

==Shields in Japan==
In Japan there are several innovative approaches to shield tunnelling, e.g. the Double-O-Tube or DOT-tunnel. 
This tunnel looks like two overlapping circles. There are also shields with computerized arms which can be used to dig a tunnel in virtually any shape.

<text>In the classical bosonic sector of a supersymmetric field theory, the Bogomol&#x27;nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield (BPS) bound (named after Evgeny Bogomolny, M.K. Prasad, and Charles Sommerfield) provides a lower limit on the energy of static field configurations, depending on their topological charges or boundary conditions at spatial infinity. This bound manifests as a series of inequalities for solutions of the classical bosonic field equations. Saturating this bound, meaning the energy of the configuration equals the bound, leads to a simplified set of first-order partial differential equations known as the Bogomolny equations. Classical solutions that saturate the BPS bound are called &quot;BPS states&quot;. These BPS states are not only important solutions within the classical bosonic theory but also play a crucial role in the full quantum supersymmetric theory, often corresponding to stable, non-perturbative states in both field theory and string theory. Their existence and properties are deeply connected to the underlying supersymmetry of the theory, even though the bound itself can be formulated within the bosonic sector alone.

In theoretical physics, specifically in theories with extended supersymmetry, the BPS bound is a lower limit on the mass of a physical state in terms of its charges. States that saturate this bound are known as BPS states, and they have special properties, such as being invariant under some fraction of the supersymmetry transformations. The acronym BPS stands for Bogomol&#x27;nyi, Prasad, and Sommerfield, who first derived the bound in the context of magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills theory in 1975.

== Overview ==

Supersymmetry is a theoretical framework that relates bosons and fermions, particles with integer and half-integer spin, respectively. Extended supersymmetry involves multiple supersymmetry generators, denoted by formula_1, where formula_2 is a spinor index and formula_3 labels the different supersymmetry generators. The supersymmetry algebra includes anticommutators of these generators, which typically involve the Hamiltonian (energy operator) formula_4, momentum operators formula_5, and central charges formula_6 and formula_7. Central charges are operators that commute with all other operators in the supersymmetry algebra and are typically topological charges.

The BPS bound arises from the positivity of the norm of states in the Hilbert space. Consider the following anticommutator from the supersymmetry algebra:

formula_8

where formula_9 are the Pauli matrices (or their higher-dimensional generalizations), formula_10 is the four-momentum, and formula_7 are the central charges. Taking the expectation value of this anticommutator in a physical state formula_12, we obtain:

formula_13

Since the norm of any state is non-negative, this leads to the inequality:

formula_14

where formula_15 is the mass of the state (in the rest frame, where formula_16) and formula_17 is a linear combination of the central charges. This inequality is the BPS bound.

== BPS states ==

States that satisfy the BPS bound, i.e., formula_18, are called BPS states. They have the following important properties:

* Short multiplets: BPS states form shorter irreducible representations of the supersymmetry algebra compared to generic states. This is because some of the supersymmetry generators annihilate the BPS states, reducing the number of states in the multiplet.
* Stability: BPS states are often stable against quantum corrections. Their mass is protected from renormalization, meaning it does not change as one varies the parameters of the theory. This stability makes BPS states crucial for studying non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric theories.
* Supersymmetry preservation: BPS states preserve a fraction of the supersymmetry. Specifically, if a state saturates the BPS bound, some linear combination of the supersymmetry generators must annihilate the state: formula_19 for some spinor formula_20. The number of independent supersymmetry generators that annihilate the state determines the fraction of supersymmetry preserved.

== Examples ==

BPS bounds and states appear in various contexts in theoretical physics:

* Magnetic Monopoles: The original BPS bound was derived for magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills theory. The mass of the monopole is bounded by its magnetic charge.
* Solitons and D-branes: In string theory, BPS states include solitons like D-branes. The mass of a D-brane is determined by its tension, which is related to its charge under the Ramond-Ramond fields.
* Supersymmetric Gauge Theories: BPS states play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories, such as N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. They provide insights into the non-perturbative behavior of these theories and are related to the concept of S-duality.
* Black Holes: In supergravity and string theory, extremal black holes can be BPS states. Their mass is related to their charge and angular momentum.

== Significance ==

The BPS bound and BPS states are powerful tools for studying supersymmetric theories. They provide a window into the non-perturbative regime of these theories and allow for exact calculations of certain quantities. BPS states have played a crucial role in the development of string theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and our understanding of black hole physics.

==Example==

=== Monopoles and dyons ===

The concept of the BPS bound first arose in the study of magnetic monopoles in non-abelian gauge theories. Specifically, it was shown that the mass of a &#x27;t Hooft-Polyakov monopole and a Julia-Zee dyon is bounded from below by a quantity proportional to its topological charge. Solutions that saturate this bound are called BPS monopoles or BPS dyons, and they possess special properties and play a significant role in both classical and quantum field theory.

==== &#x27;t Hooft-Polyakov monopole ====

The &#x27;t Hooft-Polyakov monopole is a static, finite-energy solution in a non-abelian gauge theory, typically SU(2), spontaneously broken to U(1) by a scalar Higgs field in the adjoint representation. The Lagrangian for the bosonic sector is given by:

formula_21

where formula_22 is the field strength tensor, formula_23 is the covariant derivative, formula_24 is the Higgs field in the adjoint representation, and formula_25 is the Higgs potential, often taken to be formula_26, where formula_27 is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.

The energy of a static field configuration is given by:

formula_28

where formula_29 is the magnetic field.

In the limit where the Higgs self-coupling formula_30 goes to zero (the BPS limit), it can be shown that the energy is bounded by the magnetic charge:

formula_31

where formula_32 is the magnetic charge, with formula_33. This inequality is the BPS bound for the monopole.

The BPS bound is saturated when the following Bogomolny equations are satisfied:

formula_34

Solutions to these first-order equations are the BPS monopoles, which have the minimal energy for a given magnetic charge. The choice of sign in the Bogomolny equation determines whether the monopole is a regular monopole or an antimonopole.

==== Julia–Zee dyon ====

The Julia–Zee dyon is a generalization of the &#x27;t Hooft-Polyakov monopole that also carries electric charge. This is achieved by adding a term proportional to formula_35 to the Lagrangian, where formula_36 is the vacuum angle and formula_37 is the dual field strength tensor. This term introduces a coupling between the electric and magnetic fields.

The energy of a static dyon configuration is bounded by:

formula_38

where formula_39 is the electric charge. This is the BPS bound for the dyon. The bound is saturated when the following generalized Bogomolny equations are satisfied:

formula_34
formula_41

where formula_42 is the electric field. Solutions to these equations are the BPS dyons, which have the minimal energy for given electric and magnetic charges.

==== Significance ====

The BPS monopoles and dyons are important because they are stable, finite-energy solutions that saturate a classical energy bound. Their existence and properties are closely related to the topology of the gauge group and the Higgs field. Moreover, these classical solutions have quantum counterparts, and the BPS bound plays a crucial role in understanding the spectrum of the quantum theory. In supersymmetric extensions of the theory, BPS states correspond to short representations of the supersymmetry algebra and are protected from quantum corrections.

=== Extremal Reissner–Nordström black holes ===

The Reissner-Nordström metric describes the spacetime geometry around a spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole. The metric is characterized by two parameters: the mass formula_15 and the electric charge formula_44 of the black hole. The ADM mass, a concept from general relativity that defines the total mass-energy of an asymptotically flat spacetime, is simply formula_15 for the Reissner-Nordström solution.

The event horizon(s) of the Reissner-Nordström black hole are located at the radial coordinates where the metric component formula_46 vanishes. This leads to the equation:

formula_47

The solutions are given by:

formula_48

When formula_49, there are two horizons: an outer event horizon formula_50 and an inner Cauchy horizon formula_51. When formula_52, there are no horizons, and the singularity is naked, which is generally considered unphysical. The critical case, where formula_53, is known as the extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole, and in this case, the two horizons coincide:

formula_54

In the context of supergravity theories (supersymmetric extensions of general relativity), extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes can be interpreted as BPS states. This connection arises from the fact that the extremality condition formula_53 can be viewed as a saturation of a classical inequality, analogous to the BPS bound in supersymmetric field theories.

==== Classical inequalities and energy conditions ====

In general relativity, various energy conditions are imposed on the stress-energy tensor formula_56 to ensure physically reasonable behavior of matter and energy. One such condition is the weak energy condition, which states that for any timelike vector formula_57, the following inequality holds:

formula_58

This essentially means that the energy density measured by any observer is non-negative. For the electromagnetic field, which is the source of the Reissner-Nordström black hole&#x27;s charge, the weak energy condition translates to:

formula_59

where formula_60 and formula_61 are electric and magnetic field strengths.

For the Reissner-Nordström solution, the total energy, which is the ADM mass formula_15, can be decomposed into contributions from the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field. It can be shown that the electromagnetic contribution is precisely equal to formula_63, the absolute value of the charge. The weak energy condition then implies that the gravitational contribution must be non-negative. This leads to the inequality:

formula_64

This inequality is strikingly similar to the BPS bound, with the ADM mass playing the role of the energy and the electric charge playing the role of the central charge. The extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole, with formula_53, saturates this inequality, making it a classical analog of a BPS state.

==== Supersymmetry and extremal black holes ====

In the context of formula_66 supergravity, the extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole is not just an analog but a true BPS state. The supersymmetry algebra in this theory includes central charges that are proportional to the electric and magnetic charges of the black hole. The BPS bound then becomes:

formula_67

where formula_68 is the magnetic charge (which is zero for the Reissner-Nordström solution we are considering). The extremal black hole, with formula_53, saturates this bound and preserves half of the supersymmetry. This means that some of the supersymmetry transformations leave the black hole solution invariant.

The fact that extremal black holes can be BPS states has profound implications. It suggests a deep connection between gravity, supersymmetry, and the quantum nature of spacetime. BPS black holes are stable against quantum corrections and provide valuable insights into the microscopic structure of black holes and the nature of quantum gravity.

<text>A Yagi–Uda antenna, or simply Yagi antenna, is a directional antenna consisting of two or more parallel resonant antenna elements in an end-fire array; these elements are most often metal rods (or discs) acting as half-wave dipoles. Yagi–Uda antennas consist of a single driven element connected to a radio transmitter or receiver (or both) through a transmission line, and additional &quot;passive radiators&quot; with no electrical connection, usually including one so-called &quot;reflector&quot; and any number of &quot;directors&quot;. It was invented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University, Japan, with a lesser role played by his boss Hidetsugu Yagi.

Reflector elements (usually only one is used) are slightly longer than the driven dipole and placed behind the driven element, &quot;opposite&quot; the direction of intended transmission. Directors, on the other hand, are a little shorter and placed in front of the driven element &quot;in&quot; the intended direction. These parasitic elements are typically off-tuned short-circuited dipole elements, that is, instead of a break at the feedpoint (like the driven element) a solid rod is used. They receive and reradiate the radio waves from the driven element but in a different phase determined by their exact lengths. Their effect is to modify the driven element&#x27;s radiation pattern. The waves from the multiple elements superpose and interfere to enhance radiation in a single direction, increasing the antenna&#x27;s gain in that direction.

Also called a beam antenna and parasitic array, the Yagi is widely used as a directional antenna on the HF, VHF and UHF bands. It has moderate to high gain of up to 20 dBi, depending on the number of elements used, and a front-to-back ratio of up to 20 dB. It radiates linearly polarized radio waves and is usually mounted for either horizontal or vertical polarization. It is relatively lightweight, inexpensive and simple to construct. The bandwidth of a Yagi antenna, the frequency range over which it maintains its gain and feedpoint impedance, is narrow, just a few percent of the center frequency, decreasing for models with higher gain, making it ideal for fixed-frequency applications. The largest and best-known use is as rooftop terrestrial television antennas, but it is also used for point-to-point fixed communication links, radar, and long-distance shortwave communication by broadcasting stations and radio amateurs.

== Origins ==

The antenna was invented by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University, Japan, in 1926, with a lesser role played by Hidetsugu Yagi.

However, the name &quot;Yagi&quot; has become more familiar, while the name of Uda, who applied the idea in practice or established the conception through experiment, is often omitted. This appears to have been due to the fact that Yagi based his work on Uda&#x27;s pre-announcement and developed the principle of the absorption phenomenon Yagi had announced earlier. Yagi filed a patent application in Japan on the new idea, without Uda&#x27;s name in it, and later transferred the patent to the Marconi Company in the UK. Incidentally, in the US, the patent was transferred to RCA Corporation.

Yagi antennas were first widely used during World War II in radar systems by Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. After the war, they saw extensive development as home television antennas.

==Description==


The Yagi–Uda antenna typically consists of a number of parallel thin rod elements, each approximately a half wave in length. Rarely, the elements are discs rather than rods. Often they are supported on a perpendicular crossbar or &quot;boom&quot; along their centers. Usually there is a single dipole driven element consisting of two collinear rods each connected to one side of the transmission line, and a variable number of parasitic elements, &quot;reflectors&quot; on one side and optionally one or more &quot;directors&quot; on the other side. The parasitic elements are not electrically connected to the transmission line and serve as passive radiators, reradiating the radio waves to modify the radiation pattern. Typical spacings between elements vary from about to of a wavelength, depending on the specific design. The directors are slightly shorter than the driven element, while the reflector(s) are slightly longer. The radiation pattern is unidirectional, with the main lobe along the axis perpendicular to the elements in the plane of the elements, off the end with the directors.

Conveniently, the dipole parasitic elements have a node (point of zero RF voltage) at their centre, so they can be attached to a conductive metal support at that point without need of insulation, without disturbing their electrical operation. They are usually bolted or welded to the antenna&#x27;s central support boom. The most common form of the driven element is one fed at its centre so its two halves must be insulated where the boom supports them.

The gain increases with the number of parasitic elements used. Only one reflector is normally used since the improvement of gain with additional reflectors is small, but more reflectors may be employed for other reasons such as wider bandwidth. Yagis have been built with 40 directors and more.

The bandwidth of an antenna is, by one definition, the width of the band of frequencies having a gain within 3 dB (one-half the power) of its maximum gain. The Yagi–Uda array in its basic form has a narrow bandwidth, 2–3 percent of the centre frequency. There is a tradeoff between gain and bandwidth, with the bandwidth narrowing as more elements are used. For applications that require wider bandwidths, such as terrestrial television, Yagi–Uda antennas commonly feature trigonal reflectors, and larger diameter conductors, in order to cover the relevant portions of the VHF and UHF bands. Wider bandwidth can also be achieved by the use of &quot;traps&quot;, as described below.

Yagi–Uda antennas used for amateur radio are sometimes designed to operate on multiple bands. These elaborate designs create electrical breaks along each element (both sides) at which point a parallel LC (inductor and capacitor) circuit is inserted. This so-called &quot;trap&quot; has the effect of truncating the element at the higher frequency band, making it approximately a half wavelength in length. At the lower frequency, the entire element (including the remaining inductance due to the trap) is close to half-wave resonance, implementing a &quot;different&quot; Yagi–Uda antenna. Using a second set of traps, a &quot;triband&quot; antenna can be resonant at three different bands. Given the associated costs of erecting an antenna and rotator system above a tower, the combination of antennas for three amateur bands in one unit is a practical solution. The use of traps is not without disadvantages, however, as they reduce the bandwidth of the antenna on the individual bands and reduce the antenna&#x27;s electrical efficiency and subject the antenna to additional mechanical considerations (wind loading, water and insect ingress).

==Theory of operation==
Consider a Yagi–Uda consisting of a reflector, driven element, and a single director as shown here. The driven element is typically a &quot;λ&quot; dipole or folded dipole and is the only member of the structure that is directly excited (electrically connected to the feedline). All the other elements are considered &quot;parasitic&quot;. That is, they reradiate power which they receive from the driven element. They also interact with each other, but this mutual coupling is neglected in the following simplified explanation, which applies to far-field conditions.

One way of thinking about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a parasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. The principal part of the current in a loaded receiving antenna is distributed as in a center-driven antenna. It is proportional to the effective length of the antenna and is in phase with the incident electric field if the passive dipole is excited exactly at its resonance frequency. Now we imagine the current as the source of a power wave at the (short-circuited) port of the antenna. As is well known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects the incident voltage 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the antenna element. If the transmitted voltage wave were 180 degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). However, the current of the backward wave is in phase with the current of the incident wave. This current drives the reradiation of the (passive) dipole element. At some distance, the reradiated electric field is described by the far-field component of the radiation field of a dipole antenna. Its phase includes the propagation delay (relating to the current) and an additional 90 degrees lagging phase offset. Thus, the reradiated field may be thought as having a 90 degrees lagging phase with respect to the incident field.

Parasitic elements involved in Yagi–Uda antennas are not exactly resonant but are somewhat shorter (or longer) than &quot;λ&quot; so that the phase of the element&#x27;s current is modified with respect to its excitation from the driven element. The so-called &quot;reflector&quot; element, being longer than &quot;λ&quot;, has an inductive reactance, which means the phase of its current lags the phase of the open-circuit voltage that would be induced by the received field. The phase delay is thus larger than 90 degrees and, if the reflector element is made sufficiently long, the phase delay may be imagined to approach 180 degrees, so that the incident wave and the wave reemitted by the reflector interfere destructively in the forward direction (i.e. looking from the driven element towards the passive element). The &quot;director&quot; element, on the other hand, being shorter than &quot;λ&quot;, has a capacitive reactance with the voltage phase lagging that of the current. The phase delay is thus smaller than 90 degrees and, if the director element is made sufficiently short, the phase delay may be imagined to approach zero and the incident wave and the wave reemitted by the reflector interfere constructively in the forward direction.

Interference also occurs in the backward direction. This interference is influenced by the distance between the driven and the passive element, because the propagation delays of the incident wave (from the driven element to the passive element) and of the reradiated wave (from the passive element back to the driven element) have to be taken into account. To illustrate the effect, we assume zero and 180 degrees phase delay for the reemission of director and reflector, respectively, and assume a distance of a quarter wavelength between the driven and the passive element. Under these conditions the wave reemitted by the director interferes destructively with the wave emitted by the driven element in the backward direction (away from the passive element), and the wave reemitted by the reflector interferes constructively.

In reality, the phase delay of passive dipole elements does not reach the extreme values of zero and 180 degrees. Thus, the elements are given the correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those re-radiated by the parasitic elements all arrive at the front of the antenna in-phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the forward wave from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the antenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director end) of the antenna.

==Analysis==
While the above qualitative explanation is useful for understanding how parasitic elements can enhance the driven elements&#x27; radiation in one direction at the expense of the other, the assumption of an additional 90 degrees (leading or lagging) phase shift of the reemitted wave is not valid. Typically, the phase shift in the passive element is much smaller. Moreover, to increase the effect of the passive radiators, they should be placed close to the driven element, so that they can collect and reemit a significant part of the primary radiation.

A more realistic model of a Yagi–Uda array using just a driven element and a director is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. The wave generated by the driven element (green) propagates in both the forward and reverse directions (as well as other directions, not shown). The director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 45° which will be important for the reverse direction calculations later). Due to the director&#x27;s shorter length, the current generated in the director is advanced in phase (by about 20°) with respect to the incident field and emits an electromagnetic field, which lags (under far-field conditions) this current by 90°. The net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about 70° (20° - 90°) retarded with respect to that from the driven element (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net forward wave (bottom, right) with an amplitude somewhat larger than the individual waves.

In the reverse direction, on the other hand, the additional delay of the wave from the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two elements (about 45° of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be about 160° (70° + 2 × 45°) out of phase with the wave from the driven element (green). The net effect of these two waves, when added (bottom, left), is partial cancellation. The combination of the director&#x27;s position and shorter length has thus obtained a unidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven (half-wave dipole) element alone.


When a passive radiator is placed close (less than a quarter wavelength distance) to the driven dipole, it interacts with the near field, in which the phase-to-distance relation is not governed by propagation delay, as would be the case in the far field. Thus, the amplitude and phase relation between the driven and the passive element cannot be understood with a model of successive collection and reemission of a wave that has become completely disconnected from the primary radiating element. Instead, the two antenna elements form a coupled system, in which, for example, the self-impedance (or radiation resistance) of the driven element is strongly influenced by the passive element. A full analysis of such a system requires computing the &quot;mutual impedances&quot; between the dipole elements which implicitly takes into account the propagation delay due to the finite spacing between elements and near-field coupling effects. We model element number &quot;j&quot; as having a feedpoint at the centre with a voltage &quot;V&quot;j and a current &quot;I&quot;j flowing into it. Just considering two such elements we can write the voltage at each feedpoint in terms of the currents using the mutual impedances &quot;Z&quot;ij:

: formula_1

: formula_2

&quot;Z&quot;11 and &quot;Z&quot;22 are simply the ordinary driving point impedances of a dipole, thus 73 + j43 ohms for a half-wave element (or purely resistive for one slightly shorter, as is usually desired for the driven element). Due to the differences in the elements&#x27; lengths &quot;Z&quot;11 and &quot;Z&quot;22 have a substantially different reactive component. Due to reciprocity we know that &quot;Z&quot;21 = &quot;Z&quot;12. Now the difficult computation is in determining that mutual impedance &quot;Z&quot;21 which requires a numerical solution. This has been computed for two exact half-wave dipole elements at various spacings in the accompanying graph.

The solution of the system then is as follows. Let the driven element be designated 1 so that &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;I&quot;1 are the voltage and current supplied by the transmitter. The parasitic element is designated 2, and since it is shorted at its &quot;feedpoint&quot; we can write that &quot;V&quot;2 = 0. Using the above relationships, then, we can solve for &quot;I&quot;2 in terms of &quot;I&quot;1:

: formula_3
and so
: formula_4.
This is the current induced in the parasitic element due to the current &quot;I&quot;1 in the driven element. We can also solve for the voltage &quot;V&quot;1 at the feedpoint of the driven element using the earlier equation:
:formula_5
where we have substituted &quot;Z&quot;12 = &quot;Z&quot;21. The ratio of voltage to current at this point is the &quot;driving point impedance Zdp&quot; of the 2-element Yagi:

: formula_6
With only the driven element present the driving point impedance would have simply been &quot;Z&quot;11, but has now been modified by the presence of the parasitic element. And now knowing the phase (and amplitude) of &quot;I&quot;2 in relation to &quot;I&quot;1 as computed above allows us to determine the radiation pattern (gain as a function of direction) due to the currents flowing in these two elements. Solution of such an antenna with more than two elements proceeds along the same lines, setting each &quot;V&quot;j = 0 for all but the driven element, and solving for the currents in each element (and the voltage &quot;V&quot;1 at the feedpoint). Generally the mutual coupling tends to lower the impedance of the primary radiator and thus, folded dipole antennas are frequently used because of their large radiation resistance, which is reduced to the typical 50 to 75 Ohm range by coupling with the passive elements.

==Design==
There are no simple formulas for designing Yagi–Uda antennas due to the complex relationships between physical parameters such as
* element length and spacing
* element diameter
* performance characteristics: gain and input impedance

However using the above kinds of iterative analysis, one can calculate the performance of a given a set of parameters and adjust them to optimize the gain (perhaps subject to some constraints). Since with an element Yagi–Uda antenna, there are parameters to adjust (the element lengths and relative spacings), this iterative analysis method is not straightforward. The mutual impedances plotted above only apply to length elements, so these might need to be recomputed to get good accuracy.

The current distribution along a real antenna element is only approximately given by the usual assumption of a classical standing wave, requiring a solution of Hallen&#x27;s integral equation taking into account the other conductors. Such a complete exact analysis, considering all of the interactions mentioned, is rather overwhelming, and approximations are inevitable on the path to finding a usable antenna. Consequently, these antennas are often empirical designs using an element of trial and error, often starting with an existing design modified according to one&#x27;s hunch. The result might be checked by direct measurement or by computer simulation.

A well-known reference employed in the latter approach is a report published by the United States National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) that provides six basic designs derived from measurements conducted at 400 MHz and procedures for adapting these designs to other frequencies. These designs, and those derived from them, are sometimes referred to as &quot;NBS yagis.&quot;

By adjusting the distance between the adjacent directors it is possible to reduce the back lobe of the radiation pattern.

==History==
The Yagi–Uda antenna was invented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University, Sendai, Japan, with the guidance of Hidetsugu Yagi, also of Tohoku Imperial University. Yagi and Uda published their first report on the wave projector directional antenna. Yagi demonstrated a proof of concept, but the engineering problems proved to be more onerous than conventional systems.

Yagi published the first English-language reference on the antenna in a 1928 survey article on short wave research in Japan and it came to be associated with his name. However, Yagi who provided the conception which was originally vague expression to Uda, always acknowledged Uda&#x27;s principal contribution towards the design which will currently be recognized as the reduction to practice, and if the novelty is not considered, the proper name for the antenna is, as above, the Yagi–Uda antenna (or array).

The Yagi was first widely used during World War II for airborne radar sets, because of its simplicity and directionality. Despite its being invented in Japan, many Japanese radar engineers were unaware of the design until late in the war, partly due to rivalry between the Army and Navy. The Japanese military authorities first became aware of this technology after the Battle of Singapore when they captured the notes of a British radar technician that mentioned &quot;yagi antenna&quot;. Japanese intelligence officers did not even recognise that Yagi was a Japanese name in this context. When questioned, the technician said it was an antenna named after a Japanese professor.

A horizontally polarized array can be seen on many different types of WWII aircraft, particularly those types engaged in maritime patrol, or night fighters, commonly installed on the lower surface of each wing. Two types that often carried such equipment are the Grumman TBF Avenger carrier-based US Navy aircraft and the Consolidated PBY Catalina long range patrol seaplane. Vertically polarized arrays can be seen on the cheeks of the P-61 and on the nose cones of many WWII aircraft, notably the Lichtenstein radar-equipped examples of the German Junkers Ju 88R-1 fighter-bomber, and the British Bristol Beaufighter night-fighter and Short Sunderland flying-boat. Indeed, the latter had so many antenna elements arranged on its back – in addition to its formidable turreted defensive armament in the nose and tail, and atop the hull – it was nicknamed the &quot;fliegendes Stachelschwein&quot;, or &quot;Flying Porcupine&quot; by German airmen. The experimental &quot;Morgenstern&quot; German AI VHF-band radar antenna of 1943–44 used a &quot;double-Yagi&quot; structure from its 90° angled pairs of Yagi antennas formed from six discrete dipole elements, making it possible to fit the array within a conical, rubber-covered plywood radome on an aircraft&#x27;s nose, with the extreme tips of the &quot;Morgenstern&#x27;s&quot; antenna elements protruding from the radome&#x27;s surface, with an NJG 4 Ju 88G-6 of the wing&#x27;s staff flight using it late in the war for its Lichtenstein SN-2 AI radar.

After World War II, the advent of television broadcasting motivated extensive adaptation of the Yagi–Uda design for rooftop television reception in the VHF band (and later for UHF television) and also as an FM radio antenna in fringe areas. A major drawback was the Yagi&#x27;s inherently narrow bandwidth, eventually solved by the adoption of the wideband log-periodic dipole array (LPDA). Yet the Yagi&#x27;s higher gain compared to the LPDA makes it the best for fringe reception, and complicated Yagi designs and combination with other antenna technologies have been developed to permit its operation over the broad television bands.

The Yagi–Uda antenna was named an IEEE Milestone in 1995.

<text>Public reason requires that the moral or political rules that regulate our common life be, in some sense, justifiable or acceptable to all those persons over whom the rules purport to have authority. It is an idea with roots in the work of Thomas Hobbes, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and has become increasingly influential in contemporary moral and political philosophy as a result of its development in the work of John Rawls, Jürgen Habermas, and Gerald Gaus, among others. 

==Immanuel Kant==
The phrase &quot;public use of one&#x27;s reason&quot; (&quot;Vernunft in allen Stükken öffentlichen Gebrauch&quot;) was used by Immanuel Kant in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question &quot;What Is Enlightenment?,&quot; where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post. This Kantian conception was further developed by American philosopher John Rawls to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a pluralist society and identified it as a component of political liberalism. Although Rawls cited the Kantian origin of his concept, his understanding is distinguished by the way he explained how public reason embodies the shared fund of beliefs and reason of those who constitute a democratic polity—those who are concerned with the good of the public and matters of basic justice.

Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course. In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual&#x27;s reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family).

Rawls also classified the concept into public reason for &quot;liberal peoples&quot; and public reason for &quot;society of peoples&quot;. The former involves public reason of free and equal liberal peoples who debate their mutual relations while the latter involves equal citizens of domestic society debating political issues and justice concerning their government.

<doc id="296084" wikidata="Q1121970" url="?curid=296084" title="William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury">
<text>William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (In or before 11677 March 1226) (&quot;Long Sword&quot;, Latinised to &quot;de Longa Spatha&quot;) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman, primarily remembered for his command of the English forces at the Battle of Damme and for remaining loyal to his half-brother, King John. His nickname &quot;Longespée&quot; is generally taken as a reference to his great physical height and the oversized weapons that he used.

==Early life==

William was an illegitimate son of Henry II, King of England. His mother was unknown for many years until the discovery of a charter William made that mentions &quot;Comitissa Ida, mater mea&quot; (Countess Ida, my mother). This referred to Ida de Tosny, a member of the prominent Tosny (or Toesny) family, who had married Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk in 1181.

In 1188, William was recognized as son of King Henry II and received the honour of Appleby, Lincolnshire. Eight years later, his half brother King Richard I married him to a great heiress, Ela of Salisbury, 3rd Countess of Salisbury, the only child of William of Salisbury, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. Accordingly, William was given the title and lands of the earldom of Salisbury.

During the reign of King John, William was at court on several important ceremonial occasions and held various offices: High Sheriff of Wiltshire; lieutenant of Gascony; constable of Dover; and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; and later warden of the Welsh Marches. He was appointed sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire about 1213.

==Military career==

Charter witness lists place William in Normandy during Richard I&#x27;s campaigns to recover lands seized by King Philip II whilst the king of England had been away on crusade. In 1205, William was sent to Poitou to command a small force of knights alongside John&#x27;s bastard son, Geoffrey, after John&#x27;s plans for a full scale expedition were squashed.
Salisbury was a commander in the king&#x27;s Welsh and Irish expeditions of 1210–1212 and was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, jointly with John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich, when the king left for England in 1210. The king also granted him the honour of Eye in Suffolk.

In 1213, Salisbury led a large fleet to Flanders, where he seized or destroyed a good part of a French invasion fleet anchored at or near Damme. This ended the invasion threat but not the conflicts between England and France. In 1214, Salisbury was sent to help Otto IV of Germany, an English ally, who was invading France. Salisbury commanded the right wing of the army at their disastrous defeat in that year at the Battle of Bouvines, where he was captured after Bishop of Beauvais Philip of Dreux struck him with a mace at an important moment in the battle.

By the time he returned to England, revolt was brewing amongst the barons. Salisbury was one of the few who remained loyal to John, except for a few months in 1216. In the civil war that took place the year after the signing of the Magna Carta, Salisbury was one of the leaders of the king&#x27;s army in the south. He was made High Sheriff of Wiltshire again, this time for life. After raising the siege of Lincoln with William Marshall he was also appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire (in addition to his current post as High Sheriff of Somerset) and governor of Lincoln castle. However, after Louis of France landed as an ally of the rebels, Salisbury went over to his side. Presumably, he thought John&#x27;s cause was lost.

After John&#x27;s death and the departure of Louis, Salisbury, along with many other barons, joined the cause of John&#x27;s young son, now Henry III of England. He held an influential place in the government during the king&#x27;s minority and fought in Gascony to help secure the remaining part of the English continental possessions. He was appointed High Sheriff of Devon in 1217 and High Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire in 1224. Salisbury&#x27;s ship was nearly lost in a storm while returning to England in 1225, and he spent some months in refuge at a monastery on the French island of Ré.

==Death==

Salisbury died not long after his return to England at Salisbury Castle. Roger of Wendover alleged that he was poisoned by Hubert de Burgh. One reliable source, however, states that &quot;there is little evidence [of murder] aside from Roger of Wendover&#x27;s account in Flores Historiarum&quot;.

He was buried at Salisbury Cathedral in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.

The corpse of a rat was found in Salisbury&#x27;s tomb when it was opened in 1791.

==Likeness==
A terracotta statue of Salisbury, dating from 1756, is located in the Great Hall of Lacock Abbey in Lacock, Wiltshire, England. A likeness of his wife Ela is also on display, while several other statues are believed to show their children.

==Cultural legacy==
The 1762 novel &quot;Longsword&quot; by Irish writer Thomas Leland was based on his life, which itself inspired the 1767 play &quot;The Countess of Salisbury&quot; by Hartson Hall that premiered at the Haymarket Theatre in London.

==Family==
William and Ela, Countess of Salisbury had:
* William II Longespée (1212?–1250), who was sometimes called Earl of Salisbury but never legally bore the title because he died before his mother, Countess Ela, who held the earldom until her death in 1261. He married Idoine de Camville.
* Stephen Longespée (died 1260), who was seneschal of Gascony and Justiciar of Ireland, married Emeline de Ridelsford, widow of Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster.
* Richard Longespée, a canon of Salisbury.
* Nicholas Longespée (died 1297), bishop of Salisbury
* Isabel Longespée, who married Sir William de Vesci.
* Ela Longespée, who first married Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick, and then married Philip Basset. No issue.
* Ida Longespée, married firstly Ralph de Somery of Dudley. They had no children. She married secondly William de Beauchamp, Baron of Bedford, by whom she had seven children.
* Mary Longespée, married. No issue.
* Pernel Longespée.

<text>A grid illusion is any kind of grid that deceives a person&#x27;s vision. The two most common types of grid illusions are the Hermann grid illusion and the scintillating grid illusion.

==Hermann grid illusion==
The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870. The illusion is characterized by &quot;ghostlike&quot; grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background. The grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection.

==Scintillating grid illusion==

The scintillating grid illusion is an optical illusion, discovered by E. and B. Lingelbach and M. Schrauf in 1994. It is often considered a variation of the Hermann grid illusion but possesses different properties.

It is constructed by superimposing white discs on the intersections of orthogonal gray bars on a black background. Dark dots seem to appear and disappear rapidly at random intersections, hence the label &quot;scintillating&quot;. When a person keeps their eyes directly on a single intersection, the dark dot does not appear. The dark dots disappear if one is too close to or too far from the image.

==Differences between the scintillating and Hermann grid illusions==
The difference between the Scintillating Grid Illusion and the Hermann Grid Illusion is that the former has dots already in place at the intersections, which is not the case for the latter. Since, at first sight, the graphs appear similar, the two illusions are occasionally confused. But the scintillating illusion does not occur with an isolated intersection, as is the case for the Hermann grid; observations suggest that a minimum of evenly spaced intersections with superimposed discs are required to produce the effect. This requirement suggests the participation of global processes of the kind proposed for the linking and grouping of features in an image, in addition to local processes.

==Theories==
The effect of both optical illusions is often explained by a neural process called lateral inhibition. The intensity at a point in the visual system is not simply the result of a single receptor, but the result of a group of receptors which respond to the presentation of stimuli in what is called a receptive field.

A retinal ganglion cell pools the inputs of several photoreceptors over an area of the retina; the area in physical space to which the photoreceptors respond is the ganglion cell&#x27;s &quot;receptive field&quot;. In the center of a so-called on-center receptive field, the individual photoreceptors &quot;excite&quot; the ganglion cell when they detect increased luminance; the photoreceptors in the surrounding area &quot;inhibit&quot; the ganglion cell. Thus, since a point at an intersection is surrounded by more areas of intensity than a point at the middle of a line, the intersection appears darker due to the increased inhibition.

There is strong evidence that the retinal ganglion cell theory is untenable. For example, making the lines of the grid wavy rather than straight eliminates both the Hermann grid and scintillating grid illusions.
The Baumgartner / RGC theory does not predict this outcome. Lateral inhibition theory also can not account for the fact that the Hermann grid illusion is perceived over a range of bar widths. Lateral inhibition theory would predict that decreasing the size of the grid (and therefore decreasing the amount of inhibition at the intersection) would eradicate the illusory effect. One alternative explanation is that the illusion is due to S1 type simple cells in the visual cortex.

It has been hypothesized that the effect is caused by movement of the physiological blind spot.

<text>The Canada Trust Company was a Canadian trust company founded in 1894 in Calgary, Alberta, as the General Trust Corporation of Canada. In 1899, it was acquired by the Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society, which moved the company to London, Ontario, and changed its name to the Canada Trust Company.

In September 1985, Canada Trust was acquired by the conglomerate Genstar Corp., and at the beginning of 1986 Genstar merged Canada Trust with Canada Permanent. The new giant company, which became the country&#x27;s sixth largest financial institution, was acquired in March 1986 by the tobacco conglomerate Imasco. In June 1999, Imasco&#x27;s controlling shareholder, British American Tobacco, announced its plan to increase its share to a majority. As part of the deal, British American would sell Canada Trust to the Toronto-Dominion Bank. The sale, worth CAD 7.8 billion, closed on 1 February 2000.

==History==

=== Founding in Calgary, 1894–1899 ===
The articles of incorporation of the General Trust Corporation of Canada received royal assent on 23 July 1894. The founding shareholders were James Alexander Lougheed, Harry Symons, William Roper Hull, John Lineham, Alfred B. Few, George Kidd Leeson, Henry W. C. Meyer, Harry William Nanton, and Edmund Cave. Lougheed served as its first president. Historian Philip Smith wrote that, &quot;having procured their charter, those early westerners do not seem to have done much with it, since references to it through the years in the Huron &amp; Erie&#x27;s records describe it as &#x27;largely inactive.&#x27; &quot;

=== Takeover by Huron &amp; Erie, 1899–1901 ===
In 1899, seven officers of the Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society of London, Ontario paid a combined $115,000 to acquire the General Trust Corporation of Canada. After the purchase, the group transferred their shares to Huron and Erie, moved General Trust&#x27;s offices to London, and renamed the business the Canada Trust Company. Canada Trust opened for business in 1901 with Verschoyle Cronyn as its new president, and George Somerville as its managing director.

=== Development as a major trust, 1901–1985 ===
The parent company changed its name to the Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation in 1915, then began branding itself as Huron and Erie–Canada Trust; the branding was changed to Canada Trust–Huron and Erie in 1962 to reflect the company&#x27;s national reach. In 1976, Huron and Erie changed its name to Canada Trustco Mortgage Company and continued to operate Canada Trust as a subsidiary.

Canada Trust was a trust company that offered the same services as a bank. It was one of Canada&#x27;s largest non-bank financial institutions, with $38 billion in deposits and $176 billion in assets. It had 11,000 employees and 3.5 million customers and operated a network of 413 branches across Canada; and almost 1,000 automated banking machines. Its banking machines were, at one point in the late 1980s to early 1990s, called &quot;Johnnycash&quot; machines. They were even promoted with lifesize cutouts of Johnny Cash asking the question, &quot;Why walk the line?&quot;, a reference to one of his hit songs.

In the United States, CT Financial operated through First Federal Savings and Loan Association. First Federal was founded in 1896, and operated through 82 branches throughout New York State. CT Financial also operated other divisions including Truscan Realty Limited (doing business as Canada Trust Realty), CT Insurance Limited, and Canada Trust Bank N.V.

=== Genstar, Imasco ownership, 1985–2000 ===

In September 1985, Genstar Corporation of Vancouver, run by Angus MacNaughton, purchased Canada Trust. In 1981, Genstar had purchased the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, which included Permanent&#x27;s subsidiary the Canada Permanent Trust Company. Effective 1 January 1986, Genstar merged Canada Trust with Canada Permanent. After the merger, Canada Trust&#x27;s assets increased from $13.5 billion to $21 billion, and its number of branches increased from 208 to 320. Additionally, the new Canada Trust held more savings deposits than both the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia.

Shortly after the Canada Trust–Canada Permanent merger, on 24 March 1986, the Montreal-based tobacco company Imasco made a USD 1.43 billion offer to take Genstar over. The offer received considerable criticism, and in April the cross-party finance committee of the House of Commons voted unanimously to block the takeover. The president of the Canadian Bankers&#x27; Association, Robert MacIntosh, called also for the takeover to be blocked. On 17 April, Secretary of State Barbara McDougall announced that the takeover had been approved. By late May, Imasco had acquired around 95 per cent of Genstar shares. To help pay the debts incurred in the takeover, Imasco issued seven million shares of its own.

In September 1987, Imasco formed a new holding company for Canada Trustco Mortgage, called CT Financial Services Inc.

=== Acquisition by Toronto-Dominion, 1999–2000 ===
In 1999, Imasco was controlled by British American Tobacco, which owned 42 per cent of the company&#x27;s shares. In June of that year, British American announced a plan to increase its share to 58 per cent. As part of the purchase, British American would dispose of Imasco&#x27;s three non-tobacco businesses: CT Financial Services, Shoppers Drug Mart, and Genstar Development. In August, British American announced it had struck a tentative deal with the Toronto-Dominion Bank to acquire CT Financial. In January 2000, Toronto-Dominion shareholders voted to approve the acquisition, which would see TD pay $67 per share for Imasco&#x27;s 98.2 per cent of CT, worth CAD 7.8 billion. On 1 February 2000, finance minister Paul Martin approved the purchase, on the condition that Toronto-Dominion sell off CT&#x27;s MasterCard business.

After the takeover, Canada Trust&#x27;s retail banking operations were integrated into TD&#x27;s similar operations, now collectively known as TD Canada Trust. This new subsidiary now primarily provides traditional trust company services, and also services Canada Trust accounts opened prior to the merger with TD (other existing TD Canada Trust-branded accounts are actually issued by TD Bank itself).

<doc id="296095" wikidata="Q986354" url="?curid=296095" title="Randy Barnett">
<text>Randy Evan Barnett (born February 5, 1952) is an American legal scholar. He serves as the Patrick Hotung Professor of Constitutional Law at Georgetown University, where he teaches constitutional law and contracts, and is the director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution.

After graduating from Northwestern University and Harvard Law School, Barnett tried felony cases as a prosecutor in the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office in Chicago. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in Constitutional Studies and the Bradley Prize, Barnett has been a visiting professor at Penn, Northwestern and Harvard Law School.

In 2004, Barnett argued the medical marijuana case of &quot;Gonzalez v. Raich&quot; before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012, he was one of the lawyers representing the National Federation of Independent Business in its constitutional challenge to the Affordable Care Act in &quot;NFIB v. Sebelius&quot;. He blogs on the Volokh Conspiracy.

==Life and career==
Barnett was born on February 5, 1952, in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family. He was raised in Calumet City, Illinois, while attending synagogue in Hammond, Indiana, where he was president of the local Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA) chapter and received his bar-mitzvah. After high school, Barnett was educated at Northwestern University, graduating in 1974 with a B.A. in philosophy. As an undergraduate, he was mentored by professor Henry Veatch in addition to being influenced by Murray Rothbard and the works of Ayn Rand.

After graduation, Barnett enrolled in Harvard Law School, receiving a J.D. in 1977. Barnett then returned to Chicago and worked as an Illinois state prosecutor for Cook County, Illinois.

Barnett spent the 1981–82 academic year as a research fellow at the University of Chicago Law School, then, in the fall of 1982, began his academic career as an assistant professor of law at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. In 1993, Barnett was hired as a professor of law at the Boston University School of Law. In 2006, Barnett left Boston and began teaching at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he currently remains.

== Jurisprudence ==
In &quot;The Structure of Liberty&quot;, Barnett offers a libertarian theory of law and politics. Barnett calls his theory &quot;the liberal conception of justice&quot; and emphasizes the relationship between legal libertarianism and classical liberalism. He argues private adjudication and enforcement of law, with market forces eliminating inefficiencies and inequities, to be the only legal system that can provide adequate solutions to the problems of interest, power, and knowledge.

He discusses theories of constitutional legitimacy and methods of constitutional interpretation in &quot;Restoring the Lost Constitution&quot;.

There have been several criticisms and reviews of his theory, including Stephan Kinsella, Richard Epstein,
David N. Mayer,
Lawrence B. Solum, and John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung.

==Supreme Court cases==
Barnett was also lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in &quot;Ashcroft v. Raich&quot; (later &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;), which he won before the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that federal action against legal marijuana patients violated the Commerce Clause. Barnett&#x27;s side, however, lost on appeal at the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress had the power to enforce federal
marijuana prohibition in states that had legalized medical marijuana.
He was also involved in the famous Affordable Care Act case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius.

==Constitutional theory==
Barnett has also done work on the theory of the United States Constitution, culminating in his books &quot;Restoring the Lost Constitution&quot; and &quot;Our Republican Constitution&quot;. He argues for an originalist theory of constitutional interpretation and for constitutional construction based on a presumption of liberty, not popular sovereignty.

Barnett also focuses on the history and original meaning of the Second and Ninth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He has advanced the Standard Model interpretation that the Second Amendment protects an individual&#x27;s right to bear arms, subject to federal regulation under Congress&#x27;s power to organize the militia in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.

===Ninth Amendment===
Barnett is a proponent of the view that the Ninth Amendment&#x27;s rights &quot;retained by the people&quot; should be vigorously enforced by the federal judiciary. In a 2006 article, Barnett wrote:

Regarding what stature and force natural rights had before some of them were enumerated, Barnett says that federal courts did not have authority to enforce such rights against the states. He wrote in the same 2006 article:

A related issue is whether the original unamended Constitution gave federal courts authority to enforce unenumerated natural rights against congressional regulation of the federal district. Barnett has indicated that federal courts had such authority and that enumerated rights &quot;had the same stature and force&quot; in the district even before they were enumerated. He has indicated that the case of &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; (dealing with integration of public schools in the District of Columbia) is hard to justify textually from the Constitution, and if it were to be overturned, Congress would create more laws desegregating the district, which would be justified in his view of the Constitution.

The question of what constitutional rights citizens possessed in the federal district has ramifications for the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2003, Barnett wrote:

If no such federal constitutional protection of unenumerated rights existed in the federal district prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, only enumerated rights may have been extended by it.

===Fourteenth Amendment===
With Evan Bernick, Barnett reviews the history and sources of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as its misunderstanding and legal misuse in the Belknap Press title &quot;The Original Meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment: Its Letter and Spirit&quot;. Barnett&#x27;s reading of Lysander Spooner was instrumental in changing his constitutional theory.

In February 2025, Barnett co-authored an op-ed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; with Ilan Wurman where they argue that there is no right to birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants under the Fourteenth Amendment. They wrote the op-ed in defense of an executive order by President Donald Trump. Other legal scholars challenged the op-ed. Jed Shugerman wrote that Barnett and Wurman offered very thin evidence for their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment; no evidence from the period of ratification was cited. The only two pieces of evidence that they could point to actually contradicted their argument. Ilya Somin also criticized the lack of evidence, while adding that if Barnett and Wurman&#x27;s interpretation was correct, it would undermine the central purpose of the Citizenship Clause.

===Repeal Amendment===

Barnett has proposed a Repeal Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would give two thirds of the states the power to repeal any federal law or regulation. According to Barnett, the proposed amendment &quot;provides a targeted way to reverse particular congressional acts and administrative regulations without relying on federal judges or permanently amending the text of the Constitution to correct a specific abuse.&quot; He described the intent of the amendment as follows:

Barnett&#x27;s proposal has received interest from many politicians and academics, even those who do not share his libertarian beliefs. &quot;[A] number of congressional Republicans, including soon-to-be House Majority Leader Eric Cantor&quot; have endorsed the proposal, as has Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli. Republican Congressman Rob Bishop of Utah introduced the amendment in the House of Representatives. University of Texas Law Professor Sanford Levinson has said that the Repeal Amendment &quot;ha[s] the merit of recognizing that structures matter.&quot;.

===Bill of Federalism===

The Bill of Federalism is a list of ten proposed amendments to the United States Constitution by Barnett. It would enshrine in the Constitution certain ideas based on states&#x27; rights and free market libertarianism. Barnett drafted the bill in response to the Tea Party movement&#x27;s emphasis on limiting federal powers. The present draft of the document was published on May 13, 2009 and incorporated much of the feedback that Barnett had received in response to the previous draft. The document is an expansion of an earlier &#x27;Federalist Amendment&#x27; that Barnett composed as part of an article he wrote in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Barnett advocates for the states to call for a Constitutional Convention in which they would propose the amendments comprising the bill. Alternatively, the United States Congress could propose the amendments to the states, as they have done every time a Convention to propose amendments has been called for.

The amendments, summarized by number below, would:
# Disallow federal income taxes (repeal Sixteenth Amendment), as well as gift, estate, and consumption taxes; allow FairTax; require a three-fifths supermajority to raise or set new taxes
# Set limits on the Interstate Commerce Clause
# Disallow unfunded mandates and conditions on funding.
# Close a constitutional loophole that allows treaties to override established limits on power
# Extend free speech consideration to campaign contributions and to cover any medium of communication (including the Internet)
# Allow a resolution of three fourths of the states to rescind any federal law or regulation.
# Establish term limits for Senators and Representatives.
# Provide the President with a line-item veto to balance the budget on any year in which it is unbalanced.
# Reinforce the Ninth Amendment by specifying additional rights and by providing a process for any person to prove the existence of an unenumerated right.
# Restrict judicial activism by mandating an originalist method of interpretation.

The Bill of Federalism Project has been incorporated as a nonprofit agency in the State of Tennessee.

== Personal life ==

Barnett is married to Beth Barnett. Their son, Gary Barnett, attended the Georgetown University Law Center and now works as a prosecuting attorney in Brooklyn, New York. Their daughter, Laura Barnett, lives in Washington, D.C., and works for the Institute for Humane Studies.

<text>Václav Havel Airport Prague () , formerly Prague Ruzyně International Airport (, ), is an international airport of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. The airport was founded in 1937 when it replaced the Kbely Airport (founded in 1918) as the city&#x27;s principal airport. It was reconstructed and extended in 1956, 1968, 1997, and 2006. In 2012, it was renamed after the last president of Czechoslovakia and the first president of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel. It is located at the edge of the Prague-Ruzyně area, next to Kněževes village, west of the centre of Prague and southeast of the city of Kladno.

In 2018, it served around 17 million passengers. It served as a hub for Czech Airlines until it ceased operations in late 2024 and it serves as a hub for Smartwings, and as an operating base for Ryanair and Eurowings.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
Prague–Ruzyně Airport began operations on 5 April 1937, but Czechoslovak civil aviation history started at the military airport in Prague–Kbely in 1919. The Prague Aviation Museum is now found at Kbely Airport.

Due to the insufficient capacity of Kbely Airport by the mid-1930s, the government decided to develop a new state civil airport in Ruzyně. Among the major awards Prague Ruzyně Airport has received is the Diploma and Gold Medal granted in 1937 at the occasion of the International Art and Technical Exhibition in Paris (&quot;Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne&quot; also known as &quot;Paris 1937 World&#x27;s Fair&quot;) for the technical conception of the central airport, primarily the architecture of the check-in building (nowadays known as Terminal 4) designed by architect Adolf Benš.

In one of the most dramatic moments in its history, the airport was seized by Soviet paratroopers on the night of 20–21 August 1968, who then facilitated the landing of Soviet troops and transports for the invasion of Czechoslovakia.

Moreover, the Ruzyně fields provide opportunities for further expansion of the airport according to the increasing capacity demand. The airport serves as a hub of the trans-European airport network.

Political and economic changes have significantly influenced Prague–Ruzyně Airport&#x27;s seventy-year history. Some new air transportation companies and institutions have been founded and some have ceased operation since 1937. Ten entities have been responsible for airport administration over time, including the new construction and development.

===Development since 2000===
The airport stood in for Miami International Airport in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.

An online petition organised by one of the best-known Slovak film directors, Fero Fenič, calling on the government and the Parliament to rename Prague Ruzyně Airport to Václav Havel International Airport attracted – in just one week after 20 December 2011—the support of over 65,000 signatories both within and outside the Czech Republic. A rendition of the airport with the proposed Václav Havel name in the form of his signature followed by his typical heart symbol suffix was included in the blog&#x27;s article in support of renaming of the airport. This name change took place on 5 October 2012 on what would have been Havel&#x27;s 76th birthday. The PRG name of the airport for IATA and ICAO will remain the same.

The main runway 06/24 was reconstructed from 2012 to 2013 due to poor technical conditions. During reconstruction, runway 12/30 was the only usable runway as runway 04/22 is closed permanently. The runway reconstruction was originally planned for three stages. The first stage in 2012, the second stage in 2013 and the last stage in 2014. Runway 12/30 (which would be used during the reconstruction of the main runway) is not equipped for low visibility landings as it offers only ILS CAT I landings. In addition, the approach path of runway 12/30 goes above high-density population areas (such as Prague 6 and Kladno). Therefore, the second and the third stage of the runway reconstruction had to be merged so the works could be finished in 2013.

==Expansion plans==

===Terminal expansion===
An expansion of the existing terminals is scheduled to start construction sometime during the year 2027 or 2028. A new concourse is supposed to be built to expand the existing Terminal 2 and it will be south of the mentioned terminal and north of the new runway (&quot;see &quot;New runway&quot;&quot;). It will accommodate both non-Schengen (&quot;departure and arrival&quot;) and Schengen flights (&quot;arrival only&quot;). It will contain 8 jetway gates and 10 non-Schengen bus gates. An extension of the check-in hall at Terminal 1 is also going to be made. Modifications will be made to the existing concourses (including concourses A and B). Terminal 1 will be used only for Schengen flights and Terminal 2 will be used for both Schengen and non-Schengen flights. In addition, one Schengen bus gate will be added to concourse A. This project is supposed to be completed by the year 2033.

===Railway connection===
The construction of a railway connection between the airport and Prague city centre is also in the planning stage. The track will be served by express trains with special fares, connecting the airport non-stop with the city centre, and local trains fully integrated into Prague integrated transit system.

==Infrastructure==


===Terminals===
Prague Airport has two main passenger terminals, two general aviation terminals, as well as a cargo facility. Most flights depart Prague Airport from the North Terminals (Terminals 1 and 2). The South Terminals (Terminals 3 and 4) handle a few irregular flights, as well as VIP flights, special flights and small aircraft.

* Terminal 1 is used for flights outside the Schengen Area; it was opened in 1968 and rebuilt in 1997, it includes concourses A and B
* Terminal 2 is used for flights within the Schengen area; it was opened on 17 January 2006, it includes concourses C and D
* Terminal 3 is used for private and charter flights; it was opened in 1997
* Terminal 4 is used exclusively for VIP flights and state visits; it is the oldest part of the airport, and was opened on 5 April 1937.

There are also two freight terminals, &quot;Cargo Terminal 1&quot; is operated by Menzies Aviation Czech while &quot;Cargo Terminal 2&quot; is operated by Skyport.

===Runways===
The airport contains two runways in service: 06/24 (till April 1993 07/25) and 12/30 (till May 2012 13/31). Former runway 04/22 is permanently closed for take-offs and landings and is used for taxiing and parking only. The most used runway is 24 due to the prevailing western winds. Runway 30 is also used often. Runway 06 is used rarely, while runway 12 is used only exceptionally.

===Other facilities===

Czech Airlines has its head office, the APC Building, on the grounds of Prague Airport. On 30 December 2009 CSA announced that it would sell its head office to the airport for CZK 607 million. Smartwings have their head office on the airport property. In addition the Civil Aviation Authority also has its head office on the airport property.

===Operations===
The company operating the airport is Prague Airport (&quot;Letiště Praha, a. s.&quot;), a joint-stock company that has one shareholder, the Ministry of Finance. The company was founded in February 2008, as part of a privatisation process involving the Airport Prague (&quot;Správa Letiště Praha, s.p.&quot;) state enterprise. This action was in accordance with the Czech Republic Government Memorandum Nr. 888, which had been passed on 9 July 2008. On 1 December 2008, Prague Airport took all rights and duties formerly held by Správa Letiště Praha, s.p., and Prague Airports took all business authorisations, certificates, employees, and licenses from the former company. The head office of Prague Airport is in Prague 6. The former state-owned enterprise had its head office on the airport property.
==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
As of 2024, Prague Airport offers flights to more than 170 destinations, with 70 carriers operating the flights. The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Prague Airport:

==Ground transportation==
===Road===
Buses of DPP, the Prague Public Transit Co., stop at both terminals 1 and 2 frequently. A Czech Railways public bus service, AE – AirportExpress, connects Terminal 1 with Praha hlavní nádraží. From the bus station in front of Terminal 1 there are also regular buses to Kladno, intercity buses of Regiojet run every 30–60 minutes to Karlovy Vary and Cheb.

===Proposed rail connection===
There are plans to build a rail connection to the airport. Preliminary work commenced in 2018, with procurement proceedings launched the following year. Main construction was expected to start around 2023, but as of 2024 construction had not yet begun. According to a 2021 media report, the airport is to be served via a branch off the Prague-Kladno line, including an underground station to serve the airport. The project also includes double tracking and electrifying the existing single-track railway. The plan also includes upgrades to Prague-Masarykovo station, which began in 2024. The project is notable for being the first ever public-private partnership in Czech railway history, and is expected to be completed around 2030 at a cost of 28 billion crowns.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 19 February 1973, Aeroflot Flight 141, a Tupolev Tu-154, crashed half a kilometre short of the airport during final approach. While most of the passengers survived the crash many died in the fire that followed. Altogether 66 people died from the 100 passengers and crew. The crash was the first loss of and the first fatal accident involving a Tu-154.

* On 30 October 1975, Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 450, a Douglas DC-9-32 hit high ground during an approach in fog to Prague Ruzyně Airport. 75 of the 120 passengers and crew on board were killed.

* On 21 October 1981, a Tupolev Tu-154B flown by Malév landed hard after flight from Amsterdam. Fuselage broke into two main parts thus making aircraft damaged beyond repair. Everybody onboard survived, 24 passengers were injured.

* On 29 March 1989, two teenagers from Czechoslovakia armed with grenades and shotguns hijacked Malév Flight 640 at Prague Ruzyně Airport, and forced the Tupolev Tu-154B with 15 hostages to fly to Frankfurt Airport in West Germany before surrendering.

<text>Sears Canada Inc. was a publicly-traded Canadian company affiliated with the American-based Sears department store chain. In operation from September 18, 1952 until January 14, 2018, and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company began as Simpsons-Sears—a joint venture between the Canadian Simpsons department store chain and the American Sears chain—which operated a national mail order business and co-branded Simpsons-Sears stores modelled after those of Sears in the U.S. After the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company purchased Simpsons in 1978, the joint venture was dismantled and Hudson&#x27;s Bay sold its shares in the joint venture to Sears; with Sears now fully owning the company, it was renamed Sears Canada Inc. in 1984. In 1999, Sears Canada acquired the remaining assets and locations of the historic Canadian chain Eaton&#x27;s. From 2014, Sears Holdings owned a 10% share in the company. ESL Investments was the largest shareholder of Sears Canada. Sears Canada operated 125 full-line department stores at its&#x27; peak.

In 2016, Sears Canada had a network that included 140 corporate stores (including full-line, Sears Home, and Sears Outlet stores), 71 Hometown stores, over 900 catalogue and online merchandise pick-up locations, 69 Sears Travel offices, and a nationwide repair and service network. The company also published a general merchandise catalogue until the last quarter of 2016 and offered shopping online at sears.ca until October 19, 2017.

After filing for creditor protection in June 2017, Sears Canada announced it would close 20 full-line locations, 15 Home stores, 10 Outlet stores, and 14 Sears Hometown stores. The closings resulted in 2,900 employee layoffs. These stores officially closed on Sunday, October 1, 2017. In September 2017, Sears Canada announced the closing of 10 additional stores, in addition to the 59 store closings previously announced in June. On October 10, 2017, Sears Canada announced that it would seek court approval to shutter all of its remaining stores in Canada and lay off 11,240 remaining staff. The approval was granted by the Ontario Superior Court on October 13, 2017.

Liquidation sales began on October 19, 2017. The remaining Sears stores closed on January 14, 2018. Store fixtures and equipment from the closed stores were sold until January 26, 2018.

== History ==
=== Operations during 20th century ===
==== Simpsons-Sears ====
Sears Canada began its operations as Simpsons-Sears Limited, a catalogue and mid-market suburban retailer that was a joint venture between the Robert Simpson Company Limited, a Canadian department store chain, and Sears, Roebuck and Co. of the United States. In 1952, Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood sent a letter to Simpsons President Edgar G. Burton, proposing a partnership between their two companies in order to serve the Canadian market. The deal to create Simpsons-Sears Limited, a Canadian catalogue and department store chain separate from the Simpson&#x27;s chain, was signed on September 18, 1952. The new company would be a 50–50 partnership; Simpsons and Sears both invested $20 million and had equal representation on Simpsons-Sears&#x27; board of directors. The new company had two main objectives: to expand Simpson&#x27;s mail-order business (which was sold to the new company) and to build a string of stores modelled on Sears&#x27; format across the country.

The agreement also contained a provision that would become a major challenge in later years. Under its terms, Simpsons-Sears could not open a retail store within 25 miles of Simpsons&#x27; existing stores in Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Regina, and London. In return, Simpsons promised not to build any stores outside of those five cities. Simpsons-Sears&#x27; mail-order business, however, was free to operate anywhere in Canada, as was the new Simpsons-Sears Acceptance Company, the credit arm of the operation.

The business operations of Simpsons-Sears began when the first Simpsons-Sears Spring/Summer Catalogue was printed by Photo-Engravers and Electrotypers, Ltd. and delivered to 300,000 Canadian homes in early 1953. On September 17, 1953, the first Simpsons-Sears retail store opened in Stratford, Ontario; the second store opened in Kamloops, British Columbia in December of that year. In 1954, Simpsons-Sears opened Canada&#x27;s first large suburban department store, in Vancouver – Burnaby, BC, based on new the modern Sears, Roebuck model, spreading across the U.S.

Simpsons-Sears introduced the slogan “We Service What We Sell” in 1955, backed up by a highly trained nationwide corps of service technicians.

In 1963, Simpsons-Sears opened its first full-line store in Quebec, in Quebec City&#x27;s Fleur de Lys complex.

The company made its public debut on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges on April 5, 1965, with the listing of its Class “A” non-voting shares.
That year, Sears began its long-standing partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada, to support its youth programming.

In 1968, Simpsons-Sears became the first Canadian retailer to begin buying products from Mainland China.

In 1971, Simpsons-Sears opened a new head office building in downtown Toronto.

In 1972, Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears agreed to end the 25-mile restriction and permit Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears stores anywhere. The following year Simpsons-Sears opened a store at Square One Shopping Centre in the city of Mississauga, approximately west of Toronto. To avoid confusing customers used to Simpsons, new stores were opened under the &quot;Sears&quot; banner. All existing Simpsons-Sears stores were rebranded to the Sears banner as well. However, the name of the company remained Simpsons-Sears Limited.

Also in 1973, Sears hit $1 billion in sales.

In 1974, Simpsons-Sears opened a Sears store at Hillcrest Mall in Richmond Hill, Ontario, its first location in a mall that had a Simpsons store.

==== Divestiture by Simpsons ====
In 1978, Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears put forward a plan to merge their businesses. This plan had to have the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, as Sears, Roebuck would become the prime shareholder. Before approval could be attained, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company made a counter bid and acquired Simpsons Limited. Simpsons&#x27; shares in Simpsons-Sears taken over by The Bay were eventually sold back to Sears, Roebuck. The company was renamed Sears Canada Inc. in 1984 to reflect its independence.
The paths of Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Sears crossed again in 1991. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company merged its remaining Greater Toronto Simpsons stores into its The Bay division in 1991, and the Simpsons name disappeared from Canada&#x27;s retail landscape. As a result of this move, Sears Canada took over eight former Simpsons and Bay stores and finally gained a major foothold in Greater Toronto, a market from which it had been excluded by the 1952 agreement with Simpsons. These new stores featured a new 60:40 fashions; hardlines mix and introduced new boutique shop arrangements and fashion lines, such as Le Chateau, Sung, and Rouie.

Sears announced, &quot;The Store of the Future&quot; in 1983. It represented a complete transformation and remodelling of stores along a new product-focused and customer-friendly merchandising program. The first remodelled store, in Mississauga, Ontario, was unveiled in 1985. Stores would be fully retrofitted over the following three years.

The Sears Catalogue Club points program began in 1986. The next year, it changed to &quot;Sears Club&quot; to incorporate all the company&#x27;s trading channels. The points of the program could no longer be earned from June 22, 2017.

==== Acquisition of Eaton&#x27;s ====
In 1999, Sears Canada acquired the assets and the trademark name of the bankrupt chain The T. Eaton Company Limited. For the first time in its history, Sears Canada gained the leases to a number of prime downtown locations in Toronto (Eaton Centre), Vancouver, Victoria, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Calgary, all former Eaton&#x27;s flagship stores. The Simpsons-Sears agreement had largely shut out Sears from the urban core, and that remained so even when the restriction was lifted, as The Bay and Eaton&#x27;s long held a duopoly in the downtowns of major Canadian cities. Sears Canada had also entertained notions of obtaining the former Eaton downtown Montreal store but that location was eventually occupied by Quebec retailer Les Ailes de la Mode.

=== Operations during 21st century ===
==== 2000–2009 ====
Sears relaunched &quot;Eatons&quot; (rendered with the lowercase &quot;e&quot; logo) in November 2000 as a seven-store upscale mini-brand, with locations in Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto (Eaton Centre and Yorkdale) and Ottawa, all of which had been flagship Eaton stores. At Yorkdale and Winnipeg&#x27;s Polo Park, this meant that Sears Canada managed two anchor stores (Eatons and Sears) in those malls for a short time. This operation was unsuccessful, however, and Sears converted the Eatons stores to the Sears brand in 2002. Many said that the Eatons stores were too upscale and/or too thinly scattered across the country for the mini-chain to have ever been profitable and worthwhile. The retail environment has changed with more of the population shopping at big box outlets and specialty stores squeezing out the middle market which is the base of the traditional department store.

In 2005, Sears Card financial services were outsourced to JPMorgan Chase. Sears received C$3 billion for the sale, and the Sears Club points system was retained by the retailer. Sears also paid a special dividend upon the completion of the transaction. CEO Brent Hollister said that the move would allow Sears to refocus on its retail operations. Sears Canada announced it would end its credit card partnership with JPMorgan Chase when the agreement expired in November 2015.

In January 2006, Sears Holdings, the parent company and majority shareholder of Sears Canada, made a bid to purchase the remaining shares to take the company private. Some members of the board opposed the move. A ruling by the Ontario Securities Commission, made in August 2006, stalled progress the attempted privatization by its parent company, Sears Holdings Limited. While the ruling did not dispel the future possibility of the privatization of Sears Canada, it posed a significant obstacle by ruling three major shareholding blocks ineligible to vote as the blocks were given extraordinary privileges by Sears Holdings Limited. On November 14, 2006, Sears Holdings&#x27; move to privatize Sears Canada at a bid of $17.97/share fell through by voting amongst the minority shareholder groups. On March 31, 2005, the majority ownership stake was transferred to Sears Holdings, which then owned 73.1% of Sears Canada common shares, while Pershing Square Capital held 17.3%, and the remainder of the shares were publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

On September 26, 2007, Sears Canada announced the sale of its 222 Jarvis Street headquarters to the Government of Ontario. The company relocated its head office to surplus space at its flagship store in the Toronto Eaton Centre.

==== 2010–2016 ====
Same-store sales were down 4% in 2010, compared to 6.8% in 2009. In December 2011, after slow sales over the holiday season, Sears laid off 70 employees from its head office after losing nearly $47 million in the previous quarter. Through 2003 and into 2011 the company lost $1.6 billion in revenue.

In June 2011, Calvin McDonald, formerly of Loblaw Companies, was named president and CEO of Sears Canada. McDonald planned to restructure the company&#x27;s operations under a three-year plan, in the wake of increased competition and economic uncertainties. He explained that &quot;we are in the situation that we are in because we stopped doing the things that make great retailers great. We traded ourselves into this challenge and we will trade ourselves out of it.&quot; The company had posted a $44.1 million loss in 2010 but had recovered to $21.9 million by the third quarter of 2011. Among the planned changes were to build upon market segments where Sears had historically performed well (including appliances, dresses, children&#x27;s wear and related products, and mattresses), and introduce a new store format with a more &quot;engaging&quot; layout. In 2012, Sears sold three stores in Calgary, Ottawa, and Vancouver (Chinook Centre, Rideau Centre, and Pacific Centre) back to Cadillac Fairview for $170 million. Sears also sold its Deerfoot Mall location in Calgary, as well as its locations at Square One Shopping Centre and Yorkdale Mall. Sears Holdings also distributed shares in the company to Sears Canada&#x27;s shareholders, reducing its holdings to 51%. Sears Holdings Corporation&#x27;s chairman and CEO, Edward Lampert, has a 27% stake in Sears Canada. In April 2013, the company began to scale back some of its product offerings, dropping electronics and window coverings, and making toys online-only.

In September 2013, Douglas C. Campbell took over as Sears Canada&#x27;s COO. The following month, Sears Canada announced that it would close five of its major urban stores and sell them back to their respective landlords, including its flagship Toronto Eaton Centre location, as well as two other locations in Toronto, one in London, and one in Richmond, British Columbia. Campbell explained that &quot;Unlocking the value of assets is one of the three levers we have said we will use as a way to create total value for the company. When proposals such as this one are presented to us, we must weigh the value of the transaction against the value we will obtain from continuing to operate those stores in their current locations&quot;.

Campbell left Sears Canada in October 2014 and was replaced by Ronald Boire, who served until June 2015. Brandon Stranzl was appointed executive chairman in July 2015, continuing in his role as chairman of the board and also assuming the duties of the CEO. In November 2015, Carrie Kirkman was appointed president and chief merchant, a role she held until July 2016.

In late 2013, SHS Services Management, a Markham, Ontario-based contract partner, went into receivership, but Sears Canada promised to honour home improvement warranty through services offered by SHS on behalf of Sears Canada.

On August 24, 2016, Sears Canada unveiled a new corporate logo, consisting of a black wordmark and a red outline of a maple leaf, to replace the blue striped wordmark that had previously been used by the U.S. Sears chain. Company representatives described the new logo as being &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;confident&quot;.

In its second quarter earnings report, Sears Canada announced that it was developing a new store concept dubbed &quot;Sears 2.0&quot;, which it planned to test at several of its current locations. In September 2016, Sears officially unveiled the new store format at its Promenade and Mapleview Centre locations, with a media launch day on September 27, 2016. The new format was designed to have a more open layout with fewer permanent displays and partitions, providing more flexibility in how departments are arranged and stocked. The footwear department was also moved to the centre of the store and switched to a &quot;self-serve&quot; concept, with product boxes accessible by customers (thus reducing the need for dedicated associates). Stranzl stated that the new format was meant to &quot;take ideas from the best in the business, whether it&#x27;s in shoes, outerwear or appliances&quot;, and return the chain to a &quot;price-focused&quot; strategy. The new format was implemented during renovation of the Stone Road Mall location in Guelph.

In December 2016, Sears Canada announced plans to add grocery sections in three-to-five remodelled stores in 2017. The selection would be primarily organic, with a focus on low cost and e-commerce.

== Bankruptcy and liquidation ==

On June 13, 2017, citing &quot;material uncertainties&quot; over whether the company would have enough cash flow to meet its financial obligations over the next year, and &quot;significant doubt as to the company&#x27;s ability to continue as a going concern&quot;, Sears Canada announced that it had hired advisors to explore a potential restructuring or sale of the company. On June 22, 2017, Sears Canada received court protection from its creditors and announced that it had commenced court-supervised restructuring proceedings under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act, which would include closure a total of 59 stores (including 20 department stores, 15 Sears Home stores, 14 Sears Hometown stores, and 10 Sears Outlet stores) over an unspecified time period. These closures resulted in the loss of 2,900 employees. The company had also been reducing its product assortment to have a larger focus on fashion and home decor, downplaying its automotive, electronics, and tool businesses. The company stated that its new strategies and positioning were &quot;starting to resonate with consumers&quot;, citing increasing same-store sales over the previous two quarters.

On July 18, 2017, Sears Canada received court approval to begin liquidating the inventory of the 59 closing locations on July 21, 2017, appointing Gordon Brothers and Merchant Retail Solutions to manage the liquidation of the department and Sears Home stores. Per the formal plan submitted in court documents, the terms &quot;bankruptcy&quot;, &quot;going out of business&quot;, or &quot;liquidation&quot; could not be used to promote these sales. Liquidation of the Hometown stores was managed by their franchisees. The move to close Hometown stores was criticized by several of their owners. The owners of five Alberta dealers reported that most of their locations were still profitable, and stated that due to the restructuring proceedings, they were losing compensation prescribed by their contracts with Sears if the retailer terminates them early.

Amid the restructuring, Sears Canada was criticized for its treatment of the laid-off employees, including that the company planned to issue a total of $7.6 million in retention bonuses to 43 executives and senior managers, and $1.6 million to senior employees at stores that are closing, but did not plan to offer severance pay to the laid-off employees. These concerns resulted in calls over social media to boycott the company. Sears Canada defended the decisions, stating that the retention payments were a common practice during these processes, intended to maintain the morale of senior staff as they wind down their stores and that key executives remain with the company through the insolvency process.

On August 15, 2017, the company announced that it planned to seek authorization from the Ontario Superior Court to siphon $500,000 from the retention bonuses into an &quot;Employee Hardship Fund&quot;, which would be available to eligible employees. A company representative stated that Sears Canada &quot;shares everyone&#x27;s concerns about the plight faced by some of its former employees, and is glad to see a solution, pending court approval, that can at least help those most in need.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that this arrangement was not a true substitute to severance pay, as affected employees &quot;would have collected far more had Sears followed the typical path of giving a few weeks of pay per year of service for terminated employees.&quot;

On October 2, 2017, Sears Canada announced its intent to seek extended bankruptcy protection as well as the closure of 11 additional stores.

A management group led by the company&#x27;s executive chairman Brandon Stranzl had hoped to take over the retailer, but that attempt failed. &quot;Following exhaustive efforts, no viable transaction for the company to continue as a going concern was received,&quot; Sears Canada announced on October 10, 2017. On the same day, the company stated that it was seeking court approval to liquidate the approximately 130 remaining locations and assets. Sears Canada received Ontario Superior Court approval on October 13, 2017, since there was no viable buyer for the operation; the liquidation process was expected to be completed in 10 to 14 weeks after the beginning of liquidation on October 19, 2017.

The closure of all operations led to a loss of nearly 12,000 jobs, of which roughly three-quarters were part-time employees. Since the pension plan was underfunded by nearly $270 million, the annual benefits received by 17,000 pension plan members was likely to be reduced. In an attempt to moderate the hardship for retirees, a judge had previously ordered payments to other Sears creditors frozen until the pension issue was resolved. While Ontario offers a plan to financially aid such pensioners under its Pension Benefits Act, no other province has a similar program.

==Store formats and channels==

===Full-line stores===
Simpsons-Sears began operating full-line (department) stores in 1953. Internally, these have been classified by size, volume, and the extent of merchandise selection. In the early decades, classifications were based on a letter designation, mirroring founding American parent, Sears, Roebuck, and Co.: &#x27;A&#x27; Stores were large full-line stores, &#x27;B&#x27; stores were smaller full-lines, serving more-mid-sized markets, while &#x27;D&#x27; stores were early stores serving small markets, normally offering mostly hard-line and home departments, with a catalogue desk. the &#x27;D&#x27; stores were phased out in the early 1960s. Small stores, denoted &#x27;S.S.&#x27; and serving similar markets to the original &#x27;D&#x27; Stores, were introduced in the 1980s. In latter decades, stores have been classified by more descriptive terms, such as &#x27;Select,&#x27; &#x27;Core&#x27;, and &#x27;Small.&#x27; When Hometown Dealer Stores were introduced, they mirrored the assortments of the early &#x27;D&#x27; stores.

===Clearance centres and outlet stores===
In 1971, adjacent to its new Kenmore Catalogue Service Centre in Toronto, Simpsons-Sears opened its first new concept &quot;Clearance Centre&quot;, to assist in the rotation of its off-season and marked down catalogue merchandise. The concept was eventually expanded nationwide, offering consumers an off-priced selection of in-house and brand name products. In the 2000s, these stores were renamed &quot;Outlet Stores&quot; to reflect a broader assortment as well as channel-specific merchandise. Sears full-line stores in some markets were converted to this format in 2014. As of Fall 2016, Sears Canada operated 17 outlet locations. In June 2017 Sears announced 10 remaining outlet stores would also close.

===Hometown (Dealer) stores===
In 1994, Sears Canada opened its first Hometown Dealer Store in Pembroke, Ontario. The &quot;Hometown Stores&quot;. were designed to serve smaller-sized markets and bring a displayed selection of big ticket merchandise, along with the convenience of a local Catalogue counter, to consumers not near larger Sears stores nor other large retail firms. Stores of this format were operated predominantly in partnership with local community franchisers.

===Home stores===
In 1995, Sears Canada launched a chain of specialty stores called &quot;Sears Whole Home&quot; in order to better showcase its home decor offerings. Furniture stores were located in power centres. they were renamed &quot;Sears Furniture and Appliances&quot; stores in 1999, to reflect the addition of major appliances. In 2003, the Furniture and Appliances stores were renamed &quot;Sears Home&quot; stores. This change was intended to reflect their broader appeal for customers seeking a one-stop experience for re-making their home decor. The stores&#x27; product line was expanded to include home-installed products and services such as floor coverings, customer drapery, and other installed home related products in many locations.

In 2004, new off-mall specialty formats were introduced, including four Sears Appliances and Mattresses stores and two Sears (Floor) Coverings Stores.

===Online shopping===
In 1998, Sears Canada&#x27;s website, sears.ca, became an active channel, allowing customers to order from a selection of over 500 products.

In 2016, the company launched Initium, an initiative to overhaul existing legacy platforms into a new cohesive, functional, adaptable and user-friendly online retail enterprise for consumers. This new site provided for omni-channel availability of orders, integrated logistics and improved search and checkout experiences for customers. In a related move, Sears Canada entered into an agreement with CGI to support Sears strategy to reengineer its technology platforms, with the goal of reducing costs and improving efficiency. After October 19, 2017, the website was no longer available for online purchases and directed shoppers to the remaining stores undergoing liquidation, with a message of thanks to customers. Sears Canada website ceased operations after December 13, 2018, but their social media links with Twitter and Facebook can still be reached despite no activity since the retailer ceased operating.

Sears offers options for Canadian cross-border shoppers to purchase from US site and pickup at the nearest US store. International delivery is not available to Canadians.

=== Corbeil Appliances ===
Founded in 1949, Corbeil Électrique Inc., better known as Corbeil Appliances, was acquired by Sears Canada in 2005. Corbeil had 26 locations in Quebec, but closed its four locations in Toronto and Ottawa. As a part of the bankruptcy protection process, Corbeil was sold to Am-Cam Électroménagers Inc., headquartered in Montreal, for an undisclosed amount. Am-Cam is the parent company of Distinctive Appliances and the sale was completed in December 2017.

== Corporate affairs ==
The headquarters were in Downtown Toronto, inside an eight-story complex which was formerly the home to Sears&#x27; flagship location within the Toronto Eaton Centre until 2014. The headquarters moved there from 222 Jarvis Street after that building was sold in 2007 to the Ontario Realty Corporation and houses provincial government use since 2011. The lower four floors of the Eaton Centre location remained in use for retail, including a three-floor Nordstrom store from fall 2016 onwards, while the upper four floors continued as Sears Canada headquarters. This headquarters remained active until the retailer completed liquidation on January 14, 2018.

After closure of the stores and corporate head office, the board of directors remains active with four remaining members are responsible in divesting remaining real estate for the now defunct retailer.

==Sears house brands==
Sears Canada and its predecessors were long been associated with its well-known house brands, each having a history of its own. For Canadian and overseas vendor suppliers, it maintained a Vendor Code of Conduct which, amongst other things, prohibits the use of child labour.

Among some of Sears house brands over time:

Craftsman was Sears&#x27; line of hardware, lawn and garden equipment, and work wear. In 2009, readers of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; named Craftsman their favourite brand of hand tools in their Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards. The Craftsman trademark was registered by Sears, Roebuck and Co. on May 20, 1927. Arthur Barrows, head of the company&#x27;s hardware department, liked the name Craftsman and reportedly bought the rights to use it from the Marion-Craftsman Tool Company for $500. The line has been carried in Canada since Simpsons-Sears began operating in 1953, first alongside such Simpson&#x27;s hardware brands as Beaver.

Sears tool line, like many of its other product lines, used a &quot;good, better, best&quot; pricing structure, with the Craftsman brand as the middle tier and Craftsman Professional or Craftsman Industrial as the highest tier. The lower, value-priced tier was branded Sears. The &quot;Dunlap&quot; name was also used for from the late 1930s until the late 1950s. The Sears tool line was discontinued in the late 1980s and replaced by the &quot;Companion&quot; tool line. The Companion tool line was discontinued and replaced by the &quot;Evolv&#x27;&quot; tool line in 2008, with a focus on homeowners and do-it-yourselfers.

Kenmore was Sears Canada&#x27;s primary line of household appliances. The first Kenmore branded product was a washing machine marketed by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1927. The first Kenmore vacuum cleaners were sold in the U.S. in 1932. Simpsons-Sears began selling the Kenmore line in Canada in 1953. Kenmore&#x27;s upscale line of appliances is known as the Elite line. Kenmore also has a professional line of appliances called Kenmore Pro. In the 1960s and 1970s, many housewares and personal electrics in the line were branded “Lady Kenmore” but its use was discontinued with the rise of sexism sensitivities.

Silvertone was the brand name used by Sears, Roebuck and Co. for its line of sound, radio, stereo and home entertainment equipment from 1915 to 1972 and by Simpsons-Sears in Canada from 1953 to 1972. Probably best known for the line of inexpensive guitars, the brand became popular with novice musicians. Jerry Garcia, Chet Atkins, Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, Jack White, Mark Knopfler, and Brad Paisley had a Silvertone for their first electric, bass, or acoustic guitar. The Canadian band Chad Allan and The Silvertones, which became The Guess Who, took its name from this line of instruments. Pete Townshend would employ them in live performance with The Who for the purposes of smashing them. The name was placed on guitars from several different manufacturers over the years, including Danelectro, National, Harmony, Kay, and Teisco. The guitars, especially the 1960s models, are prized by collectors.

Coldspot was a Sears brand that existed from 1928 to 1976. The brand was created for a line of refrigerators. Other products sold under the Coldspot brand included freezers, dehumidifiers, and window air conditioning units. Sears, Roebuck had supplied this brand to Eaton&#x27;s for distribution in Canada, but the line switched it to Simpsons-Sears upon its founding.

Jessica was Sears Canada&#x27;s primary private label brand of women&#x27;s apparel and accessories, catering to the modern woman. It was introduced in 1987 and was the top-selling ladies&#x27; fashion label in Canada. The brand was later renamed &quot;Jess&quot; near the closure of the brand.

Attitude was a fashion-forward ladies&#x27; fashion collection appealing to fashion conscious women. It had been an Eaton&#x27;s exclusive house brand and Sears continued the name. In 2010, when Canadian fashion designer Jay Manuel became its exclusive designer, the line became Attitude by Jay Manuel. Manuel also added a men&#x27;s dresswear line to the collection. In 2013, Sears entered into a strategic alliance with the ALDO Group to design and manufacture Sears entire line of Attitude and Nevada footwear for men and women.

&quot;&#x27;Nevada&quot; was Sears Canada&#x27;s main line of denim and casual wear for both children and adults. Introduced along with a revamp of apparel house brands in 1987. It followed in the footsteps of another long-popular but more utilitarian Sears jeans line, &quot;Toughskins&quot;, which dominated in the 1970s. In 2013, Sears entered into a strategic alliance with Buffalo International Inc. to design and manufacture Sears&#x27; entire line of Nevada denim-based apparel (cited above).

In 2016, with the rollout of the Sears 2.0 concept, Sears Canada amalgamated most of its house brands into the Sears Woman, Sears Man, Sears Kids and Sears Home labels.

In 2017, Canadian Tire agreed to acquire rights to the Viking appliance brand, however Viking Range, LLC purchased the rights in January 2018. Indigo Books and Music acquired the Calgary Distribution Centre and Subsidiary SLH Transport was sold to Quebec-based C.A.T. Transport Inc.

<doc id="296102" wikidata="Q7574976" url="?curid=296102" title="Specific Area Message Encoding">
<text>Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) is a protocol used for framing and classification of broadcasting emergency warning messages. It was developed by the United States National Weather Service for use on its NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) network, and was later adopted by the Federal Communications Commission for the Emergency Alert System, then subsequently by Environment Canada for use on its Weatheradio Canada service. It is also used to set off receivers in Mexico City and surrounding areas as part of the Mexican Seismic Alert System (SASMEX).

==History==
From the 1960s to the 1980s, a special feature of the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) system was the transmission of a single attention tone prior to the broadcast of any message alerting the general public of significant weather events. This became known as the Warning Alarm Tone (WAT). Although it served NWR well, there were many drawbacks. Without staff at media facilities to manually evaluate the need to rebroadcast an NWR message using the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), automatic rebroadcasting of all messages preceded by just the WAT was unacceptable and impractical. Even if stations and others with the need were willing to allow for this type of automatic capture, assuming the events for activation were critical, there was no way for automated equipment at the station to know when the message was complete and restore it back to normal operation.

SAME had its beginnings in the early 1980s when NOAA&#x27;s National Weather Service (NWS) began experimenting with system using analog tones in a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) format to transmit data with radio broadcasts. In 1985, the NWS forecast offices began experimenting with placing special digital codes at the beginning and end of every message concerning life- or property-threatening weather conditions targeting a specific area. The intent of what became SAME was to ultimately transmit a code with the initial broadcast of all NWR messages. However, the roll-out moved slowly until 1995, when the U.S. Government provided the budget needed to develop the SAME technology across the entire radio network. Nationwide implementation occurred in 1997, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the SAME standard as part of its new Emergency Alert System (EAS). In 2003, NOAA established a SAME technology standard for weather radio receivers.

The SAME technique was later adopted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1997 for use in the EAS as well as by Environment Canada for its Weatheradio Canada service in 2004. Much like the original EBS dual-tone , this produces a distinct sound (the ) which is easily recognized by most individuals due to its use in weekly and monthly broadcast tests, as well as weather alert messages. During the said events, viewers and/or listeners will hear these digital codes in the form of buzzes, chirps, and clicking sounds (colloquially known as &quot;duck farts&quot; by broadcast engineers) just before the attention signal is sent out and at the conclusion of the voice message.

==Format of digital parts==
In the SAME system, messages are constructed in four parts, the first and last of which are digital and the middle two are audio. The digital sections of a SAME message are AFSK data bursts, with individual bits lasting 1920 μs (1.92 ms) each, giving a bit rate of 520 bits per second. A mark bit is four complete cycles of a sine wave, translating to a mark frequency of 2083 Hz, and a space bit is three complete sine wave cycles, making the space frequency 1562.5 Hz.

The data is sent isochronously and encoded in 8-bit bytes with the most-significant bit of each ASCII byte set to zero. The least-significant bit of each byte is transmitted first, including the preamble. The data stream is bit and byte synchronized on the preamble.

Since there is no error correction, the digital part of a SAME message is transmitted three times, so that decoders can pick &quot;best two out of three&quot; for each byte, thereby eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail.

==Header format==

The text of the header code is a fixed format:

 &lt;Preamble&gt;ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-

This is broken down as follows:

1. A preamble of binary 10101011 (0xAB in hex) repeated sixteen times, used for &quot;receiver calibration&quot; (i.e., clock synchronization), then the letters codice_1 as an attention to the decoder (a message activation method inherited from NAVTEX).

2. &quot;ORG&quot; — Originator code; programmed per unit when put into operation
* PEP – National Public Warning System (Previously known as &quot;Primary Entry Point System&quot;. It will be FEMA for National Tests through the Legacy format instead of IPAWS.)
** President or other authorized national officials
* CIV – Civil authorities
** i.e. Governor, state/local emergency management, local police/fire officials
* WXR – National Weather Service (or Environment Canada.)
** Any weather-related alert
* EAS – EAS Participant (or Broadcast station or cable system)
** Broadcasters. Generally only used with test messages.
* EAN – Emergency Action Notification Network (No longer used after 2010.)
** Used to send Emergency Action Notifications. (No longer used, replaced by PEP.)

3. &quot;EEE&quot; — Event code; programmed at time of event

4. &quot;PSSCCC&quot; — Location codes (up to 31 location codes per message), each beginning with a dash character; programmed at time of event
* In the United States, the first digit (&quot;P&quot;) is zero if the entire county or area is included in the warning, otherwise, it is a non-zero number depending on the cardinal location of the emergency within the area. The remaining five digits are the FIPS state (&quot;SS&quot;) and county code (&quot;CCC&quot;). The entire state may be specified by using county code 000 (&quot;three zeros&quot;).
* In Canada, all six digits make up a Canadian Location Code, which corresponds to a specific forecast region as used by the Meteorological Service of Canada. All forecast region numbers are six digits with the first digit always zero.

5. &quot;TTTT&quot; — Purge time of the alert event (from exact time of issue)
* In the format &quot;hhmm&quot;, using 15-minute increments up to one hour, using 30-minute increments up to six hours, and using hourly increments beyond six hours. Weekly and monthly tests sometimes have a 12-hour or greater purge time to assure users have an ample opportunity to verify reception of the test event messages; however; 15 minutes is more common, especially on NOAA Weather Radio&#x27;s tests.
* For short term events (like a tornado) this value could be set to 0000 (&quot;four zeros&quot;), which will purge the warning immediately after the message has been received. However, this is not typical, and FCC guidelines suggest a minimum of 15 minutes purge time.
* The purge time is not intended to coincide with the actual end of the event. Longer events that may not end for days (like hurricanes) may have a purge time of only a few hours. That an event message has been purged does not indicate or imply that the threat has passed.

The National Weather Service is changing the maximum purge time for alerts on NOAA Weather Radio from 6 hours to 99.5 hours by summer 2023 to address long duration events purging before the event begins.

6. &quot;JJJHHMM&quot; — Exact time of issue, in UTC, (&quot;without time zone adjustments&quot;).
* &quot;JJJ&quot; is the Ordinal date (&quot;day&quot;) of the year, with leading zeros
* &quot;HHMM&quot; is the hours and minutes (24-hour format), in UTC, with leading zeros

7. &quot;LLLLLLLL&quot; — Eight-character station callsign identification, with &quot;/&quot; used instead of &quot;–&quot; (such as the first eight letters of a cable headend&#x27;s location, codice_2 for WABC-FM, codice_3 for a weather radio station programmed from Los Angeles, or codice_4 for a Weatheradio Canada station).

Each field of the header code is terminated by a dash character, including the station ID at the end; individual &quot;PSSCCC&quot; location numbers are also separated by dashes, with a plus (+) separating the last location from the purge time that follows it.

==Full message format==
An EAS message contains these elements, in this transmitted sequence:

# Header.
# Attention signal — Sent if any message is included (normally sent with all messages except RWT on broadcast radio/TV); must be at least eight seconds long. (On weather radio in Canada the 1050 Hz tone is only used with three event codes: RMT, SVR &amp; TOR)
#* Single audio tone used by NOAA Weather Radio.
#* Combined tones for broadcast radio/TV.
# Message — An audio message. The FCC permits encoded video or text in lieu of an audio message, but neither are implemented in practice.
# Tail — (Preamble) codice_5 (EOM).

There is one second of blank audio between each section, and before and after each message. For those used to packet communications systems where each packet has a checksum, note that there is no checksum used in the message format. The header and EOM are transmitted 3 times, and the receiver is obliged to implement columnar parity correction.

The combined tones date back to 1976 when they were made part of the Emergency Broadcast System, the EAS&#x27; predecessor.

==Event codes==
There are roughly 80 different event codes that are used in EAS. These codes are defined federally by the FCC for use in the EAS system and publicly by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) standard for SAME protocol weather radio receiver decoder units.

All but the first six of these used to be optional and could be programmed into encoder/decoder units at the request of the broadcaster. However, a July 12, 2007, memo by the FCC now requires mandatory participation in state and local level EAS by broadcasters. Furthermore, the creation and evolution of a voluntary standard by the CEA in December 2003 has provided participating manufacturers of weather radio receivers a single definitive reference to use when designing and programming receivers. In addition, some receiver manufacturers have added an additional layer as to whether or not an event code can be user-suppressed (e.g., a Hurricane Warning in a Midwest US State) or will never be allowed to be suppressed (e.g., Nuclear Power Plant Warning).

:Key for event code tables

:Event codes in use:

:The following event codes have been implemented by agencies in the United States and/or Canada, and CIRES A.C. in Mexico.
* Unrecognized Alerts are only seen on NOAA Weather Radios. This is typically due to poor reception, or for newly implemented event codes, which an older radio may not recognize.
:** While the CEA standard lists the FZW event code as &quot;Freeze Warning&quot;, Environment Canada refers to it as a &quot;Frost Warning&quot;. However, it will be displayed as a &quot;Freeze Warning&quot; on receivers that are compliant to the CEA standard.
:† Environment Canada additionally uses the WSW event code to refer to any of the following weather conditions: Blowing Snow Warning, Freezing Drizzle Warning, Freezing Rain Warning, Snowfall Warning, Snow Squall Warning
:*** The EQW and VOW event codes are used in Mexico as part of the Mexican Seismic Alert System (also known as SASMEX). EQW is referred as &quot;Alerta Sísmica&quot;, while VOW is referred to as &quot;Alerta Volcánica&quot;. Other event codes are being tested, such as Hurricane Warning (HUW), Hurricane Watch (HUA) and Hurricane Statement (HLS). Required Weekly Tests (RWT) are conducted every three hours to make sure receivers are working properly.
:**** The FCC created the BLU code for Blue Alerts beginning on December 14, 2017.
:*****The FCC in 2012 modified protocol for national EAS activations. Emergency Action Notifications are now treated as any other EAS alert (except that it is mandatory to air), eliminating the need for Emergency Action Terminations, so the FCC removed it from operation.
:Internal use only:

:Receiver decoders that comply to the CEA standard will neither display the messages below, nor activate a warning tone if applicable. While the message will be stored in memory, it will not be displayed to the user. The FCC has also designated these event codes as being for &quot;internal use only&quot;, and not for display. Environment Canada lists these messages as &quot;Administrative Bulletins&quot;.

: The above events are only seen on NOAA Weather Radio if certain situations happen, such as a station losing power. In this case, the &quot;TXB&quot; or &quot;Transmitter Backup On&quot; code would be transmitted, following by beeping noises of multiple frequencies, finally followed by EOM tones. However, these tones are not typically transmitted over the air.

:Future implementation:

:The following codes are part of the CEA standard for receiver decoders, but are not listed as being in use by any agencies in the United States. Environment Canada lists these codes, along with several others, as &quot;for possible future implementation&quot;. None of these event codes are being implemented in Mexico, as Mexico&#x27;s network is for seismic and volcanic alerts at this time.

The FCC established naming conventions for EAS event codes. The third letter of the code must be one of the following.
The exception to this convention is for &quot;TOR&quot; (tornado warning), &quot;SVR&quot; (severe thunderstorm warning), &quot;EVI&quot; (evacuation immediate), &quot;EAN, EAT, NIC&quot; (the EAS national activation codes), and &quot;ADR&quot; (administrative messages).

==On weather radio receivers==
There are many weather/all-hazards radio receivers that are equipped with the SAME alert feature, which allows users to program SAME/FIPS/CLC codes for their designated area or areas of their interest and/or concern rather than the entire broadcast area. (For example, a person living in Irving, Texas, would program a FIPS code for Dallas County. However, if there is a need to know of severe weather from the west and northwest ahead of time, the user would program additional FIPS codes for Denton and Tarrant Counties.)

On a more specialized receiver, a user has the option to eliminate any SAME alert codes that may not apply to their area such as a &quot;Special Marine Warning&quot; or a &quot;Coastal Flood Warning&quot;. Once the SAME header is sent by NOAA/NWS and if it matches the desired code(s), the receivers then decode the event, scroll it on their display screens, and sound an alarm.

Receivers receive on one of the following National Weather Service network frequencies (in MHz): 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550. The signals are typically receivable up to 40 miles (80 km) from the transmitters.

==In popular culture==
* The Iowa State Cyclones football sports program uses a SAME tone at the end of the pregame video before the football team takes the field. The SAME message is followed by the following narration: &quot;This is a Cyclone Weather Alert! Ladies and Gentlemen, radar has indicated a strong storm approaching Jack Trice Stadium. High winds and low visibility are expected. &quot;[The opposing team&#x27;s]&quot; fans in the area should seek immediate cover...&quot;
* The EOM (end of message) tone was heard in the movie trailer for &quot;Knowing&quot; and in the series &quot;Jericho&quot; in which its familiar emergency use and its increasing cadence create a sense of foreboding.
* It was used in the movie trailers for &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; and &quot;The Purge&quot;. The uses have since been heavily discouraged on air by the Federal Communications Commission (outside public service announcements demonstrating SAME and EAS technology), and stations and networks using them (for instance, TBS and WNKY in Bowling Green, Kentucky) in advertising or promotions have been fined for doing so.
* The SAME tones can be briefly heard in the &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; episode &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;.
* SAME Tones are heard in the campaign of the popular video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, prior to the mission “Of Their Own Accord”. Ironically, these tones are decoded down to an EAS Participant issuing a Required Weekly Test on station WLS-TV.
* In the 2020 video game Black Mesa, entire emergency messages with SAME tones can be heard on radios as the player progresses, each describing the game&#x27;s events with increasing urgency. In January 2015, prior to the game&#x27;s release on Steam as early access, a website was launched that played back one such message as a teaser.
* SAME tones are used within a genre of videos on video sharing platform sites like YouTube known as &quot;EAS scenarios,&quot; which depict fictional emergency situations through a series of fictional EAS broadcasts. The majority of SAME tones used within these videos are valid, though some creators choose to use customized tones (and on several occasions, a warning/disclaimer) to prevent unintentional activation of EAS equipment.
* In &quot;Leave The World Behind&quot;, a conversation is interrupted with a SAME message suddenly emerging from the television, with it later revealing that an &quot;Unrecognised Warning&quot; (&quot;??W&quot;) is being distributed over the network.

<text>The Tłı̨chǫ (, ) people, sometimes spelled Tlicho and also known as the Dogrib, are a Dene First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group living in the Northwest Territories of Canada.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Dogrib&quot; is an English adaptation of their own name, (or ) – “Dog-Flank People”, referring to their fabled descent from a supernatural dog-man. Like their Dene neighbours they called themselves often simply (&quot;person&quot;, &quot;human&quot;) or (&quot;People, i.e. Dene People&quot;). The Tłı̨chǫ&#x27;s land is known as (or , or ). On the 1682 Franquelin map, Dogrib was recorded as &quot;Alimousp[i]goiak&quot; (from Cree , &quot;Dog-Flanks&quot;).

== Communities ==
The Tłı̨chǫ have six communities with a majority of Tłı̨chǫ residents: Behchokǫ̀ (formerly Rae-Edzo), Whatì (Lac la Martre), Gamèti (Rae Lakes), and Wekweètì (Snare Lake), the four communities of the Tłı̨chǫ Government, and Dettah (T&#x27;èɂehdaà) and Ndilǫ, the communities of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation.

The or Dogrib language belongs to the Athabaskan languages, which are part of the Na-Dene languages family. The dialect spoken in the communities of Dettah and Ndilǫ developed from intermarriage between Yellowknives and Tłı̨chǫ.

== Treaty Process ==

=== Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) ===
In June 1899, negotiation began on Treaty 8, which covered in the Northwest Territory. It was an agreement between the Canadian Government and the Dene groups in the area in question; in return for their willingness to share their land with non-Natives, the Dene would receive medical and educational assistance, as well as treaty payments. The Canadian Government and the various Dene groups, including Yellowknives and Tłı̨chǫ under chief Drygeese with headmen Benaiyah and Sek&#x27;eglinan, signed the treaty in 1900 at Fort Resolution (called by the Tłı̨chǫ &quot;Įndàà&quot;). After the signing, the group that signed the treaty was called the &quot;Yellowknife B Band&quot; (Helm, 7: 1994). At that point in history, Treaty No.8 was the largest land settlement the Canadian Government had ever made (PWNHC, Historical).

=== Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib) ===
Twenty years after Treaty No. 8 was signed, oil was discovered in the Mackenzie River Valley. Upon the discovery, the Canadian Government proposed another treaty that would clear the way for miners and development of the area. The treaty was greatly debated, as the Natives did not want to lose their right to hunt, fish, gather, and trap in the area. They also opposed being &quot;confined to Indian reserves.&quot; Many Dene felt that Treaty No. 8 was not honored by the Canadian Government, and some were afraid that this treaty would turn out similarly. Nevertheless, Treaty No. 11 was signed by the Tłı̨chǫ trading chief Monfwi in the summer of 1921. The Tłı̨chǫ groups that signed this treaty were then known as the &quot;Dog Rib Rae Band&quot; (Helm, 7: 1994), constituting the majority of the Tłı̨chǫ population. Both Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 overlap in several of their boundaries, and continue to cause conflict between the two separate treaty bands (nowadays two First Nations).

Not all members of the Dene and Tłı̨chǫ communities agreed with or signed these treaties. In the fall of 1992, the Tłı̨chǫ submitted their own regional claim to the Canadian government. Negotiations were scheduled to begin in 1994 between the &quot;Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib)&quot; and the &quot;Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib)&quot;, but the Yellowknife B Band refused to enter into negotiations. This complicated matters, as both treaty groups had land boundaries that overlapped each other. Self-governance seemed to be the issue between the two groups, as both wanted to have their say in the agreement. This halted the negotiations in 1994 while the Canadian government explored the boundary and self-government issue. A new mandate in April 1997 allowed negotiation of a &quot;joint land claims and self-government agreement with the Dogrib Treaty 11 Council&quot; (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib). In 1999, the Agreement-in-Principle was available for Dogrib approval and was accepted on January 7, 2000. Ninety-three percent of the Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib) turned out to vote with over 84% voting for the agreement. After several community discussions and revisions, in March 2003 the Chief Negotiators initialed the agreement.

== Tłı̨chǫ First Nations ==

=== Yellowknives Dene First Nation (formerly Yellowknife B Band) ===
The Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) formed the Yellowknives Dene First Nation in 1991 following the collapse of this territorial-wide comprehensive land claim negotiation. They currently negotiate a land claim settlement for their lands as part of the Akaitcho Land Claim Process by the Akaitcho Territory Government. The Yellowknives Dene First Nation (known by themselves as &quot;Weledeh Yellowknives Dene&quot;) is the umbrella organization for the Dettah Yellowknives Dene First Nation (or – &#x27;Burnt Point&#x27; in Tłı̨chǫ, referring to a traditional Dene fishing camp) and Ndilǫ Yellowknives Dene First Nation ( ). They speak the Dettah-Ndilǫ dialect of Tłı̨chǫ and are descendants of Tłı̨chǫ, Yellowknives and Chipewyan.

=== Tlicho Government (formerly Dog Rib Rae Band) ===

==== The Tlicho Agreement ====
The act of signing the agreement began the ratification process for the Tlicho Agreement. On Thursday, August 4, 2005, the Tlicho Agreement went into full effect, &quot;The first official day of the Tlicho Government and the Tlicho community governments&quot; (Tlicho Effective Date). On August 25, 2003, they signed a land claims agreement, also called Tłı̨chǫ, as the Tłı̨chǫ Government, with the Government of Canada. The agreement will cede a area between Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake in the NWT to Tłı̨chǫ ownership. The territory includes the communities of Behchokǫ̀, Gamèti, Wekweètì and Whatì along with Diavik Diamond Mine and Ekati Diamond Mine. The four Tłı̨chǫ bands, Dog Rib Rae First Nation, Wha Ti First Nation, Gameti First Nation and Dechi Laot&#x27;i First Nations, as well as their umbrella Dogrib Treaty 11 Council, ceased to exist on August 4, 2005, and have been succeeded by the Tlicho Government.

The Tłı̨chǫ have their own legislative bodies in the area&#x27;s four communities, of which the chiefs must be Tłı̨chǫ, though anyone may run for councillor and vote. The legislatures will have, among other authorities, the power to collect taxes, levy resource royalties, which currently go to the federal government, and control hunting, fishing and industrial development.

The Tłı̨chǫ would also receive payments of $152 million over 15 years and annual payments of approximately $3.5 million.

The federal government retains control of criminal law, as it does across Canada, and the NWT controls services such as health care and education in partnership with the Tłı̨chǫ Nation through the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency.

The land-claims process took twenty years to conclude. A similar process with the Inuit in the NWT brought about the creation of the new territory of Nunavut. Though Tłı̨chǫnèk&#x27;e is not a separate territory, the extent of its powers has invited comparisons both with the birth of Nunavut and with the creation of the NWT government in 1967.

<text>William Stanley Jr. (November 28, 1858 – May 14, 1916) was an American physicist born in Brooklyn, New York. During his career, he obtained 129 patents covering a variety of electric devices. In 1913, he also patented an all-steel vacuum bottle, and formed the Stanley Bottle Company.

==Early life and education==
Stanley was born November 28, 1858, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of William Stanley and Elizabeth A. Parsons Stanley. William Jr. attended Williston Seminary and later graduated from Yale University with the class of 1881.

==Career==
Stanley was as an electrician working with tele keys and fire alarms of an early manufacturer. In Philadelphia, Stanley designed one of the first electrical installations (at a Fifth Avenue store). Shortly thereafter, George Westinghouse hired Stanley as his chief engineer at his Pittsburgh factory.

In 1885, Stanley built the first practical alternating current transformer based on Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs&#x27; prototype of 1881. This device was the precursor to the modern transformer. In December, under a new contract with Westinghouse, Stanley moved his operations to Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

In 1886, on March 20, Stanley demonstrated the first complete system of high voltage alternating current transmission, consisting of generators, transformers and high-voltage transmission lines. His system allowed the distribution of electrical power over wide areas. He used the system to light offices and stores along the main street of Great Barrington - the location of his West Avenue family home. Stanley&#x27;s transformer design became a prototype for future transformers, and his AC distribution system formed the basis of modern electrical power distribution. His work in the electrification of Great Barrington&#x27;s Main Street was named an IEEE Milestone.

Agreeing that the AC system had arrived, Westinghouse further tested the system in summer 1886 in Pittsburgh; it transmitted over a distance of 3 miles, and used an alternator designed by Stanley to replace the Siemens model, which regulated voltage poorly. Satisfied with the pilot system, Westinghouse began commercial production and shipped his company&#x27;s first commercial alternator to Buffalo, New York, where a local utility placed it in service. Orders for 25 alternating-current plants followed within months.

In 1890, Stanley founded the Stanley Electric Manufacturing Company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In 1903 the General Electric Corporation purchased a controlling interest in the firm. The land on which the company once stood is now the site of the William Stanley Business Park of the Berkshires in Pittsfield.

==Personal life==
William married to Lila Courtney (Wetmore) Stanley in 1884. In 1935, their son, Harold Stanley, went on to found the modern day financial firm of Morgan Stanley with J. P. Morgan&#x27;s grandson, Henry Sturgis Morgan.

William Stanley Jr. died at his home in Great Barrington on May 14, 1916.

<text>Canada AM is a Canadian morning television news show that aired on CTV from 1972 to 2016. Its final hosts were Beverly Thomson and Marci Ien, with Jeff Hutcheson presenting the weather forecast and sports. The program aired on weekdays, and was produced from CTV&#x27;s facilities at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Toronto.

In addition to CTV&#x27;s local owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;Os) in Eastern Canada as well as affiliate station CITL-DT Lloydminster, the program also aired on independent station CJON-DT (NTV) in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as CTV News Channel, the network&#x27;s 24-hour national news service. The program previously aired on CTV&#x27;s O&amp;Os in Western Canada, until they launched their own all-local morning news programmes called &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot; on August 29, 2011.

==History==
CTV&#x27;s first attempt at a morning show, &quot;Bright and Early&quot;, launched in 1966 and was cancelled the next year; among the presenter lineup was future federal Liberal cabinet minister Jim Fleming, who read the news headlines.

Ray Peters, the head of Vancouver&#x27;s CTV affiliate CHAN-TV, had been an avid viewer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, and lobbied CTV to reinstate a morning program in order to compete with the American networks. Peters had intended the show to be produced out of Vancouver, but agreed to a Toronto-based production in order to bring CFTO-TV&#x27;s owner John W. H. Bassett on board. The 90-minute program launched under the title &quot;Canada AM&quot; on September 11, 1972, with Carole Taylor and Percy Saltzman as hosts, and Dennis McIntosh as newsreader. Taylor left the show in 1973 to host &quot;W5&quot;, and was succeeded by Elaine Callei; however, Callei left the program within a few months, and was in turn succeeded by Helen Hutchinson, who for a time hosted concurrently with her tenure as co-host of the evening newsmagazine series, &quot;W5&quot;. Long-time host Norm Perry joined in 1975 and would remain with the programme until 1990, making him the longest-running co-host in the show&#x27;s history.

===Prior to 2008===
For most of the 1990s and 2000s, &quot;Canada AM&quot; had a consistent running time of two and a half hours, airing between 6:30 and 9:00 a.m. local time, with most affiliates repeating the previous night&#x27;s late local news at 6:00 a.m. As the program is produced live for the Eastern Time Zone, the program would be &quot;delayed&quot; in Atlantic Canada to 7:30-10:00 AT / 8:00-10:30 NT.

The first half-hour would typically consist of a rundown of news headlines, sports, and weather, followed by a lengthy business news segment produced by Business News Network; for a few years the 6:30 half-hour was in fact a semi-autonomous program known as &quot;AM Business&quot;. From 7:00 on, the program used a format more in line with its U.S. counterparts. In its final seasons as CTV&#x27;s Vancouver affiliate, CHAN-TV (known on air as BCTV) would pre-empt the first 30 minutes in favour of its own morning newscast, and eventually delayed the remainder of &quot;Canada AM&quot; by an hour, i.e. 8 to 10 a.m. (it did not carry the additional hour discussed below).

The program also includes opt-outs for news updates from a local anchor at each station at the end of each half-hour. The network would always produce an alternate national segment for stations not using the opt-outs, as well as CTV News Channel.

In fall 2000, CTV decided to match NBC&#x27;s expansion of &quot;Today&quot; by adding another hour of &quot;Canada AM&quot; from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. local, which aired on O&amp;Os and some affiliates. This would include a &quot;coffee talk&quot; segment as well as other lifestyle features. As a result, CTV dropped the recently renamed &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. As &quot;Live&quot; continued to have strong ratings stateside, the Canadian network re-added the talk show in fall 2001, bumping the &quot;coffee talk&quot; hour to 10:00 a.m. in most areas, before abandoning the final hour entirely later in the season.

During the early to mid-1990s, &quot;Canada AM&quot; also aired a one-hour weekend edition, although this was essentially a &quot;best-of&quot; package of that week&#x27;s regular shows. Another weekend program, &quot;Good Morning Canada&quot;, was launched in the early 2000s but was also pre-taped using segments from local stations; it was cancelled in 2009.

&quot;Canada AM&quot; underwent a format change on January 28, 2008, which saw the show expand to six hours of live programming between 6 a.m. and noon ET every weekday. Local CTV stations across the country aired &quot;Canada AM&quot; live between 6 and 9 a.m. local time (7 and 10 a.m. Atlantic Time, 7:30 and 10:30 a.m. Newfoundland Time), while the complete six-hour, live edition aired on CTV Newsnet. Between 6:00 and 6:30 am ET was &quot;Early Edition&quot;, originally aired only in the Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland time zones, while it still aired on CTV Newsnet.

The format change was marked by the addition of a second on-air team from CTV British Columbia in Western Canada, consisting of host Mi-Jung Lee and weather presenter Rena Heer in Vancouver, and news anchor Omar Sachedina in Toronto. The shift from the Eastern to Western hosting teams took place at 7 a.m. PT (10 a.m. ET), meaning that only viewers in Alberta, British Columbia and part of Saskatchewan saw the western team on their local CTV station, although all other Canadians could watch the western team on CTV Newsnet or out-of-market CTV stations carried by cable providers.

On June 6, 2008, CKNW in Vancouver reported the cancellation of the Vancouver-based portions of &quot;Canada AM&quot;. Biographies of Mi-Jung Lee and Rena Heer were taken off the show&#x27;s website the same day. CTV announced that it would revert to the program&#x27;s original format (the additional 6:00-6:30 half-hour will continue as well), stating that the decision was in response to viewer feedback from western Canada indicating a preference for the prior format.

A few weeks prior, CTV cancelled the extra local news segments that appeared at :00 and :30 minutes past the hour, reverting to updates only at :25 and :55 minutes past the hour.

Following the cancellation of the western edition, CTV continued to produce the 9:00 ET hour of &quot;Canada AM&quot; until September 2008. During those three months, CTV Newsnet aired 4 hours of &quot;Canada AM&quot; from 6:00-10:00 ET (3:00-7:00 PT), and 2 hours of its own news content from 10:00 a.m. to noon ET to replace the cancelled western edition. CTV British Columbia also reverted to its original local updates (until they were cancelled in March 2009).

The 9:00 ET hour of &quot;Canada AM&quot; was handled differently on the main network depending on the time zone:
* Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland Time Zone viewers did not notice a schedule difference at all because the 9:00 ET edition was only available on cable.
* Pacific Time Zone viewers were able to see the second and third hour of the eastern edition, but the first hour was preempted with the live 9:00 ET edition at 6:00 PT. The first hour of the eastern edition could only be viewed on CTV Newsnet between 3:00-4:00 a.m. PT.

After the 9:00 ET hour of &quot;Canada AM&quot; was cancelled, CTV Newsnet (later rebranded as CTV News Channel) began airing an extra hour of its own news content, presented by Marci Ien. From that point onward, the program aired without deviations in every time zone, including &quot;Early Edition&quot; at 6:00 AM.

===2009 to 2016===

In March 2009, CTV stopped producing local opt-out news updates in most markets in order to reduce costs at its local stations. The two exceptions are CTV Toronto (where &quot;Canada AM&quot; is produced) and CTV Atlantic (which reuses the staff already on hand for sister channel CTV Two Atlantic&#x27;s morning show). Private affiliate NTV also continues to utilize the opt-out for local news updates.

As part of Bell Canada&#x27;s re-acquisition of CTV in 2011, CTV&#x27;s new owner Bell Media announced the launch of new all-local morning newscasts (titled &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;) to be produced at the network&#x27;s stations in Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver effective fall 2011. (In the latter three markets, local morning newscasts on Global stations usually had higher ratings than &quot;Canada AM&quot; at that point.) As a result, &quot;Canada AM&quot; no longer aired on CTV&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations in Western Canada, and is instead available only via CTV News Channel, or out-of-market CTV stations from Lloydminster or Eastern Canada.

The new programs complement existing local morning shows produced under the Bell Media corporate umbrella in Eastern Canada, namely &quot;CP24 Breakfast&quot; in Toronto, and &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot; in Ottawa and Atlantic Canada. However, the existing programs did not replace &quot;Canada AM&quot; on the CTV stations in their respective markets; instead, they air on co-owned local outlets (CP24, CTV Two Ottawa and CTV Two Atlantic respectively) in competition with the national show.

Seamus O&#x27;Regan left the show on November 24, 2011 to become a correspondent for CTV National News. Marci Ien took over as co-host upon returning from maternity leave on January 9, 2012. No replacement for Ien&#x27;s previous position as newsreader was named, and the duty of reading the news headlines at the top of each half-hour alternated between Thomson and Ien.

On June 2, 2016, after nearly 44 years on the air, CTV announced that &quot;Canada AM&quot; had been cancelled, and would air a series finale the next day. The following Monday, June 6, the program&#x27;s replacement, &quot;Your Morning&quot;, was announced. Since its premiere on August 22, 2016, it has been hosted by Anne-Marie Mediwake and Ben Mulroney.

Ien soon joined &quot;The Social&quot; as a substitute cohost after Traci Melchor took a leave of absence, and would become permanent cohost of the show in 2017, remaining in that position until 2020, while Beverly Thomson became a correspondent for CTV News Channel. Jeff Hutcheson had already announced plans to retire.

==Theme music==
For several years, in the 1970s and 1980s, the theme music was an instrumental version of The Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot;, which was recorded by Ronnie Aldrich and the London Festival Orchestra; by the mid-1980s &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; remained the theme music of &quot;Canada AM&quot;, but an orchestral version was used rather then Aldrich&#x27;s. During the same era, CTV&#x27;s newsmagazine series &quot;W5&quot; was using Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot;.

<doc id="296106" wikidata="Q502670" url="?curid=296106" title="Chennai International Airport">
<text>Chennai International Airport is an international airport serving the city of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India. It is located in Tirusulam in Chengalpattu district, in the Greater Chennai Metropolitan Area around southwest of the city centre. The first air service was operated in 1915 and the airport was commissioned in 1930. The airport serves as the southern regional headquarters of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for South India comprising the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and the union territories of Lakshadweep, and Puducherry.

The airport is the fifth-busiest airport in India by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, and fourth busiest by cargo handled in India and international traffic. In the financial year 2023–24, the airport handled over 21 million passengers and 0.34 million tonnes of cargo. The airport has two asphalt runways and offers direct flights to three continents. Terminals 1 and 4 handle domestic traffic and Terminal 2, which is being expanded to replace the older Terminal 3, handles international operation. A new satellite terminal is also under construction. A dedicated air cargo complex operates out of the old passenger terminal at Meenambakkam. The airport serves as a hub for Blue Dart Aviation, a focus city for Air India, and an operating base for IndiGo.

The airport is expected to reach saturation by 2035, with a peak capacity of 40 million passengers; a new greenfield airport has been proposed to supplement it. The airport is served by the Chennai International Airport Metro Station of the Chennai Metro and the Tirusulam railway station of the Chennai Suburban Railway.

== History ==
=== Beginning and establishment ===
The aviation history of the city began in 1910, when a city-based Corsican hotelier Giacomo D&#x27;Angelis built a biplane powered by a small engine in association with Simpson&#x27;s, a leading coach-builder in the city. He tested it at Island Grounds at Madras, making it the first powered flight in Asia. Further flying displays were performed by a set of aviators including Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck in February 1911. J. W. Madley, a water works engineer with the Madras government, flew an aircraft he had assembled over the Red Hills reservoir and shot aerial photographs in 1914.

In 1915, Tata Air Mail started an airmail service between Karachi and Madras, marking the beginning of civil aviation in South India. A discussion initiated by pilot G. Vlasto led to the founding of Madras Flying Club in March 1930. The first instructional flight took off from the airstrip in July 1930.

Commissioned in 1930, Madras aerodrome was one of the first airports of India. On 15 October 1932, J. R. D. Tata flew a Puss Moth aircraft carrying air mail from Karachi to Bombay&#x27;s Juhu Airstrip. Piloted by aviator Nevill Vintcent, it continued to Madras and became the first scheduled flight to land at the airport. The first mail service to Colombo was operated by Tata in 1936, with regular mail and passenger service commencing later in 1938. Although commercial services came into operation earlier, the airport was confined mostly to military operations during World War II, when it became the base of Royal Indian Air Force.

=== Expansion ===
In 1952, the Civil Aviation Department took over the operations of the airport. The first passenger terminal was built in 1954 on the northeastern side of Meenambakkam, and the airport operated as a customs airport with limited international services. In 1972, the airport came under the purview of Airports Authority of India (AAI). An air cargo complex was commissioned on 1 February 1978, which was the second gateway air cargo terminal in the country, after Kolkata airport. In August 1984, a bomb blast near the airport killed 33 people and injured 27 others. The entire concourse was razed down and had to be rebuilt. The passenger operations were shifted to the new domestic terminal built at Tirusulam in 1985. An international terminal was added in 1989 and the old terminal building was used for air cargo.

In November 1988, British Airways commenced services to Europe, flying to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport with Boeing 747s from April 1991. On 23 September 1999, a handling centre for flowers, fruits and vegetables was commissioned at the air cargo terminal. In 2001, the international airport became the first in the country to receive the ISO 9001-2000 certification. A new international departure terminal was commissioned in 2003. In May 2005, Delta Air Lines commenced the first direct flights to the Americas, connecting Chennai with New York City via Paris.

In 2008, the AAI started a major modernisation project. Two new terminals (Terminal 1 and 4) were constructed, the existing international terminal (Terminal 3) was renovated, the secondary runway was extended, and new taxiways, parking bays and a fire station were constructed.

=== 2015 floods and later modernisation ===
In December 2015, unprecedented rainfall associated with India&#x27;s North-east monsoon caused extensive flooding of the airport tarmac and runways. The airport was closed for a week to all traffic from 1 to 6 December. About 1,500 passengers and 2,000 airport workers were evacuated as water entered terminal buildings and 30–35 aircraft were stranded on the apron. Military authorities permitted the use of Naval Air Station INS Rajali in Arakkonam, west of central Chennai and Tambaram Air Force Station south as relief airports for a limited service of civilian commercial flights as well as official rescue/assistance flights. The Indian Air Force evacuated passengers from Chennai airport to the two military bases for onward journeys on Air Force transport aircraft to other domestic destinations. On 5 December, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation permitted a partial re-opening of the airport during daylight hours under visual meteorological conditions only, allowing airlines to ferry stranded aircraft without passengers or cargo on board. Operations under instrument meteorological conditions were not permitted and rescue and assistance flights, were permitted to operate in and out of the airport from 6 December.

In 2018, the construction of a new integrated terminal (Terminal 2) to expand the capacity began and the flight operations started from the new terminal on 7 July 2023.
==Accidents and incidents==
* On 7 January 1974, an Antonov AN-12 of the Indian Air Force crashed on take-off at the airport due to engine failure. There were no fatalities but the aircraft was damaged beyond recovery.

== Administration ==
Chennai Airport is owned and operated by the Airports Authority of India and serves as the regional headquarters of the AAI for the southern region of India comprising the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, and the union territories of Lakshadweep, and Puducherry. It functions from the Air Traffic Control Complex within the airport. The airport is the centre of the southern flight information region (FIR), one of the four FIRs that the Indian air space is divided into. It is alo responsible for the air traffic services over the Chennai FIR, which consist of five southern states, two southern union territories, and oceanic air space over parts of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

The immigration services at the airport are handled by the Bureau of Immigration of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The airport is the home to the southern regional office of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), which is responsible for the security of flights. The Airport Sector (CISF) provides security, including a dog squad for identification of narcotics and bomb disposal.

In 2013, the Government of India proposed to offer a contract to a private operator to operate the airport, which the AAI invited bids for. The plan did not materialise because airport employees, fearing job losses, protested against the move.

== Facilities ==
=== Runways ===
The airport has two runways – the long primary runway 07/25 (Northeast – Southwest orientation) and the long secondary runway 12/30 (Northwest – Southeast orientation). The runways are equipped with CAT-I Instrument Landing System (ILS) for IFR approach with Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) landing aids. An upgraded ILS was installed on runway 07/25 in 2017. As the airport is not equipped with a CAT-III landing system, which will enable operations in poor visibility conditions, disruptions in flight operations happen in poor weather conditions. In 2012, the AAI acquired additional land to install new landing lights and upgrade the ILS.

The secondary runway (12/30) was closed in 2009 to extend it over the Adyar River by means of a bridge over the watercourse at a cost of . The runway which was initially long was planned to be extended to . The expansion was completed in March 2011. The bridge over the Adyar river accommodated the runway and a taxiway, making Chennai airport the first international airport in India to have a runway across a river. The commissioning was delayed due to work on landing lights and VOR antenna. In February 2012, airport authorities announced that only about of the secondary runway would be operational due to displacements at both ends and the runway which was earlier used by only smaller aircraft, would be able to accommodate narrow body aircraft.

The layout consists of a long taxiway (B) and a shorter taxiway (R) parallel to primary runway 07/25 and parallel taxiway (N) oriented along the secondary runway 12/30. Two taxiways (P and Q) linked the two runways. Apart from the primary taxiways, other secondary taxiways interconnect the runways, main taxiways and parking aprons. In January 2018, the airport began cross-runway operations to reduce flight delays. In May 2023, a rapid exit taxi way was added from the threshold on the primary runway 07 and another taxi way linking the main apron. This reduced the runway occupancy time and helped with the plan to increase in flight handling capacity from 36 to 45 flights per hour. In January 2024, AAI announced plans to construct 11 new rapid taxi-ways to improve aircraft handling.

=== Passenger terminals ===
The airport occupies an area of with the passenger terminals located in Tirusulam in Kanchipuram district. , the airport consists of three operational passenger terminals with Terminals 1 and 4 catering to domestic traffic and Terminal 2 handling international traffic. The power supply to the airport is provided by Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation through a 11,000 kV sub-station.

Terminals 1 and 4 have three levels with the departure area on the top level with an elevated corridor, which has approach and exit ramps. The arrivals section is on the ground level, which also serves as the base for airlines and other offices. The basement is used for luggage handling. Terminal 1, which can handle 16 million passengers per year, covers , has seven gates, 52 check-in counters, and eight counters for e-ticketing. Terminal 4 which was originally built to handle international operations, covers an area of and is capable of handling 7 million passengers per year. Both the terminals are equipped with an in-line baggage handling system and security screening system with four departure conveyors of a length of and can handle 1,200 baggage pieces per hour. The terminals are designed with two sustainable gardens with wing-like roofs and glass facades. Rainwater is harvested and used to sustain the gardens. There is of space at the terminals, consisting of duty-free retail shops, restaurants, snack bars, and executive lounges. There have been more than 65 incidents of false ceiling collapses and breakage of glass windows reported from the terminals over the years.

As a part of expansion plan unveiled in 2018, a new integrated terminal and a satellite terminal were planned to increase the terminal area to with a capacity of 35 million passengers, up from then existing capacity of 18 million. The satellite terminal near the secondary runway is connected to the main buildings by a long tunnel built at a cost of . The new integrated Terminal 2 replaced the older Terminals 2 and 3 which were situated between Terminals 1 and 4. It commenced partial operations on 7 July 2023. The new terminal is designed with the inspiration from Tamil culture, with the building&#x27;s exterior inspired from Dravidian Architecture of Hindu temples and the roof inspired from pleats of sari worn by Bharatanatyam dancers. The flooring and the false ceiling feature Kolam patterns and colourful murals. The outside of the terminal features a 1,730-kilogram Nachiarkoil lamp.

With the new integrated terminal opening in May 2023, the old Terminal 3 was demolished to extend the new integrated terminal (Terminal 2). This second phase of construction involved the expansion of the existing terminal by . The complete new terminal building would be spread over and have a handling capacity of 10 million passengers. The terminal has 100 check-in counters, 11 automated tray retrieval systems, six self-bag drops and six baggage reclaim belts. It is equipped with a passenger flow monitoring system (PFMS) that helps in management of passenger operations.

=== Cargo complex ===

The air cargo complex at the airport was established in 1978, with regulatory and facilitating agencies brought under one roof for faster processing and clearance of international cargo. Following the construction of new passenger terminals at Tirusulam, the old passenger terminal at Meenambakkam serves as the air cargo complex. The air cargo complex covers an area of and is operated by AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company (AAICLAS), a subsidiary of AAI.

The cargo complex consists of two divisions, namely, the export and the import wings. The export facility covers an area of and the import facility is spread across . The cargo complex is equipped with Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) for efficient storage and easy retrieval of cargo and operates fully mechanised Elevated Transfer Vehicles (ETV) for faster and easier cargo loading and unloading. The complex also has temperature-controlled cold storage for perishable cargo, and secured storage rooms for high value cargo. As only a limited number of flights could be handled at the existing cargo complex, plans to build an integrated cargo handling terminal to increase the capacity to 0.3 million tonnes per annum was announced in early 2024.

=== Parking bays ===

The airport has 90 parking bays including 18 in-contact bays connected to the passenger terminals. The main apron (A) located to the south of the primary runway and the parallel taxiway B accommodates 33 parking bays including 11 parking bays that can accommodate wide body aircraft. Two aprons (Aprons II and III) are located between the two runways. Apron II can park 36 narrow-body aircraft and Apron III can accommodate 12 wide-body aircraft including one parking bay that can park an Airbus A380.

A remote apron (Apron I) located to the east of the secondary runway can accommodate a further eight narrow body jets. A smaller apron (T) located towards the east end of the secondary runway has three parking bays. An apron (B) located to the east of the air cargo complex caters to cargo operations has 10 parking bays with three of them accommodating wide body aircraft.

=== Air traffic control ===
The Air traffic control tower is located at the Air Traffic Services Complex and is equipped with advanced surface movement guidance and control system. An automated smart flight guidance system was installed in October 2011 at a cost of . The automated system combines information from tower control, approach control, area control and oceanic control. There are two radars, a secondary surveillance radar and a terminal radar. As the airport controls one of the four flight information regions in the country, other radar systems in the region are integrated with the ATC at Chennai. In 2021, AAI announced plans to construct a new ATC complex at the airport.

=== Other facilities ===
The old parking lot at the airport accommodated 1,200 cars. In June 2018, a six-level car park with a capacity to accommodate 2,237 cars was planned in front of the airport on a 4.25-acre plot. Construction began in March 2019, was completed in December 2021 and opened in 2022. In addition, a mall named Aerohub was built. The mall has a cinema multiplex and a 59-key transit hotel facility. TajSATS, a joint-venture of the Indian Hotels Company and SATS, provides in-flight catering at Chennai Airport. It also manages the airport lounges. The Taj Madras Flight Kitchen, a joint venture of the Indian Hotels, SATS and Malaysia Airlines which started in 1994, operates restaurants at the airport.

In 2008, a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) hangar was established at a cost of . The facility can handle one large or two smaller aircraft and functions as a repair shop and assembly area. It is equipped with an engineering and training facility and an engineering maintenance conference room. Fire and rescue services at the airport are provided by Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services in conjunction with AAI.

== Future plans ==

The existing airport is expected to reach saturation by 2035, with a peak capacity of 40 million passengers. Plans for a second, greenfield, airport for the city have been put forward since 2012; In August 2022, the state government selected Parandur in Kanchipuram district as location for the new airport on of land.

<text>The Westway is a elevated dual carriageway section of the A40 trunk road in West London running from Paddington in the east to North Kensington in the west. It connects the London Inner Ring Road to the West London suburbs.

The road was constructed between 1962 and 1970 to connect the proposed London Ringways motorway scheme to Paddington, and opened as the A40(M). It was the first urban motorway project in London and attracted criticism for the lack of care over the environment, the well-being of local residents and communities, and the handling of those whose homes would be demolished. Road protests increased following its opening. In 2000, the Westway was downgraded to an all-purpose road after the formation of Transport for London. The road has become a significant London landmark and has been noted in several works of popular culture.

==Route==

The road is long and is located in the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. At its eastern end, the Westway starts to the west of the Marylebone Flyover (A501), which takes traffic over the junction of Edgware Road (A5) and Marylebone Road (part of the London Inner Ring Road). Between the Westway and the flyover, a section of surface-level road allows westbound traffic from the flyover to turn-off on to the Harrow Road (A404) or eastbound traffic from the Harrow Road to access the flyover. Eastbound traffic from the Westway cannot exit here to reach the Edgware Road and continues on to the flyover.

Heading west, the Westway rises as it passes Paddington Green and crosses the Grand Union Canal branch to Paddington Basin. As the road passes Westbourne Green on the north and Royal Oak Underground Station on the south, it gains a lane from a climbing slip-road from Gloucester Terrace. Eastbound, one lane diverges from the mainline to a sliproad crossing the railway to Paddington station via Westbourne Bridge. The bridge once carried traffic from Harrow Road to Bishops Bridge Road but was blocked at the north end and appropriated for the Westway scheme.

Continuing westward, the Westway runs parallel with the Great Western Main Line, before turning south-west at Westbourne Park and crossing the railway to run immediately adjacent to London Underground&#x27;s Hammersmith &amp; City line as far as Ladbroke Grove station. The road then returns to an east–west alignment to the elevated roundabout junction with the West Cross Route (A3220) and flyover above this, crossing the Central line and Wood Lane (A219) before returning to ground level and continuing to the junction with Old Oak Common Lane where Westway connects end-on to the eastern end of Western Avenue. From the elevated road between Westbourne Park and Ladbroke Grove, Trellick Tower is visible to the north; east of the roundabout, the site of Grenfell Tower is visible to the south.

With the extension westward of the London Congestion Charge Zone between 19 February 2007 and 4 January 2011, the part of the road between Westbourne Park and the Westway roundabout that passed through the zone was designated as a &quot;free through route&quot; that allowed vehicles to cross the zone without paying the charge.

==Background==
The Westway was built as an extension of Western Avenue to form a link from Paddington to Ringway 1, the innermost circuit of the London Ringways network, part of a complex and comprehensive plan for a network of high speed roads circling and radiating out from central London designed to manage and control the flow of traffic. This plan had developed from early schemes prior to World War II through Patrick Abercrombie&#x27;s County of London Plan, published in 1943, and the following year&#x27;s Greater London Plan, to a 1960s Greater London Council (GLC) scheme that would have involved the construction of motorway-standard roads across the city, requiring substantial demolition.
The elevated roundabout junction with the West Cross Route was built with the capability to be extended once the planned northern continuation of the latter road was constructed to Harlesden. Two stubs on the roundabout&#x27;s north side were built for the connection of slip roads and the alignment of the slip roads between the West Cross Route and the roundabout avoided the planned line of the road to the north.
==Construction==

The Westway was funded by the GLC with a 25% grant from central government. The main contractor was John Laing &amp; Sons, while the flyovers at the eastern end were engineered by Sir Bruce White and Partners.

The road was planned to support three lanes in each direction, but was upgraded to include hard shoulders in 1966. The route was chosen to follow the easiest path from Western Avenue to Paddington which paralleled existing railway lines. To the east, the GLC had purchased slums between Harrow Road and the Grand Union Canal for redevelopment, and the Westway was planned to run along the southern edge of this. An elevated road was cheaper to construct and required less land to be directly built on, and had worked well for previous road construction projects, such as elevated section of the M4 from Chiswick to Langley and the Five Ways interchange at Hendon. However, passing an eight lane elevated motorway through a densely populated area involved the clearance of a large number of buildings adjacent to the railway, particularly in the area west of Westbourne Park, where several roads were truncated or demolished to make way for the concrete structures. London County Council architect Hubert Bennett speculated that some sections of the road viaduct would pass within of people&#x27;s homes.

Compulsory purchases of properties began in 1962, with an estimated 3,356 people needing to be rehoused. Many properties on the line of the route were put on short-term rental or left derelict. The local area was disrupted by the flow of heavy goods traffic moving materials to the construction site and taking spoil away. The road was mostly constructed from pre-stressed and post-tensioned concrete, which was cast offsite and moved into position as required. Tensioning cables were then passed through conduits cast into the sections and tightened to achieve the bearing capacity necessary to carry the weight of traffic. Joints between sections were minimised in order to provide a smoother journey. The road was designed with a main speed of aside from the sliproads, which were designed for . All elevated sections of the road were designed to support HA loading plus 45 units of HB loading in any direction.

Prince Charles visited the construction work in 1968, aged nineteen. The road was opened to traffic by the Minister of Transport John Peyton and junior transport minister Michael Heseltine on 28 July 1970 at a total cost of £30 million (£ million in ), and classified A40(M). At its opening the road was the largest continuous elevated structure in Europe and was constructed with some advanced features, such as heating grids on slopes to control the formation of ice. After completion a corridor of wasteland remained below the motorway, which the government had no plans to develop.

==Environment==

The Westway was planned and constructed in an era before environmental impacts were routinely considered, and it caused controversy at the time for the effects it and the vehicles it carried had upon the local community and the environment. At the opening ceremony, Heseltine was jeered by protesters armed with placards. A group of squatters moved into vacant houses on Freston Road near to those demolished for the Westway, forming a so-called &quot;independent state&quot; of Frestonia.

Residents on Acklam Road, which ran parallel to the Westway between Ladbroke Grove and Westbourne Park, draped a large banner across several houses reading &quot;Get us out of this hell! Rehouse us now!&quot; Locals complained about having to use Westbourne Terrace and Gloucester Terrace, both residential streets with several listed buildings, as access roads for the Westway. Shortly after opening, a group of residents planned to blockade the motorway and stop traffic in protest at the excessive noise of the road. Eight houses on Walmer Road, North Kensington, severed by the construction of the Westway, were planned to be demolished and their residents re-homed, but there were no plans for other nearby properties. Until 1973, there was no legal obligation to compensate anyone living outside the boundaries of the highway, no matter how close their property was or what nuisance the road may have caused.
On 9 August 1970, the Westway was closed for an hour after a group of 80 protesters marched along the road carrying placards. Four people were arrested. The following month, the GLC announced that a further 28 homes on Walmer Road would be compulsory purchased and the residents moved, in order to build a new school. In March 1971, it was announced that all 41 homes on Acklam Road would be demolished. By 1972, it had been estimated approximately 5,000 families had lost their homes for each mile of the Westway constructed. In 1974, the GLC announced of land in Notting Hill to the north of the Westway would be compulsory purchased and redeveloped with new apartments and screening walls to reduce noise from the motorway.

The project has since been condemned for the negative effect it had on local communities and housing, and contributed to the increased interest in anti-road protesting. The British Road Federation called the Westway &quot;one of the insensitive and socially unacceptable examples of motorways.&quot; The North Kensington Playspace Group was established in 1966 by Adam Ritchie, who strongly criticised the Westway, saying &quot;a more inappropriate and negative use for the space could not be imagined&quot;. The North Kensington Amenity Trust (now Westway Development Trust), was founded in 1971 to develop the land for local community use. Since 2000, local charity Urban Eye has initiated a programme of cleaning, painting, and lighting to improve the visual appearance and safety of the areas under the flyover structure.
==Aftermath==
Because of the construction costs and public opposition of the Westway, most of the London Ringways scheme was cancelled in 1973. The Westway, the West Cross Route and East Cross Route in east London were the only significant parts to be built. Other parts of the Ringway network were later built as all-purpose roads, including the M11 link road from Hackney to Redbridge, which drew major protests and opposition.

Westway lost its motorway status in May 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority. In 2013, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced parts of the Westway would be reconstructed to allow a separated cycleway to be built on it. The space required would be provided by reducing vehicle capacity. These plans were abandoned in 2016.

==Cultural references==
The Westway is referred to in J. G. Ballard&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Crash&quot;. The following year&#x27;s &quot;Concrete Island&quot; was set in a junction between motorways, one of which is the Westway. In the novel, the protagonist has an accident on the road while speeding and is consequently stranded in waste ground between motorways with nobody able to help. The 1997 murder mystery &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; by P. D. James was set in an area being demolished for the Westway, referring to houses &quot;rising in great choking clouds of ochre dust&quot;.

Chris Petit&#x27;s 1979 road movie &quot;Radio On&quot; includes several shots of the Westway. The land underneath the road was used as a setting for riots in the films &quot;Breaking Glass&quot; and &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot;. Episode &quot;Mangrove&quot; of the anthology series &quot;Small Axe&quot; features a time lapse visual effects montage of the Westway construction. &quot;Westway&quot; was a BBC World Service radio series that ran from 1997 until 2005. It featured the community surrounding the road.

The Westway has featured in songs by several British rock bands. The Clash referred to the road in &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, and the group&#x27;s Joe Strummer described their music as &quot;the sound of the Westway&quot;. The group&#x27;s documentary &quot;Westway to the World&quot; is named after the road. Swiss post-punk group Chin Chin used the same turn of phrase for the title of their 1985 LP &quot;The Sound of the Westway.&quot; The cover for The Jam&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;This Is the Modern World&quot; was taken under the Westway. Blur&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; mentions that the protagonist couple in the song are &quot;lost on the Westway&quot;, and the road is mentioned in two other songs by the band, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Under the Westway&quot;. Dirty Pretty Things refer to the Westway in the song &quot;Truth Begins&quot;; the opening lyrics are &quot;The Westway walls so tall and bleak / Reflect the words we dare not speak&quot;.

Local groups from the Ladbroke Grove scene, notably Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, played several free benefit and charity concerts underneath the motorway, pictures of which appeared on the inner sleeve of Hawkwind&#x27;s second album &quot;In Search of Space&quot;. One such concert by the Pink Fairies under the Westway - disrupted by the police because a neighbour complained that was unable to hear his television over the noise - is referenced in the track &quot;Right On Fight On&quot; on their second album &quot;What A Bunch Of Sweeties&quot;.

The opening track on Sky&#x27;s 1979 debut album is entitled &quot;Westway&quot;. The Westway is referenced in Pete Doherty&#x27;s &quot;Broken Love Song&quot;, in the line &quot;By the Westway, Inside The Scrubs&quot;, as he claimed to have once lived beside the Westway in a caravan. It is also featured on the front cover of &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; by Bloc Party. The picture, part of &quot;A Modern Project&quot; was taken by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg. The Westway is also seen in various shots in the 1990 movie Nuns on the Run.

<doc id="296111" wikidata="Q15840489" url="?curid=296111" title="Piedmont Airlines">
<text>Piedmont Airlines, Inc. ( ) is an American regional airline headquartered at the Salisbury Regional Airport in Wicomico County, Maryland, near the city of Salisbury. The airline is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Airlines Group and it is paid by fellow group member American Airlines to staff, operate and maintain aircraft used on American Eagle flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by American Airlines. Piedmont also provides ground handling and customer service for airports in the northeastern and western United States.

Piedmont operates a fleet consisting exclusively of Embraer ERJ 145 regional jet aircraft. Its main base is Philadelphia International Airport with an additional hub at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The company has a team of more than 9,800 employees, operating flights to nearly 50 destinations.

Started in 1961 as Henson Airlines, the airline was rebranded in 1993 to re-use the name of the 1948–1989 airline, Piedmont Airlines, one of the predecessors of today&#x27;s American Airlines, to protect the trademark.

==History==
The airline was formed in 1961 by Richard A. Henson as Henson Aviation, a fixed-base operator in Hagerstown, Maryland. It began its first scheduled flights to Washington National Airport in 1962 under the Hagerstown Commuter name, later changed to Henson Airlines. Allegheny Airlines (which became US Airways, which in turn has now merged with American Airlines) and Henson began one of the world&#x27;s first code sharing arrangements in 1967. Henson re-branded itself as an Allegheny Commuter carrier using Beechcraft 99 aircraft. It initially developed a route structure serving Washington D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore, while establishing a new headquarters for Allegheny Commuter at Salisbury, Maryland in 1968. In the 1970s, the airline upgraded to Short 330 and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 turboprops.

In 1983, Piedmont Aviation bought Henson Airlines and re-branded the airline as &quot;Henson, The Piedmont Regional Airline.&quot; Under Piedmont&#x27;s control, the airline expanded rapidly, particularly in Florida. Both were purchased by the USAir Group in 1987 with Piedmont absorbed two years later and Henson&#x27;s aircraft repainted in USAir Express livery. The 1980s saw rapid growth by the company with the upgrade of its fleet to the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft and fleet expansion. With the growth in capacity, the airline expanded to Florida, including numerous intrastate routes in Florida, and it opened a maintenance facility in Jacksonville.

The Piedmont name was resurrected in 1993, when USAir (the erstwhile Allegheny Airlines that became US Airways) renamed Henson to &quot;Piedmont Airlines&quot;, to protect the Piedmont brand name, which could be used by others if not exercised in trade use for a period of time. USAir continued this practice by changing the name of its two other wholly owned regional airline subsidiaries, Jetstream and Suburban Airlines, to PSA Airlines and Allegheny Airlines, respectively (Pacific Southwest Airlines was the name of a California-based airline merged into USAir). In 1997, USAir was renamed US Airways, and Piedmont and Allegheny were likewise re-branded as US Airways Express carriers. US Airways merged Allegheny Airlines into Piedmont in 2004.

==Operations==
The airline had more than 10,000 employees as of August 2022 and operated nearly 400 daily flights to more than 55 destinations.

As of January 2024, Piedmont is currently the exclusive operator at Pitt–Greenville Airport, Florence Regional Airport, Watertown International Airport, and Salisbury Regional Airport.

Piedmont Airlines currently flies under the American Eagle brand after a merger of American Airlines and US Airways in December 2013.

The airline operates maintenance bases in Albany, Charlotte, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Richmond, Roanoke and Salisbury. Piedmont has crew bases in Charlotte, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia. 

==Fleet==

As of July 2024, the Piedmont Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:

== Incidents and accidents==
*On September 23, 1985, Henson Airlines Flight 1517, a Beechcraft Model B99 turboprop, crashed near Grottoes, Virginia. The crash was fatal to all 12 passengers and both crewmembers. This was the first fatality of a female commercial U.S. pilot, First Officer Zilda A. Spadaro-Wolan. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that part of the probable cause of the crash was the airline&#x27;s failure to standardize the cockpit configurations of its aircraft and on its failure to provide adequate training to its pilots.
*On November 16, 2008, US Airways Express Flight 4551, a Piedmont Airlines-operated Dash 8 turboprop, took off from Lehigh Valley International Airport at 8:20am heading to Philadelphia International Airport, had to make an emergency landing. The flight crew was indicated that the front nose gear hadn&#x27;t come down and had to make a flyover the runway for confirmation. Of 35 passengers and 3 crew, there were no injuries. The aircraft (N326EN) incurred only minor damage and was returned to service.
*On January 1, 2011, US Airways Express Flight 4352, a Piedmont Airlines-operated Dash 8-100 turboprop forced an evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and fighter jets were scrambled from Andrews Air Force Base after Flight 4352 suffered radio problems on approach to Washington, DC&#x27;s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and strayed into restricted airspace. The Capitol was evacuated for approximately 20 minutes until the Dash 8 aircraft landed at Reagan National Airport.
*On January 7, 2011, US Airways Express Flight 4507, a Piedmont Airlines-operated Dash 8-100 turboprop from Philadelphia International Airport to Tweed New Haven Regional Airport in Connecticut was struck by lightning over the Long Island Sound. The captain reported electrical problems and diverted safely to Long Island MacArthur Airport due to more favorable weather conditions. The aircraft had 33 passengers aboard who were then bussed to New Haven.
*On May 18, 2013, US Airways Express Flight 4560 made a belly landing at Newark Liberty International Airport after landing gear would not extend. All passengers and crew members were evacuated safely.
*On December 31, 2022, a Piedmont Airlines ground worker was killed after being ingested into the engine of an Embraer 175 aircraft operated by Envoy Air at Montgomery Regional Airport in Montgomery, Alabama. The incident caused flights at Montgomery Airport to be temporarily grounded.

<text>Swans Crossing is an American teen drama television series created by Mardee Kravit and Ned Kandel. The series stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Brittany Daniel, Stacey Moseley, and Eddie Robinson. It aired in syndication from June 29 to September 25, 1992.

==Synopsis==
The series chronicles the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers living in the seaside town of Swans Crossing. Sydney Rutledge (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was the daughter of the town&#x27;s mayor, Margaret Rutledge. They lived right next door to the mayor&#x27;s political rival, Grant Booth, and his family. Sydney had a close but secret relationship with Grant&#x27;s son, Garrett (Shane McDermott), but the parents found out and built a literal wall between them and their houses. The couple broke up but still stayed in the same social groups, generating a bitter struggle between them as the season progressed.

Other major characters in &quot;Swans Crossing&quot; were J.T. Adams (Tom Carroll) and Neil Atwater (Eddie Robinson), best friends and scientific geniuses; Bobby &quot;Saja&quot; De Castro (Alex Tanaka); Saja&#x27;s sister Sophia Eva McCormick De Castro (Mira Sorvino), Sandy Swan (Kristen Mahon) and Owen Fowler (Evan Ferrante), the talented musicians; Jimmy Clayton (Devin Doherty) and Callie Walker (Stacey Moseley), the auto mechanics; Glory Booth (Carisa Dahlbo), Garrett&#x27;s younger sister and J.T.&#x27;s love interest; mean girl Nancy Robbins (Kristy Barbera), Sydney&#x27;s best friend; and Mila Rosnovsky (Brittany Daniel), competition for Sydney for Garrett&#x27;s affection, and the daughter of a countess who is an old friend of the Mayor&#x27;s.

Spies, first loves, phony birth certificates, and the preservation of endangered species, fueled the plots. One major storyline that never got resolved was Garrett blackmailing Sydney with the fact that he could prove she was swapped at birth with Sandy Swan (the birth certificate was phony). After making peace with Callie and Jimmy, they offered to help Sydney find the evidence to help her disprove it. The 65 episode run ended unsuspectingly with a (to be continued) sign, which it never was; leaving a lot of questions unanswered and a lot of viewers confused and disappointed.

==Cast==

==Production==
The series, which was created by Ned Kandel and Mardee Kravit, was taped at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, home of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The show was filmed on videotape and shot and edited in a way to resemble a daytime soap opera similar to that of shows such as &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

==Streaming==
In July 2015, executive producer Ned Kandel announced on the show&#x27;s Facebook fan listing, that the series would be available for streaming soon. On December 4, 2015, both ShoutFactoryTV and Hulu made available for streaming all 65 episodes of the series. As of September 2016, Hulu has removed the series from its streaming library though it is still available on ShoutFactoryTV. The show is also available on Tubi.

==Merchandising==
A &quot;Swans Crossing&quot; series of action figures and a Rock Concert Playset were produced by Playmates Toys.

<doc id="296116" wikidata="Q1930201" url="?curid=296116" title="Blooper">
<text>A blooper, or gag reel, is short clip from a film, television program or video production, usually a deleted scene, containing a mistake made by a member of the cast or crew. It also refers to an error made during a live radio or TV broadcast or news report, usually in terms of misspoken words or technical errors. 

The word blooper comes from the early days of radio, from around 1926. Used in baseball by 1940, it meant &quot;hit a ball in a high arc over the head of a fielder&quot;. It has been used as a noun from 1931.

The term blooper was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s in a series of record albums produced by Kermit Schafer entitled &quot;Pardon My Blooper&quot;, in which the definition of a blooper is thus given by the record series&#x27; narrator: &quot;Unintended indiscretions before microphone and camera.&quot;

Bloopers are often the subject of television programs and may be shown during the closing credits of comedic films or TV episodes. Prominent examples of films with bloopers include &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, and &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds are both famous for including such reels with the closing credits of their movies.

In recent years, many animated films have also incorporated bloopers, including a mix of faked bloopers, genuine voice-actor mistakes set to animation, and technical errors. Examples can be found in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001).
Humorous mistakes made by athletes are often referred to as bloopers as well, particularly in baseball. The more provocative term &quot;choke&quot; may be used to describe such plays instead, especially if a blooper affects the outcome of a sports competition in a major way, such as a late-game event in a close game. This is especially true if the game was an important one in the outcome of a season such as a playoff game or championship event.

== Origins ==
===United States===
The term &quot;blooper&quot; was popularized in the United States by television producer Kermit Schaefer in the 1950s; the terms &quot;boner&quot; (meaning a boneheaded mistake) and &quot;breakdown&quot; had been in common usage previously. Schaefer produced a long-running series of &quot;Pardon My Blooper!&quot; record albums in the 1950s and 1960s which featured a mixture of actual recordings of errors from television and radio broadcasts and re-creations. Schaefer also transcribed many reported bloopers into a series of books that he published up until his death in 1979.

Schaefer was by no means the first to undertake serious study and collection of broadcast errata; NBC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; series &quot;Behind the Mike&quot; (1940–42) occasionally featured reconstructions of announcers&#x27; gaffes and flubs as part of the &quot;Oddities in Radio&quot; segment, and movie studios such as Warner Brothers had been producing so-called &quot;gag reels&quot; of outtakes (usually for employee-only viewing) since the 1930s. As recently as 2003, the Warner Brothers Studio Tour included a screening of bloopers from classic films as part of the tour.

===United Kingdom===
Jonathan Hewat (1938–2014), who had a vast personal collection of taped broadcasting gaffes, was the first person in the UK to broadcast radio bloopers, on a bank holiday show on BBC Radio Bristol at the end of the 1980s.

He subsequently produced and presented a half-hour show on that station called &quot;So You Want to Run a Radio Station?&quot;. This was nominated for a Sony Award. The transmission of humorous mistakes, previously considered private material only for the ears of industry insiders, came to the attention of BBC Radio 2. They commissioned a series of six fifteen-minute programmes called &quot;Can I Take That Again?&quot;, produced by Jonathan James Moore (then Head of BBC Light Entertainment, Radio). The success of this series led to a further five series on Radio 2 (the programme ran from 1985 to 1990), as well as a small number of programmes (called &quot;Bloopers&quot;) on BBC Radio 4.

Some of the earliest clips in Hewat&#x27;s collection went back to Rudy Vallee &quot;corpsing&quot; (giggling uncontrollably) during a recording of &quot;There Is a Tavern in the Town&quot; and one of the very earliest OBs (Outside Broadcasts) of &quot;The Illumination of the Fleet&quot;.

The comment made by newsreaders after making a mistake &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;ll read that again&quot; was the origin of the title of the radio show which ran on the BBC during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Television shows==

Comedian Dick Emery showcased his own out-takes as an epilogue entitled &quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot; to his BBC shows in the mid-1970s. The later ITV show &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; (originally hosted by Denis Norden) showed out-takes from film and TV. The BBC&#x27;s answer to the show, &quot;Auntie&#x27;s Bloomers&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Auntie&#x27;s Sporting Bloomers&quot;, ran until 2001. It was replaced by &quot;Outtake TV&quot;, which began as a series of one-off specials in 2002, hosted by Paul O&#x27;Grady, before a series was commissioned for BBC One in 2004, hosted by Anne Robinson. Special &quot;Weakest Link&quot;-themed editions were common during Robinson&#x27;s tenure, which lasted until 2009. Rufus Hound took over in 2010. &quot;Outtake TV&quot; now appears as occasional one-off specials, much in the same way as &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot;.

ITV has produced two other shows, &quot;TV Nightmares&quot;, and &quot;TV&#x27;s Naughtiest Blunders&quot;. Both were presented by Steve Penk, before the latter show changed to show continuous clips with voice-over by Neil Morrissey. &quot;Nightmares&quot; presented TV personalities relating some of their most hair-raising moments, and &quot;Naughtiest Blunders&quot; presented more risqué mistakes. The latter has also been criticised for being used as a simple schedule filler, often with ridiculously titled editions (e.g. &quot;All New TV&#x27;s Naughtiest Blunders 18&quot;).

During the 1982–83 season, TV producer Dick Clark revived the bloopers concept in America for a series of specials on NBC called &quot;TV&#x27;s Censored Bloopers&quot;. This led to a weekly series which ran from 1984 through 1992 (co-hosted by Clark and Ed McMahon) and was followed by more specials that appeared on ABC irregularly until 2004, still hosted by Clark. These specials and a record album of radio bloopers produced by Clark in the mid-1980s were dedicated to the memory of Kermit Schaefer.

After Clark suffered a stroke, the blooper shows went on hiatus until 2007, when John O&#x27;Hurley hosted a special for ABC that was packaged by Dick Clark Productions.

The success of both Clark&#x27;s and Norden&#x27;s efforts led to imitators on virtually all American and Australian TV networks, as well as scores of home video releases; many American productions are aired to fill gaps in prime time schedules. The ABC Network aired &quot;Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders&quot; hosted by Steve Lawrence and Don Rickles in direct competition with the Clark TV series. With the coming of DVD in the 1990s, it became common for major film releases to include a &quot;blooper reel&quot; (also known as a &quot;gag reel&quot; or simply &quot;outtakes&quot;) as bonus material on the disc.

In 1985, Steve Rotfeld began compiling stock footage of various sports-related errors and mistakes and compiled them into a program known as &quot;Bob Uecker&#x27;s Wacky World of Sports&quot;. In the early 1990s, that series eventually evolved into &quot;The Lighter Side of Sports&quot; and continued in limited production through the early 2000s.

NFL Films, the official production arm of the National Football League, has produced a line of blooper reels known as the Football Follies for both television and direct-to-video consumption since 1968.

==Causes==

Bloopers are usually accidental and humorous. Where actors need to memorize large numbers of lines or perform a series of actions in quick succession, mistakes can be expected. Similarly, newsreaders have only a short time to deliver a large amount of information and are prone to mispronounce place names and people&#x27;s names, or switch a name or word without realizing it, as in a slip-of-the-tongue or Freudian slip.

Some common examples include:
*Uncontrollable laughter (called, in television and acting circles, &quot;corpsing&quot;)
*Unanticipated incidents (e.g. a prop falling or breaking, or a child/animal failing to behave as expected)
*Forgotten lines
*Deliberate sabotage of an actor&#x27;s performance by a fellow actor; a prank or practical joke (to evoke laughter from cast and crew).

The famous old chestnut of show business &quot;Never work with children or animals&quot; demonstrates two other causes of out-takes: Children, especially those who have no acting experience, often miss cues, deliver the wrong lines or make comments which are particularly embarrassing. (The &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; series, conceived by Art Linkletter, deliberately sought these kinds of remarks.) Similarly, animals are very likely to do things not in the script, generally involving bodily functions.

A third type of blooper is caused by failure of inanimate objects. This can be as simple as a sound effect being mistimed or a microphone not working properly, but frequently involves doorknobs (and doors) not working or breaking, props and sets being improperly prepared, as well as props working in ways they should not work.

In recent years, mobile phones have been a new source of bloopers with them frequently going off. Many of them belong to actors, presenters, and contestants who may have forgotten to turn them off or put them in silent mode. The effect is especially pronounced when the film setting is before the modern era (e.g., ancient Greece or Rome). However, this blooper is rarely seen in recent films (most productions enforce &quot;no cellphone&quot; rules while on-set to reduce the risk of plot or production details being leaked) but is commonly used in fake bloopers for animations.

The reaction to bloopers is often intensified in the stressful environment of a movie or television set, with some actors expressing extreme annoyance while others enjoy the stress relief brought on by the unexpected event.

==Examples==

One of the earliest known bloopers is attributed to 1930s radio broadcaster Harry Von Zell, who accidentally referred to then-US President Herbert Hoover as &quot;Hoobert Heever&quot; during an introduction. Reportedly it was upon hearing of this mistake that Kermit Schafer was inspired to begin collecting bloopers, although the exact circumstances of the event have been debated. A similar situation occurred decades later when then-new president Gerald Ford was introduced as &quot;Gerald Smith&quot;, the same name as an American Fascist leader from the 1930s.

On an episode of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; in the 1950s, a skit involving Red&#x27;s &quot;country bumpkin&quot; character &quot;Clem Kadiddlehopper&quot;, had him leading a cow onto the stage. Several seconds into the skit, the cow defecated on-stage during the live broadcast. Whereupon the audience laughed uncontrollably, and Skelton resorted to the use of the ad-lib, saying &quot;Boy, she&#x27;s a great cow! Not only does she give milk, {pause} she gives Pet-Ritz Pies!&quot; (Laughs for about ten seconds, then says some things to the cow by her ear). He followed up with, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you think of that earlier?&quot;, &quot;On top of that, you have a bad breath, you know that?&quot; and finally, &quot;Well sir, it&#x27;s like they say in psychiatry. Get it out of your system.&quot;. Then the network cut to a commercial.

A much-bootlegged recording of Bing Crosby has him singing to a recording of a band playing &quot;Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams&quot;, when he realizes that the master tape had not been fully rewound, and ad-libbed vocals to the truncated music. He begins, &quot;Castles may tumble, that&#x27;s fate after all/ Life&#x27;s really funny that way.&quot; Realizing the shortened music, he ad-libs, &quot;Sang the wrong melody, we&#x27;ll play it back/ See what it sounds like, hey hey/ They cut out eight bars, the dirty bastards/ And I didn&#x27;t know which eight bars he was gonna cut/ Why don&#x27;t somebody tell me these things around here/ Holy Christ, I&#x27;m going off my nut&quot;. This recording was first made available to the public by Kermit Schaefer in Volume 1 of his &quot;Pardon My Blooper&quot; album series for Jubilee Records in the late 1950s.

On the &quot;Wild Bill Hickok&quot; radio series in the early 1950s, a newsflash caused an unexpected blooper when it broke into the show. With sound effects providing the sound of horses&#x27; hoofs galloping and guns firing, Guy Madison spoke the line &quot;Cut him off at the pass, Jingles!&quot; Whereupon an announcer interrupted with, &quot;We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from the Mutual newsroom in New York! According to an announcement from Moscow radio, Lavrenti Beria, former head of the Soviet secret police, has just been executed! We now return you to &quot;Wild Bill Hickok.&quot;&quot; At this point, Andy Devine (as Jingles) was delivering the line &quot;Well, that oughta hold him for a little while, Bill!&quot;

In a similar vein, New York children&#x27;s radio show host &quot;Uncle Don&quot; Carney supposedly delivered the ad-libbed line &quot;Are we off? Good...well, that oughta hold the little bastards&quot; after signing off on his show one night, thinking his studio microphone was switched off. As a discredited urban legend has it, the remarks went to air, eventually leading to the show&#x27;s cancellation and &quot;Uncle Dons disgrace; apparently, Carney himself would tell the story of his blooper, especially once it became popular after the release of Schaefer&#x27;s records. However, according to the debunking website Snopes.com, not only did the alleged incident never happen, the much distributed recording of the incident was a fabrication. (The alleged incident was even parodied in the 1993 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;.)

An episode of the radio drama &quot;Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons&quot; was presumably introduced as &quot;Mr. Keen, Loser of Traced Persons.&quot; (Bob and Ray once did their own parody of this program under the title &quot;Mr. Trace, Keener Than Most Persons&quot;.)

A popular story among Texas broadcasting circles has it that a station manager&#x27;s late change in programming from Les Brown&#x27;s orchestra to a religious programme marking the somber Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur led to the staff announcer&#x27;s billboard urging his listeners to &quot;Stay tuned for the dance music of Yom Kippur&#x27;s Orchestra.&quot; (Many gentile DJs have urged their Jewish listeners to &quot;Have a happy Yom Kippur!&quot;)

A radio commercial for A&amp;P food stores ended with the announcer excitedly blurting out &quot;...and be sure to visit your nearby A &amp; Food P Store!&quot; In much the same vein was an ad for instant tea as came out in the end &quot;Instant White Rose, hot or cold – Orange Tekoe Pee&quot; and a bakery advertising itself as having &quot;the breast bed and rolls you ever tasted; I knew that would happen one night, friends,&quot; all the while breaking out in fits of uncontrollable laughter trying to get the line right.

During the Davy Crockett mania of the mid-1950s, a radio ad for children&#x27;s bedding cashing in on same had the line &quot;...with scenes of Davy Crockett in action on the mattress,&quot; a clear example of how unintentional &quot;double-entendre&quot; can translate into blooper material.

Afrikaans news anchor Riaan Cruywagen made several live-bloopers during his long career, most notably: where the normally very composed and highly professional Cruywagen burst into uncontrollable laughter while covering story about a record-breaking frog; as well as when co-anchor Marïetta Kruger asked what the word &quot;dysentery&quot; meant while covering a story related to the topic, to which he responded with &quot;spuitpoep&quot; (it translated as &quot;spray poo&quot;), which resulted in Kruger going into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.

A public service announcement urging young women to volunteer as nurses during a critical shortage thereof ended with the appeal &quot;Volunteer to be one of America&#x27;s white-clapped angels of mercy,&quot; confusing a slang term for infection with gonorrhea with &quot;white-clad.&quot;

The announcer of a radio ad for the 1948 Bob Hope film &quot;The Paleface&quot;, which costarred buxom actress Jane Russell, enthusiastically promised: &quot;Bob Hope, America&#x27;s favorite comedian, and Jane Russell...what a pair!&quot;

A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio announcer&#x27;s station-identification message once allegedly came out &quot;This is the Dominion Network of the Canadian Broadcorping Castration,&quot; in turn coining an oft-used sarcastic term for the public broadcaster. Like other blooper recordings distributed by Schaefer, a recreation was created as the original recording was not preserved, leading to debate over whether the event actually happened.

A radio adaptation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; over the BBC had one episode ending with the announcer explaining where &quot;I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ve run out of time, so here we leave Don Quixote, sitting on his ass until tomorrow at the same time.&quot; In US English, &quot;ass&quot; could refer either to the buttocks or to a jackass. However, this would not have been seen as a blooper in the UK in the period when it was transmitted, since the British slang word for buttocks is &quot;arse&quot;, pronounced quite differently. It is only since it has become permissible for &quot;ass&quot; in the sense of &quot;buttocks&quot; to be used in US films and on television, and syndicated to the UK, that most Brits have become aware of the &quot;buttocks&quot; usage. Indeed, since the King James Bible translation is now rarely used, and since the word &quot;jackass&quot; is very rare in the UK, much of British youth is now unaware that &quot;ass&quot; can mean &quot;donkey&quot;. As with the word &quot;gay&quot;, its usage has completely changed within a few years. The announcer was merely making a joke of the character being frozen in place for 24 hours waiting for us, rather like Elwood in the opening minutes of &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, or like toys put back in the cupboard in several children&#x27;s films.

===Contemporary examples===
The American sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; had a tradition of airing outtakes over the closing credits, though blooper reels were not shown during the closing credits of the show during the first, fifth (except for one episode), and sixth seasons. Many of these involved malapropisms on the part of the cast, often lampooned by Will Smith, who would chime in on the mistakes made by the rest of the cast. An example of this is when Uncle Phil (James Avery) comments, &quot;Well, the silverware&#x27;s obviously not in the house. It must been stolen&quot;, before realizing the line was &quot;It must &quot;have&quot; been stolen&quot; and correcting himself. Smith appears in the shot and, in an exaggerated accent, responds, &quot;It must been stolen. Feet, don&#x27;t fail me now!&quot;

Another sitcom, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, also showcased outtakes over its closing credits; however, some episodes featured a tag scene over the credits in lieu of a blooper reel.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; produced many famous out-takes, which were shown to the delight of fans at gatherings over the years and have been extensively bootlegged. One famous example shows actor Leonard Nimoy, who plays the supposedly emotionless Mr. Spock, breaking into laughter when, in the first-season episode &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, instead of saying the line &quot;The plants act as a &quot;repository&quot;&quot;, says &quot;The plants act as a &quot;suppository&quot;&quot;. In another out-take, series star William Shatner breaks character during a scene and starts complaining about the food served in the studio commissary. A third example begins with the third-season episode &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot;, in which guest actress Diana Muldaur recited the line, &quot;We&#x27;ve come to the end of an eventful... trip&quot;, to which Shatner replies, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been taking...&quot; – a reference to the then-topical issue of drug-induced hallucinations or &quot;trips&quot;. People bumping into supposedly automatic doors when the backstage personnel mistimed opening them was a common accident depicted. Similarly there were also mishaps while filming in exterior, with aircraft flying over supposedly alien planets.

&quot;Hee Haw&quot; often showed bloopers in the show itself, usually with the actor or actors requiring several tries to get a line right, ending in most cases with the correctly delivered line.

Many theatrical motion pictures feature bloopers during the end credits. For example, many Jackie Chan movies end with footage of failed stunts, blown dialogue, and other mishaps; Chan was inspired to do this by Burt Reynolds&#x27; films of the early 1980s (in particular &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; and &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;) that also featured end-credits bloopers. As an homage to its inspiration, the closing-credits blooper reel for &quot;&quot; actually featured one outtake from &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;.

Pixar also has a tradition of including blooper-like material during the end credits of such films as &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;; the latter was at one point reissued to theatres with a major selling feature being the addition of extra &quot;bloopers&quot;. Since Pixar&#x27;s films are painstakingly animated, making actual blunders of this sort is impossible, these scenes are in fact staged to provide additional audience enjoyment. The makers of another animated film, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, likewise also created a faux blooper reel showing the characters playing practical jokes and, in one case, bursting into laughter when one &quot;sneezes&quot; during a dramatic sequence. However, the movie &quot;Shrek&quot; has actual bloopers that were released on DVD. These bloopers are technical errors within the system, causing blurred characters or the characters bodies going through objects, such as a bush or the crown Lord Farquaad wears. Going back decades earlier, in 1939 Warner Bros. cartoon director Bob Clampett produced a short &quot;blooper&quot; film (for the studio&#x27;s annual in-house gag reel) of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Porky Pig smashing his thumb with a hammer and cursing.

The television show, &quot;Full House&quot;, had various bloopers in television specials but unreleased bloopers were leaked containing cast members using profanity to express their mistakes in a family-friendly program.

The fishing television series &quot;Bill Dance Outdoors&quot; has produced four videos (two VHS and two DVD) focusing entirely on bloopers occurring during production of the show and associated commercials, often showing various mishaps such as missed lines (which sometimes take several takes to finally deliver correctly), accidents during filming (including falling into the water, being impaled with a fish hook, or equipment malfunctions), as well as practical jokes played on the host by his guests and film crew (and vice versa). Some of the outtakes shown on these videos would sometimes be shown over the end credits.

The Discovery Channel series &quot;MythBusters&quot; will often keep some bloopers included in the actual episodes, usually various mishaps that occur on the show, such as minor injuries suffered by the cast, or various other accidents and malfunctions, which are usually quite spectacular and/or embarrassing when they do occur.

In Asia, variety shows, which is broadcast in a live-like format, would sometimes air bloopers titled &quot;NG&#x27;s&quot;, which stands for &quot;no good&quot;/&quot;not good&quot;. These &quot;NG&#x27;s&quot; would usually feature hosts forgetting their words by mistake and admit they make mistakes on occasion.

The Disney Channel Original Series &quot;Sonny with a Chance&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Sonny So Far&quot; included bloopers where actress Demi Lovato had uncontrollable laughter while suffering from hiccups during a supposedly &quot;serious&quot; scene, and several other scenes where the cast-members either humorously messed-up their lines, or props were forgotten.

A recent example of a well-publicized live blooper occurred during the March 2, 2014 telecast of the 86th Academy Awards. In introducing the singer Idina Menzel&#x27;s performance of one of the Best Song nominees, actor John Travolta accidentally announced her as &quot;Adele Dazeem&quot;.

==Acceptance of out-takes==
The proliferation of out-takes/gag reels/blooper reels, especially on recent DVD releases, has received mixed response by actors and directors. While many do not mind the extra publicity offered by such material being shown to the public and others simply enjoy seeing the mistakes, other actors complain that out-takes are demeaning to themselves and/or the craft and refuse to allow them to be made public.

Director Hal Ashby&#x27;s decision to include a blooper reel of star Peter Sellers in his 1979 film &quot;Being There&quot;, for example, is sometimes blamed for Sellers&#x27; failure to win that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Actor (for which he was nominated). Sellers had reportedly urged Ashby not to include the outtakes in the final edit of the film, to no avail.

Among his other issues with &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s producer Gene Roddenberry, Leonard Nimoy was not happy that Roddenberry showed the show&#x27;s blooper reels to fans at conventions in the early 1970s. He felt actors needed to be free to make mistakes without expecting that they would be shown to the public, and wrote a letter to Roddenberry asking him to stop. Roddenberry&#x27;s answer was to send Nimoy a blooper reel of his own should he have wished to show it at conventions.

Conversely, actors and crew on many productions treat the creation of gag reels as part of the filmmaking process, with innumerable examples of commercially released outtakes in which an actor can be heard remarking that a failed take was likely destined for a gag or blooper reel. Film producer Sam Raimi went so far as to commission veteran composer Vic Mizzy to create unique scores for the gag/blooper reel special features for the DVD releases of the films &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;.

Comedian Greg Giraldo flubbed a joke about sex with koalas during a performance of his Comedy Central special &quot;Midlife Vices&quot;. Giraldo then made several self-deprecating jokes, suggesting the flub would be included with the &quot;DVD extras&quot;, before repeating the joke correctly. The entire bit made the final cut.

==Alternative definitions==
The term &quot;blooper&quot; or &quot;flub,&quot; is often applied to describe continuity errors and other mistakes that have escaped the notice of film editors and directors and have made it into a final, televised or released product, where these errors are subsequently identified by viewers. For example, in a film taking place in the Old West, a viewer might spot a twentieth century vehicle driving in the distance of one shot, or in a film taking place in ancient Greece, an actor may have forgotten to remove his wristwatch and it was caught on film. Or it might be a piece of clothing, such as shoes, that change for one shot then change back with no explanation. Strictly speaking, however, these are film errors, and not &quot;bloopers&quot; since they did not occur in outtake footage or a live broadcast. The Internet Movie Database website uses the term goofs instead. In the mid-1990s, author Phil Farrand published a series of &quot;Nit-Picker&#x27;s Guides&quot; books in which he collected continuity errors and other on-screen &quot;bloopers&quot; from various &quot;Star Trek&quot; series that had been identified by either himself or fans; the listing of such information is commonplace on wiki-style websites devoted to TV and film production.

In baseball, the term is used to describe a Texas Leaguer, or a short fly ball that lands just past the infield, eluding both infielders and outfielders alike.

The Vietnam-era M79 grenade launcher also has the nickname &quot;Blooper&quot; due to its distinctive firing noise. Gustav Hasford refers to this in his novel, &quot;The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam&quot; (1990).

<text>Davao del Norte (; ), officially the Province of Davao del Norte (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao. Its capital and largest city is Tagum. The province also includes Samal Island to the south in Davao Gulf.

Before 1967, the five provinces—Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Davao Oriental—and Guipuzcoa were administered as a single province named Davao, a provincial district of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu. The present-day Davao Region is coterminous with this former province.

Davao del Norte is also known as &quot;The Banana Capital of the Philippines.&quot;

==History==
Davao del Norte and Davao de Oro (Compostela Valley) by R.A. 8470, January 30, 1998, together with Davao Oriental, and Davao Occidental from Davao del Sur by R.A. 10360, January 14, 2013, used to be a whole province simply known as Davao Region. This original province was split into three: Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, and Davao del Sur when &quot;Republic Act No. 4867&quot; (authored by Representative Lorenzo S. Sarmiento, Sr.) was signed into law on May 8, 1967, by President Ferdinand Marcos.

Davao del Norte originally comprised thirteen municipalities: Asuncion, Babak (now in Samal), Compostela, Kapalong, Mabini, Mawab, Monkayo, Nabunturan, Panabo, Pantukan, Samal, Santo Tomas and Tagum. On May 6, 1970, six more municipalities were created: Carmen, Kaputian (now in Samal), Maco, Montevista, New Bataan, and New Corella.

The passage of &quot;Republic Act No. 6430&quot; on June 17, 1972, changed the name of the province from &quot;Davao del Norte&quot; to &quot;Davao&quot;.

By 1996, Davao had a total of twenty-two municipalities with the creation of San Vicente (now Laak) in 1979, Maragusan in 1988, and Talaingod in 1991.

On January 31, 1998, President Fidel V. Ramos signed &quot;Republic Act No. 8470&quot;, which split the province into two, creating the province of Davao de Oro (Compostela Valley). In the meantime, Davao was renamed back to Davao del Norte. Together with the creation of the new province, two cities and one municipality were created: the municipality of Tagum, capital of Davao del Norte, was converted into a city (&quot;R.A. 8472&quot;); Samal, Babak, and Kaputian were joined into the city of Samal (&quot;R.A. 8471&quot;); and the municipality of Braulio E. Dujali was created out of several barangays in Panabo and Carmen (&quot;R.A. 8473&quot;). The province then had 8 municipalities and 2 cities.

&quot;Republic Act No. 9015&quot;, signed into law on March 5, 2001, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, converted the municipality of Panabo into a city. &quot;Republic Act No. 9265&quot;, approved on March 15, 2004, created the municipality of San Isidro from Asuncion and Kapalong.

<text>The Copernican Period in the lunar geologic timescale runs from approximately 1.1 billion years ago to the present day. The base of the Copernican period is defined by impact craters that possess bright optically immature ray systems. The crater Copernicus is a prominent example of rayed crater, but it does not mark the base of the Copernican period. 

Copernican age deposits are mostly represented by crater ejecta, but a small area of mare basalt has covered part of (and is thus younger than) some of the rays of the Copernican crater Lichtenberg, and therefore the basalt is mapped as Copernican age.

==Definition==
The base of the Copernican period is defined based on the recognition that freshly excavated materials on the lunar surface are generally &quot;bright&quot; and that they become darker over time as a result of space weathering processes. Operationally, this period was originally defined as the time at which impact craters &quot;lost&quot; their bright ray systems. This definition, however, has recently been subjected to some criticism as some crater rays are bright for compositional reasons that are unrelated to the amount of space weathering they have incurred. In particular, if the ejecta from a crater formed in the highlands (which is composed of bright anorthositic materials) is deposited on the low albedo mare, it will remain bright even after being space weathered. 

==Examples==
Other than Copernicus itself, there are many examples of Copernican craters. Large examples on the near side include Tycho, Aristillus, Autolycus, Stevinus, Kepler, Theophilus, Taruntius, Eudoxus, Bürg, Römer, Harpalus, Carpenter, Philolaus, Anaxagoras, Glushko, Hayn, Zucchius, and Rutherfurd. Examples on the far side include Ohm, Jackson, King, Necho, Giordano Bruno, O&#x27;Day, Crookes, Robertson, Vavilov, and Sharonov.

Many craters visited by the Apollo astronauts were of Copernican age. These include North Ray and South Ray, visited by Apollo 16, which were dated by cosmic ray exposure to approximately 50 million and 2 million years age, respectively.

==Relationship to Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale==
Its Earth equivalents are the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic eon and the whole of the Phanerozoic eon. So, while animal life bloomed on Earth, the Moon&#x27;s geologic activity was coming to an end.

<text>The Eratosthenian period in the lunar geologic timescale runs from 3,200 million years ago to 1,100 million years ago. It is named after the crater Eratosthenes, which displays characteristics typical of craters of this age, including a surface that is not significantly eroded by subsequent impacts, but which also does not possess a ray system. The massive basaltic volcanism of the Imbrian period tapered off and ceased during this long span of lunar time. The youngest lunar lava flows identified from orbital images are tentatively placed near the end of this period.

Its equivalent on Earth consists of most of the Mesoarchean and Neoarchean eras (Archean eon), Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic eras (Proterozoic eon).

==Examples==
Other than Eratosthenes itself, examples of large Eratosthenian craters on the near side of the Moon include Langrenus, Macrobius, Aristoteles, Hausen, Moretus, Pythagoras, Scoresby, Bullialdus, Plutarch, and Cavalerius. On the far side, examples include Olcott, Hamilton, Birkeland, Finsen, Kirkwood, and Ricco.

<text>Loblaws Inc. is a Canadian supermarket chain with stores located in the province of Ontario, and in Alberta and British Columbia under the Loblaws CityMarket banner. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, Loblaws is a subsidiary of Loblaw Companies Limited, Canada&#x27;s largest food distributor.

==History==

Loblaw Groceterias was founded by Theodore Loblaw and John Milton Cork in 1919. Loblaw opened the first Canadian self-service supermarket in Toronto in June 1919. During the 1920s the company grew throughout Ontario. By the 1930s it had 107 stores in Ontario and 50 in the state of New York. 

In 1947, Garfield Weston struck a deal to acquire a block of 100,000 shares of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited, which had become one of the country&#x27;s leading supermarket chains. By 1953, George Weston Limited had established majority control. 

Loblaws stores operated across Canada until the early 1960s when most locations in western Canada were rebranded as SuperValu, and later as Real Canadian Superstore. 

Retail sales and earnings were in decline in the 1970s as Loblaws&#x27; aging chain of supermarkets looked increasingly uncompetitive. The company initiated a broad marketing strategy that saw a prototype store renovated and remodelled in new colours and a new Loblaws logo. In the mid-1970s stores in the United States were sold to Bells Markets; however, some Loblaws stores in northwestern Pennsylvania continued operation into the early 1990s. 

In 1996, in addition to revitalizing the look of its stores, Loblaw management earmarked $40 million for the development of its in-house, private-label program.

=== Super Centre ===
Super Centre was a hyper supermarket banner used by Loblaws during the 1990s in Ontario. Some stores were an expansion from the Super-Valu banner. These stores were about in size on average, larger than standard supermarkets, sold a wider selection of merchandise (including department store merchandise, such as clothing), and contained in-store pharmacies. The initial concept was successful, but many of their locations failed as competition grew. 

The concept was abandoned by the late 1990s with locations being downsized, re-branded as Loblaws stores and sold altogether. The brand survived in Atlantic Canada as Atlantic Superstore, now Real Atlantic Superstore.

===21st century===

Beginning in 2008, some new and renovated Loblaws stores were given a new store format and were named &quot;Loblaw Great Food&quot;, dropping the red-orange curved-L logo. Stores under this banner are also subject to slightly different collective-agreement terms with the United Food and Commercial Workers, the union representing Loblaw employees. 

The chain&#x27;s location on the site of the former Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, opened in late 2011, is promoted as simply Loblaws and uses the familiar &quot;L&quot; logo, but is officially named &quot;&quot;Loblaws&quot; Great Food&quot;, indicating that similar terms are in place at that store. 

On July 19, 2013, Loblaws introduced their new concept &quot;Loblaws CityMarket&quot; in British Columbia (in North Vancouver, Richmond and Vancouver). Loblaws CityMarkets are now operational in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. 

On July 23, 2015, Loblaws announced the planned closure of 52 non-profitable stores over the following year.

In December 2017, Loblaws and George Weston Limited disclosed to the Competition Bureau that it had arranged to fix the price of bread from 2000 to 2014. In response, the chain offered a $25 gift card to Canadian customers as a gesture of goodwill, but was met with public backlash over its restrictions and lack of remorse. The two companies agreed to pay $500 million to settle the lawsuit in July 2024, with the class action lawsuit against several other retailers continuing.

==Programs==
Loblaws offers a grocery pickup service called PC Express where customers can order groceries online and select a time slot to pick up their orders. The rewards program used at Loblaws is PC Optimum which allows customers to accumulate points from purchases of certain items to be used in increments of ten dollars on purchases.

It is a participant in the voluntary Scanner Price Accuracy Code managed by the Retail Council of Canada.

<doc id="296129" wikidata="Q1030016" url="?curid=296129" title="Nectarian">
<text>The Nectarian Period of the lunar geologic timescale was from 3.920 billion years ago to 3.850 billion years ago. It is the period during which the Nectaris Basin and other major basins were formed by large impact events. Ejecta from Nectaris form the upper part of the densely cratered terrain found in lunar highlands. The period ended with the formation of the Imbrium basin, which initiated the Imbrian Period. Magnetic anomalies found in some Nectarian Period basins suggest that the Moon possessed a core dynamo magnetic field at that time.

==Relationship to Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale==
Since little or no geological evidence on Earth exists from the time spanned by the Nectarian Period of the Moon, the Nectarian has been used by at least one notable scientific work as an unofficial subdivision of the terrestrial Hadean eon.

<doc id="296131" wikidata="Q384169" url="?curid=296131" title="Combination tone">
<text>A combination tone (also called resultant or subjective tone) is a psychoacoustic phenomenon of an additional tone or tones that are artificially perceived when two real tones are sounded at the same time. Their discovery is credited to the violinist Giuseppe Tartini, so they are also called Tartini tones.

There are two types of combination tones: sum tones whose frequencies are found by adding the frequencies of the real tones, and difference tones whose frequencies are the difference between the frequencies of the real tones. &quot;Combination tones are heard when two pure tones (i.e., tones produced by simple harmonic sound waves having no overtones), differing in frequency by about 50 cycles per second [Hertz] or more, sound together at sufficient intensity.&quot;

Combination tones can also be produced electronically by combining two signals in a circuit that has nonlinear distortion, such as an amplifier subject to clipping or a ring modulator.

==Explanation==
One way a difference tone can be heard is when two tones with fairly complete sets of harmonics make a just fifth. This can be explained as an example of the missing fundamental phenomenon. If formula_1 is the missing fundamental frequency, then formula_2 would be the frequency of the lower tone, and its harmonics would be formula_3 etc. Since a fifth corresponds to a frequency ratio of 2:3, the higher tone and its harmonics would then be formula_4 etc. When both tones are sounded, there are components with frequencies of formula_5 etc. The missing fundamental is heard because so many of these components refer to it.

The specific phenomenon that Tartini discovered was physical. Sum and difference tones are thought to be caused sometimes by the non-linearity of the inner ear. This causes intermodulation distortion of the various frequencies which enter the ear. They are combined linearly, generating relatively faint components with frequencies equal to the sums and differences of whole multiples of the original frequencies. Any components which are heard are usually lower, with the most commonly heard frequency being just the difference tone, formula_6, though this may be a consequence of the other phenomena. Although much less common, the following frequencies may also be heard:
:formula_7

For a time it was thought that the inner ear was solely responsible whenever a sum or difference tone was heard. However, experiments show evidence that even when using headphones providing a single pure tone to each ear separately, listeners may still hear a difference tone. Since the peculiar non-linear physics of the ear doesn&#x27;t come into play in this case, it is thought that this must be a separate, neural phenomenon. Compare binaural beats.

Heinz Bohlen proposed what is now known as the Bohlen–Pierce scale on the basis of combination tones, as well as the 833 cents scale.

==Resultant tone==
A resultant tone is &quot;produced when any two loud and sustained musical sounds are heard at the same time.&quot;

In pipe organs, this is done by having two pipes, one pipe of the note being played, and another harmonically related, typically at its fifth, being sounded at the same time. The result is a pitch at a common subharmonic of the pitches played (one octave below the first pitch when the second is the fifth, 3:2, two octaves below when the second is the major third, 5:4). This effect is useful especially in the lowest ranks of the pipe organ where cost or space could prohibit having a rank of such low pitch. For example, a 32&#x27; pipe would be costly and take up as much as 16&#x27; of vertical space (if capped) or more commonly 17-32&#x27; (if open-ended) for each pipe. Using a resultant tone for such low pitches reduces the cost and space factor, but does not sound as full as a true 32&#x27; pipe. The effect can be enhanced by using further ranks in the harmonic series of the desired resultant tone.

This effect is most often used in the lowest octave of the organ only. It can vary from highly effective to disappointing depending on several factors, primarily the skill of the organ voicer, and the acoustics of the room the instrument is installed in.

It is possible to produce a melody with resultant tones from multiple harmonics played by two or more instruments. There is an example with seven saxophones.

<text>Loeb was a Canadian supermarket chain. Founded in Ottawa, Ontario, Loeb expanded across Canada, and into parts of the United States. The company was acquired by the Quebec-based supermarket chain Metro in 1999, and its stores were converted to the Metro brand in 2008.

==History==
Loeb began in 1912 when Moses Loeb opened a small wholesale confectionery house in Ottawa. By 1950, Loeb grew into two large warehouses, and the following two decades were those of lucrative business ventures. Through partnerships with other companies into the 1980s, Loeb continued to serve the needs of people throughout Canada and the United States.

In 1990, Loeb launched its own brand of private label products, called &#x27;Loeb Made Today&#x27;, followed by &#x27;Loeb Ready&#x27; products.

In the early 1990s, Loeb had mascot characters named &quot;Koo-Kie&quot; and &quot;Handy and Dandy&quot;.

===Acquisition by Metro===
In June 1999, Loeb became part of the Metro Foods corporate group. At the time, it was owned by Provigo, which was sold the previous year to Loblaw Companies, which was required to resell Loeb for competitive reasons. Following the purchase, Metro began putting products from its own house brands, Merit/Selection and Irresistibles, on the shelves of Loeb stores.

In 2006, following Metro&#x27;s acquisition of The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Company of Canada, Loeb became a subsidiary of A&amp;P Canada. New products and services were introduced to Loeb stores, and the Merit, Econochoix, and Irresistible lines were dropped in favour of A&amp;P Canada&#x27;s own Master Choice, Equality and Baker&#x27;s Oven products, along with Fresh Obsessions produce.

On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company&#x27;s conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all Loeb stores were converted to the Metro name. The rebranding also saw the Irresistibles and Selection brands return to the stores, replacing those inherited from A&amp;P.

<doc id="296133" wikidata="Q630370" url="?curid=296133" title="Pre-Nectarian">
<text>The pre-Nectarian period of the lunar geologic timescale runs from 4.533 billion years ago (the time of the initial formation of the Moon) to 3.920 billion years ago, when the Nectaris Basin was formed by a large impact. It is followed by the Nectarian period.

==Description==
Pre-Nectarian rocks are rare in the lunar sample suite; they are mostly composed of lunar highlands material which have been heavily churned, brecciated, and thermally affected by subsequent impacts, particularly during the Heavy Bombardment Eon (HBE; a period of 0.6-1 Gy from the formation of the Moon until at least the formation of the Imbrium Basin ~3.9 Ga, or even later with the formation of Orientale Basin) that marks the approximate beginning of the Nectarian period. The primary pre-Nectarian lunar highland material is dominated by the rock type anorthosite, which suggests that the early stage of lunar crustal formation occurred via mineral crystallization of a global magma ocean.

This geologic period has been informally subdivided into the &quot;Cryptic Era&quot; (4.533 - 4.172 Ga ago) and Basin Groups 1-9 (4.172 - 3.92 Ga ago), but these divisions are not used on any geologic maps. Similarly the later period has also been called the &quot;Aitkenian&quot; period.

== Impact basins ==
==Relationship to Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale==
Since little or no geological evidence on Earth exists from the time spanned by the pre-Nectarian period of the Moon, the pre-Nectarian has been used as a guide by at least one notable scientific work to subdivide the unofficial terrestrial Hadean eon. In particular, it is sometimes found that the Hadean eon is subdivided into the Cryptic era, Basin Groups 1-9, Nectarian and Lower Imbrian, though the first two of these lunar divisions are informal and collectively make up the pre-Nectarian.
