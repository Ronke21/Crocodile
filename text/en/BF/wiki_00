<text>Thomas Carmichael Hindman Jr. (January 28, 1828September 28, 1868) was an American lawyer, politician, and a senior officer of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, he later moved to Mississippi and became involved in politics. He served in the Mexican–American War from 1846 to 1848. Hindman practiced law and in 1853 was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. After his term expired in 1854, he moved to Helena, Arkansas where there were more opportunities for his political ambitions. Hindman opposed the Know-Nothing party and Arkansas&#x27;s ruling Conway-Johnson dynasty. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858, and supported slavery (and was a slaveholder himself) and secession. He was assassinated during the Reconstruction era.

Once the American Civil War began in 1861 and Arkansas seceded, Hindman joined the Confederate States Army, first commanding the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, then a brigade, and then an ad-hoc division at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862; he was wounded during the battle. Following Shiloh, Hindman was promoted to major general and sent to the Trans-Mississippi Department to command Arkansas, Missouri, the Indian Territory, and part of Louisiana. As commander of the region, his policies were sometimes legally questionable and were unpopular, although they were successful in building up the district from a basically indefensible state. Public outcry led to Hindman&#x27;s removal from his regional command. He was defeated at the Battle of Prairie Grove in December. Transferred to the Army of Tennessee in 1863, he led a division at the Battle of Chickamauga in September, where he was again wounded. After recovering, he commanded a division during the early stages of the Atlanta campaign although he wished to be transferred elsewhere.

During the retreat after the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the summer of 1864, Hindman suffered an eye injury. He was placed on leave and traveled to Texas with his family. When the Confederacy collapsed in 1865, he fled to Mexico, but returned to Helena in 1867. Resuming his involvement in politics, he opposed the Reconstruction Era government of Arkansas. Hindman was shot by an unknown assassin at his home late on September 27, 1868, and died the next morning. Before his death, Hindman suggested the shooting was politically motivated.

==Early life==
Thomas Carmichael Hindman Jr. was born to Thomas C. Hindman Sr. and Sallie Holt Hindman on January 28, 1828. His parents were of English and Scottish descent, and his father had served in the 39th United States Infantry during the War of 1812. Family lore claimed that Thomas Sr. was the first white male born in Knoxville, Tennessee. Thomas Sr. and Sallie moved to Rhea County and then Post Oak Springs before returning to Knoxville, where Thomas Jr. was born, the fifth of six children.

The elder Hindman often traveled to Alabama for business, and moved his family to Jacksonville, Alabama, in 1841. Much of his business there involved the Cherokee people, whose trust he gained, eventually leading to his appointment as an Indian agent. His work involved a great deal of travel, including along the Trail of Tears as a quartermaster during the Cherokee removal. With his father often away and little education available in the Jacksonville area, Thomas Jr. was sent to New York to live with relatives. He eventually enrolled at the Lawrenceville Classical Institute in New Jersey. Coursework at Lawrenceville was focused on the grammars of English and classical Greek and Latin, as well as mathematics and history. There was also an emphasis on debate, oratory, and religious instruction. Hindman was probably hazed while attending the school.

Thomas Jr. graduated in 1843, as his class&#x27;s salutatorian, receiving highest academic honors. After spending some time in New York, Hindman moved to Ripley, Mississippi, where his family had relocated while he was at school. His father had become prominent in local politics. In Mississippi, the younger Hindman farmed cotton and studied law with respected local attorney Orlando Davis. In 1846, the Mexican–American War began, and Hindman became caught up in the war sentiment, hoping to gain glory and believing that Mexico had wronged the United States.

==Mexican–American War==
After President James Knox Polk called upon the states to furnish 50,000 volunteers for the war in 1846, Governor of Mississippi Albert G. Brown authorized the creation of a number of companies, expecting that the state would be asked to furnish multiple units. Instead, Mississippi was authorized to produce only one unit, the Mississippi Rifles, leading to many would-be volunteers, including Hindman, not having an opportunity for service. Later, in November, after other states did not meet their quotas for units, Mississippi was permitted a second infantry unit, which both Hindman and his older brother Robert joined. Thomas served as a second lieutenant in the unit, but Robert was eventually discharged for medical reasons.

Hindman&#x27;s unit, the 2nd Mississippi, trained at Camp McClung near Vicksburg, Mississippi in January 1847, before being transferred to New Orleans, Louisiana. The unit moved to the mouth of the Rio Grande River in late February, then to other locations, including Saltillo and Buena Vista (after the Battle of Buena Vista). Aside from a few small raids, the unit did not see action and was wracked by disease. According to historian William L. Shea, Hindman served capably in his role as a junior officer in the regiment. His service included a time as a post adjutant at Mazafil from April 26 through May 1848.

==Return to Mississippi==

Hindman&#x27;s regiment returned to Mississippi later in 1848. In May 1849, Robert Hindman was killed by William Clark Falkner in a quarrel. Falkner had felt that Robert had attempted to block him from joining the Sons of Temperance brotherhood. In the quarrel, Robert pulled a gun which misfired, and Falkner stabbed him to death. He was acquitted, and then later killed a family friend of the Hindmans, again receiving an acquittal. The killings led to a gunfight between Thomas Jr. and Falkner that resulted in no injuries, and a duel was barely avoided.

Hindman joined the Sons of Temperance himself, becoming active in the early 1850s and serving as a &quot;recording scribe&quot; for the organization. After completing his studies with Orlando Davis, he was admitted to the bar in 1851, but found his calling in politics. A major political debate in Mississippi during the 1851 elections concerned whether slavery should be allowed in the territories won during the Mexican–American War. Hindman served as delegate to a county Democratic Party convention and the state convention of the faction of the party that supported the expansion of slavery. Hindman initially supported John A. Quitman in the 1851 gubernatorial election, but switched allegiance to Jefferson Davis after Quitman withdrew.

Davis and the pro-states&#x27; rights Democrats narrowly lost the 1851 election, but regained the governorship in 1853. That same year, Hindman was elected to a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives from Tippah County. He was appointed to the judiciary committee and supported tax and education reform, reforms to the Mississippi Chancery Courts system, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. He tried, with little success, to ensure that new railroads within the state complied with the requirements of their charters.

==Move to Arkansas==
In March 1854, the term of the legislature ended, and Hindman decided that the political field of Mississippi was too crowded. Across the Mississippi River lay Arkansas, which was much less developed and provided more opportunities for his political ambitions. Moving in June and settling in Helena, Hindman soon entered Arkansas politics. He formed a law partnership with John Palmer and gained attention in a political debate with the cotton planter James L. Alcorn at a Fourth of July barbeque. Hindman had a reputation as a dandy, and on the day after his debate with Alcorn, a local Whig insulted Hindman by referring to him as &quot;my sweet scented individual&quot;. The two agreed to duel with bowie knives, but the situation was defused by Patrick Cleburne and Gideon Pillow. During the 1854 political cycle, Hindman served as an orator focussing on railroad topics that would benefit Helena, although he did not run as a candidate.

During the summer of 1854, Hindman had been in contact with Quitman about a filibustering expedition to attempt to annex Cuba to the United States as a slave state. Hindman was unable to join the expedition. While lobbying for railroads in Little Rock in January 1855, he had been involved in an altercation with two men after he offended their friend, the newspaper editor Charles C. Danley. One, a Dr. Moon, pulled a pistol on Hindman, who was unarmed but expressed a willingness to fight at a later time when he had a weapon. The next day, inside the Arkansas House of Representatives building, Moon&#x27;s associate Wilson pulled a pistol on Hindman, who shot Moon with a derringer pistol and then pulled another weapon on Wilson. Hindman was confronted by an angry mob and was later arrested. Released on bail, he returned to Helena and was eventually acquitted. The incident prevented him from going to Cuba as leaving the country would have made him appear to be a fugitive.

===Opposing the Know-Nothings===
During 1855, Hindman continued to provide support for temperance groups. In May 1855, he became even more active in Arkansas politics, opposing the Know-Nothings, a political faction that held strong anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic positions. Hindman opposed the Know-Nothings because they were for the most part against slavery, he disagreed with them on immigration, and he felt that they violated religious liberty. Hindman formed a Democratic Party association, supported by his law partner Palmer, who was a Catholic. He spent the rest of the year speaking against the Know-Nothings across northern Arkansas, culminating in a major rally at Helena in late November. Cleburne was one of his primary political lieutenants at this time. The two targeted the Know-Nothings for their perceived abolitionism. When a yellow fever epidemic struck Helena that fall, only Hindman, Cleburne, and a local minister volunteered to aid doctors as nurses. During the epidemic, Hindman and Cleburne became good friends; they bought a newspaper together and renamed it the &quot;States Rights Democrat&quot;.

At the outset of 1856, Hindman decided to run for Arkansas&#x27;s 1st congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. He went on a speaking tour across northern Arkansas from late January to mid-March, stressing opposition to the Know-Nothings and abolitionism. Hindman was challenged for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination by the popular incumbent Alfred B. Greenwood. The party held a nomination convention beginning on Monday, May 5. After 276 rounds of voting deadlocked between Hindman and Greenwood that stretched into Saturday morning, Hindman withdrew in the interest of party unity. Hindman actively campaigned for Greenwood, becoming in the words of biographers Diane Neal and Thomas Kremm &quot;more visible during the canvass than Greenwood&quot;. These actions kept him in the public eye, and set him up to be a strong candidate for the 1858 election.

Hindman&#x27;s vocal opposition to the Know-Nothings led to a feud with state legislator W. D. Rice. The situation festered from June 1855 through May 1856, when the two exchanged hostile letters in a newspaper. On May 24, Rice and three of his relatives got into a street fight with Hindman and Cleburne. The participants knew a fight was coming and all were armed. Rice fired first and hit Hindman in the arm and side. Hindman and Cleburne returned fire, and Cleburne was shot through the right lung. One of Rice&#x27;s relatives died three days later from wounds suffered in the fight, and Cleburne almost died as well. Both Hindman and Cleburne were later legally acquitted for their actions during the fight. During 1856, Hindman had also began courting Mary Watkins Biscoe, at one point sneaking into a convent to see her when her father attempted to force an end to the romance. They were married on November 11, with Cleburne serving as Hindman&#x27;s best man. Hindman&#x27;s new father in-law was a wealthy landowner, and two of his bride&#x27;s uncles had held statewide office. The marriage increased Hindman&#x27;s financial position and social status.

===Bringing down Arkansas&#x27;s political &quot;family&quot;===

Hindman began another run for Congress in late 1857. The Know-Nothings had been defeated soundly in the 1856 elections, and he had no major opposition within his own party. He was quite popular with Arkansas Democrats, and this time he easily won his party&#x27;s nomination for the 1st congressional district. He then handily defeated William M. Crosby in the general election to win the nomination. During the campaign, he was involved in a carriage accident that broke his leg. The injury did not heal properly, leaving one of his legs longer than the other. He had to wear a special boot, and he walked with a limp the rest of his life.

For years, Arkansas politics had been run by the political Conway-Johnson dynasty known as the Family. By the late 1850s, the strength of the Family was waning, as one of their most successful tactics had been to stress Democratic unity in the face of the Whigs and Know-Nothings, both of whom had largely lost power in Arkansas after 1856. The Family had supported Hindman in his 1858 congressional run, but Hindman had further ambitions, desiring the United States Senate seat held by Family member William K. Sebastian. The Family backed Sebastian for re-election, and Hindman then took a leading role in organizing a Democratic faction, known as the Old Line Democrats, opposed to the Family. In 1859, he established a newspaper, the &quot;Old Line Democrat&quot;, in Little Rock. After a pro-Family political convention in November 1858 had changed traditional nominating rules to allow former Whigs and Know-Nothings to participate in the candidate selection process, Hindman protested publicly, believing that the changes had been made to secure Sebastian the nomination. In response, Richard H. Johnson and other leaders of the Family threatened to block Hindman&#x27;s re-election push for the 1860 election. To the Family, Hindman was a &quot;factious disorganizer&quot;. The historian Thomas A. DeBlack writes that Hindman&#x27;s &quot;oratorical and organizational skills were unmatched by any other politician in the state&quot;.

Major disagreements between Hindman and his camp and the Family occurred over fiscal matters. The Real Estate Bank of Arkansas, a state bank, had previously collapsed as a result of the Panic of 1837, leaving Arkansas with large amounts of debt. Hindman suggested reducing the debt by foreclosing on mortgages held by the bank and suing the bank&#x27;s stockholders, many of whom were members of the Family, for the collateral they had put up. Johnson, in turn, accused Hindman of wanting to get the bank problem resolved because his father in-law was a former trustee of the bank who owed the bank money and had been accused of mismanagement. Hindman also accused the state government of unfairly awarding a printing contract to the Family-owned &quot;True Democrat&quot; newspaper, while the Family responded that Hindman just wanted the contract to go to one of the two newspapers he owned, the &quot;States Rights Democrat&quot; and the &quot;Old Line Democrat&quot;. Hindman unsuccessfully attempted to get Congressional election dates changed, and both sides accused the other of being supported by Know-Nothings. In November 1859, Hindman promised that he would appear in Little Rock to publicly argue against the Family, but instead went to Mississippi, stating that there had been an illness in his family. His failure to appear caused Robert Ward Johnson to refer to Hindman as &quot;a bully and imposter&quot;. A duel between the two men almost occurred in December. Another scandal arose when the press of the Family accused Hindman of writing a number of pro-Hindman letters under the name of &quot;Viator&quot;; Hindman later admitted to having been involved in writing them.

Hindman&#x27;s rise to prominence had caused turmoil in Arkansas politics, and the state Democratic Party was now badly split. In the candidate selection convention for the 1860 Arkansas gubernatorial election, the Family leadership manipulated several electoral and delegate selection processes to ensure Richard Johnson&#x27;s nomination. In May 1860, Henry M. Rector, a lower-ranking member of the Family hierarchy, entered the race. Rector opposed Johnson, but did not directly ally with Hindman and his supporters, although Hindman did support Rector. In the congressional elections, Hindman won the Democratic nomination with little difficulty, although his opponents accused him of exerting undue influence over the commission and argued that he should have instead been at the Congressional session in Washington, D.C. After a bitter gubernatorial campaign that was defined more by personalities than issues, Rector defeated Johnson; Hindman handily defeated his opponent, Jesse N. Cypert. Talk of secession had played a role in the campaign: Johnson was viewed as a pro-secession candidate, anti-secessionist voters favored Rector. The 1860 elections marked the end of the strength of the Family in Arkansas politics, and it never regained its former position of dominance.

==American Civil War==
===Secession===
Throughout his political career, Hindman had supported slavery, the right of slaveholders to take their slaves to other territories, and the belief that the Union could only be preserved if slavery was allowed. He also supported the resumption of the international slave trade, which had been outlawed in the United States. In the election for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 1859, Hindman joined other southern Democrats in opposing the candidacy of Republican John Sherman. Sherman had signed a compendium accompanying an anti-slavery book by Hinton Rowan Helper, and in January 1860, Hindman made a speech titled &quot;That Black Republican Bible – The Helper Book&quot; in opposition to Sherman. Hindman&#x27;s speech was popular in the south, and Republican William Pennington was elected instead of Sherman.

In Congress, Hindman supported a canal to bypass a blockage on the Red River of the South; proposed a decrease in public land cost; supported a railroad from Memphis, Tennessee to Albuquerque, New Mexico; and proposed converting the Little Rock Arsenal into an educational facility. Hindman was not a delegate to the 1860 Charleston Democratic National Convention, where a major split in the Democratic Party occurred. The split was bad enough that another convention had to be held in Baltimore. There was disagreement over who would be in the Arkansas delegation to the Baltimore convention; a threatened duel between Hindman and Dr. William Hooper did not proceed when Hindman declined as he did not consider Hooper to be his equal. The Baltimore convention completed the split of the Democratic Party. Some of the party supported Stephen A. Douglas, while others supported John C. Breckinridge. Hindman supported Breckenridge, who was viewed as the stronger pro-slavery candidate. While Breckenridge carried Arkansas, Republican Abraham Lincoln won the election nationwide. Hindman viewed the election of Lincoln as meaning that slavery was no longer safe, and supported secession while knowing that it could lead to civil war. With the political situation volatile, Hindman and Edward W. Gantt made speeches to the Arkansas General Assembly that DeBlack refers to as inflammatory.

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded. The next day, Hindman and Robert Ward Johnson sent a telegram to the Arkansas General Assembly calling for a secession convention. By the end of January 1861, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana were out of the Union. Arkansas took control of the Little Rock Arsenal in early February, and on February 18, the voters of Arkansas approved a secession convention. The secession convention met in early March and was against secession in the early going, and on March 18 rejected two motions that would have created a statewide secession referendum. However, before the convention ended on March 21, an agreement was made to hold a secession referendum in August.

The situation changed in mid-April. On April 12, Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, bringing on the American Civil War, and Lincoln called on the states to furnish troops to put down the rebellion. Arkansas rejected the request, and the secession convention was recalled. Lincoln&#x27;s call for troops moved public opinion towards secession, and parts of the state began to prepare for war even though the state had not yet seceded. Hindman made pro-secession speeches in the areas that had previously opposed it, and he was present on May 6 when the convention voted to secede from the Union. He personally telegraphed Davis, who was now the Confederate president, with the result. With war coming, Hindman resigned his seat in the United States House of Representatives.

===Entering Confederate service===
Hindman desired to be a member of the Arkansas delegation to the Confederate States Congress but was rejected for the role; the political powers in Arkansas wanted to prevent radical forces from taking over. After seceding, the secession convention created several laws to prepare the state for military action. Hindman was not part of the convention, but did write most of an ordinance for it to establish a military board. After contacting the Confederate States Secretary of War, LeRoy Pope Walker, Hindman received permission to recruit a regiment for Confederate service. Hindman informed the military board of this development on May 23, but they would not provide weapons, food, or clothing for his men. Instead, Hindman had to keep the men he recruited at Helena and Pine Bluff at his own expense. The men were initially ordered to Richmond, Virginia, but on June 11 were given orders to remain in Arkansas because Union Army forces in Missouri were threatening Arkansas. Hindman&#x27;s unit became the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, and he entered the Confederate States Army as a colonel on June 12. Hindman&#x27;s men were assigned to the command of Confederate Brigadier General William J. Hardee, but other Arkansas troops remained in state service and would not serve under Hardee, especially since they were not being properly paid or clothed. Many simply went back home.

In September, General Albert Sidney Johnston was placed in command of all Confederate forces west of the Allegheny Mountains, excluding the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Hardee&#x27;s force, including Hindman&#x27;s regiment, was transferred to Kentucky later that month, but Hindman was on recruiting duties and did not immediately follow it. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 28, and after arriving in Kentucky, he was assigned to command one of two brigades in a division led by Hardee, with Cleburne, who was also in Confederate service, commanding the other. While in Kentucky, Hindman&#x27;s men fought in several minor actions, including the Battle of Rowlett&#x27;s Station on December 17.

===Shiloh===

On February 8, 1862, after a Union victory at the Battle of Fort Henry and with the fall of Fort Donelson likely, Johnston ordered the abandonment of Kentucky, and Hindman&#x27;s men withdrew to Corinth, Mississippi, via Murfreesboro, Tennessee. At Corinth, Johnston gathered forces and by April had over 40,000 men, and along with General P. G. T. Beauregard, began planning an attack against Major General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Union army at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. Hindman was in command of a brigade in a corps led by Hardee. Johnston&#x27;s attack, known as the Battle of Shiloh, was launched on April 6.

Shortly before the battle, Hardee reorganized his corps into two ad hoc divisions, and Hindman&#x27;s included both his original brigade (now commanded by Colonel Robert G. Shaver) and that of Brigadier General S. A. M. Wood. The battle opened with Hindman&#x27;s men fighting with Colonel Everett Peabody&#x27;s Union brigade, in an exchange that prevented the Confederates from achieving complete surprise. Wood&#x27;s brigade later drove back a Union brigade, but suffered heavy losses in the effort. Hindman personally led another attack that shattered a Union brigade. During fighting with Colonel James C. Veatch&#x27;s Union brigade, Hindman&#x27;s horse was killed, and he was knocked out of the fighting by the fall, having broken a leg. With Hindman down and Hardee elsewhere on the field, Wood&#x27;s and Shaver&#x27;s battered and exhausted brigades fell out of the fighting, leaderless. Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting on April 6, which resulted in the Union forces being pushed back but not decisively defeated. Union reinforcements arrived, and on the next day drove the Confederates from the field. Hindman received praise from both Hardee and Beauregard for his performance during the battle.

===Trans-Mississippi command===
After Shiloh, Hindman took leave in Helena to recover. He was promoted to the rank of major general to date from April 14 and reported back to the army at Corinth, Mississippi, on May 10. On May 26, Hindman received orders from Beauregard to head back west of the Mississippi River and take command of Arkansas and the Indian Territory; these orders were expanded the next day to command Arkansas, Missouri, the Indian Territory, and Louisiana north of the Red River of the South. After stopping to gather supplies and weapons in Memphis, Helena, and Napoleon, Arkansas, Hindman arrived in Little Rock on May 30. Major General Earl Van Dorn had recently transferred almost all of the men and supplies in the Trans-Mississippi Department to east of the Mississippi, leaving very little in Arkansas.

Hindman had to construct his department from little, in one of the least developed parts of the Confederacy. He approached his task with zeal and energy, enforcing conscription laws (he illegally exempted from conscription the manufacturers of some goods he deemed necessary), promoted guerrilla warfare, and declared martial law. He also took troops passing through the state for Trans-Mississippi use, ordered all white troops in the Indian Territory to report to Arkansas, set up facilities to produce supplies and weapons, and secured the return of a division of Missouri troops that had been sent east of the Mississippi. He also reorganized the cavalry units within his department. Historian Stephen B. Oates credited Hindman&#x27;s actions with making the cavalry under his authority &quot;useful instead of ornamental&quot;. In the long run, his support of guerrilla warfare backfired on Hindman, as it eventually led to an increase in lawlessness in the state. Some captured Union soldiers were tortured and murdered, and Shea suggested that Hindman&#x27;s open hatred of the Union may have been to blame.

Hindman established defensive positions on the White River, although Union forces defeated Confederates in the area in the Battle of St. Charles and then again in the Battle of Cotton Plant, eventually taking Helena. Helena was the only permanent loss of territory in Arkansas the Confederates suffered at that time. After capturing Helena, Curtis had Hindman&#x27;s slaves freed and occupied his house. As Union control of Missouri prevented Hindman from enforcing conscription there, he sent veterans of the Missouri State Guard into the state on recruiting drives, resulting in thousands of recruits for the Confederacy. The incursions also resulted in an uptick in guerrilla activity in Missouri. When Hindman had taken over in Arkansas, the region was largely defenseless and Union forces were on the move; 70 days later, Union forces were at a standstill and the Confederates had over 20,000 men in Arkansas and the Indian Territory.

Hindman&#x27;s methods in accomplishing these tasks were sometimes extralegal, and he angered the political elite of Arkansas. Planters objected when Hindman ordered cotton burned to prevent Union forces from capturing it, or when he impressed slaves for military construction projects. Conscription was unpopular, and in the words of historians William Garrett Piston and John C. Rutherford, Hindman &quot;managed to alienate almost everyone&quot;. Many Arkansans viewed him as a tyrant. Historian William Shea wrote that Hindman&#x27;s accomplishments demonstrated &quot;what fanaticism and a complete disregard for constitutional rights could accomplish&quot;. He also cooperated poorly with Brigadier General Albert Pike, who disagreed with the decision to transfer Pike&#x27;s white troops from the Indian Territory; Hindman supported another officer who ordered Pike&#x27;s arrest and wanted Pike brought up for a court martial based on a speech that Pike made to pro-Confederate Native Americans that Hindman thought was designed to discourage them. Arkansas elites complained about Hindman to the Confederate government, and Hindman was replaced, as it was believed that he had become odious to Arkansans. His successor was Major General Theophilus Holmes, who was appointed on July 16. Holmes arrived in Arkansas on August 12.

===Defeat at Prairie Grove===
Holmes, who had been transferred west after performing poorly in the Seven Days&#x27; Battles, upheld some of Hindman&#x27;s unpopular decrees, including martial law. Holmes divided his department into three districts: Hindman was appointed to command the District of Arkansas, which consisted of Arkansas, Missouri, and the Indian Territory. Both Holmes and Hindman wanted to invade Missouri, and Hindman was ordered on August 21 to travel to Fort Smith in northwestern Arkansas to prepare for such a movement. Hindman arrived three days later; the Confederate troops in the area were largely unprepared for an offensive, and only a few months remained until the onset of winter would make movements in the Ozarks very difficult. In early September, Hindman pushed 6,000 men into southwestern Missouri and established his headquarters at Pineville. On September 10, Holmes recalled him to Little Rock. Brigadier General Allison Nelson had fallen terminally ill, and Holmes needed Hindman to take care of administrative matters.

In Hindman&#x27;s absence, Brigadier General James S. Rains took command. The Confederates in southwestern Missouri withdrew back into Arkansas after the First Battle of Newtonia, splitting into two forces, one of which was shattered at the Battle of Old Fort Wayne. Hindman returned to Fort Smith in mid-October, and had Rains removed for drunkenness. After learning that Union Major General John Schofield had advanced into Arkansas with 8,000 to 10,000 men, Hindman withdrew his force south across the Boston Mountains. After the withdrawal, Schofield assumed that the Confederates were no longer threatening Missouri and took two of his three divisions back to Springfield, Missouri, leaving Brigadier General James G. Blunt&#x27;s division in northwestern Arkansas.

The Confederates had been defeated at the Second Battle of Corinth, and Holmes was ordered to transfer 10,000 men east of the Mississippi River. Hindman opposed this, and suggested an offensive movement, which Holmes reluctantly agreed to. Hindman&#x27;s plan was to send Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke&#x27;s cavalry to Cane Hill, Arkansas, to distract Blunt, while moving most of his force into Blunt&#x27;s rear, crushing Blunt before Union reinforcements could arrive from the Springfield area. Marmaduke&#x27;s movement was detected by Union scouts, and Blunt moved to attack the Confederate cavalry. Fighting broke out between the two forces on November 28, and Marmaduke was forced to withdraw. Despite being short on food and ammunition, Hindman then moved most of his force, a total of 11,000 men and 22 cannons, towards Cane Hill on December 3. Blunt learned of the movement and prepared for a fight.

Late on December 6, Hindman learned that Union forces, led by Brigadier General Francis J. Herron, had already left Springfield and would be at Cane Hill on December 7. As his previous plan was no longer feasible, Hindman decided to instead strike Herron at Prairie Grove on December 7 and then attack Blunt at Cane Hill after defeating Herron. The new plan was risky, and was predicated on Blunt not moving to reinforce Herron at Prairie Grove. Hindman did not attack, and instead took up a passive defensive position at Prairie Grove on December 7. The Battle of Prairie Grove opened between Hindman and Herron, but Blunt arrived on the field at 13:45. The Confederates fought the combined forces of Herron and Blunt to a draw, but Hindman decided to withdraw to Van Buren, Arkansas, after the battle. Biographers Diane Neal and Thomas Kremm wrote that Hindman&#x27;s decision to move to the defensive on December 7 was a &quot;ghastly mistake&quot;; Hindman&#x27;s contemporary John Newman Edwards stated that &quot;waiting for Herron&#x27;s attack meant waiting for Blunt&quot;. The Confederates retreated again, this time to Little Rock, after a defeat by Herron and Blunt at the Battle of Van Buren on December 28.

===Chickamauga===

Hindman&#x27;s earlier policies in Arkansas continued to make him unpopular during the Prairie Grove campaign, and the defeat at Prairie Grove worsened matters. The Arkansas congressional delegation petitioned Davis to transfer him out of the state, a request that was granted on January 30, 1863. Hindman was assigned to a court of inquiry related to the Confederate defeat at the Battle of New Orleans in February, and finally left the state on March 13. Hindman presided over the court of inquiry, which met from April through July. He petitioned the Confederate government to reassign him to a divisional command in Arkansas, but he was instead sent to command a division in Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk&#x27;s corps of the Army of Tennessee. He arrived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to join the army on August 13, but soon developed a poor relationship with army commander General Braxton Bragg.

On August 16, Union Major General William S. Rosecrans began a movement towards Chattanooga with 67,000 men. Outnumbered, Bragg abandoned the city and fell back into northern Georgia, pursued by Rosecrans. However, Rosecrans overextended his line, and Bragg prepared for an opportunity to attack. A division of the Union army was sent into McLemore Cove, in an area vulnerable to Confederate attack. On the night of September 910, Bragg ordered Hindman to attack, and ordered D. H. Hill to send Cleburne&#x27;s division to attack from the opposite direction once Hindman struck the Union force. Hill, in turn, claimed to Bragg that the movement was impossible, and Cleburne&#x27;s division moved only part of the way. Hindman&#x27;s division likewise halted early, with Hindman sending a message back to Bragg that he would not advance further unless he learned for certain that Cleburne was moving as well. Hindman continued his movement towards the Union position on the morning of the 11th. At about noon, Bragg ordered Cleburne to attack but soon reversed the order. Minor skirmishing broke out between Hindman and the Union force at around 16:30, and Cleburne&#x27;s division attacked, but the Union force had retreated and the Battle of Dug Gap was only light skirmishing. While Bragg&#x27;s orders were poorly written, Hindman still performed badly; in the opinion of historian Craig Symonds, Hindman deserved the public tongue-lashing given to him by Bragg after the affair.

Bragg then decided to attack Rosecrans elsewhere, at Lee and Gordon Mill. The Battle of Chickamauga began on September 18, with the main Confederate attack beginning on September 19. In the battle, Hindman&#x27;s division was assigned to the left wing of the Confederate army, under the command of Lieutenant General James Longstreet. The battle continued into the next day, and a misunderstanding led to a Union division being moved from its place in the line on the morning of September 20, resulting in a gap between Union formations. Longstreet&#x27;s men attacked into the gap. Hindman&#x27;s division shattered two Union divisions in forty minutes. The entire Union right wing collapsed. Hindman suffered a painful shrapnel wound to the neck during the battle, but remained on the field. During the early afternoon, Colonel John T. Wilder&#x27;s Union brigade struck Hindman&#x27;s left flank, blunting the division&#x27;s attack. Wilder wanted to drive through Hindman&#x27;s line to the other side of the Union position, where troops under Major General George H. Thomas were still holding out, but was ordered to retreat. After this incident, Hindman was ordered to stop his pursuit of retreating Union forces and move his division north to rejoin other units of Longstreet&#x27;s command.

Hindman sent one of his brigades to the support of Brigadier General Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division, ordered a second to resupply using captured Union ammunition, and intended to send his third brigade to Johnson&#x27;s aid once it was ready. Instead, Johnson attacked without waiting for Hindman. Bloody fighting against Thomas&#x27;s men occurred, and Hindman&#x27;s division entered the fray as well. Longstreet had been unclear as to whether Johnson or Hindman were in charge, and both officers believed that they were responsible for both divisions. Fighting, often at close quarters, continued until nightfall, when Thomas, now facing the wings of both Longstreet and Polk, withdrew. Bragg decided not to pursue on September 21.

===Suspension and transfer request===
On September 29, 1863, Bragg suspended Polk from command for &quot;neglect of duty&quot; and Hindman for &quot;disobedience of the lawful command of his superior officer&quot;, with Hindman&#x27;s charge being related to the McLemore Cove incident. Hindman was sent to Atlanta, Georgia, to await further developments. Neal and Kremm refer to the suspension as unwarranted and ill-timed and state that the suspensions of Polk and Hindman &quot;in part appear to have been motivated by Bragg&#x27;s desire to rid his command of some of his critics&quot;, although Hindman had not vocally opposed Bragg. After recovering, Hindman began preparing reports and documents to oppose his suspension, and on November 8 asked for a court of inquiry. Several of the officers of Bragg&#x27;s army had sent a petition to Davis in early October, and Davis, who had received letters from civilians criticizing Bragg&#x27;s generalship, declared that the suspensions of Hindman and Polk were void and traveled to visit Bragg&#x27;s army, although Bragg did not initially comply with the declaration. On November 15, wanting to avoid a court of inquiry, Bragg dropped the charges against Hindman and ordered him reinstated, although Hindman was allowed to remain on leave until December 15 while his wife gave birth and recovered from a serious illness. Meanwhile, Bragg had been removed from command on November 30; he was replaced by General Joseph E. Johnston on December 27. During the reorganization of the army, Hindman temporarily commanded a corps until Major General John Bell Hood arrived to take permanent command; Hood arrived on February 25.

Over the winter of 1863 to 1864, Hindman began supporting the Confederacy arming slaves, a highly controversial option. Cleburne made a public presentation in support of the idea, but it was rejected. Not wanting to serve under Hood, Hindman requested a transfer to an inspector general or behind-the-lines duty in Florida or southern Georgia before he was replaced. With the transfer not having been acted on by February 28, Hindman tendered his resignation. He had no real intentions of resigning, but hoped that it would push the Confederate government into transferring him. Instead, he was ordered back to his divisional command on March 18. His hopes of a transfer or promotion had been blunted by his support for Cleburne&#x27;s proposal to arm slaves, the hostile Bragg&#x27;s position as an advisor to Davis, and his continuing unpopularity in the Trans-Mississippi due to his previous actions in Arkansas. His resignation was denied on March 23, and Hindman officially resumed commanding his division on April 3.

===Atlanta===
In early May 1864, Union Major General William T. Sherman began the Atlanta campaign by moving almost 100,000 men against Johnston&#x27;s army in northern Georgia. The Confederates withdrew from Dalton, Georgia, and took up positions at Resaca. The Battle of Resaca began on May 13. Fighting continued into the next day, and Hindman&#x27;s division was attacked. After repulsing the Union infantry charge, Hindman&#x27;s force came under artillery bombardment. Other Confederate troops attacked the Union left, only to be blunted by Union reinforcements. The battle continued into its third day on May 15. Union cavalry raided the Confederate rear, striking Hindman&#x27;s division&#x27;s field hospital, destroying supplies and taking prisoners. Around 13:00, Union troops again attacked Hindman&#x27;s line, but were repulsed. Johnston learned that Union troops were threatening his line of communications, and ordered a withdrawal that night.

The Confederate retreat continued with sporadic fighting, with Johnston taking up a new position in the Marietta area in June. On June 22, elements of two Union corps pushed forward and encountered Hood&#x27;s division near Kolb&#x27;s Farm. Hood responded by ordering an attack. The Battle of Kolb&#x27;s Farm was a bloody Confederate repulse. Along with Major General Carter L. Stevenson&#x27;s division, Hindman&#x27;s division was ordered to charge. Stevenson&#x27;s division suffered heavy losses, while Hindman&#x27;s men encountered a swamp in their line of attack and were driven off. One Union infantry officer claimed that Hindman&#x27;s attack was repulsed solely by artillery fire, with his infantry being unengaged. On June 27, Sherman was bloodily repulsed in frontal attacks at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, and then outflanked Johnston&#x27;s line, forcing the Confederates to retreat. During the withdrawal from Kennesaw Mountain, Hindman was struck in the face by a tree branch while riding through a forest. He was thrown from his horse and injured, including developing severe eye inflammation. The eye injury prevented him from exercising field command, and Hindman went to Atlanta and then Macon to recover.

===Leave in Texas and end of war===
On July 10, 1864, Hindman again requested a transfer, this time specifically to the Trans-Mississippi. This was denied because of his unpopularity in Arkansas, and he was instead offered a leave of absence to recover from his injury. Historian Albert E. Castel suggested that Hindman went on leave less because of his injury and more out of resentment of not being promoted. Another Confederate officer noted that Hindman was &quot;anxious to get away, and everyone else equally so to get rid of him&quot;. Hindman selected San Antonio, Texas as the location for his leave, as he expected to be out of action for several months. He was unable to take all of his family&#x27;s slaves with them, and hired some out to the medical director of the Army of Tennessee. In order to support his family in Texas, Hindman purchased tobacco in Alabama using borrowed money and then had it shipped using Confederate military wagons to Texas with him, where he intended to sell it. Leaving with his family in late August, Hindman began the trek to Texas. One of his daughters died of illness near Meridian, Mississippi, and was buried along the way. In early November, the party crossed the Mississippi River with difficulty, as Union forces now controlled it. They arrived in Shreveport, Louisiana, where Hindman was criticized for using Confederate military wagons to transport his personal belongings and tobacco, although it was common practice for Confederate government wagons to haul materials for civilians when they were not needed for military use.

The Hindmans reached San Antonio in January 1865. By this time, the Confederacy was collapsing, and Atlanta had fallen. Over the next several months, false rumors about Hindman were circulating, such as that General E. Kirby Smith had ordered his arrest over the tobacco, or that Hindman had deserted the Confederacy to fight for Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. In April, the armies of General Robert E. Lee and Johnston surrendered, and Smith surrendered to Union forces on June 2. Hindman, who was under indictment for treason from Union authorities in Arkansas, refused to surrender. Along with his family and other Confederates, Hindman left Texas in June and crossed the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas, entering Mexico. The Hindmans settled in Monterrey.

==Later life==
While he expected to have been able to easily make a living in Mexico, Hindman had trouble getting a law practice to flourish, despite learning Spanish. Maximilian later ordered the ex-Confederates to leave Monterrey, as he feared that if they flourished too much on the northern frontier of the country, they would eventually demand independence. The Hindmans moved to Saltillo and then Montelise. They then traveled to Mexico City in September, where Hindman hoped to discuss with Maximilian the topic of obtaining land for the ex-Confederates. The Hindmans became friends with Maximilian and his wife Carlota of Mexico. Hindman&#x27;s fifth child was born in Mexico City in December, and Hindman published two works on military theory. The family later moved to the Carlota, where many ex-Confederates settled.

In Carlota, agriculture did not do as well as hoped, and Hindman was unable to establish a successful legal practice because of the poverty of the residents. Hindman was part of a plan formed by several ex-Confederates in 1866 to establish a colony in the Yucatán Peninsula, but this failed as foreign support for the rule of Maximilian ended. The family moved to Orizaba before June; rebels against Maximilian razed Carlota not long after they moved. Maximilian&#x27;s rule began to collapse, and the Hindmans were forced to return to the United States, returning to Helena in April 1867. Maximilian was overthrown and executed in mid-June. Hindman requested a pardon from President of the United States Andrew Johnson, but this was denied. Once settled in Helena, Hindman resumed his legal practice with John C. Palmer and later M. T. Sanders.

Hindman also reentered politics, speaking against the Radical Republicans. Hindman also argued against the 1868 Arkansas Constitution and the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican Powell Clayton. In an attempt to silence Hindman, the Republican leadership of Reconstruction Era-Arkansas revived the 1865 treason indictment and had Hindman arrested on March 20, 1868. He was permitted to remain at liberty until his trial, but the pending charges excluded him from a July 1868 amnesty proclamation by President Johnson that pardoned almost all former Confederates. He then became the leader of a political faction known as the Young Democracy, which supported taking a loyalty oath mandated by the 1868 constitution and then participating in future elections. One of the claims of the Young Democracy was that Republicans were only using Reconstruction for personal gain, and that freed slaves should instead support the Democrats. Hindman began to accrue a following of both ex-Confederates and freed slaves.

==Assassination==
On the night of September 27, 1868, while sitting in his home with his children, Hindman was shot through a window of his home. He was hit in the neck and jaw, and his windpipe was severed. His wife carried him onto the porch, and neighbors gathered around. Hindman suggested that the shooting was politically motivated, and asked a relative of his wife to take care of his family. He died early the next morning. The assassination was a shock to Arkansas. Many accused the Republican Party of being involved in the murder, but the assassin was not known. Louis D. Vaughn claimed to have been hired by Daniel A. Linthicum to commit the murder, but it was later determined that Vaughn was only trying to get back at Linthicum for exposing him as a bigamist in 1866. In 1876, an arsonist in Georgia claimed before his execution to have murdered Hindman, but his testimony contradicted the known facts of the case. Hindman is buried at what is now known as Maple Hill Cemetery in Helena, his remains having been moved there in 1870. Hindman Hall, the museum at Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park, was constructed using funds left by the estate of Hindman&#x27;s son Biscoe for a memorial for Hindman.

<text>Suprematism () is an early twentieth-century art movement focused on the fundamentals of geometry (circles, squares, rectangles), painted in a limited range of colors. The term &quot;suprematism&quot; refers to an abstract art based upon &quot;the supremacy of pure artistic feeling&quot; rather than on visual depiction of objects.

Founded by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1913, Supremus () conceived of the artist as liberated from everything that predetermined the ideal structure of life and art. Projecting that vision onto Cubism, which Malevich admired for its ability to deconstruct art, and in the process change its reference points of art, he led a group of Russian avant-garde artists—including Aleksandra Ekster, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Ivan Kliun, Ivan Puni, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Nina Genke-Meller, Ksenia Boguslavskaya and others—in what has been described as the first attempt to independently found a Russian avant-garde movement, seceding from the trajectory of prior Russian art history.

To support the movement, Malevich established the journal &quot;Supremus&quot; (initially titled &quot;Nul&quot; or &quot;Nothing&quot;), which received contributions from artists and philosophers. The publication, however, never took off and its first issue was never distributed due to the Russian Revolution. The movement itself, however, was announced in Malevich&#x27;s 1915 Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0,10, in St. Petersburg, where he, and several others in his group, exhibited 36 works in a similar style.

==Birth of the movement==

Kazimir Malevich developed the concept of Suprematism when he was already an established painter, having exhibited in the &quot;Donkey&#x27;s Tail&quot; and the &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; (The Blue Rider) exhibitions of 1912 with cubo-futurist works. The proliferation of new artistic forms in painting, poetry and theatre as well as a revival of interest in the traditional folk art of Russia provided a rich environment in which a Modernist culture was born.

In &quot;Suprematism&quot; (Part II of his book &quot;The Non-Objective World&quot;, which was published 1927 in Munich as Bauhaus Book No. 11), Malevich clearly stated the core concept of Suprematism:
He created a suprematist &quot;grammar&quot; based on fundamental geometric forms; in particular, the square and the circle. In the &quot;0.10 Exhibition&quot; in 1915, Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting. The centerpiece of his show was the &quot;Black Square&quot;, placed in what is called the &quot;red/beautiful corner&quot; in Russian Orthodox tradition; the place of the main icon in a house. &quot;Black Square&quot; was painted in 1915 and was presented as a breakthrough in his career and in art in general. Malevich also painted &quot;White on White&quot; which was also heralded as a milestone. &quot;White on White&quot; marked a shift from polychrome to monochrome Suprematism.

==Distinct from Constructivism==

Malevich&#x27;s Suprematism is fundamentally opposed to the postrevolutionary positions of Constructivism and materialism. Constructivism, with its cult of the object, is concerned with utilitarian strategies of adapting art to the principles of functional organization. Under Constructivism, the traditional easel painter is transformed into the artist-as-engineer in charge of organizing life in all of its aspects.

Suprematism, in sharp contrast to Constructivism, embodies a profoundly anti-materialist, anti-utilitarian philosophy. In &quot;Suprematism&quot; (Part II of &quot;The Non-Objective World&quot;), Malevich writes:

Jean-Claude Marcadé has observed that &quot;Despite superficial similarities between Constructivism and Suprematism, the two movements are nevertheless antagonists and it is very important to distinguish between them.&quot; According to Marcadé, confusion has arisen because several artists—either directly associated with Suprematism such as El Lissitzky or working under the suprematist influence as did Rodchenko and Lyubov Popova—later abandoned Suprematism for the culture of materials.

Suprematism does not embrace a humanist philosophy which places man at the center of the universe. Rather, Suprematism envisions man—the artist—as both originator and transmitter of what for Malevich is the world&#x27;s only true reality—that of absolute non-objectivity.

For Malevich, it is upon the foundations of absolute non-objectivity that the future of the universe will be built - a future in which appearances, objects, comfort, and convenience no longer dominate.

==Influences on the movement==

Malevich also credited the birth of Suprematism to &quot;Victory Over the Sun&quot;, Kruchenykh&#x27;s Futurist opera production for which he designed the sets and costumes in 1913. The aim of the artists involved was to break with the usual theater of the past and to use a &quot;clear, pure, logical Russian language&quot;. Malevich put this to practice by creating costumes from simple materials and thereby took advantage of geometric shapes. Flashing headlights illuminated the figures in such a way that alternating hands, legs or heads disappeared into the darkness. The stage curtain was a black square. One of the drawings for the backcloth shows a black square divided diagonally into a black and a white triangle. Because of the simplicity of these basic forms they were able to signify a new beginning.

Another important influence on Malevich were the ideas of the Russian mystic, philosopher, and disciple of Georges Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, who wrote of &quot;a fourth dimension or a Fourth Way beyond the three to which our ordinary senses have access&quot;.

Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non-Euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement, or through time; titles such as: &quot;Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement&quot;. These give some indications towards an understanding of the &quot;Suprematic&quot; compositions produced between 1915 and 1918.

==The &quot;Supremus&quot; journal==

The Supremus group, which in addition to Malevich included Aleksandra Ekster, Olga Rozanova, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Ivan Kliun, Lyubov Popova, Lazar Khidekel, Nikolai Suetin, Ilya Chashnik, Nina Genke-Meller, Ivan Puni and Ksenia Boguslavskaya, met from 1915 onwards to discuss the philosophy of Suprematism and its development into other areas of intellectual life. The products of these discussions were to be documented in a monthly publication called &quot;Supremus&quot;, titled to reflect the art movement it championed, that would include painting, music, decorative art, and literature. Malevich conceived of the journal as the contextual foundation in which he could base his art, and originally planned to call the journal &quot;Nul&quot;. In a letter to a colleague, he explained:

Malevich conceived of the journal as a space for experimentation that would test his theory of nonobjective art. The group of artists wrote several articles for the initial publication, including the essays &quot;The Mouth of the Earth and the Artist&quot; (Malevich), &quot;On the Old and the New in Music&quot; (Matiushin), &quot;Cubism, Futurism, Suprematism&quot; (Rozanova), &quot;Architecture as a Slap in the Face to Ferroconcrete&quot; (Malevich), and &quot;The Declaration of the Word as Such&quot; (Kruchenykh). However, despite a year spent planning and writing articles for the journal, the first issue of &quot;Supremus&quot; was never published.

==El Lissitzky: Bridge to the West==

The most important artist who took the art form and ideas developed by Malevich and popularized them abroad was the painter El Lissitzky. Lissitzky worked intensively with Suprematism particularly in the years 1919 to 1923. He was deeply impressed by Malevich&#x27;s Suprematist works as he saw it as the theoretical and visual equivalent of the social upheavals taking place in Russia at the time. Suprematism, with its radicalism, was to him the creative equivalent of an entirely new form of society. Lissitzky transferred Malevich&#x27;s approach to his &quot;Proun&quot; constructions, which he himself described as &quot;the station where one changes from painting to architecture&quot;. The Proun designs, however, were also an artistic break from Suprematism; the &quot;Black Square&quot; by Malevich was the end point of a rigorous thought process that required new structural design work to follow. Lissitzky saw this new beginning in his Proun constructions, where the term &quot;Proun&quot; (Pro Unovis) symbolized its Suprematist origins.

Lissitzky exhibited in Berlin in 1923 at the Hanover and Dresden showrooms of Non-Objective Art. During this trip to the West, El Lissitzky was in close contact with Theo van Doesburg, forming a bridge between Suprematism and De Stijl and the Bauhaus.

==Architecture==
Lazar Khidekel (1904–1986), Suprematist artist and visionary architect, was the only Suprematist architect who emerged from the Malevich circle. Khidekel started his study in architecture in Vitebsk art school under El Lissitzky in 1919–20. He was instrumental in the transition from planar Suprematism to volumetric Suprematism, creating axonometric projections (The Aero-club: Horizontal architecton, 1922–23), making three-dimensional models, such as the architectons, designing objects (model of an &quot;Ashtray&quot;, 1922–23), and producing the first Suprematist architectural project (The Workers&#x27; Club, 1926). In the mid-1920s, he began his journey into the realm of visionary architecture. Directly inspired by Suprematism and its notion of an organic form-creation continuum, he explored new philosophical, scientific and technological futuristic approaches, and proposed innovative solutions for the creation of new urban environments, where people would live in harmony with nature and would be protected from man-made and natural disasters (his still topical proposal for flood protection – the City on the Water, 1925).

Nikolai Suetin used Suprematist motifs on works at the Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed, and Malevich designed a Suprematist teapot. The Suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s, which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in Constructivist architecture.

Malevich&#x27;s architectural projects were known after 1922 &quot;Arkhitektoniki&quot;. Designs emphasized the right angle, with similarities to De Stijl and Le Corbusier, and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all. Another part of the formalism was low regard for triangles which were &quot;dismissed as ancient, pagan, or Christian&quot;.

The first Suprematist architectural project was created by Lazar Khidekel in 1926. In the mid-1920s to 1932 Lazar Khidekel also created a series of futuristic projects such as Aero-City, Garden-City, and City Over Water.

In the 21st century, architect Zaha Hadid had &#x27;a particular interest [in] the Russian avant-garde, and the movement known as Constructivism,&#x27; and &#x27;as part of their work on the Russian avant-garde, Hadid&#x27;s unit studied Suprematism, the abstract movement founded by the painter Kazimir Malevich.&#x27;.

==Social context==

This development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state, ideas were in ferment, and the old order was being swept away. As the new order became established, and Stalinism took hold from 1924 on, the state began limiting the freedom of artists. From the late 1920s the Russian avant-garde experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of Socialist Realism became official policy, and prohibited abstraction and divergence of artistic expression. Malevich nevertheless retained his main conception. In his self-portrait of 1933 he represented himself in a traditional way—the only way permitted by Stalinist cultural policy—but signed the picture with a tiny black-over-white square.

<doc id="293099" wikidata="Q1952340" url="?curid=293099" title="Multichannel marketing">
<text>Multichannel marketing is the blending of different distribution and promotional channels for the purpose of marketing. Distribution channels include a retail storefront, a website, or a mail-order catalogue.

Multichannel marketing is about choice. The objective of the companies doing the marketing is to make it easy for a consumer to buy from them in whatever way is most appropriate.

To be effective, multichannel marketing needs to be supported by good supply chain management systems, so that the details and prices of goods on offer are consistent across the different channels. It might also be supported by a detailed analysis of the return on investment from each different channel, measured in terms of customer response and conversion of sales. The contribution each channel delivers to sales can be assessed via Marketing Mix Modeling or attribution modelling. Some companies target certain channels at different demographic segments of the market or at different socio-economic groups of consumers.

Multichannel marketing allows the retail merchant to reach its prospective or current customer through a channel of his/ her liking.

==Coordination of online and offline channels==
Companies that sell branded products and services through local businesses market through both online and offline channels to local audiences. Online and offline multichannel marketing campaigns can either inform one another or be executed in isolation. A proportion of companies use their online marketing efforts to inform their offline advertising (i.e. they test keywords online to understand if they fit with customer intent before printing them in offline ads).

==Comparison with traditional forms of marketing==
While multichannel marketing focuses primarily on new media platforms in marketing, traditional approaches use old media such as print sources, telemarketing, direct mail and broadcasting stations such as radio and television. Multichannel marketing does not only use web 2.0 forms but also integrates media convergence models, targeting customer interaction through different platforms such as via text messaging, on a website, email, online video campaigns, GPS to track the location of a customer and their proximity to the product or service. Being able to reach out to customers directly is an important marketing strategy because it is convenient and enhances direct customer interaction.

==Benefits==
Some of the long term benefits of this style of marketing include:
*Better management of results and sales: Using many communicative platforms to reach the audience increases the chances of receiving feedback from a variety of customers on the overall performance. This feedback gives companies an idea of what the customer wants and what they can improve upon 
*Higher revenues: The more diverse platforms used in trying to reach customers, the more the potential customers are likely to reach out to purchase goods and services. If the company advertises its brand only on the [internet], it will be very hard to capture the attention of potential customers who do not use the internet regularly and rely on other mediums such as the [television] for example.
*Better understanding of customers: By the response from customers, it is easier to understand what they expect from a product or service and how a brand can be improved. To satisfy the needs of a niche, it is necessary to identify the channels and platforms which work for a certain group.
*Increased brand visibility and reach: About 36% of shoppers search products on one channel but purchase the product through a different channel.
*Optimize media spend: Data retrieval and centralization enables companies to better target consumer segments and provide them with more effective marketing campaigns therefore optimizing media spend. ref url = https://digital.hec.ca/en/digital-and-omni-channel-marketing/

<doc id="293107" wikidata="Q160422" url="?curid=293107" title="Theo van Doesburg">
<text>Theo van Doesburg (; born Christian Emil Marie Küpper; 30 August 1883 – 7 March 1931) was a Dutch painter, writer, poet and architect. He is best known as the founder and leader of De Stijl. He married three times.

== Personal life ==
Theo van Doesburg was born Christian Emil Marie Küpper on 30 August 1883, in Utrecht, Netherlands, as the son of the photographer Wilhelm Küpper and Henrietta Catherina Margadant. After a short period of training in acting and singing, he decided to become a storekeeper. He always regarded his stepfather, Theodorus Doesburg, to be his natural father, so that his first works are signed with Theo Doesburg, to which he later added &quot;van&quot;.

Van Doesburg married three times: on 4 May 1910 to theosophist, poet and writer Agnita Henrica Feis; on 30 May 1917 to accountant Helena &#x27;Lena&#x27; Milius; and on 24 November 1928 to artist, pianist and choreographer Petronella &#x27;Nelly&#x27; Johanna van Moorsel.

== Career ==
His first exhibition was in 1908. From 1912 onwards, he supported his works by writing for magazines. He considered himself to be a modern painter, at that time, although his early work is in line with the Amsterdam Impressionists and is influenced by Vincent van Gogh, both in style and subject matter. This suddenly changed in 1913 after reading Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Rückblicke&quot;, in which he looks back at his life as a painter from 1903 to 1913. It made him realize there was a higher, more spiritual level in painting that originates from the mind rather than from everyday life, and that abstraction is the only logical outcome of this. It was already in 1912 that Van Doesburg was criticizing Futurism in an art article in &quot;Eenheid&quot; no. 127, on 9 November 1912, because &quot;The mimetic expression of velocity (whatever its form may be: the aeroplane, the automobile, and so on) is diametrically opposed to the character of painting, the supreme origin of which is to be found in inner life&quot;. On 6 November 1915, he wrote in the same journal: &quot;Mondrian realizes the importance of line. The line has almost become a work of art in itself; one can not play with it when the representation of objects perceived was all-important. The white canvas is almost solemn. Each superfluous line, each wrongly placed line, any color placed without veneration or care, can spoil everything—that is, the spiritual&quot;.

== The De Stijl movement ==

It was while reviewing an exhibition for one of these magazines he wrote for, in 1915 (halfway through his two-year service in the army), that he came in contact with the works of Piet Mondrian, who was eight years older than he was, and had by then already gained some attention with his paintings. Van Doesburg saw in these paintings his ideal in painting: a complete abstraction of reality. Soon after the exhibition Van Doesburg got in contact with Mondrian, and together with related artists Bart van der Leck, Antony Kok, Vilmos Huszár and Jacobus Oud they founded the magazine &quot;De Stijl&quot; in 1917.
=== Promoting De Stijl ===

Although De Stijl was made up of many members, Van Doesburg was the &quot;ambassador&quot; of the movement, promoting the ideas of Neoplasticism across Europe. He moved to Weimar in 1922, deciding to make an impression on the Bauhaus principal, Walter Gropius, to spread the influence of the movement.

While Gropius accepted many of the precepts of contemporary art movements he did not feel that Doesburg should become a Bauhaus master. Doesburg then installed himself near to the Bauhaus buildings and started to attract school students interested in the new ideas of Constructivism, Dadaism, and De Stijl.

== The split with Mondrian ==
The friendship between Van Doesburg and Mondrian remained strong in these years, although their primary means of communication was by letter. In 1923 Van Doesburg moved to Paris, together with his later wife Nelly van Moorsel. Because the two men got to see each other on a much more regular basis the differences in character became apparent: Mondrian was an introvert, while van Doesburg was more flamboyant and extravagant. During 1924 the two men had disagreements, which eventually led to a temporary split that year. The exact reason for the split has been a point of contention among art historians; usually the divergent ideas about the directions of the lines in the paintings have been named as the primary reason: Mondrian never accepted diagonals, whereas Doesburg insisted on the dynamic aspects of the diagonal, and indeed featured it in his art. Mondrian accepted some concepts of diagonals, such as in his &quot;Lozenge&quot; paintings, where the canvas was rotated 45 degrees, while still maintaining horizontal lines. In recent years, however, this theory has been challenged by art historians such as Carel Blotkamp, who cites the artist&#x27;s different concepts about space and time. After the split, Van Doesburg launched a new concept for his art, Elementarism, which was characterized by the diagonal lines and which rivaled Mondrian&#x27;s Neo-Plasticism.

In 1929 the two men reconciled when they accidentally met in a café in Paris.

== Architecture, design, and typography ==

Van Doesburg had other activities apart from painting and promoting De Stijl: he made efforts in architecture, designing houses for artists, together with Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Hans Arp he designed the decoration for the Aubette entertainment complex in Strasbourg. Together with El Lissitzky and Kurt Schwitters, Van Doesburg pioneered the efforts to an International of Arts in two congresses held in Düsseldorf and Weimar, in 1922. A geometrically constructed alphabet Van Doesburg designed in 1919 has been revived in digital form as Architype Van Doesburg. This typeface anticipates similar later experimentation by Kurt Schwitters in his typeface Architype Schwitters. In the mid-1920s, Van Doesburg worked together with Schwitters and the artist Kate Steinitz to produce a series of children&#x27;s fairy-tale books that featured unusual typography, including &quot;Hahnepeter&quot; (&quot;Peter the Rooster&quot;, 1924), &quot;Die Märchen vom Paradies&quot; (&quot;The Fairy Tales of Paradise&quot;, 1924–25), and &quot;Die Scheuche&quot; (&quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, 1925).

Van Doesburg also kept a link with Dada, publishing the magazine &quot;Mécano&quot; under the heteronym of I. K. Bonset (possibly derived from &quot;Ik ben zot&quot;, Dutch for &quot;I am foolish&quot;). He also published Dada poetry under the same name in De Stijl. Under a second pseudonym, Aldo Camini, he published anti-philosophical prose, inspired by the Italian representative of Metaphysical art, Carlo Carrà. In these works of literature, he heavily opposed individualism (and thus against the movement of the Tachtigers, realism, and psychological thinking). He sought for a collective experience of reality. His conception of intensity had much in common with Paul van Ostaijen&#x27;s conception of &quot;dynamiek&quot;. He wanted to strip words of their former meaning, and give them a new meaning and power of expression. By doing this, he tried to &quot;evoke&quot; a new reality, instead of describing it.

== Last years ==
Van Doesburg stayed active in art groups and the magazine &quot;Cercle et Carré&quot;, which he left in 1929. &quot;The plan to produce a magazine had been broached some time before. It is clear from the correspondence that in the spring of 1928 Van Doesburg made the first designs for the layout of the periodical. He wrote to Joaquín Torres-García on 28 May 1929 : I will prepare the blueprint fo nouveau plan.&quot; Art Concret, which he co-founded in 1929, and Abstraction-Création, which he co-founded in 1931. At the end of February 1931 he was forced to move to Davos in Switzerland because of his declining health. Van Doesburg did not recuperate: on 7 March 1931, he died of a heart attack. After his death Nelly van Doesburg released the last issue of De Stijl in January 1932, as a memorial issue, with contributions by old and new members from De Stijl.

== Influence ==
Van Doesburg&#x27;s work has had significant influence, including that dealing with issues of crossover art, design and architecture. For example, his &quot;Space-time construction #3&quot; (1923) was a key work in the Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art&#x27;s &quot;Painting toward architecture&quot; exhibition (1947–52, 28 venues). From that time, the work was influential to the practice of noted architect Harry Seidler. In 1992, he acquired the artwork, which was donated to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra in 2010. In a travelling, international exhibition on Seidler&#x27;s work, Van Doesburg&#x27;s &quot;Space time-construction #3&quot; was shown as a key influence.

<doc id="293110" wikidata="Q5189256" url="?curid=293110" title="Crowley's Ridge">
<text>Crowley&#x27;s Ridge (also Crowleys Ridge) is a geological formation that rises 250 to above the alluvial plain of the Mississippi embayment in a line from southeastern Missouri to the Mississippi River near Helena, Arkansas. It is the most prominent feature in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Gulf of Mexico.

This narrow rolling hill region rising above the flat plain is the sixth, and smallest, natural division of the state of Arkansas. The southern part is protected within Ozark–St. Francis National Forest.

Most of the major cities of the Arkansas Delta region lie along Crowley&#x27;s Ridge. It was named after Benjamin Crowley, known as the first American settler to reach the area, sometime around 1820. The Civil War Battle of Chalk Bluff was fought on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge on May 1–2, 1863.

==Composition and origin==
The ridge is primarily composed of the windblown glacially derived sediment known as loess. It contrasts greatly with the flat table land around it and with the black soil that makes up the delta. The ridge varies from half a mile to wide and reaches an elevation of near its northern extremity. The highest point on the ridge in Arkansas is &quot;Legacy Mountain&quot; at the Craighead County solid waste site south of Jonesboro.

Prevailing winds blow dust into the river fogs. The fog wetted dust tends to fall and make loess deposits on the downwind sides of rivers, such as the east and north sides of the Mississippi River, as well as the east side of the Black River. These loess deposits are a classic example of periglacial loess. Crowley&#x27;s Ridge is a natural loess accumulation point. A comparable example of this type of deposit is the Loess Hills in northwestern Missouri and western Iowa.

At one time, the ridge was thought to have been an island between the Mississippi River and Ohio River that was isolated as a long low hilly ridge after the rivers changed course millions of years ago. Recent seismic evidence, however, questions the fluvial origin by focusing on uplift along ridge bounding faults.

There is evidence that the area&#x27;s elevation has increased over the years, suggesting that uplift is still taking place. This alternative explanation posits a link between the ridge and the nearby New Madrid Seismic Zone.

==Soils and vegetation==
The flora and fauna of the ridge seem more closely related to the Tennessee hills to the east than to the Ozark Mountains to the west. This unique habitat has been protected by the establishment of several state and city parks, the St. Francis National Forest, recreational lakes, and in 1997 a national scenic byway, the Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Parkway.

The soils in this area are moderately fertile and sometimes rich. The land is moderately rugged, discouraging row-crop agriculture. These soils are easily eroded. There is some commercial agriculture in the loessal plains area of the ridge. The ridge is surrounded by the fertile lands of the delta region. The vegetation is predominantly oak and hickory forests, similar to vegetation found in the Appalachian Mountains. Examples are the tulip tree (or yellow poplar) and the American beech. Ferns and flowers abound here, including the American bellflower, fire pink, butterfly weed, cardinal flower, blue lobelia, phlox, verbena, wild hydrangea, hibiscus, aster, and yellow jasmine. The low-lying areas around the ridge were once much swampier, and the ridge provided a natural and more healthful place for settlers to establish homes. The ridge became a natural north-south communications link for the region, since travel along the ridge was much easier than through the swampy lowlands.

==Fossils==
The region adjacent to the ridge is covered with thick deltaic soils, and few fossils are found except in gravel pits. These pits sometimes reveal the teeth of large mastodons, mammoths and horses, which roamed the continent as recently as 10,000 years ago. Crowley&#x27;s Ridge contains important exposures of fossiliferous Tertiary sediments and contains the only documented Miocene exposures in the state. A silicified conifer stump weighing several tons was unearthed near Wittsburg, and many more were found around Piggott. Mastodon bones were found within the city limits of Helena at the southern end of the ridge. Near Forrest City, in the bed of Crow Creek, a deposit of oyster shells estimated to be nearly 7,000,000 cubic yards in size was discovered.

==Namesake==

Crowley&#x27;s Ridge is named after Benjamin Crowley (1758–1842), the first American settler of the Ridge near Paragould, Arkansas. Crowley is buried in the Shiloh Cemetery in Greene County, Arkansas, and a monument marks the spot. The cemetery is part of Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park. Next to Crowley&#x27;s grave, other early settlers of the ridge are buried in unmarked graves.

==Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Nature Center==
The Forrest L. Wood Crowley’s Ridge Nature Center in Jonesboro, Arkansas features self-guided exhibits about area&#x27;s topography and natural history and wildlife of Crowley’s Ridge. Operated by the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission (AGFC) and opened in 2004, the Center includes an exhibit area, discovery room, observation tower, meeting rooms, auditorium, and gift shop. Outside there are trails through wetlands, forest and prairie, and a 1/4 mile universally accessible trail and boardwalk around a pond. The Center offers many activities and nature education programs. It is named after Forrest L. Wood, a former commissioner and supporter of the AGFC.

<text>The [[People&#x27;s Commissariat]] for Education (or Narkompros; , directly translated as the &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for Enlightenment&quot;) was the Soviet agency charged with the administration of public education and most other issues related to culture. In 1946, it was transformed into the Ministry of Education. Its first head was Anatoly Lunacharsky. However he described Nadezhda Krupskaya as the &quot;soul of Narkompros&quot;. Mikhail Pokrovsky, Dmitry Leshchenko and Evgraf Litkens also played important roles.
Lunacharsky protected most of the avant-garde artists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Despite his efforts, the official policy after Joseph Stalin put him in disgrace.

Narkompros had seventeen sections, in addition to the main ones related to general education, e.g.,
* Likbez, a section for liquidation of illiteracy,
* &quot;Profobr&quot;, a section for professional education,
* Glavlit, a section for literature and publishing (also in charge of censorship in publishing),
* &quot;Glavrepertkom&quot; (Главрепертком), a commission for approval of performers&#x27; repertoires.
* Department of the Mobilisation of Scientific Forces, to which the Russian Academy of Sciences reported after 1918.
* TEO, the Theatre Department which published Vestnik Teatra
* &quot;Vneshkol&#x27;nyi Otdel&quot;, the adult Education Department run by Krupskaya
* &quot;Glavpolitprosvet&quot;, in charge of political education out of school
Some of these evolved into separate entities, others discontinued.

== Relationship with Proletkult ==
Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii, as chair of the Organizing Bureau for the National Proletkult argued that Narkompros, as a state organ, had responsibilities for the whole of society, whereas Proletkult asserted its autonomy as an organisation set up specifically for workers class. However, there was concern with &quot;parallelism&quot; - the situation which arose when similar work was carried out in parallel by different organisations. In early 1918 Narkompros gave Proletkult a budget of over 9,200,000 rubles, whereas the entire Adult Education Division received 32,500,000 rubles.

== Izo-Narkompros ==
The Izo-Narkompros (Изо-наркомпрос), or the section of visual arts (отдел изобразительных искусств) created on 29 January 1918. It consisted of two parts: the collegium (deliberative organ) and the section proper (executive organ). The first collegium was headed by Vladimir Tatlin and included Kasimir Malevich, Ilya Mashkov, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Olga Rozanova, Alexander Rodchenko, Wassily Kandinsky. It was subdivided into a number of subsections.

Lunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the agit-trains and agit-boats, that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts. He also gave support to Constructivism&#x27;s theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the &quot;ROSTA Windows&quot;, revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, and others.

Izo-Narkompros also published &quot;Iskusstvo kommuny&quot; (Art of the Commune) of which 19 issues appeared between 7 December 1918 and April 1919.

===Museum Bureau===

==Film industry==
Lenin saw film as the most important medium for educating the masses in the ways, means and successes of communism. As a consequence Lenin issued the &quot;Directives on the Film Business&quot; on 17 January 1922, which instructed the Narkompros to systemise the film business, registering and numbering all films shown in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, extracting rent from all privately owned cinemas and subject them to censorship.

<doc id="293114" wikidata="Q487425" url="?curid=293114" title="Test of English as a Foreign Language">
<text>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL ) is a standardized test to measure the English language ability of non-native speakers wishing to enroll in English-speaking universities. The test is accepted by more than 11,000 universities and other institutions in over 190 countries and territories. TOEFL is one of several major English-language tests worldwide, including IELTS, Pearson Test of English (PTE), Duolingo English Test, Cambridge Assessment English, and Trinity College London exams.

TOEFL is a trademark of the Educational Testing Service (ETS), a private non-profit organization, which designs and administers the tests. ETS issues official score reports which are sent independently to institutions and are valid for two years following the test.

== History ==

In 1962, a national council made up of representatives of thirty government and private organizations was formed to address the problem of ensuring English language proficiency for non-native speakers wishing to study at U.S. universities. This council recommended the development and administration of the TOEFL exam for the 1963–1965 timings.

The test was initially developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor Charles A. Ferguson.

The TOEFL test was first administered in 1964 by the Modern Language Association financed by grants from the Ford Foundation and Danforth Foundation.

In 1965, The College Board and ETS jointly assumed responsibility for continuing the TOEFL testing program.

In 1973, a cooperative arrangement was made between ETS, The College Board, and the Graduate Record Examinations board of advisers to oversee and run the program. ETS was to administer the exam with the guidance of the TOEFL board.

To the present day, college admission criteria for international students who are nationals of some of the Commonwealth nations exempt them from taking the TOEFL exam. Nations that are part of the English-speaking world (from most Commonwealth realms to former British colonies e.g., Hong Kong SAR or former/protectorates of the United States (Philippines, Puerto Rico), where English is the de facto official language, automatically grant a TOEFL exemption with some restrictions (e.g., residents of Quebec are required to take TOEFL while the rest of Canada is exempt – also inclusive of Commonwealth nations where English is not an official language e.g., Mozambique or Namibia (English is co-official but spoken by 3% of the population). However, this does not apply to some Commonwealth nations outside the Anglosphere, due to the IELTS, such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc., even though they may have English as the de facto official language.

==Formats and content==

===Internet-based test===

The TOEFL Internet-based test (iBT) measures all four academic English skills: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. Since its introduction in late 2005, the Internet-based Test format has progressively replaced computer-based tests (CBT) and paper-based tests (PBT), although paper-based testing is still used in select areas. The TOEFL iBT test has been introduced in phases, with the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy in 2005 and the rest of the world in 2006, with test centers added regularly. It is offered weekly at authorized test centers. The CBT was discontinued in September 2006 and these scores are no longer valid. 

Initially, the demand for test seats was higher than availability, and candidates had to wait for months. It is now possible to take the test within one to four weeks in most countries. Now, people who wish to take the test create an account on the official website to find the closest place. In the past this test lasted 4 hours, today people can choose to take the test for around 3 hours.

The test consists of four sections, each measuring one of the basic language skills (while some tasks require integrating multiple skills), and all tasks focus on the language used in an academic, higher-education environment. Note-taking is allowed during the TOEFL iBT test. The test cannot be taken more than once every 3 days, starting from September 2019.

#Reading
#:The Reading section consists of questions on 3–4 passages, each approximately 700 words in length and with 10 questions. The passages are on academic topics; they are the kind of material that might be found in an undergraduate university textbook. Passages require an understanding of rhetorical functions such as cause-effect, compare-contrast, and argumentation. Students answer questions about main ideas, details, inferences, essential information, sentence insertion, vocabulary, rhetorical purpose, and overall ideas. New types of questions in the TOEFL iBT test require filling out tables or completing summaries. Prior knowledge of the subject under discussion is not necessary to come to the correct answer.
#Listening
#:The Listening section consists of questions on 2–3 conversations with 5 questions each and 3–4 lectures with 6 questions each. Each conversation is 2.5–3 minutes and lectures are 4.5–5.5 minutes in length. The conversations involve a student and either a professor or a campus service provider. The lectures are a self-contained portion of an academic lecture, which may involve student participation and do not assume specialized background knowledge in the subject area. Each conversation and lecture passage is heard only once. Test-takers may take notes while they listen and they may refer to their notes when they answer the questions. The listening questions are meant to measure the ability to understand main ideas, important details, implications, relationships between ideas, organization of information, speaker purpose, and speaker attitude.
#Speaking
#:The Speaking section consists of 4 tasks: 1 independent (Task 1) and 3 integrated (Task 2, 3, 4). In task 1, test-takers answer opinion questions on familiar topics. They are evaluated on their ability to speak spontaneously and convey their ideas clearly and coherently. In tasks 2 and 4, test-takers read a short passage, listen to an academic course lecture or a conversation about campus life, and answer a question by combining appropriate information from the text and the talk. In task 3, test-takers listen to an academic course lecture and then respond to a question about what they heard. In the integrated tasks, test-takers are evaluated on their ability to appropriately synthesize and effectively convey information from the reading and listening material. Test-takers may take notes as they read and listen and may use their notes to help prepare their responses. Test-takers are given a short preparation time before they have to begin speaking. The responses are digitally recorded, sent to ETS&#x27;s Online Scoring Network (OSN), and evaluated by three to six raters.
#Writing
#:The Writing section measures a test taker&#x27;s ability to write in an academic setting and consists of two tasks: one integrated and one independent. In the integrated task, test-takers read a passage on an academic topic and then listen to a speaker discuss it. The test-taker then writes a summary of the important points in the listening passage and explains how these relate to the key points of the reading passage. In the independent task, the test-taker must write an essay that states their opinion or choice, and then explain it, rather than simply listing personal preferences or choices. Responses are sent to the ETS OSN and evaluated by at least 3 different raters.
One of the sections of the test will include extra, uncounted material. Educational Testing Service includes extra material to pilot test questions for future test forms. When test-takers are given a longer section, they should give equal effort to all of the questions because they do not know which question will count and which will be considered extra. For example, if there are four reading passages instead of three, then one of the passages will not be counted. Any of the four could be the uncounted one.

=== Home edition ===
The TOEFL IBT Home Edition is essentially the same test as the TOEFL IBT. However, it is taken at home while a human proctor watches through a web camera (usually built-in to most laptops) and via sharing of the computer screen. The popularity of the Home Edition has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic as it has been the only option during lockdowns. Many students experience technical or security problems during the Home Edition tests. The ETS browser used to administer the test has been unreliable in many cases. Students who have their exams interrupted are not likely to get a refund or the chance to reschedule for a new test as the ETS has technical problems that are hard to document and the processing of a complaint is slow due to the popularity of the Home Edition and the number of complaints. If the test runs smoothly, the results are accepted by most companies and universities that accept the TOEFL IBT standard edition.

===Paper-delivered test===
The TOEFL paper-delivered test is an official test for use where the internet test is unavailable, usually due to internet &amp; computer issues.

It consists of the Listening, Reading, and Writing sections, with scores that are on the same scale as the Internet-Based Test. There is no total score. Not all centers have the possibility of delivering this type of test, so it will generally be necessary to reschedule the day of the test for another available day.

==== Paper-based test ====

The TOEFL paper-based test (PBT) was still available in limited areas until 2017 when it was replaced by the paper-delivered test. Scores are valid for two years after the test date, and test takers can have their scores sent to institutions or face time.

#Listening (30 – 40 minutes)
#:The Listening section consists of 3 parts. The first one contains 30 questions about short conversations. The second part has 8 questions about longer conversations. The last part asks 12 questions about lectures or talks. Harder questions are worth two scores.
#Structure and Written Expression (25 minutes)
#:The Structure and Written Expression section has 15 exercises for completing sentences correctly and 25 exercises for identifying errors. Harder questions are worth two scores.
#Reading Comprehension (55 minutes)
#:The Reading Comprehension section has 50 questions about reading passages. Harder questions are worth two scores.
#Writing (30 minutes)
#:The TOEFL PBT administrations include a writing test called the Test of Written English (TWE). This is one essay question with 250–300 words on average.

=== Accommodations ===
There are three different categories of accommodations that can be utilized for TOEFL test takers. Some of these accommodations are available for all students and some are only available for those with certain disabilities. If the accommodation the student requires is not available then requests can be made through the Testing Accommodations Request Form. For questions, ETS provides Disability Services that can be contacted.

==Test scores==

===TOEFL iBT test===
* The TOEFL iBT test is scored on a scale of 0 to 120 points.
* Each of the four sections (Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing) receives a scaled score from 0 to 30. The scaled scores from the four sections are added together to determine the total score.
* The reading and listening sections are tested first, followed by a ten-minute break. The speaking and writing sections are then completed following the break. A maximum amount of 203 minutes is allowed to complete the whole exam process.
*Each speaking question is initially given a raw score of 0 to 4, with a 1-point increment, and each writing question is initially given a raw score of 0.0 to 5.0, with a 0.5-point increment. These scores are converted to scaled scores of 0 to 30.

===Paper-based test (PBT)===
*The final PBT score ranges between 0 and 677 and is based on three subscores: Listening (0–68), Structure (0–68), and Reading (0–67). The minimum possible score is 310, which corresponds to 31 scores for each section. Unlike the CBT, the score of the Writing component (referred to as the Test of Written English, TWE) is not part of the final score; instead, it is reported separately on a scale of 0–6.
* The score test takers receive on the Listening, Structure, and Reading parts of the TOEFL test is not the percentage of correct answers. The score is converted to take into account the fact that some tests are more difficult than others. The converted scores correct these differences. Therefore, the converted score is a more accurate reflection of the ability than the raw score.

The TOEFL PBT was discontinued at the end of May 2017. Official testing in areas without internet or computers now uses the TOEFL PDT.

===Accepted TOEFL scores===
Most colleges use TOEFL scores as only one factor in their admission process, with a college or program within a college often setting a minimum TOEFL score required. The minimum TOEFL iBT scores range from 64 (Conservatorium van Amsterdam) to 110 (University of Oxford).

ETS has released tables to convert between iBT, CBT, and PBT scores.

== &quot;TOEFL ITP&quot; tests ==
&quot;TOEFL ITP&quot; (&quot;ITP&quot; stands for &quot;Institutional Testing Program&quot;) tests are paper-based and use academic content to evaluate the English-language proficiency of non-native English speakers. The tests use new and previously administered TOEFL test questions and are used for placement, progress, evaluation, exit testing, and other situations. The test scores, format, and content of the test match the &quot;TOEFL PBT&quot;, with the exception of not including the TWE (Test of Written Expression).

Unlike the TOEFL iBT and PBT tests, &quot;TOEFL ITP&quot; tests are administered by the institution and for internal use. It should not replace the need for the TOEFL iBT test, which is administered securely and includes Speaking and Writing components. There are two levels of TOEFL ITP: Level 1 (intermediate to advanced) and Level 2 (high beginning to intermediate). &quot;TOEFL ITP&quot; scores are mapped to the CEFR and test takers are provided with a certificate of achievement.

==&quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; tests==
ETS also offers the &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; tests, a general assessment of middle school-level English-language proficiency. It is intended for students aged 11+. The tests are administered in two formats: &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; Standard (on paper) and &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; Comprehensive (via computer). The &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; Standard test has three sections: Reading Comprehension, Listening Comprehension, and Language Form and Meaning. The &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; Comprehensive test has four: Reading Comprehension, Listening Comprehension, Speaking, and Writing. &quot;TOEFL Junior&quot; scores are mapped to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and test takers are provided with a certificate of achievement.

The test is scored on a scale of 0 to 300 on each section, added up to determine the total score (0–900). The minimum passing score is 600, corresponding to 200 scores for each section.

== TOEFL &quot;Primary&quot; test ==
The TOEFL family of tests has also created the TOEFL Primary test. It is designed for students between the ages of eight and eleven. The test is divided into 3 sections: reading and listening – step 1, reading and listening – step 2, and speaking. Depending on the fluency of students&#x27; English, they will be expected to take either the step 1 or step 2 test. Students are expected to take two of the three sections, depending on their communicative skills in English. They will take either the step 1 or step 2 test. The reading and listening tests can be done on paper or digitally, but the speaking test is only available digitally.

While the other TOEFL test scores are valid for two years, this test is only valid for one. This is because of how quickly children grow in their communicative abilities.

Scores for these tests range from 101–115 for the reading and listening, and 1–27 for the speaking portion.

<doc id="293115" wikidata="Q206017" url="?curid=293115" title="Patrick Michaels">
<text>Patrick J. Michaels (February 15, 1950 – July 15, 2022) was an American agricultural climatologist. Michaels was a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute until 2019. Until 2007, he was research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, where he had worked from 1980.

Starting in 1991, he collaborated with Fred Singer to attack the scientific consensus on ozone depletion. He joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. He described policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as &quot;Obamunism&quot;.

He wrote a number of books and papers denying or minimizing climate change.

==Early life==
Born in Berwyn, Illinois, Michaels obtained an A.B. in biological science in 1971 and an S.M. in biology in 1975 from the University of Chicago, and in 1979 he obtained his Ph.D. in ecological climatology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Atmospheric anomalies and crop yields in North America&quot;.

In 1991 and 1992, Michaels collaborated with Fred Singer in writing articles for the &quot;Washington Times&quot; rejecting the scientific consensus on ozone depletion. He advanced arguments on the subject as late as 2000.

==Views on climate change==
Michaels said that he does not contest the basic scientific principles behind greenhouse warming and acknowledges that the global mean temperature has increased in recent decades. He is quoted as being skeptical of global warming, and was described by Michael E. Mann as a &quot;prominent climate change contrarian&quot;. He contends that the changes will be minor, not catastrophic, and may even be beneficial.

A 2002 article published in the journal &quot;Climate Research&quot; by Michaels and three other scholars predicted &quot;a warming range of 1.3–3.0°C, with a central value of 1.9°C&quot; over the 1990 to 2100 period, although he remarked that the &quot;temperature range and central values determined in our study may be too great&quot;. He made the argument that the climate feedback system involving current warming trends was weaker than generally asserted, coming to a conclusion that set his views apart from that of the IPCC&#x27;s estimates.

In 2009, Michaels authored a Cato report arguing that &quot;Congress should pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide, repeal current ethanol mandates, and inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation.&quot;

In 2018, Michaels asserted on Fox News, &quot;[P]robably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree [of total warming] might be caused by greenhouse gases.&quot; &quot;Climate Feedback&quot;, a fact-checking website for media coverage on climate change, wrote of Michaels&#x27; assertion, &quot;No evidence or research is provided to support this claim, which contradicts the published scientific literature.&quot;

==Advocacy==
===Expert witness for Western Fuels Association===
In May 1994 Richard Lindzen, Michaels, and Robert Balling served as expert witnesses on behalf of Western Fuels Association in St. Paul, Minnesota to determine the environmental cost of coal burning by state power plants. Western Fuels Association is a consortium of coal producers that uses collective advocacy to represent industry interests.

===World Climate Report, Greening Earth Society, and Western Fuels Association===
The World Climate Report, a newsletter edited by Michaels was first published by the Greening Earth Society. The society was a public relations organization associated with the Western Fuels Association (WFA), an association of coal-burning utility companies. It has been called a &quot;front group created by the coal industry&quot; and an &quot;industry front&quot;. Fred Palmer, a society staffer, is a registered lobbyist for Peabody Energy, a coal company. WFA founded the group in 1997, according to an archived version of its website, &quot;as a vehicle for advocacy on climate change, the environmental impact of CO2, and fossil fuel use.&quot;

===2003 John Holdren===
Office of Science and Technology Policy director, John Holdren, told the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee in June 2003, &quot;Michaels is another of the handful of U.S. climate-change contrarians … He has published little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science.&quot; In 2009 Michaels responded in a &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; op-ed, saying that the IPCC had subverted the peer review process, and adding the IPCC had &quot;left out plenty of peer-reviewed science that it found inconveniently disagreeable.&quot;

===IPCC===
Michaels was one of hundreds of US reviewers composing the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group in 2007.

Although the Greening Earth Society was generally skeptical of the impact of climate change, it acknowledged some degree of global warming as real: &quot;Fact #1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18°C per decade&quot;. Note that the actual increase in the global surface temperature during the 100 years ending in 2005 was 0.74 ± 0.18 °C.

Climate scientist Tom Wigley, a lead author of parts of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has stated that &quot;Michaels&#x27; statements on the subject of computer models are a catalog of misrepresentation and misinterpretation … Many of the supposedly factual statements made in Michaels&#x27; testimony are either inaccurate or are seriously misleading.&quot;

==Funding from energy or fossil fuel companies==
In 2006, a Colorado energy cooperative, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, had given Michaels $100,000. An Associated Press report said that the donations had been made after Michaels had &quot;told Western business leaders ... that he was running out of money for his analyses of other scientists&#x27; global warming research&quot; and noted that the cooperative had a vested interest in opposing mandatory carbon dioxide caps, a situation that raised conflict of interest concerns.

Michaels said on CNN that 40 percent of his funding came from the oil industry. According to Fred Pearce, fossil fuel companies have helped fund Michaels&#x27; projects, including his &quot;World Climate Report&quot;, published every year since 1994, and his &quot;advocacy science consulting firm&quot;, New Hope Environmental Services.

A 2005 article published by the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that Michaels had received more than $165,000 in fuel-industry funding, including money from the coal industry, to publish his own climate journal.

==Death==
Michaels died on July 15, 2022, in Washington, D.C. at age 72. He leaves behind a wife Rachel Schwartz Michaels (m-2016 - 2022)

==Selected publications==
His writing has been published in major scientific journals, including &quot;Climate Research&quot;, &quot;Climatic Change&quot;, &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot;, &quot;Journal of Climate&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, and &quot;Science&quot;, as well as in popular serials such as the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot;. He was an author of the climate &quot;paper of the year&quot; awarded by the Association of American Geographers in 2004.

<text>Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.
Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.

Education in India has much room for growth, such as improving access to education, increasing the quality of education, reducing disparities, lowering dropout rates, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organisations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.

Education in India is plagued by issues such as grade inflation, corruption, unaccredited institutions offering fraudulent credentials and lack of employment prospects for graduates. Half of all graduates in India are considered unemployable.

== Education system ==
Until 1976, under the Indian constitution, each state was responsible for the schools that fell under its governance; states possessed full jurisdiction over creating and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list, which allowed the federal government (also known as the central government) to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes&quot;.&quot; In a country as large as India, with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences between states&#x27; policies, plans, programmes, and initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programmes and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously, the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-2006, 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government, and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centres). Of those schools managed privately, one third are &#x27;aided&#x27; and two thirds are &#x27;unaided&#x27;. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However, in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66).

In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was reported to be literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for female. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India&#x27;s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India&#x27;s comparatively young population.

Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.While a consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools, greater affordability of private schools, and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools. After the adoption of the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be &#x27;government-recognised&#x27;. A private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions.

At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group. Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.

As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6–14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6–14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018). Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl&#x27;s enrolment. While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9–12).
Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day. States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that India is achieving only 79.0% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to education.

Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading. However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: &quot;The Emptying of Public Schools and Growth of Private Schools in India&quot;, it is said that for sensible education-policy making, it is vital to take account of the various changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with adverse effects on children&#x27;s education.

In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges. In India&#x27;s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the central government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary. Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.

==History==

Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a &quot;guru&quot; or preceptor after initiation. The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was a very important part of education. Taxila is an example of an ancient higher learning institute in ancient India, possibly dating as far back as the 8th century BCE. However, it is debatable whether or not this can be regarded as a university in modern-day terms, since the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university, and all subjects there were taught in the Pali language.

Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education such as medical studies. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar), Vikramashila, and Odantapuri among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, and páli grammar. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with the founding of the Mauryan Empire.

Shramanas and Brahmanas historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas and temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacharis or celibate. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. Arts, crafts, Ayurveda, architecture, etc., were taught.

With the advent of Islam in India the traditional methods of education increasingly came under Islamic influence. Pre-Mughal rulers such as Qutb-ud-din Aybak and other Muslim rulers initiated institutions which imparted religious knowledge. Scholars such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Moinuddin Chishti became prominent educators and established Islamic monasteries. Students from Bukhara and Afghanistan visited India to study humanities and science. Islamic institution of education in India included traditional &quot;madrassas&quot; and &quot;maktabs&quot; which taught grammar, philosophy, mathematics, and law influenced by the Greek traditions inherited by Persia and the Middle East before Islam spread from these regions into India. A feature of traditional Islamic education was its emphasis on the connection between science and humanities.

British rule and the subsequent establishment of educational institutions saw the introduction of English as a medium of instruction. Some schools taught the curriculum through vernacular languages with English as a second language. The term &quot;pre-modern&quot; was used for three kinds of schools – the Arabic and Sanskrit schools which taught Muslim or Hindu sacred literature and the Persian schools which taught Persian literature. The vernacular schools across India taught reading and writing the vernacular language and arithmetic. British education became solidified into India as missionary schools were established during the 1820s.

===18th century===

Dharampal was instrumental in changing the understanding of pre-colonial education in India. Dharampal&#x27;s primary works are based on documentation by the colonial government on Indian education, agriculture, technology, and arts during the period of colonial rule in India. His pioneering historical research, conducted intensively over a decade, provides evidence from extensive early British administrators’ reports of the widespread prevalence of indigenous educational institutions in Bombay, Bengal and Madras Presidencies as well as in the Punjab, teaching a sophisticated curriculum, with daily school attendance by about 30% of children aged 6–15.

In 1818, the fall of Maratha Empire lead to large parts of India coming under British rule. During the decade of 1820–30, detailed surveys of the indigenous education system that were prevalent in their provinces were conducted by the British.

G.L. Prendergast, a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council in Bombay Presidency, recorded the following about indigenous schools on 27 June 1821:

===Colonial period and English education===
In 1835, the English Education Act was passed by the British in India. This act made English the formal medium of education in all schools and colleges. This act neglected both indigenous schools and mass education, as only a small section of upper-class Indians were educated to become the connecting link between the government and the masses. This act is today popularly known as Macaulayism.

&quot;We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.&quot;

According to sociologist Hetukar Jha, this act lead to the decline of indigenous schools which flourished in villages and towns, and simultaneously, the British policy in 1835 skewed in favor of the filtration theory of education, which worked to block to a significant extent the entry of the middle classes and below.

The colonial period also saw an increasing establishment of Christian missionary schools, which had a considerable influence in shaping English education in India. The Charter Act 1813 lifted several prohibitions on Christian missionary schools in the expanding British territories. Historian Gauri Viswanathan identifies two major changes to the relation between Britain and India that came about as the result of the Charter Act 1813: first, the assumption by the British of a new responsibility for Indian people&#x27;s education; and, second, the relaxation of controls on missionary activity.

===Post-independence===

Since the country&#x27;s independence in 1947, the Indian government sponsored a variety of programmes to address the low literacy rate in both rural and urban India. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, India&#x27;s first Minister of Education, envisaged strong central government control over education throughout the country, with a uniform educational system.

The Union government established the University Education Commission (1948–1949), the Secondary Education Commission (1952–1953), University Grants Commission and the Kothari Commission (1964–66) to develop proposals to modernise India&#x27;s education system. The Resolution on Scientific Policy was adopted by the government of Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#x27;s first Prime Minister. The Nehru government sponsored the development of high-quality scientific education institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology. In 1961, the Union government formed the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) as an autonomous organisation that would advise both the Union and state governments on formulating and implementing education policies.

====2020====

In 2019, the Indian Ministry of Education released a draft of a new education policy, which was followed by a number of public consultations. It discusses reducing curriculum content to enhance essential learning, critical thinking, and promoting more holistic, experiential, discussion-based and analysis-based learning. It also talks about a revision of the curriculum and pedagogical structure from a 10+2 system to a 5+3+3+4 system design in an effort to optimise learning for students based on cognitive development of children. On 29 July 2020, the cabinet approved a new National Education Policy with an aim to introduce several changes to the existing Indian education system. The Policy aims to make pre-primary education universal and places special emphasis on achieving foundational literacy/numeracy in primary school and beyond for all by 2025.

== Educational stages ==

The National Education Policy 2020 introduced the 5+3+3+4 education structure in India, where students will spend 5 years in the foundational stage, 3 years in the preparatory stage, 3 years in the middle stage, and 4 years in the secondary stage, with a focus on holistic development and critical thinking. However, it is important to note that educational practices can vary across different states and education boards in India.

=== Pre-Primary / Elementary Education ===
This stage is optional and includes pre-school and kindergarten education for children aged 3 to 6 years. It focuses on early childhood development and prepares children for formal schooling.

==== Nursery / Anganwadi ====
Nursery 

==== Kindergarten (LKG &amp; UKG) ====
Kindergarten is mainly attended by children between 3–5 years of age, and is an important basic building block that prepares kids for primary education. Children study in LKG for one year and then in UKG for one year.

=== Primary Education : ===
Primary education typically starts at the age of 6 and continues for 5 years, from Classes I to V. The main subjects taught during this stage include: mathematics, science, social science, languages (usually English and a regional language or a foreign language), physical education and training, value education. 

=== High School Education : ===

==== Secondary / Lower Secondary / Matriculation Education ====
Secondary education covers Classes IX and X (Grades 9-10), usually from ages 14 to 16. Students are exposed to a wider range of subjects, including additional languages, arts, and vocational subjects in addition to the usual English, math, science, social science, computer science physical ed., value education. At the end of class X, students often appear for a standardised board examination like the Secondary School Leaving Certificate Examination / Secondary School Certificate (&quot;SSLC / SSC&quot;) conducted by the respective state education boards or All India Secondary School Examination (&quot;AISSE&quot;) conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (&quot;ICSE&quot;) examination conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE).Secondary school education in India is commonly known as &quot;high school&quot; or &quot;secondary school&quot;. These terms are widely used across the country to refer to the stage of education that follows primary education and precedes higher secondary education.

==== Senior Secondary / Higher Secondary / Intermediate Education ====
After completing secondary education, students move on to higher secondary education, which includes classes XI and XII (Grades 11–12). They typically specialise in one of three streams: Science, Commerce, or Humanities/Arts. The curriculum becomes more focused on specific subjects related to the chosen stream with a few subjects in common and compulsory such as physical education, work experience, value education and art or related. At the end of class XII, students generally appear for board examinations such as the Higher Secondary Certificate Examination conducted by the respective state boards or All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) conducted by CBSE or the Indian School Certificate (ISC) examination conducted by CISCE.

The terminology used to describe higher secondary education varies between states in India. Some commonly used terms include intermediate education in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh; higher secondary education (HSE) in Assam, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu; senior secondary education (SSE) in Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan; and pre-university education (PUC) in Karnataka. These terms represent the educational stage following secondary education and indicate the diverse terminology used in different states across the country. The curriculum for these streams may vary based on the board of education or state education board.

After completing the 12th grade, students can also pursue higher education in universities or specialised institutions depending on their chosen stream and career aspirations.

====Pre-university course or intermediate education====
In certain states in India, such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the education system includes a two-year pre-university course (PUC) after the completion of secondary education (10th grade). The PUC is commonly referred to as junior college. Students typically enroll in pre-university colleges to pursue their intermediate education, which acts as a bridge between high school and university.
The pre-university system allows students to choose from three major streams of study:
:Science: This stream focuses on subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
:Commerce: This stream includes subjects like Accountancy, Economics, Business Studies, and Mathematics.
:Arts/Humanities: Students in this stream study subjects like History, Political Science, Sociology, Economics, and Languages.
Upon completing their pre-university education, students can choose to pursue higher education at universities, professional colleges, or other specialised institutions.
In the rest of the states in India, including the central education boards like CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) and CISCE (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations), the education system follows a 10+2 format. It consists of ten years of primary and secondary education (up to the 10th grade) followed by two years of higher secondary education (11th and 12th grade).

==== Vocational Education ====
In addition to the regular academic curriculum, vocational education is offered at various stages to provide specific skills and training in fields such as engineering, information technology, hospitality, healthcare, and more. Vocational courses are available at both the secondary and higher secondary levels.

It is important to note that educational practices, syllabus, and examinations may vary depending on the education board, such as CBSE, CISCE, state boards, or international boards. Additionally, there are alternative education systems in India, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), which follow different curricula and assessment methods.

===Higher Education===
After completing higher secondary or intermediate education, students can pursue higher education in colleges and universities. Higher education options include undergraduate programmes (bachelor&#x27;s degrees), postgraduate programmes (master&#x27;s degrees), and doctoral programmes (Ph.D. degrees).

==Pre-primary education in India==
The pre-primary stage is the foundation of children&#x27;s knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage, but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.
* Play group (pre-nursery): At playschools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness. The age limit for admission into pre-nursery is 2 to 3 years. Anganwadi is government-funded free rural childcare &amp; Mothercare nutrition and learning programme also incorporating the free Midday Meal Scheme.
* Nursery: Nursery level activities help children reach crucial developmental milestones, thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities. The age range for admission in nursery is 3 to 4 years.
* Lower Kindergarten (LKG): Also known as the junior kindergarten (jr. kg) stage. The age range for admission in LKG is 4 to 5 years.
* Upper Kindergarten (UKG): It is also called the senior kindergarten (Sr. kg) stage. The age range for admission in UKG is 5 to 6 years.
LKG and UKG stages prepare and help children emotionally, mentally, socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life. A systematic process of preschool education is followed in India to impart knowledge in the best possible way for a better understanding of the young children. By following an easy and interesting curriculum, teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children.

==Primary education in India==

Primary education in India is divided into two parts: Lower Primary (Class I-V) and Upper Primary (Class VI-VIII).

The Indian government places emphasis on primary education, intended for children between 6 and 14 years of age. Since education laws are governed by individual states, the duration of primary school can vary between Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country. Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school teachers in India. there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India. Education has also been made free for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009. While school enrollment rates have increased, many children leave school with poor literacy and numeracy skills. ASER reported in 2019 that only 50% of fifth standard students in rural India could read a Standard II-level text, and only 29% of them could do basic division.

However, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training. Some scholars have used the concept of &quot;visibility&quot; to explain why successive governments have underprioritised investments directed at raising the quality of teaching and education in India relative to investments in building more schools. Building schools is more &quot;visible&quot; to the voting public and easily attributable to the government; training teachers to teach better and raising the quality of education is a more uncertain venture, the success of which is determined by factors outside the control of any one government. This incentivises governments to focus their resources on &quot;visible&quot; areas of intervention.

There have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education Revitalisation Programme (DERP) was launched in 1994 with an aim to universalise primary education in India by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system. 85% of the DERP was funded by the central government and the remaining 15% was funded by the states. The DERP, which had opened 160,000 new schools including 84,000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 3.5 million children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes. &quot;Corruption hurts the poor disproportionately – by diverting funds intended for development, undermining a government&#x27;s ability to provide basic services, feeding inequality and injustice, and discouraging foreign investment and aid&quot; (Kofi Annan, in his statement on the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Corruption by the General Assembly, NY, November 2003). In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.

This primary education scheme has also shown a high gross enrolment ratio of 93–95% for the last three years in some states. Significant improvement in staffing and enrolment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme. The scheme for universalisation of Education for All is the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world. While school enrolment rates have increased, the quality of education received by students remains low. The literature suggests that one of the biggest reasons for quality deficiencies in primary and secondary education is teacher absence and negligence. In one popular study, the researchers made unannounced visits to 3700 schools in 20 major Indian states, where they found that, on average, 25% of government primary school teachers absent every day. In another study, although it was found that three-quarters of the teachers were in attendance in the government primary schools that were inspected, only half of them were found teaching.

==Secondary education in India==
Secondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 88.5 million children according to the 2001 Census of India. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, Intermediate or simply the &quot;+2&quot; stage. The two-halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by boards of education under education ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.

UGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take the standardised exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary School certificate exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate exams. It is further stated that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control.

Secondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Secondary school is split into 2 parts (grades 9–10 and grades 11–12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (colloquially referred to as &quot;board exams&quot;). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11–12 at a secondary school, pre-university programme, or a vocational or technical school. Passing the grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world.

Most schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for example, students in India are often not allowed to take Chemistry and History together in grades 11–12 as they are part of different &quot;streams&quot;). Private candidates (that is, not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for, and take board examinations, but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.

Students taking the grade 10 examination usually take five or six subjects: Two languages (at least one of them being English/Hindi), Mathematics, Science (often taught as three separate disciplines: physics, chemistry and biology; but assessed as a single subject), Social Sciences (consisting of four components assessed as a single subject: history, geography, economics and political science), and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers. Elective or optional subjects often include computer applications, information technology, commerce, painting, music and home science.

Students taking the grade 12 examination usually take five or six subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing subjects from a &quot;core stream&quot; in addition to the language: Science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Biotechnology, Physical Education), Commerce (Accountancy, Business Studies, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Informatics Practices, Marketing, Retail, Financial Market Management), or Humanities (History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography, Legal Studies, Fine Arts, Music, Dance) depending on the school. Students with the Science stream study mathematics up to single-variable calculus in grade 12.

Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India. Popular entrance tests include JEE, NEET and the recent CUET.

==Higher education in India==
Students may opt for vocational education or university education.

=== Vocational education ===
India&#x27;s All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) reported, in 2013, that there are more than 4,599 vocational institutions that offer degrees, diploma and post-diploma in architecture, engineering, hotel management, infrastructure, pharmacy, technology, town services and others. There were 1,740,000 students enrolled in these schools. Total annual intake capacity for technical diplomas and degrees exceeded 3.4 million in 2012.

According to the University Grants Commission (UGC) total enrolment in Science, Medicine, Agriculture and Engineering crossed 65 lakh in 2010. The number of women choosing engineering has more than doubled since 2001.

=== Tertiary education ===


After passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the Standard 12 examination), students may enroll in general degree programmes such as bachelor&#x27;s degree (graduation) in arts, commerce or science, or professional degree programme such as engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and law graduates. India&#x27;s higher education system is the third largest in the world, after China and the United States. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission (India) (UGC), which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps co-ordinate between the centre and the state up to Post graduation and Doctorate (PhD). Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 12 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission.

, India has 152 central universities, 316 state universities, and 191 private universities. Other institutions include 33,623 colleges, including 1,800 exclusive women&#x27;s colleges, functioning under these universities and institutions, and 12,748 Institutions offering Diploma Courses. The emphasis in the tertiary level of education lies on science and technology. Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted of a large number of technology institutes. Distance learning is also a feature of the Indian higher education system. The Government has launched Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan to provide strategic funding to State higher and technical institutions. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it.

Some institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of under-graduate education in engineering. Several other institutes of fundamental research such as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) are also acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics. However, India has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector.

Besides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen &amp; politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of a lack of a solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.

The Government of India is aware of the plight of higher education sector and has been trying to bring reforms, however, 15 bills are still awaiting discussion and approval in the Parliament. One of the most talked about bill is Foreign Universities Bill, which is supposed to facilitate entry of foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The bill is still under discussion and even if it gets passed, its feasibility and effectiveness is questionable as it misses the context, diversity and segment of international foreign institutions interested in India. One of the approaches to make internationalisation of Indian higher education effective is to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy which aims at infusing excellence, bringing institutional diversity and aids in capacity building.

Three Indian universities were listed in the Times Higher Education list of the world&#x27;s top 200 universities – Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, and Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2005 and 2006. Six Indian Institutes of Technology and the Birla Institute of Technology and Science—Pilani were listed among the top 20 science and technology schools in Asia by &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. The Indian School of Business situated in Hyderabad was ranked number 12 in global MBA rankings by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; of London in 2010 while the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has been recognised as a global leader in medical research and treatment. The University of Mumbai was ranked 41 among the Top 50 Engineering Schools of the world by America&#x27;s news broadcasting firm Business Insider in 2012 and was the only university in the list from the five emerging BRICS nations viz Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It was ranked at 62 in the QS BRICS University rankings for 2013 and was India&#x27;s 3rd best Multi-Disciplinary University in the QS University ranking of Indian Universities after University of Calcutta and Delhi University. In April 2015, IIT Bombay launched the first U.S.-India joint EMBA programme alongside Washington University in St. Louis.

=== Technical education ===
From the first Five-year Plan onwards, India&#x27;s emphasis was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined manpower. India&#x27;s National Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation and development of higher technical education, which came into being as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian parliament. At the central level, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, the National Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology are deemed of national importance.

The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are among the nation&#x27;s premier education facilities.

 The UGC has inter-university centers at a number of locations throughout India to promote common research, e.g. the Nuclear Science Centre at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Besides there are some British established colleges such as Harcourt Butler Technological Institute situated in Kanpur and King George Medical University situated in Lucknow which are important centre of higher education.

In addition to above institutes, efforts towards the enhancement of technical education are supplemented by a number of recognised Professional Engineering Societies such as:

# Institution of Engineers (India)
# Institution of Civil Engineers (India)
# Institution of Mechanical Engineers (India)
# Institution of Chemical Engineering (India)
# Institution of Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineers (India)
# Indian Institute of Metals
# Institution of Industrial Engineers (India)
# Institute of Town Planners (India)
# Indian Institute of Architects
that conduct Engineering/Technical Examinations at different levels (Degree and diploma) for working professionals desirous of improving their technical qualifications.

The number of graduates from technical colleges increased to over 700,000 in 2011, compared to 550,000 in FY 2010. However, according to one study, 75% of technical graduates and more than 85% of general graduates lack the skills needed in India&#x27;s most demanding and high-growth global industries such as Information Technology (IT). In 2009, less than 1% of India&#x27;s labour pool was employed in the Indian IT industry (about 2.3 million people). That number has almost doubled as of 2023, with around 5.4 million people estimated to be employed in IT, however, given the rapid population growth in India, this still accounts for only 0.4% of the Indian labour pool. Given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering, science and mathematics, India faces challenges balancing the huge demand for employment with the need to ensure quality graduates.

== Schooling system ==
Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is, both the Central Government of India and the state governments are responsible for enacting and implementing education policy.
The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the &quot;10+2&quot; pattern of education. In this pattern, the first 10 years of a student&#x27;s education is spent in schools, and the latter two years are in junior colleges (as they are known in the state of Maharashtra) or higher secondary schools (in most other states). Students wishing to pursue further education undergo 3 years of study for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years of Higher Secondary Schools or Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.

There are two types of educational institutions in India, 1) Recognised institutions – primary school, secondary school, special schools, intermediate schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as prescribed by universities or boards and are also open for inspection by these authorities, 2) Unrecognised Institutions, which do not fulfil conditions as stated for the recognised ones.

=== Administration ===

====Policy====
Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system. A significant feature of India&#x27;s secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society. Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India&#x27;s secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing. A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) which is the most recent initiative of Government of India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary education (USE). It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of secondary education up to class X.

====Curriculum and school education boards====

National Skill Development Agency (NSDA)&#x27;s National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), is a quality assurance framework which grades and recognises levels of skill based on the learning outcomes acquired through both formal or informal means.

School boards set the curriculum, conduct standardised exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.

* National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located in New Delhi, India&#x27;s capital city. The council oversees the curriculums for school education across India. The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies. Curriculum bodies that govern state specific curriculum are known as SCERTs.
* State Government Boards of Education: Most state governments have at least one state board that oversees secondary school education. However, some states, like Andhra Pradesh have more than one, while the union territories, such as Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry, do not have a board, and instead share services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 for affiliated schools. The curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English – often considered less rigorous than national curricula such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th and 8th level.
* Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 9 to 12 for affiliated schools and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th levels. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.
* Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 for affiliated schools and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE – Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC – Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE – Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK&#x27;s A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with ICSE and ISC examinations respectively. ICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.
*National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations; the secondary examination and senior secondary examination (All India), and also some courses in Vocational Education. The National Board of Education is run by Government of India&#x27;s Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by the CBSE, designed to provide quality, affordable education, educates students up until the 12th grade. The choice of subjects is highly customisable and the subjects are equivalent to CBSE subjects. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams.
* Hindu, vedic &amp; Sanskrit education: The Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Sanskrit Shiksha Board (MSRVSSB) is a national-level school education board which grants the Veda Bhushan (10th) and Veda Vibhushan (12th) certificates to students of affiliated schools. MSRVSSB certificates are accredited by the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and AICTE as the recognised qualifications for admission into other tertiary institutions for a higher degree. Along with the modern subjects, the students are also taught Hindu scriptures, vedas, upnishads, ayurveda and sanskrit. Govt of India has granted legal authority to MSRVSSB to affiliate and recognise vedic and Sanskrit schools run by other organisations. MSRVSSB is run by the Maharishi Sandipani Rashtriya Ved Vidya Pratishthan (MSRVVP), which already runs several vedic school and MSRVSSB also accredit schools run by other organisations.
* Islamic madrasah: Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with Darul Uloom Deoband or Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama.
* Autonomous schools: Such as Woodstock School, Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry, Patha Bhavan and Ananda Marga Gurukula.
* International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examinations (CAIE): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme or the Cambridge International Examinations (CAIE).
* International schools, which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities).

====Midday Meal Scheme====
The Midday Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India designed to improve the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide, by supplying free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, &quot;Madarsa&quot; and &quot;Maqtabs&quot; supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is one of the largest in the world.

With the twin objectives of improving health and education of the poor children, India has embarked upon an ambitious scheme of providing mid day meals (MDM) in the government and government-assisted primary schools. The administrative and logistical responsibilities of this scheme are enormous, and, therefore, offering food stamps or income transfer to targeted recipients is considered as an alternative.

In a welcome move, Government of India made special allocations for Midday Meal Scheme during nationwide lockdown and school closure period of COVID-19 to continue nutrition delivery to children. However, many experts have differing opinions on ground level implementation of MDM amid pandemic and its actual benefit delivered to school children.

====Teacher Training====

In addition, NUEPA (National University of Educational Planning and Administration) and NCTE (National Council for Teacher Education) are responsible for the management of the education system and teacher accreditation.

===Types of schools===
====Government schools====
The majority of Indian children attend government run schools. Education is free socially and economically for children until the age of 14. An Education Ministry data from 2017 showed that 65.2% (113 million) of all school students in 20 states attend government schools (c. 2017). These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the central government. Example of large center government run school systems are Kendriya Vidyalaya in urban areas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya for the gifted students, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya for girls belonging to vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, and Indian Army Public Schools run by the Indian Army for the children of military personnel.

Kendriya Vidyalaya project, was started for the employees of the central government of India, who are deployed throughout the country. The government started the &quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya&quot; project in 1965 to provide uniform education in institutions following the same syllabus at the same pace regardless of the location to which the employee&#x27;s family has been transferred.
====Government aided private schools====

These are usually charitable trust run schools that receive partial funding from the government. The largest system of aided schools is run by D.A.V. College Managing Committee.

====Private schools (unaided)====
According to a survey an estimate, 29% of Indian children were privately educated in 2014. With more than 50% children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private schooling in cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in private schools.

Most middle-class families send their children to private schools, mostly in their own city, but also at boarding schools. Private schools have been established since the British Rule in India and St George&#x27;s School, Chennai is the oldest private school in India. At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but Hindi or the state&#x27;s official language is also taught as a compulsory subject. Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains. Montessori education is also popular, due to Maria Montessori&#x27;s stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in Chennai were Montessori.

Many privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation &quot;Public&quot;, such as the Delhi Public Schools, or Frank Anthony Public Schools. These are modelled after British public schools, which are a group of older, expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in England.

According to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a multiple of the unit cost of government schools. The reason being high aims and better vision. However, others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families, a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored Court orders for their regulation. Research with children from the same family, in which one child attends private school and the other receives a government education, has found barely any difference in their attainment. This has led some analysts to argue that the better test scores achieved by private schools in general is primarily a result of &#x27;background advantages&#x27; enjoyed by privately educated children because they tend come from wealthier families than their government-educated peers. Such advantages may, for example, include having more educational resources at home.

In their favour, it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama. The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female. There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive in-service training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit.
However, the number of private schools in India is still low – the share of private institutions is 7% (with upper primary being 21% secondary 32% – &quot;source: fortress team research&quot;). Even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free. A study found that 65% school-children in Hyderabad&#x27;s slums attend private schools.

=====International schools=====
, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed India as having 410 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including The Economist.

===Home-schooling===
Home-schooling in India is legal, though it is the less explored option, and often debated by educators. The Indian Government&#x27;s stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home, if they wish to and have the means. The then MHRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere.

===Non-governmental work in education===

NGO work in Indian education broadly spans four areas – piloting approaches to multigrade teaching, making improvements to learning environments, teacher training and support, and creating stronger school-community links.

NGO involvement in education has been crucial in delivering targeted action to under resourced communities, such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, the urban poor, children engaged in child labor, children with disabilities, etc. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) recognised the role played by NGOs in ensuring access to education, particularly for students with disabilities. NGOs contributed to SSA by either leading advocacy movements for persons with disabilities or providing various types of assistance in rural settings for children with disabilities.

Under the SSA, NGOs also engaged in collaboration with the state to reach children excluded from mainstream education, including migrant children, child laborers, dropouts, children living in areas with civil instability and girls. There are 79,960 registered NGOs working in the areas of education and literacy. Partnerships under the SSA can occur through funding by Central and State governments, funding activities by identified National and State Resource Institutions or through participation in community activities of various Village Education Committees.

Grassroots education NGOs often deliver services via local governing institutions such as the Panchayati Raj and emphasise community participation in ensuring quality. The Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation (MVF), established in 1991 to address literacy among child laborers utilised Parent Teacher Associations to disburse seed money for the programme under the supervision of the village Panchayat, which then took issues of staffing shortage and insufficient infrastructure to the State Government. The Pratham Educational Initiative in Delhi and Mumbai works with the Integrated Child Development Scheme to set up and provide support to community-run pre-school centres or &quot;balwadis.&quot; Under the Namma Shaale project in Karnataka, the Azim Premji Foundation identified seven key stakeholders (children, teachers, parents, School Development and Monitoring Committees, Community Based Organizations, Gram Panchayats, and education managers) in their work to establish a framework of school-community leadership.

NGOs also work with the State to enable teacher training. There have been a number of NGO partnerships with local District Institute of Educational Training. The Rishi Valley Institute for Educational Resources (RIVER) has worked with school districts in many Indian states to provide multi-grade, multi-level training approaches catering to the needs of remote one-room schools. The Eklavya Foundation in Madhya Pradesh has been working with the State Council for Education Research and Training since 1987 to train teachers in making learning a joyful experience by emphasising skill development and practical learning in the sciences.

NGOs have historically been associated with non-formal education (NFE) programmes, both in providing alternative pedagogical approaches as well as substitutes to mainstream education. The Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samiti, for instance, emphasises &quot;science and literacy for national integration and self-reliance&quot; and uses approaches such as the Gyan Vigyan Vidyalayas to encourage long-term engagement in literacy.

Studies in NGO involvement in education have criticised the adoption of NGO models into formal schooling as low-cost options that require institutional mechanisms to avoid undermining the State&#x27;s financial responsibility in providing elementary education. The cost‐effectiveness of NGO programmes has yet to be determined. In studies that demonstrate that NGOs are more cost-effective in the Global South, there have been concerns raised that this is accomplished by cutting ethical corners, such as underpayment of NGO workers.

==Open and distance learning in India==
Open schooling refers to a system of education that allows individuals to pursue their education through flexible and extensible learning methods. It is primarily targeted towards students who are unable to attend regular schools due to various reasons, such as work commitments, financial constraints, or other personal circumstances.
The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) is the largest open schooling system in India, operating under the aegis of the Indian Ministry of Education. NIOS offers various academic and vocational courses at the secondary (10th grade) and senior secondary (12th grade) levels. It follows a learner-centric approach and provides education through open and distance learning methods.

Apart from NIOS, some states like Kerala have their own open schooling boards that provide similar opportunities for flexible learning and certification. The certificates and qualifications offered by NIOS or state open education boards are recognised by various educational institutions, colleges, and universities in India and abroad, and hold the same value as certificates obtained through regular schooling.
1.4 million students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance learning.

At the school level, the Board of Open Schooling and Skill Education, Sikkim (BOSSE), NIOS provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. In 2012, various state governments also introduced the State Open School program to provide distance education.

Massive open online courses are made available for free by the MHRD and various educational institutes.
=== Online education ===

Online education in India started during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only a small proportion of the Indian population has access to online education. The MHRD recently launched the &#x27;Bharat Padhe Online&#x27; program.
The Indian government has imposed one of the longest school closures globally as it suffered through multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. These school closures have revealed the inequities between urban and rural populations, as well as between girls and boys, in adapting to online learning tools.
On 4 July 2018, in a landmark reform in the field of Higher Education, University Grants Commission has notified UGC (Online Courses or Programmes) Regulations, 2018. Distance Education Bureau started giving approvals to Higher Educational Institutions to offer Certificate, Diploma and Degree Programmes in full-fledged online mode.

=== Evolution ===
When COVID-19 shut down schools and colleges all over the India, teachers and students had to adjust fast to keep learning going. Online education quickly became really popular and important, helping lots of people keep up with their studies. This change did not just make sure learning did not stop; it also showed how great online learning can be.

== Deaf education in India ==
=== History of education in India for the DHH population ===
India is very diverse with eight main religions, hundreds of ethnic groups, and 21 languages with hundreds of dialects. This diversity has made it difficult to educate deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) people in India for generations.

There is a history of educating the deaf in India, however, there is no single clear approach to their education. This stems from conditions, some similar to those faced around the world, and others unique to India. For example, prior to independence of India, there were not clear laws and protections for the disabled. Since independence, advancements have been made for rights of the disabled, but this has not fully tackled the issue.

Pre-independence there were only 24 schools for the deaf in India, and all of these used an oral approach. The belief was that using sign language would hinder advancements of hearing and speaking in deaf children. Additionally, there was no single Indian sign language, so signs would differ depending on where the school was located.

Post-independence, there are more services and resources available for DHH people, however, challenges with education remain. There are organisations around the country that work to advance the spread and quality of education for the deaf.

=== Education for DHH children ===
Oralism and the use of sign language are two competing approaches to education for DHH people. While oralism dominates in India, which is an approach that encourages speaking and hearing, it is usually not realistic for DHH children.

There is an Indian Sign Language, however, it is not formally recognised by the government and it is not complete or comprehensive. It varies around the country and is not encouraged by professionals and educators. Beliefs of the past that the use of sign language will hinder the potential advancements of hearing and speaking in DHH children remain. In recent years, there has been a notion to encourage the use of sign language in India and teach it in schools. In 2017, the first ISL dictionary was released.

Due to these challenges and beliefs associated with sign language, education for DHH people in India often focuses on teaching children to hear, speak, and read lips, this is known as an oral approach.

In India there are regular schools and special schools. Special schools provide education for children with different disabilities. Special schools can be beneficial to DHH children, and provide a better education than they would receive in a regular school. However, these schools are not available for every deaf child. Sometimes they are located too far from a child&#x27;s home. Another reason a child may have to attend a regular school is if they receive hearing technology. Since India focuses on hearing and speaking for the deaf, hearing technology is encouraged. Once a child receives hearing technology it is believed that they can attend regular schools. Even with hearing technology, DHH children still need special education in order to succeed. This puts them at a significant disadvantage in regular school and can cause them to fall behind academically, linguistically, and developmentally. For these reasons, many deaf children receive poor education or no education at all, causing the illiteracy rate of deaf children to rise.

Education in India in regular schools and deaf schools has problems. Even in deaf schools, sign language is not usually taught and used. Some use a small amount of sign language but all of the deaf schools in India use or claim to use an oral approach. Some deaf schools secretly teach sign language due to the stigma and beliefs surrounding the use of sign language, and disability in general, in India. Children in deaf schools have to try to learn by hearing or reading lips and writing. In hearing schools, the children have to do the same. There are no special accommodations. Additionally, there are not any teachers that use sign language in regular schools (maybe a few in deaf schools), and there aren&#x27;t any interpreters.

There are a couple of hundred deaf schools in India and vocational training is becoming more common for DHH people.

=== Higher education ===
There are no deaf colleges or universities in India. A person&#x27;s education ends with grade school- where they likely were not able to learn. With lack of education, DHH people then have a very difficult time finding a job.

There is one interpreter in one college in India, Delhi University.

==Quality==

===Literacy===

According to the Census of 2011, &quot;every person above the age of 7 years who can read and write with understanding in any language is said to be literate&quot;. According to this criterion, the 2011 survey holds the national literacy rate to be 74.04%. The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females), while 86% of boys and 72% of girls are literate in the 10–19 age group.

Within the Indian states, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93.91% whereas Bihar averaged 61.8% literacy. The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of &#x27;absolute non-literates&#x27; in the country was 304 million. Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in Rajasthan, the state with the lowest female literacy rate in India, average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.

===Attainment===
, enrolment rates are 58% for pre-primary, 93% for primary, 69% for secondary, and 25% for tertiary education.

Despite the high overall enrolment rate for primary education among rural children of age 10, half could not read at a basic level, over 60% were unable to do division, and half dropped out by the age of 14.

In 2009, two states in India, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, participated in the international PISA exams which is administered once every three years to 15-year-old&#x27;s. Both states ranked at the bottom of the table, beating out only Kyrgyzstan in score, and falling 200 points (two standard deviations) below the average for OECD countries. While in the immediate aftermath there was a short-lived controversy over the quality of primary education in India, ultimately India decided to not participate in PISA for 2012, and again not to for 2015 and 2018.

While the quality of free, public education is in crisis, a majority of the urban poor have turned to private schools. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two-thirds of all students attend private institutions, many of which charge a modest US$2 per month.

====Public school workforce====
Officially, the pupil to teacher ratio within the public school system for primary education is 35:1. However, teacher absenteeism in India is exorbitant, with 25% never showing up for work. The World Bank estimates the cost in salaries alone paid to no-show teachers who have never attended work is US$2 billion per year.

A study on teachers by Kremer etc. found out that 25% of private sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers were absent during the survey. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 14.6% in Maharashtra to 41.9% in Jharkhand. Only 1 in nearly 3,000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence. The same study found &quot;only about half were teaching, during unannounced visits to a nationally representative sample of government primary schools in India.&quot;

===Higher education===
As per &quot;Report of the Higher education in India, Issues Related to Expansion, Inclusiveness, Quality and Finance&quot;, the access to higher education measured in term of gross enrolment ratio increased from 0.7% in 1950/51 to 1.4% in 1960–61. By 2006/7 the GER increased to about 11%. Notably, by 2012, it had crossed 20% (as mentioned in an earlier section).

According to a survey by All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) released by the ministry of human resource development, Tamil Nadu which has the highest gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in the country has registered an increase of 2.6% to take GER to 46.9 per cent in 2016–17.

===Vocational education===
An optimistic estimate from 2008 was that only one in five job-seekers in India ever had any sort of vocational training.
However, it is expected to grow as the CBSE has brought changes in its education system which emphasises inclusion of certain number and types of vocational subjects in classes 9th and 11th. Although it is not mandatory for schools to go for it but a good number of schools have voluntarily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the change in their curriculum.

==Issues==
===Facilities===
As per 2016 Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER), 3.5% schools in India had no toilet facility while only 68.7% schools had usable toilet facility. 75.5% of the schools surveyed had library in 2016, a decrease from 78.1% in 2014. Percentage of schools with separate girls toilet have increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 61.9%in 2016. 74.1% schools had drinking water facility and 64.5% of the schools had playground.

===Curriculum issues===
Modern education in India is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving. Anil K. Rajvanshi writes that Indian education system seems to be producing zombies since in most of the schools students seemed to be spending majority of their time in preparing for competitive exams rather than learning or playing. &quot;Preschool for Child Rights&quot; states that almost 99% of pre-schools do not have any curriculum at all. Also creativity is not encouraged or is considered a form of entertainment in most institutions.

The British &quot;essentialist&quot; view of knowledge of the nineteenth century emphasised the individual, scientific, universal, and moral aims of education ahead of the social and cultural. This, combined with the colonial construction of Indian society, designed to preserve the ideological lead of the Empire post-1857, it helped shape the official nineteenth-century school curriculum. The rejection of nationalist Gopal Krishna Gokhale&#x27;s Bill (1911) to make primary education free and compulsory by the colonial administration and English-educated and often upper-caste elite further helped sustain a curriculum that focused on colonial objectives. Holmes and McLean (1989, 151) argues that despite tensions between the colonial view of education and the nationalist postcolonial aims of education, British essentialism grew unassailable roots in India partly because &quot;colonial values coincided with those of indigenous traditions.&quot;

===Rural education===

Following independence, India viewed education as an effective tool for bringing social change through community development. The administrative control was effectively initiated in the 1950s, when, in 1952, the government grouped villages under a Community Development Block—an authority under a national programme which could control education in up to 100 villages. A Block Development Officer oversaw a geographical area of which could contain a population of as many as 70,000 people.

Setty and Ross elaborate on the role of such programmes, themselves divided further into &quot;individual-based&quot;, &quot;community based&quot;, or the &quot;Individual-cum-community-based&quot;, in which microscopic levels of development are overseen at village level by an appointed worker:

Despite some setbacks the rural education programmes continued throughout the 1950s, with support from private institutions. A sizeable network of rural education had been established by the time the &quot;Gandhigram Rural Institute&quot; was established and 5,200 Community Development Blocks were established in India. Nursery schools, elementary schools, secondary school, and schools for adult education for women were set up.

The government continued to view rural education as an agenda that could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India&#x27;s poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results. Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the Rural Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, but the number of students served is small.

Education in rural India is valued differently from in an urban setting, with lower rates of completion. An imbalanced sex ratio exists within schools with 18% of males earning a high school diploma compared with only 10% of females. The estimated number of children who have never attended school in India is near 100 million which reflects the low completion levels. This is the largest concentration in the world of youth who have not enrolled in school.

===Women&#x27;s education===

Women have a much lower literacy rate than men. Far fewer girls are enrolled in the schools, and many of them drop out. In the patriarchal setting of the Indian family, girls have lower status and fewer privileges than boys. Conservative cultural attitudes prevent some girls from attending school. Furthermore, educated women belonging to the upper middle clas are less likely to enter the workforce compared to uneducated women of lower castes. They opt to stay at home due to traditional, cultural and religious norms.

The number of literate women among the female population of India was between 2–6% from the British Raj onward to the formation of the Republic of India in 1947. Concerted efforts led to improvement from 15.3% in 1961 to 28.5% in 1981. By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50% of the overall female population, though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India. Recently the Indian government has launched Saakshar Bharat Mission for Female Literacy. This mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level.

Sita Anantha Raman outlines the progress of women&#x27;s education in India:

Sita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.

The education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country. A higher female literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home, by encouraging and promoting education of children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household. Women&#x27;s lower educational levels is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children. A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level. The survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth.

In India, there is a large disparity between female literacy rates in different states. State of Kerala has the highest female literacy rate of 91.98% while Rajasthan has the lowest female literacy rate of 52.66. This correlates to the health levels of states, Kerala has average life expectancy at birth of 74.9 while Rajasthan&#x27;s average life expectancy at birth is 67.7 years.

In India, higher education is defined as the education of an age group between 18 and 24, and is largely funded by the government. Despite women making up 24–50% of higher education enrolment, there is still a gender imbalance within higher education. Only one third of science students and 7% of engineering students, are women. In comparison, however, over half the students studying Education are women.

===Accreditation===
In 2018, 277 fake engineering colleges were identified. In January 2010, the Government of India decided to withdraw Deemed university status from as many as 44 institutions. The Government claimed in its affidavit that academic considerations were not being kept in mind by the management of these institutions and that &quot;they were being run as family fiefdoms&quot;. In February 2009, the University Grant Commission found 39 fake institutions operating in India.

===Employer training===
Only 16% of manufacturers in India offer in-service training to their employees, compared with over 90% in China.

===Teacher careers===

In the Indian education system, a teacher&#x27;s success is loosely defined. It is either based on a student&#x27;s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher&#x27;s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help them understand their own development.

===Coaching Institutes ===
Increased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India. They prepare students for engineering, medical, MBA, banking jobs&#x27; entrance tests as well as American SAT and GRE. There are also coaching institutes that teach subjects like English for employment in India and abroad.

Private coaching institutes are of two types: offline coaching and online coaching. There are many online coaching centres and apps available in the market and their usage is growing, especially in tier 2 metro cities.

A 2013 survey by ASSOCHAM predicted the size of private coaching industry to grow to $40 billion, or Rs 2.39 trillion (short scale) by 2015.

Kota in Rajasthan is the called the capital of engineering and medical colleges&#x27; entrance&#x27;s coaching sector. In Punjab, English language is taught by coaching institutes for foreign visa aspirants to get the right IELTS score for their applications. Mukherjee Nagar and Old Rajinder Nagar in Delhi are considered a hub for UPSC Civil Services Examination coaching. To compete in these exams, Center and some state governments also provide free coaching to students, especially to students from minority communities.

Coaching classes have been blamed for the neglect of school education by students. Educationists such as Anandakrishnan have criticised the increasing importance being given to coaching classes as they put students under mental stress and the coaching fees add to the financial burden on parents. These educationists opine that if a good schooling system is put in place, children should not need additional coaching to take any competitive examination.

The Indian education system has faced criticism for its emphasis on rote learning and intense examination pressure. This pressure has been linked to cases of mental health issues and student suicides especially in the city of Kota, Rajasthan, amongst those preparing for competitive exams such as JEE and NEET. In 2023, India witnessed a rise in the number of student suicides with Kota, Rajasthan witnessing a record breaking 26 suicide cases in a single year. Initiatives like the National Level Common Entrance Examination (NLCEE) provide students with exposure to various career paths and institutions, guiding them to make informed decisions about their future. By reducing uncertainty and regret in their choices, such initiatives aim to alleviate stress and help students avoid extreme responses to academic challenges.

The Ministry of Education has implemented a new law regulating private coaching institutes to control growing student suicides.

===Corruption in education===

Corruption in Indian education system has been eroding the quality of education and has been creating long-term negative consequences for the society. Educational corruption in India is considered one of the major contributors to domestic black money. In 2021, Manav Bharti University, a private university, was accused of selling tens of thousands of degrees for money over a decade.

===Grade inflation===
Grade inflation has become an issue in Indian secondary education. In CBSE, a 95 per cent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent today as it was in 2004, and a 90 per cent close to nine times as prevalent. In the ISC Board, a 95 per cent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012. CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue &quot;artificial spiking of marks&quot;. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 per cent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more – 10 times higher than in 2004 – and almost 6 per cent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.

==Initiatives==
===Central government involvement===


Following India&#x27;s independence, a number of rules were formulated for the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India. In 1960, a list identifying 405 Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government. An amendment was made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes. The total percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5% with the Scheduled Castes accounting for 17% and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5%. Following the report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as &quot;Dalit&quot;, a Marathi language terminology used by B R Ambedkar which literally means &quot;oppressed&quot;.

The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India&#x27;s educational programmes. Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in &quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya&quot; for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of 7.5% in &quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya&quot; for Scheduled Tribes. Similar reservations are held by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in many schemes and educational facilities in India. The remote and far-flung regions of North-East India are provided for under the Non-Lapsible Central pool of Resources (NLCPR) since 1998–1999. The NLCPR aims to provide funds for infrastructure development in these remote areas.

Women from remote, underdeveloped areas or from weaker social groups in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, fall under the &quot;Mahila Samakhya Scheme&quot;, initiated in 1989. Apart from provisions for education this programme also aims to raise awareness by holding meetings and seminars at rural levels. The government allowed during 2007–08 to carry out this scheme over 83 districts including more than 21,000 villages.

There are 68 &quot;Bal Bhavans&quot; and 10 &quot;Bal Kendra&quot; affiliated to the &quot;National Bal Bhavan&quot;. The scheme involves educational and social activities and recognising children with a marked talent for a particular educational stream. A number of programmes and activities are held under this scheme, which also involves cultural exchanges and participation in several international forums.

India&#x27;s minorities, especially the ones considered &#x27;educationally backward&#x27; by the government, are provided for in the 1992 amendment of the Indian National Policy on Education (NPE). The government initiated the Scheme of Area Intensive Programme for Educationally Backward Minorities and Scheme of Financial Assistance or Modernisation of Madarsa Education as part of its revised Programme of Action (1992). Both these schemes were started nationwide by 1994. In 2004 the Indian parliament passed an act which enabled minority education establishments to seek university affiliations if they passed the required norms.

Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India in collaboration with Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology has also launched a National Scholarship Portal to provide students of India access to National and State Level Scholarships provided by various government authorities. As a Mission Mode Project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), the online service enlists more than 50 scholarship programmes every year including the renowned Ministry of Minority Affairs (MOMA) Scholarships for Post-Matric and Pre-Matric studies. In the academic year 2017–18 the MOMA Scholarships facilitated the studies of 116,452 students with scholarships worth ₹3165.7 million. The National Scholarship continues to enlist scholarship programmes managed by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) and respective state governments.

===Legislative framework===
Article 45, of the Constitution of India originally stated:
This article was a directive principle of state policy within India, effectively meaning that it was within a set of rules that were meant to be followed in spirit and the government could not be held to court if the actual letter was not followed. However, the enforcement of this directive principle became a matter of debate since this principle held obvious emotive and practical value, and was legally the only directive principle within the Indian constitution to have a time limit.

Following initiatives by the Supreme Court of India during the 1990s the 93rd amendment bill suggested three separate amendments to the Indian constitution:

The constitution of India was amended to include a new article, 21A, which read:
Article 45 was proposed to be substituted by the article which read:
Another article, 51A, was to additionally have the clause:
The bill was passed unanimously in the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot;, the lower house of the Indian parliament, on 28 November 2001. It was later passed by the upper house—the &quot;Rajya Sabha&quot;—on 14 May 2002. After being signed by the President of India the Indian constitution was amended formally for the eighty sixth time and the bill came into effect. Since then those between the age of 6–14 have a &quot;fundamental right&quot; to education.

Article 46 of the Constitution of India holds that:
Other provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be found in Articles 330, 332, 335, 338–342. Both the 5th and the 6th Schedules of the Constitution also make special provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

=== Central government expenditure on education ===
As a part of the tenth Five-year Plan (2002–2007), the central government of India outlined an expenditure of 65.6% of its total education budget of i.e. on elementary education; 9.9% i.e. on secondary education; 2.9% i.e. on adult education; 9.5% i.e. on higher education; 10.7% i.e. on technical education; and the remaining 1.4% i.e. on miscellaneous education schemes.

During the Financial Year 2011–12, the Central Government of India has allocated 38,957 crore for the Department of School Education and Literacy which is the main department dealing with primary education in India. Within this allocation, a major share of 21,000 crore, is for the flagship programme &#x27;Sarva Siksha Abhiyan&#x27;. However, budgetary allocation of 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of 356.59 billion for the year 2011–12. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation, the &#x27;Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009&#x27;. In recent times, several major announcements have been made for developing the poor state of affairs in the education sector in India, the most notable ones being those of the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. These announcements were:
(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.
(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.
(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.
(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6–14 years.
(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Midday Meal Scheme.

However, even after five years of the implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country has targeted devoting a 6% share of its GDP towards the educational sector, India&#x27;s performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951–52 to 2.31% in 1970–71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000–01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004–05. There is a definite need to step up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000–2001 to around 9.98% during the UPA&#x27;s rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget. A policy brief issued by [Network for Social Accountability (NSA)] titled &quot;[NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget: UPA Rule and the Education Sector]&quot; provides a significant revelation of this fact. Due to a declining priority of education in the public policy paradigm in India, there has been an exponential growth in the private expenditure on education also. [As per the available information, the private out-of-pocket expenditure by the working class population for the education of their children in India has increased by around 1150 percent or around 12.5 times over the last decade].

==National Education Policy 2020==
The central government of India introduced the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) which is expected to bring profound changes to education in India.
The policy, approved by the Cabinet of India on 27
July 2020, outlines the vision of India&#x27;s new education system. The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. It aims to transform India&#x27;s education system by 2021.

The National Education Policy 2020 has &#x27;emphasised&#x27; on the use of mother tongue or local language as the medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond. It also states that no language will be imposed on the students. The language policy in NEP is a broad &quot;guideline&quot; and &quot;advisory&quot; in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the implementation. Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.

NEP 2020 outlines the vision of India&#x27;s School education system. The new policy replaces the previous National Policy on Education, 1986. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India&#x27;s education system by 2021. As per NEP2020, the &quot;10 + 2&quot; structure is replaced with &quot;5+3+3+4&quot; model. 5+3+3+4 refers to 5 foundational years, whether in an &quot;anganwadi&quot;, pre-school or &quot;balvatika&quot;. This is followed by 3 years of preparatory learning from classes 3 to 5. This is followed by a middle stage that is of 3 years in length and finally a 4-year secondary stage till class 12 or 18 years of age. This model will be implemented as follows:

Instead of exams being held every academic year, school students attend three exams, in classes 2, 5 and 8. Board exams are held for classes 10 and 12. Standards for Board exams is established by an assessment body, &quot;PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development).&quot; To make them easier, these exams would be conducted twice a year, with students being offered up to two attempts. The exam itself would have two parts, namely the objective and the descriptive.

NEP&#x27;s higher education policy proposes a 4-year multi-disciplinary bachelor&#x27;s degree in an undergraduate programme with multiple exit options. These will include professional and vocational areas and will be implemented

* A certificate after completing 1 year of study (vocational)
* A diploma after completing 2 years of study (vocational)
* A Bachelor&#x27;s degree after completion of a 3-year programme (professional)
* A 4-year multidisciplinary bachelor&#x27;s degree (the preferred option) (professional)

=== Conceptual understanding of inclusive education ===
The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the Central Government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India.
The policy approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India&#x27;s new education system. The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India&#x27;s education system by 2021.

Shortly after the release of the policy, the government clarified that no one will be forced to study any particular language and that the medium of instruction will not be shifted from English to any regional language. The language policy in NEP is a broad &quot;guideline&quot; and &quot;advisory&quot; in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the implementation. Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.

Although it may not be appropriate to judge the adoption of a northern concept in the south from a northern perspective, hasty use of such globalised terminology without engaging with the thinking behind it may present no more than empty rhetoric, whatever the context. clearly perceives inclusive education as &quot;...a concept that has been adopted from the international discourse, but has not been engaged with in the Indian scenario.&quot; She supports this view of lack of conceptual engagement through data collected in semi-structured interviews for her PhD research, where she found that: Many interviewees concurred with the opinions reflected in government documents that inclusion is about children with special needs, as reflected by a disabling condition. A handful of others argue that inclusive education should not be limited to children with disabilities, as it holds relevance for all marginalised groups. Though they were quick to accept that this thinking has not yet prevailed. Indian understandings of disability and educational needs are demonstrated through the interchangeable use of several English terms which hold different meanings in the north. For example, children with special needs or special educational needs tend to be perceived as children with disabilities in India, as demonstrated by Mukhopadhyay and Mani&#x27;s (2002) chapter on &#x27;Education of Children with Special Needs&#x27; in a NIEPA government-funded research report, which solely pertains to children with disabilities. In contrast, the intention of Mary Warnock&#x27;s term &#x27;special educational needs&#x27;, coined in the UK in 1978, was to imply that any child, with an impairment or not, may have an individual educational need at some point in their school career (e.g. dyslexia, or language of instruction as a second language) which the teacher should adapt to. This further implies that a child with a disability may not have a special educational need while their able-bodied peers could (Giffard-Lindsay, 2006). In addition, despite the 1987 Mental Health Act finally separating the meaning of learning disability from that of mental illness in India, there is still some confusion in understanding, with the 1995 Persons with Disabilities Act listing both mental retardation and mental illness as categories of disability. Ignorance and fear of genetic inheritance adds to the societal stigma of both. &#x27;Inclusive&#x27; and &#x27;integrated&#x27; education are also concepts that are used interchangeably, understood as the placement of children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms, with the provision of aids and appliances, and specialist training for the teacher on how to &#x27;deal with&#x27; students with disabilities. There is little engagement with the connotations of school, curriculum, and teacher flexibility for all children. These rigid, categorical interpretations of subtly different northern concepts are perhaps a reflection of not only the government tendency to categories and label (Julka, 2005; Singal, 2005a) but also a cultural one, most explicitly enforced through the rigidly categorised caste system.

<text>The Burke and Wills expedition was organised by the Royal Society of Victoria (RSV) in Australia in 1860–61. It initially consisted of nineteen men led by Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke, with William John Wills being a deputy commander. Its objective was the crossing of Australia from Melbourne in the south to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, a distance of around 3,250 kilometres (approximately 2,000 miles). At that time most of the inland of Australia had not been explored by non-Indigenous people and was largely unknown to European settlers.

The expedition left Melbourne in winter. Very bad weather, poor roads and broken-down horse wagons meant they made slow progress at first. After dividing the party at Menindee on the Darling River, Burke made good progress, reaching Cooper Creek at the beginning of summer. The expedition established a depot camp at Cooper Creek, and Burke, Wills and two other men pushed on to the north coast (although dense swampland stopped them from reaching the northern coastline).

The return journey was plagued by delays and monsoon rains, and when Burke&#x27;s party reached the depot at Cooper Creek, they found it had been abandoned just hours earlier. Burke and Wills died on or about 30 June 1861. Several relief expeditions were sent out, all contributing new geographical findings. Altogether, seven men died, and only one man, the Irish soldier John King, crossed the continent with the expedition and returned alive to Melbourne.

==Background==
In 1851, gold was discovered in what was then the Colony of Victoria. The subsequent gold rush led to a huge influx of migrants, with the local population increasing from 29,000 in 1851 to 139,916 in 1861 (Sydney had 93,686 at the time). As a result, Melbourne rapidly grew to become Australia&#x27;s largest city and the second largest city of the British Empire. The boom lasted forty years and ushered in the era known as &quot;marvellous Melbourne&quot;. 

The influx of educated gold seekers from England, Ireland and Germany led to rapid growth of schools, churches, learned societies, libraries and art galleries. The University of Melbourne was founded in 1855 and the State Library of Victoria in 1856. The Philosophical Institute of Victoria was founded in 1854 and became the Royal Society of Victoria (RSV) after receiving a Royal Charter in 1859.

By 1855 there was speculation about possible routes for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line to connect Australia to the new telegraph cable in Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies, and then Europe. There was fierce competition between the colonies over the hypothetical route, with governments recognising the economic benefits that would result from becoming the centre of the telegraph network. A number of routes were considered including Ceylon to Albany in Western Australia, or Java to the north coast of Australia and then either onto east coast, or south through the centre of the continent to Adelaide. The Government of Victoria organised the Burke and Wills expedition to cross the continent in 1860. The Government of South Australia offered a reward of £2000 to encourage an expedition to find a route between South Australia and the north coast.

==Exploration Committee==
In 1857 the Philosophical Institute formed an &quot;Exploration Committee&quot; with the aim of investigating the practicability of fitting out an expedition of the Australian interior. While interest in inland exploration was strong in the neighbouring colonies of New South Wales and South Australia, in Victoria enthusiasm was limited. Even the anonymous donation of £1,000 (later discovered to be from Ambrose Kyte) to the &quot;Fund Raising Committee&quot; of the RSV failed to generate much interest and it wasn&#x27;t until 1860 that sufficient money was raised and the expedition was assembled.

The Exploration Committee called for offers of interest for a leader for the &quot;Victorian Exploring Expedition&quot;. Only two members of the committee, Ferdinand von Mueller and Wilhelm Blandowski, had any experience in exploration. However, due to factionalism, both men were consistently outvoted. Several people were considered for the post of leader and the RSV held a range of meetings in early 1860. Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke was selected by committee ballot as the leader, and William John Wills was recommended as surveyor, navigator and third-in-command. Burke made for an unusual choice as he had no experience in exploration; he was an Irish-born ex-officer with the colonial forces, and later became police superintendent with virtually no skills in bushcraft. Wills was more adept than Burke at living in the wilderness, but it was Burke&#x27;s leadership skills (or lack thereof) that was especially detrimental to the mission.

Rather than take cattle to be slaughtered during the trip, the Exploration Committee decided to experiment with dried meat. The weight required three extra wagons and slowed the expedition down appreciably.

===Instructions from the Exploration Committee===

The Exploration Committee gave Burke written instructions. These included suggestions for the expedition&#x27;s route, but also gave Burke discretion depending on conditions and barriers he might encounter. The instructions were signed by the Honorary Secretary Dr John Macadam and in part advised:

==Camels==

Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world, but by 1859 only seven camels had been imported into Australia.
The Victorian government appointed George James Landells to purchase twenty-four camels in India for use in desert exploration. The animals arrived in Melbourne in June 1860, and the Exploration Committee purchased an additional six from George Coppin&#x27;s Cremorne Gardens. The camels were initially housed in the stables at Parliament House and later moved to Royal Park. Twenty-six camels were taken on the expedition, with six (two females with their two young calves and two males) being left in Royal Park.

==Departure from Melbourne==

The Burke and Wills expedition set off from Royal Park at about 4pm on 20 August 1860, watched by around 15,000 spectators. The nineteen men of the expedition included six Irishmen, five Englishmen, three Germans, an American, and four camel drivers from the Indian subcontinent. They took twenty-three horses, six wagons and twenty-six camels.

The members of the expedition at the time of departure were:

* Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke (leader)
* George James Landells (1825–1871) (second in command, charge of camels)
* William John Wills (third in command, surveyor and astronomical observer)
* Hermann Beckler (medical officer and botanist)
* Ludwig Becker (artist, naturalist and geologist)
* Charles Ferguson (1832–1925) (foreman)
* Thomas Francis McDonough (1834–1904) (assistant)
* William Patton (?–1861) (assistant)
* Patrick Langan (assistant)
* William Brahe (1835–1912) (assistant)
* John King (assistant)
* John Drakeford (assistant)
* James McIlwaine (1834–?) (assistant)
* Patrick Langan (assistant)
* Thomas Brooks (assistant)
* Samla (camel driver, a Hindu from India)
* Esau Khan (camel driver, a Muslim from Kalat) 
* Dost Mahomet (camel driver, a Muslim from Ghazni)
* Belooch Khan (camel driver, a Parsi from Kanpur)

The expedition took a large amount of equipment, including enough food to last two years, a cedar-topped oak camp table with two chairs, pocket charcoal water filters, rifles, revolvers, rockets, flags and a Chinese gong; the equipment all together weighed as much as twenty tonnes.
Committee member Captain Francis Cadell had offered to transport the equipment from Adelaide up the Murray River to the junction with the Darling River to be collected on the way. However, Burke declined his offer, possibly because Cadell had opposed Burke&#x27;s appointment as leader of the expedition. Instead, all of the supplies were loaded onto six wagons. One wagon broke down before it had even left Royal Park and by midnight of the first day the expedition had reached only Essendon, on the edge of Melbourne. There, two more wagons broke down. Heavy rains and bad roads made travelling through Victoria difficult and time-consuming. The party arrived at Lancefield on 23 August and set up their fourth camp. The first day off was taken on Sunday 26 August at Camp VI in Mia Mia.
The expedition reached Swan Hill on 6 September, where Charles Gray joined the expedition. They arrived in Balranald on 15 September. There, to lighten the load, the expedition left behind their sugar, lime juice and some of their guns and ammunition. Burke also dismissed several members of the expedition here, including the foreman Charles Ferguson, citing lack of funds. Ferguson later successfully sued for unfair dismissal. At Gambala on 24 September, Burke decided to load some of the provisions onto the camels for the first time, and to lessen the burden on the horses he ordered the men to walk. He also ordered that personal luggage be restricted to . 

At Bilbarka on the Darling, Burke and his second-in-command, Landells, argued after Burke decided to dump the 60 gallons (≈270 litres) of rum that Landells had brought to feed to the camels in the belief that it prevented scurvy. At Kinchega on the Darling, Landells resigned from the expedition, followed by the expedition&#x27;s surgeon, Dr Hermann Beckler. Third-in-command Wills was promoted to second-in-command. They reached Menindee on 12 October, having taken two months to travel from Melbourne—the regular mail coach did the journey in little more than a week. By this time two of the expedition&#x27;s five officers had resigned, thirteen members had been fired and eight new men had been hired.

==Menindee to Cooper Creek==
In July 1859 the South Australian government offered a reward of £2,000 (about A$243,800 in 2023 dollars) for the first successful south–north crossing of the continent west of the 143rd line of longitude. The experienced explorer John McDouall Stuart had taken up the challenge. Burke was concerned Stuart might beat him to the north coast and he soon grew impatient with the expedition&#x27;s slow progress, often averaging only an hour.

Burke therefore split the group, taking fifteen horses, sixteen camels and the seven fittest men; Wills, Brahe, Patton, McDonough, King, Gray and Dost Mahomet. He also reduced the amount of equipment, with plans to push on quickly to Cooper Creek (then known as Cooper&#x27;s Creek) and then wait for the others left behind at Menindee to catch up. They departed Menindee on 19 October, guided by a Paakantyi man named Dick Barkinji, William Wright (the manager of the nearby Kinchega sheep station) and another local Aboriginal man. Wright was appointed third-in-command and travel was relatively easy because recent rain made water abundant, and the unusually mild weather temperatures exceeded only twice. Wright and Barkinji had also travelled the same way near to Cooper Creek a few months beforehand.

Burke&#x27;s party journeyed via waterholes at Bilpa, Langawirra, Mutawintiji and Wannaminta to the swamp at Torowotto. At Torowotto, Wright, Barkinji and the other Aboriginal guide were sent back to Menindee to bring up the remainder of the men and supplies, while Burke&#x27;s party continued on to Cooper Creek. Aborigines living at Torowotto told them they would meet with opposition from the inhabitants further north.

Guided by another two Aboriginal men, Burke&#x27;s party soon reached Lake Altiboulka (Altoka) and then travelled through the Caryapundy floodplains to the Bulloo River, which was also known as Wright&#x27;s Creek. At the Bulloo, they encountered around 120 Aboriginal residents and at times used their pathways to make their way to Cooper Creek, which they arrived at on 11 November.

==Cooper Creek==

In 1860, Cooper Creek was the outer limit of the land that had been explored by Europeans, the river having been visited by Captain Charles Sturt in 1845 and Augustus Charles Gregory in 1858. Burke&#x27;s party arrived at the Cooper on 11 November and they formed a depot at Camp LXIII (Camp 63). While conducting a ninety-mile reconnaissance to the north of this camp, Wills lost three camels and had to walk back to the depot. A plague of rats forced the men to move camp, so they formed a second depot further downstream at a waterhole. This was Camp LXV (Camp 65), where they erected a stockade which they named Fort Wills.

It was thought that Burke would wait at Cooper Creek until autumn (March the next year) so that they would avoid having to travel during the hot Australian summer. However, Burke waited only until 16 December before deciding to make a dash for the Gulf of Carpentaria. He split the group again, leaving Brahe in charge of the depot, with Dost Mahomet, Patton and McDonough.

Burke, Wills, King and Gray set off for the Gulf with six camels, one horse and enough food for just three months. By now it was mid-summer and the daily temperature often reached in the shade, and in the Strzelecki and Sturt Stony Deserts there was very little shade to be found. Brahe was ordered by Burke to wait for three months; however, the more conservative Wills had reviewed the maps and developed a more realistic view of the task ahead, and secretly instructed Brahe to wait for four months.

== Gulf of Carpentaria==

The journey north to the Gulf of Carpentaria went smoothly, with recent rains making water easy to find and the Aborigines, contrary to expectations, being peaceful. Around 2 February 1861, the group formed Camp CXIX (Camp 119) on the banks of the Bynoe River, an arm of the Flinders River delta, which Wills had noticed to be salty and tidal. Knowing that the sea must be close, but with the ground being boggy, Burke and Wills decided to leave the camels behind with King and Gray at Camp 119 and set off through the swamps to the coast. They followed a path which led to an Aboriginal community with a yam-field and a very large hut. Some of the resident Kukatj men pointed them in the best direction. It is assumed that on 11 February 1861 they may have reached or viewed the shores of the Gulf, but there is no documentary evidence of this. By this stage, they were desperately short of supplies. They had food left for twenty-seven days, but it had already taken them fifty-nine days to travel from Cooper Creek. Burke and Wills rejoined the others at Camp 119 and started the return journey on 13 February.

== Return journey to Cooper Creek ==

On the way back, the wet season broke and the tropical monsoonal rains began. A camel named &quot;Golah Sing&quot; was abandoned on 4 March when it was unable to continue. Three other camels were shot and eaten along the way and they shot their only horse, &quot;Billy&quot;, on 10 April on the Diamantina River, south of what is today the town of Birdsville. Equipment was abandoned at a number of locations as the number of pack animals was reduced. One of these locations, Return Camp 32, was relocated in 1994; the Burke and Wills Historical Society mounted an expedition to verify the discovery of camel bones in 2005.

To extend their food supply, Burke&#x27;s party ate portulaca, a flowering plant. Gray also caught an python (probably &quot;Aspidites melanocephalus&quot;, a black-headed python), which they ate. Both Burke and Gray immediately came down with dysentery. Gray was ill, but Burke thought he was &quot;gammoning&quot; (pretending). On 25 March on the Burke River (just south of what is now the town of Boulia), Gray was caught stealing skilligolee (a type of watery porridge) and Burke beat him. By 8 April, Gray could not walk; he died on 17 April of dysentery at a place they called Polygonum Swamp. The location of his death is unknown, although it is generally believed to be Lake Massacre in South Australia. While the possibility that Burke killed Gray has been discounted, the severity of the beating Burke gave has been widely debated. The three surviving men stopped for a day to bury Gray, and to recover their strength – they were by this stage very weak from hunger and exhaustion. They finally reached Cooper Creek on 21 April, only to find that the depot in charge of Brahe had been abandoned several hours earlier.

== Actions of Brahe and Wright ==

Burke had asked Brahe and the depot party to remain at the camp on the Cooper for thirteen weeks. The party had actually waited for eighteen weeks and was running low on supplies and starting to feel the effects of scurvy; they had come to believe that Burke would never return from the Gulf. After one of the men at the depot, Patton, had injured his leg from being thrown off a horse, Brahe decided to return to Menindee. Before leaving he buried some provisions in case Burke did return, carving a message on a tree to mark the spot.

===The &quot;Dig Tree&quot;===

Brahe blazed two trees () at Camp 65. Located on the banks of Cooper Creek, both are coolibahs (&quot;Eucalyptus coolabah&quot; formerly &quot;Eucalyptus microtheca&quot;) and both are estimated to be at least 250 years old. One tree has two blazes on it; one denoting the date of arrival and the date of departure &quot;DEC-6-60&quot; carved over &quot;APR-21-61&quot; and the other showing the initial &quot;B&quot; (for Burke) carved over the Roman numerals for (camp) 65; &quot;B&quot; over &quot;LXV&quot;. The date blaze has grown closed and only the camp number blaze remains visible today. On an adjacent smaller tree, Brahe carved the instruction to &quot;DIG&quot;. The exact inscription is not known, but is variously recalled to be &quot;DIG&quot;, &quot;DIG under&quot;, &quot;DIG 3 FT N.W.&quot;, &quot;DIG 3FT N.E.&quot; or &quot;DIG 21 APR 61&quot;.

Initially the tree with the Date and Camp Number blaze was known as &quot;Brahe&#x27;s Tree&quot; or the &quot;Depot Tree&quot;, and the tree under which Burke died attracted most attention and interest. However, the tree at Camp 65 became known as the &quot;Dig Tree&quot; from at least 1912.

In 1899, John Dick carved a likeness of Burke&#x27;s face in a nearby tree along with his initials, his wife&#x27;s initials and the date.

=== Wright&#x27;s journey ===

Meanwhile, the mission led by Wright to bring the supplies and men up to Camp 65 was having terrible problems. Wright&#x27;s group had only departed Menindee at the end of January 1861 and made very slow progress due to hot weather and a lack of water availability. They arrived at the Bulloo River in early April with several men in poor health. Wright camped at a large lagoon populated with Galali people, who had made several &#x27;ingeniously constructed fishing dams&#x27; nearby. The Galali made demonstrations for Wright&#x27;s group to get off their campsite, and Wright built a stockade for protection. 

For the rest of April, Wright was stuck at the lagoon, unable to move due to his sick men. Eventually three of the men, Dr Ludwig Becker, Charles Stone and William Purcell, died. Toward the end of the month, a large group of Galali tried to take down the stockade, with Wright&#x27;s group firing upon and dispersing them. A member of Wright&#x27;s party, William Hodgkinson, later produced a painting of this skirmish.

=== Brahe joins up with Wright ===
On 29 April, Brahe&#x27;s group arrived at the Bulloo River after abandoning Camp 65 eight days previously. They united with Wright&#x27;s group and started to head back to Menindee to try and save their remaining men. However, Wright and Brahe decided to make one last quick excursion to Camp 65 to see if Burke had returned. When the two men arrived on 8 May, Burke had already left for Mount Hopeless, and the Cooper Creek depot was again deserted. Burke and Wills were away by this point. As the mark and date on the tree were unaltered, Brahe and Wright assumed that Burke had not returned, and did not think to check whether the supplies were still buried. They left to rejoin the main party and return to Menindee.

==Burke, Wills and King at Cooper Creek==
Burke, Wills and King arrived at Camp 65 in the evening of Sunday, 21 April 1861, finding the Cooper Creek depot deserted after Brahe&#x27;s group had left earlier that day. They found the &quot;Dig Tree&quot; and dug up the cache of supplies together with Brahe&#x27;s letter explaining that the party had given up waiting and left. Burke&#x27;s party had missed them by only nine hours. The three men and two remaining camels were exhausted; they had no hope of catching up to Brahe&#x27;s party.
Burke&#x27;s party rested at Camp 65 for two days, living off the supplies left in the cache. Wills and King wanted to follow their outward track back to Menindee, but Burke overruled them and decided to attempt to reach the furthest outpost of pastoral settlement in South Australia, a cattle station near Mount Hopeless. This would mean travelling southwest through the desert for . They wrote a letter explaining their intentions and reburied it in the cache under the marked tree in case a rescue party visited the area. Unfortunately, they did not change the mark on the tree or alter the date. On 23 April they set off, following Cooper Creek downstream and then heading out into the Strzelecki Desert towards Mount Hopeless.

After leaving the &quot;Dig Tree&quot;, Burke&#x27;s party rarely travelled more than a day, mostly following paths used by the local Aboriginal residents. The region was well populated with Yandruwandha people and they were very courteous to the three explorers, giving them fish, beans called &quot;padlu&quot; and a type of damper made from the ground sporocarps of the &quot;ngardu&quot; (nardoo) plant (&quot;Marsilea drummondii&quot;) in exchange for sugar. One of the two remaining camels, &quot;Landa&quot;, was shot when he became bogged in Minkie waterhole and the other, &quot;Rajah&quot;, later collapsed on 7 May. Without pack animals, it became impossible for Burke, Wills and King to leave Cooper Creek and cross the Strzelecki Desert.

Over the next few days, the party encountered several Yandruwandha communities who gave them a variety of cooked foods, including fish, nardoo, native rats and padlu. They were also given gunyahs to sleep in and the stimulant pituri to chew. Some Yandruwandha even stayed attentive to their fire at night so the explorers wouldn&#x27;t get cold. However, by 10 May these Yandruwandha moved elsewhere, forcing the three men to fend for themselves. They were unable to locate other Aboriginal camps and had to make do for the next two weeks camping next to a nardoo patch, preparing this food themselves.

At the end of May 1861, Burke ordered Wills to return to the &quot;Dig Tree&quot; to deposit some items for safekeeping. During this trip, Wills met with two more Yandruwandha clans who offered their hospitality to him. For about a week, Wills lived with them, sharing a gunyah with a man named Poko Tinnamira and learning some of their language. He became friends with another man called Pitchery, and was supplied with ample water and food. They even de-boned the fish for him before he ate it. By 5 June, Wills left this group to reunite with Burke and King.

While Wills was away, Burke and King had also been well cared for by another group of Yandruwandha. However, when one of them took Burke&#x27;s oilcloth after giving him some fish, Burke ran after him and shot over his head. King had also lined some Yandruwandha up outside the gunyah they were staying in and fired over their heads after he felt threatened by their approach. Burke then went up to another group who had arrived with nets full of fish. He knocked the nets out of their hands and ordered King to fire over them. They ran away and Burke collected the fish left behind. While cooking this fish, Burke accidentally set fire to the gunyah they were in, destroying most of their remaining belongings except for Burke&#x27;s pistol and another firearm.

On 6 June, Wills had returned to Burke and King. They spent the following days trying to find another Aboriginal camp, but unsurprisingly the Yandruwandha had cleared out from the area. Over the next few weeks, the three men subsisted on leftover camel meat and nardoo they prepared themselves. The weather became rainy and cold, and they had little to protect themselves from exposure to the elements. Wills recorded that the nardoo agreed with King more, while he and Burke were starving and feeling the cold.

===Death of Burke and Wills===

Wills&#x27; last entry in his journal was on 29 June, when King and Burke had decided to leave him to look for an Aboriginal camp. Wills had become too weak to continue. At his own insistence he was left behind at Breerily waterhole with some food, water and shelter. Burke and King continued upstream for another two days until Burke became too weak to continue. He died the following morning at a place called Yaenimemgi, his pistol loaded and capped in his hand. King stayed with his body for two days and then returned downstream to Breerily waterhole, where he found that Wills had died as well.

The exact dates on which Burke and Wills died are unknown, and different dates are given on various memorials in Victoria. The Exploration Committee fixed 28 June 1861 as the date both explorers died.

After the deaths of Burke and Wills, King found a two-week supply of nardoo flour at an abandoned Aboriginal camp. He then came across a group of Yandruwandha willing to give him food and shelter, and in return he shot birds to contribute to their supplies. He became more closely united with this clan after he attempted to heal a skin sore on a woman named Carrawaw, and lived with them for around a month until he was found on 15 September by the rescue expedition led by Alfred Howitt.

==Rescue expeditions==

In 1861, five expeditions were sent out to search for Burke and Wills; two commissioned by the Exploration Committee, one by the Victorian government, one by the government of Queensland and one by the government of South Australia. HMCSS &quot;Victoria&quot; was sent from Melbourne to search the Gulf of Carpentaria for the missing expedition, and SS &quot;Firefly&quot; sailed from Melbourne to Brisbane, where they picked up William Landsborough&#x27;s Queensland Relief Expedition. The other expeditions went overland, with Howitt&#x27;s Victorian Contingent Party departing from Melbourne, John McKinlay&#x27;s South Australian Burke Relief Expedition departing from Adelaide and Frederick Walker&#x27;s Victorian Relief Expedition departing from Rockhampton.

===Victorian Contingent Party===
After six months without receiving word from the Burke and Wills expedition, the media began questioning its whereabouts. Public pressure for answers increased and on 13 June 1861, the Exploration Committee agreed to send a search party to find the expedition and, if necessary, offer them support. The Victorian Contingent Party left Melbourne on 26 June 1861 under the leadership of Alfred Howitt. At the Loddon River, Howitt met Brahe, who was returning from Cooper Creek. As Brahe did not have knowledge of Burke&#x27;s whereabouts, Howitt decided a much larger expedition would be required to find the missing party. Leaving three of his men at the river, Howitt returned to Melbourne with Brahe to update the Exploration Committee. On 30 June, the expanded expedition left to follow Burke&#x27;s trail.

On 8 September, the party reached Cooper Creek, on 11 September the &quot;Dig Tree&quot;, and four days later the two Aboriginal members of the party, Sandy and Frank, brought news to Howitt that King had been found, living with the Yandruwandha. Over the next week, Howitt located the remains of Burke and Wills and buried them. Howitt had transported four messenger pigeons with him from Melbourne to release when Burke and Wills had been found. On releasing these pigeons one was immediately eaten by a kite while another stayed close to the camp. Howitt gave tomahawks, knives, mirrors, beads, sugar, flour, ribbons and Union Jack handkerchiefs to the Yandruwandha for their kind treatment toward Burke, Wills and King. Tchukulow, Mungalee and the woman Carrawaw were some of the main people acknowledged by Howitt.

Although King was found in a pitiful condition, he recovered rapidly to complete the two-month trip back to Melbourne. He died eleven years later, aged 33, never having fully recovered his health. He is buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

===HMVS &quot;Victoria&quot;===

On 4 August 1861, HMCSS &quot;Victoria&quot;, under the Command of William Henry Norman, sailed from Hobson&#x27;s Bay with orders to search the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Victorian government also chartered &quot;Firefly&quot; (188 tons, built 1843) to assist with transportation. &quot;Firefly&quot; left Hobson&#x27;s Bay on 29 July and arrived at Moreton Bay in Brisbane on 10 August 1861, the same day as &quot;Victoria&quot;. &quot;Firefly&quot; transported the Queensland party led by William Landsborough, along with thirty horses. The two ships sailed for the Gulf on 24 August 1861.

The ships became separated in a storm on 1 September, and &quot;Firefly&quot; hit a reef off Sir Charles Hardy Islands. The crew were able to free and save twenty-six of the horses by cutting a hole in the side of the ship. &quot;Victoria&quot; arrived shortly afterwards. &quot;Firefly&quot; was repaired and able to be towed by &quot;Victoria&quot;. They recommenced their journey on 22 September, arriving near Sweers Island and Albert River on 29 September, where they rendezvoused with the brig &quot;Gratia&quot; and the schooner &quot;Native Lass&quot;, which had also been chartered by the Victorian government as support. They established a land base on Sweers, after visiting Bentinck Island and finding it inhabited by &quot;hostile natives&quot;.

Using &quot;Victoria&quot; boats, &quot;Firefly&quot; was manoeuvred up the Albert River some to a suitable place to transfer the horses and stores to land.

===Queensland Relief Expedition===
After disembarking from &quot;Victoria&quot; in November, Landsborough&#x27;s Queensland Relief Expedition searched the north coast for the missing expedition. The party proceeded south and, while they found no trace of Burke&#x27;s party, they continued all the way to Melbourne arriving in August 1862. This was the first European expedition to traverse mainland Australia from northern to southern coast. Landsborough named various geographical entities along the way, such as the Barkly Tableland, Gregory River and Aramac Creek. On reaching the Thomson River, they were guided along the best routes by the local Aboriginal people, while at the Barcoo River they had a skirmish with a clan of the Kuungkari, resulting in one of these people being shot dead. In 1881, the Queensland Parliament awarded Landsborough £2000 for his achievements as an explorer.

===Victorian Relief Expedition===
Frederick Walker led the Victorian Relief Expedition. The party, consisting of twelve mounted men, seven of them ex-troopers from the Native Police Corps, started from Rockhampton on 7 September 1861 with the goal of reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 30 October, they came across a group of Aborigines at the Stawell River, killing twelve in the fight that ensued. On 25 November, they found traces of Burke&#x27;s track near the Bynoe River and followed them close to Camp 119 but lost the trail from there. On 1 December they had another encounter with a large group of Aborigines, whom they charged and inflicted a heavy loss upon. On 7 December, Walker met up with Commander Norman of &quot;Victoria&quot; in the Gulf.

===South Australian Burke Relief Expedition===
The South Australian House of Assembly chose John McKinlay to lead the South Australian Burke Relief Expedition, which left Adelaide on 16 August 1861. On 21 October the grave of a European man was found at Lake Kadhi-baeri, about 100km north of Lake Hope on Cooper Creek. It was ascertained that this man was part of a group of three and was killed during a conflict with local Aborigines probably many months previously. Several Aborigines had also been killed, and some of the survivors showed McKinlay their bullet wounds. The dead man&#x27;s two associates had left to the south. In vengeance, the Aborigines had cut off some of the dead man&#x27;s muscle, cooked it and ate it. McKinlay assumed that the dead man was a member of the Burke expedition until he received news a few weeks later that Howitt had found King and the bodies of Burke and Wills. Some sources claim the man to have been Gray. 

The same group of Aborigines later became angry at McKinlay&#x27;s party, surrounding and shouting at them. McKinlay ordered his men to fire several rounds at them, with many feeling the effects. The Aborigines retreated to the lake, where McKinlay&#x27;s men fired at them some more, dispersing them completely.

McKinlay then decided to make exploration the focus of his expedition and headed in the direction of Central Mount Stuart, but was driven back by heavy rains and floods. He then made for the Gulf of Carpentaria, hoping to find &quot;Victoria&quot; still there. By 20 May 1862, McKinlay was around five miles (8 km) from the shore of the gulf, but the intervening country was found to be impassable and he decided to turn east and make for Port Denison on the north coast. On 2 August 1862 he reached a station on the Bowen River, and after resting a few days the expedition reached Port Denison. The party then returned by sea to Adelaide. McKinlay received a grant of £1000 from the government and a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society of England.

== Expedition to recover the remains of Burke and Wills ==
In late 1861, Howitt was tasked with returning to Cooper Creek, exhuming Burke and Wills&#x27; remains and returning them to Melbourne for a state funeral. Howitt and his party left Melbourne on 9 December. After a long stay in Menindee and again at Mount Murchison, the expedition arrived at Cooper Creek on 25 February 1862, camping at Cullyamurra waterhole. From there Howitt undertook numerous exploratory trips into the surrounding area. On 13 April, Wills&#x27; remains were exhumed, and in September 1862, Burke&#x27;s bones were retrieved from the grave that Howitt had dug a year earlier.

For the next six months, Howitt explored the Australian interior before deciding in November to return to the settled areas. On 8 December the party arrived in Clare, South Australia. Howitt and the expedition&#x27;s doctor continued on to Adelaide while the rest of the party followed three days later by train. Burke&#x27;s and Wills&#x27; remains were then taken to Melbourne, arriving on 29 December 1862.

On this expedition, Howitt presented three breastplates commissioned by the Exploration Committee to the Yandruwandha people in appreciation of the assistance they had given to Burke, Wills and King. Breastplates were often issued to Aboriginal people for faithful service to the colonists. One of these plates is in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. The inscription on the plate states that it was presented &quot;for the Humanity shewn to the Explorers Burke, Wills and King 1861&quot;.

== Controversy and blame==
Fairly or unfairly, blame for the deaths of Burke and Wills have been focused on three individuals, namely Brahe, Wright and Burke himself.
Brahe could have stayed longer at Camp 65 were it not for the leg injury suffered by the blacksmith Patton, necessitating the Brahe party&#x27;s departure for Menindee that morning. Patton was to die from complications six weeks later. Burke and Wills discussed catching up with them, but they were too exhausted and decided to wait. 

Wright&#x27;s delay at Menindee and at the Bulloo River subsequently resulted in his being blamed for the deaths of Burke and Wills. In 1963, Alan Moorehead wrote of the &#x27;mystery&#x27; surrounding Wright&#x27;s delay:

An in-depth study of Wright&#x27;s action formed a part of Dr Tom Bergin&#x27;s 1982 MA thesis. Bergin, who recreated the original journey from Cooper Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria with camels in 1978, showed that a lack of money and too few pack animals to carry supplies meant Wright was placed in an unenviable position. His requests to the Exploration Committee were not acted on until early January, by which time the hot weather and lack of water meant that the party moved extremely slowly.

Burke&#x27;s abrasive personality, poor decision making and hostile behaviour to some of his fellow expeditioners and to local Aborigines has also been pointed out as contributing factors to the disaster.

==Cause of death==
Unknown to the explorers, nardoo sporocarps contain the enzyme thiaminase, which depletes the body of vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is probable that they were not preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that Burke&#x27;s party did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.

As a result, it is likely that the deaths of Burke and Wills resulted in part from a vitamin deficiency disease called beriberi. Evidence to this effect is further provided by King&#x27;s account, which revealed that Burke complained of leg and back pain shortly before his death. However, other research suggests that scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.

==Cooper Creek summary==

* Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke, the official date of death adopted by the Exploration Committee was Wednesday, 28 June 1861, but Burke probably died on Saturday, 1 July 1861 at Burke&#x27;s Waterhole, Cooper Creek.

==Aftermath==
The Victorian government held a Commission of Enquiry into the deaths of Burke and Wills. Howitt was sent back to Cooper Creek to recover their bodies.

===Commission of Enquiry===
The Commission was convened on 18 November 1861, and the results of their investigations were presented to both houses of the colonial parliament. It was laid on the table of the Legislative Council on 4 March 1862.

The Commission found that Burke &quot;evinced far greater amount of zeal than prudence in finally departing from Cooper&#x27;s Creek before the depot party had arrived from Menindie&quot;, found the conduct of Mr Wright &quot;to have been reprehensible&quot; and had some sympathy for Brahe, upon whom &quot;a responsibility far beyond his expectations devolved upon him&quot;. The Commission judged that in leaving the depot before Burke returned or further relief had arrived was regrettable, but that Brahe had &quot;acted from a conscientious desire to discharge his duty.&quot;

Subsequent historians have posited that the commissioners were compromised by their close relationships with members of the RSV and failed to question them with the same zeal that was applied to men like Brahe.

===Funeral===
Howitt sailed from Adelaide to Melbourne on the SS &quot;Havilah&quot; with the remains of Burke and Wills in a small wooden box, arriving at Hobson&#x27;s Bay on 28 December 1862. The box was taken to the hall of the RSV, and a coffining ceremony was held on 31 December. This ceremony was delayed because Macadam, who held the only key to the box, arrived late. A locksmith was called but before he could pick the lock Dr Macadam, blaming his own distress for his lateness, finally arrived with the key.

The remains were placed in state for two weeks. Around 100,000 people visited the RSV hall to view the coffins.

It was originally proposed that the funeral should take place at St James Cathedral, but it was decided this would be impractical because of the expected crowds and the difficulty of moving the coffins into the church from the grand mourning vehicle. It was agreed that a service at the cemetery would be appropriate.

The order and carriage of the clergy was discussed with agreement that they would walk in the procession with the Protestant clergy in front, followed by the Roman Catholics. This small example of ecumenism is interesting given the general enmity and divisive sectarianism between Irish Catholics and English Protestants that blighted Victoria&#x27;s history over the previous century.

The state funeral of Burke and Wills was held on 21 January 1863. It was an elaborate affair, with the funeral car modelled on the design used for the Duke of Wellington ten years earlier. It was estimated that 40,000 people lined the streets of Melbourne. Many had travelled from rural Victoria, especially the Castlemaine area where Burke had served most recently as police superintendent.

Burke and Wills were buried at the Melbourne General Cemetery. There the Dean of Melbourne, Hussey Burgh Macartney, conducted an Anglican burial service, but clergy representing various Christian denominations were represented in the funeral procession.

At 8pm that evening there was a public meeting at St George&#x27;s Hall, where Macadam addressed the crowd, and acknowledged the contributions of Ambrose Kyte, Howitt and Commander Norman.

===Legacy===

In some ways the tragic expedition was not a waste. It completed the picture of inland Australia and proved that there was no inland sea. More importantly, each of the rescue parties sent from different parts of the continent added in some way to the understanding of the land it crossed.

In the years immediately following the expedition, monuments to Burke were erected in Melbourne, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Bendigo, Beechworth and Fryerstown. In 1863, when Julius von Haast searched for a crossing from Otago to the west coast in New Zealand, he named two rivers flowing into the Haast River after Burke and Wills.

In 1983, the Burke and Wills expedition were honoured on a postage stamp depicting their portraits issued by Australia Post. In August 2010 Australia Post issued four stamps to commemorate the 150th anniversary.

A silent movie, &quot;A Romance of Burke and Wills Expedition of 1860&quot;, was released in 1918. The plot is fictional and only loosely connected to the historical expedition. In 1957, Anthony Quayle was linked to a proposed film about the expedition written by Ralph Peterson. It was never made. In the 1960s, William Sterling attempted to make a feature film about the expedition that resulted in the short documentary &quot;Return Journey&quot;. In 1970 it was announced a film of the expedition written by Terence Rattigan called &quot;Mr Burke and Mr Wills&quot; would start filming later that year, but no film resulted.

The 1966 stage play &quot;Burke&#x27;s Company&quot; dramatised the expedition.

In 1975 an episode of a BBC documentary series called &quot;The Explorers&quot; featured the Burke and Wills expedition, narrated by David Attenborough (replaced with narration by Anthony Quinn in the later 1976 US broadcast) and directed by Lord Snowdon.

In 1985 the film, &quot;Burke &amp; Wills&quot;, was made with Jack Thompson as Burke and Nigel Havers as Wills. Also in 1985, the spoof &quot;Wills &amp; Burke&quot; was released with Garry McDonald as Burke and Kym Gyngell as Wills.

In 2002 the book &quot;The Dig Tree&quot; by Sarah Murgatroyd was published. This provides a detailed account of the expedition.

In November 2009 the Royal Australian Mint issued two coins, $1 and a 20 cent, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the expedition.

<doc id="293133" wikidata="Q323466" url="?curid=293133" title="Culture of India">
<text>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse nation of India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India&#x27;s languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.

Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural areas.

Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music, and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world. The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language, which resulted in a local English dialect and influences on the Indian languages.

==Religious culture==
Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are all based on the concepts of dharma and karma. Ahimsa, the philosophy of nonviolence, is an important aspect of native Indian faiths whose most well-known proponent was Shri Mahatma Gandhi, who used civil disobedience to unite India during the Indian independence movementthis philosophy further inspired Martin Luther King Jr. and James Bevel during the American civil rights movement. Foreign-origin religion, including Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are also present in India, as well as Zoroastrianism and Baháʼí Faith both escaping persecution by Islam have also found shelter in India over the centuries.

India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different cultures and is the most populated country in the world. The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. Influence from East/Southeast Asian cultures onto ancient India and early Hinduism, specifically via Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on local Indian peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent. They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music. Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travelers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era. To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains. Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India.

India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and other religions. They are collectively known as Indian religions. Indian religions are a major form of world religions along with Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world&#x27;s third and fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers altogether, and possibly as many as 2.5 or 2.6 billion followers. Followers of Indian religions – Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists make up around 80–82% population of India.

India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the lives of many of its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has a large Muslim population. Except for Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram and Lakshadweep, Hindus form the predominant population in all 28 states and 8 union territories. Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam; while only Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep have majority Muslim populations. Christians are other significant minorities of India.

Because of the diversity of religious groups in India, there has been a history of turmoil and violence between them. India has been a theatre for violent religious clashes between members of different religions such as Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and Sikhs. Several groups have founded various national-religious political parties, and in spite of government policies minority religious groups are being subjected to prejudice from more dominant groups in order to maintain and control resources in particular regions of India.

According to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the population of India practice Hinduism. Islam (14.2%), Christianity (2.3%), Sikhism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%) and Jainism (0.4%) are the other major religions followed by the people of India. Many tribal religions, such as Sarnaism, are found in India, though these have been affected by major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and the Baháʼí Faith are also influential but their numbers are smaller. Atheism and agnostics also have visible influence in India, along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other faiths.

Atheism and agnosticism have a long history in India and flourished within Śramaṇa movement. The &quot;Cārvāka&quot; school originated in India around the 6th century BCE. It is one of the earliest form of materialistic and atheistic movement in ancient India. Sramana, Buddhism, Jainism, Ājīvika and some schools of Hinduism consider atheism to be valid and reject the concept of creator deity, ritualism and superstitions. India has produced some notable atheist politicians and social reformers. According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

==Philosophy==

Indian philosophy comprises the philosophical traditions of the Indian subcontinent. There are six schools of orthodox Hindu philosophy—Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta—and four heterodox schools—Jain, Buddhist, Ājīvika and Cārvāka – last two are also schools of Hinduism. However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyarania for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the Śaiva and Raseśvara traditions. Since medieval India (ca.1000–1500), schools of Indian philosophical thought have been classified by the Brahmanical tradition as either orthodox or non-orthodox – āstika or nāstika – depending on whether they regard the Vedas as an infallible source of knowledge.

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalized chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the Common Era. According to philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the earliest of these, which date back to the composition of the Upanishads in the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE), constitute &quot;the earliest philosophical compositions of the world.&quot; Competition and integration between the various schools were intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like Jainism, Buddhism, Śaiva, and Advaita Vedanta survived, but others, like Samkhya and Ājīvika, did not; they were either assimilated or became extinct. Subsequent centuries produced commentaries and reformulations continuing up to as late as the 20th century. Authors who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophies include Shrimad Rajchandra, Swami Vivekananda, Ram Mohan Roy, and Swami Dayananda Saraswati.

==Family structure and wedding==

For generations, India has had a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It is when extended members of a family – parents, children, the children&#x27;s spouses, and their offspring, etc. – live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head of the joint Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them. With the current economy, lifestyle, and cost of living in most of the metro cities are high, the population is leaving behind the joint family model and adapting to the nuclear family model. Earlier living in a joint family was with the purpose of creating love and concern for the family members. However, now it&#x27;s a challenge to give time to each other as most of them are out for survival needs. Rise in the trends of nuclear family settings has led to a change in the traditional family headship structure and older males are no longer the mandated heads of the family as they mostly live alone during old age and are far more vulnerable than before.

In a 1966 study, Orenstein and Micklin analysed India&#x27;s population data and family structure. Their studies suggest that Indian household sizes had remained similar over the 1911 to 1951 period. Thereafter, with urbanisation and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more nuclear-like families.
Sinha, in his book, after summarising the numerous sociological studies done on the Indian family, notes that over the last 60 years, the cultural trend in most parts of India has been an accelerated change from joint family to nuclear families, much like population trends in other parts of the world. The traditionally large joint family in India, in the 1990s, accounted for a small percent of Indian households, and on average had lower per capita household income. He finds that joint family still persists in some areas and in certain conditions, in part due to cultural traditions and in part due to practical factors.
Youth in lower socio-economic classes are more inclined to spend time with their families than their peers due to differing ideologies in rural and urban parenting. With the spread of education and growth of economics, the traditional joint-family system is breaking down rapidly across India and attitudes towards working women have changed.

===Arranged marriage===

Arranged marriages have long been the norm in Indian society. Even today, the majority of Indians have their marriages planned by their parents and other respected family members. In the past, the age of marriage was young. The average age of marriage for women in India has increased to 21 years, according to the 2011 Census of India. In 2009, about 7% of women got married before the age of 18.

In most marriages, the bride&#x27;s family provides a dowry to the bridegroom. Traditionally, the dowry was considered a woman&#x27;s share of the family wealth, since a daughter had no legal claim on her natal family&#x27;s real estate. It also typically included portable valuables such as jewelry and household goods that a bride could control throughout her life. Historically, in most families the inheritance of family estates passed down the male line. Since 1956, Indian laws treat males and females as equal in matters of inheritance without a legal will. Indians are increasingly using a legal will for inheritance and property succession, with about 20 percent using a legal will by 2004.

In India, the divorce rate is low — 1% compared with about 40% in the United States. These statistics do not reflect a complete picture, though. There is a dearth of scientific surveys or studies on Indian marriages where the perspectives of both husbands and wives were solicited in-depth. Sample surveys suggest the issues with marriages in India are similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world. The divorce rates are rising in India. Urban divorce rates are much higher. Women initiate about 80 percent of divorces in India.

Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages. Banerjee et al. surveyed 41,554 households across 33 states and union territories in India in 2005. They find that the marriage trends in India are similar to trends observed over the last 40 years in China, Japan, and other nations. The study found that fewer marriages are purely arranged without consent and that the majority of surveyed Indian marriages are arranged with consent. The percentage of self-arranged marriages (called love marriages in India) was also increasing, particularly in the urban parts of India.

===Wedding rituals===

Weddings are festive occasions in India with extensive decorations, colors, music, dance, costumes and rituals that depend on the religion of the bride and the groom, as well as their preferences. The nation celebrates about 10 million weddings per year, of which over 80% are Hindu weddings.

While there are many festival-related rituals in Hinduism, &quot;vivaha&quot; (wedding) is the most extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life. Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings. The rituals and processes of a Hindu wedding vary depending on the region of India, local adaptations, family resources and preferences of the bride and the groom. Nevertheless, there are a few key rituals common in Hindu weddings – &quot;Kanyadaan&quot;, &quot;Panigrahana&quot;, and &quot;Saptapadi&quot;; these are respectively, gifting away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify impending union, and taking seven circles before firing with each circle including a set of mutual vows. Mangalsutra necklace of bond a Hindu groom ties with three knots around the bride&#x27;s neck in a marriage ceremony. The practice is integral to a marriage ceremony as prescribed in Manusmriti, the traditional law governing Hindu marriage. After the seventh circle and vows of &quot;Saptapadi&quot;, the couple is legally husband and wife. Sikhs get married through a ceremony called Anand Karaj. The couple walks around the holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib four times. Indian Muslims celebrate a traditional Islamic wedding following customs similar to those practiced in the Middle East. The rituals include &quot;Nikah&quot;, payment of financial dower called &quot;Mahr&quot; by the groom to the bride, signing of a marriage contract, and a reception. Indian Christian weddings follow customs similar to those practiced in the Christian countries in the West in states like Goa but have more Indian customs in other states.

==Festivals==

India, being a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, celebrates holidays and festivals of various religions. The three national holidays in India, the Independence Day, the Republic Day and the Gandhi Jayanti, are celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm across India. In addition, many Indian states and regions have local festivals depending on prevalent religious and linguistic demographics. Popular religious festivals include the Hindu festivals of Chhath, Navratri, Janmashtami, Diwali, Maha Shivratri, Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Holi, Rath Yatra, Ugadi, Vasant Panchami, Rakshabandhan, and Dussehra. Several harvest festivals such as Makar Sankranti, Sohrai, Pusnâ, Hornbill, Chapchar Kut, Pongal, Onam and Raja sankaranti swinging festival are also fairly popular.

India celebrates a variety of festivals due to the large diversity of India. Many religious festivals like Diwali (Hindu) Eid (Muslim) Christmas (Christian), etc. are celebrated by all. The government also provides facilities for the celebration of all religious festivals with equality and grants road bookings, security, etc. providing equality to the diverse religions and their festivals.
The Indian New Year festival is celebrated in different parts of India with a unique style at different times. Ugadi, Bihu, Gudhi Padwa, Puthandu, Vaisakhi, Pohela Boishakh, Vishu and Vishuva Sankranti are the New Year festival of different part of India.

Certain festivals in India are celebrated by multiple religions. Notable examples include Diwali, which is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains across the country and Buddha Purnima, Krishna Janmashtami, Ambedkar Jayanti celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus. Sikh festivals, such as Guru Nanak Jayanti, Baisakhi are celebrated with full fanfare by Sikhs and Hindus of Punjab and Delhi where the two communities together form an overwhelming majority of the population. Adding colours to the culture of India, the Dree Festival is one of the tribal festivals of India celebrated by the Apatanis of the Ziro valley of Arunachal Pradesh, which is the easternmost state of India. Nowruz is the most important festival among the Parsi community of India.

Islam in India is the second largest religion with over 172 million Muslims, according to India&#x27;s 2011 census. The Islamic festivals which are observed and are declared public holiday in India are; Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha (Bakri Eid), Milad-un-Nabi, Muharram and Shab-e-Barat. Some of the Indian states have declared regional holidays for the particular regional popular festivals; such as Arba&#x27;een, Jumu&#x27;ah-tul-Wida and Shab-e-Qadar.

Christianity in India is the third-largest religion with over 27.8 million Christians, according to India&#x27;s 2011 census. With over 27.8 million Christians, of which 17 million are Roman Catholics, India is home to many Christian festivals. The country celebrates Christmas and Good Friday as public holidays.

Regional and community fairs are also a common festivals in India. For example, Pushkar Fair of Rajasthan is one of the world&#x27;s largest markets of cattle and livestock.

The women lift &amp; carry other women at many festivals.

==Greetings==

Indian greetings are based on Añjali Mudrā, including Pranāma and Puja.

Greetings include &quot;Namaste (Hindi,Sanskrit and Kannada)&quot;, &quot;Nômôskar&quot; in Odia, &quot;Khulumkha&quot; (Tripuri), &quot;Namaskar (Marathi),&quot; &quot;Namaskara &quot;(Kannada and Sanskrit), &quot;Paranaam&quot; (Bhojpuri), &quot;Namaskaram&quot; (Telugu, Malayalam), &quot;Vanakkam&quot; (Tamil), &quot;Nômôshkar&quot; (Bengali), &quot;Nomoskar&quot; (Assamese), &quot;Aadab&quot; (Urdu), and &quot;Sat Shri Akal&quot; (Punjabi). All these are commonly spoken greetings or salutations when people meet and are forms of farewell when they depart. Namaskar is considered slightly more formal than Namaste but both express deep respect. Namaskar is commonly used in India and Nepal by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists, and many continue to use this outside the Indian subcontinent. In Indian and Nepali culture, the word is spoken at the beginning of written or verbal communication. However, the same hands folded gesture may be made wordlessly or said without the folded hand gesture. The word is derived from &quot;Sanskrit&quot; (&quot;Namah&quot;): to bow, reverential salutation, and respect, and (te): &quot;to you&quot;. Taken literally, it means &quot;I bow to you&quot;. In Hinduism it means &quot;I bow to the divine in you.&quot; In most Indian families, younger men and women are taught to seek the blessing of their elders by reverentially bowing to their elders. This custom is known as Pranāma.
Other greetings include &quot;Jai Jagannath&quot; (used in Odia) &quot;Ami Aschi&quot; (used in Bengali), &quot;Jai Shri Krishna&quot; (in Gujarati and the Braj Bhasha and Rajasthani dialects of Hindi), &quot;Ram Ram/(Jai) Sita Ram ji&quot; (Awadhi and Bhojpuri dialects of Hindi and other Bihari dialects), and &quot;Sat Sri Akal&quot; (Punjabi; used by followers of Sikhism), &quot;As-salamu alaykum&quot; (Urdu; used by follower of Islam), &quot;Jai Jinendra&quot; (a common greeting used by followers of Jainism), &quot;Jai Bhim&quot; (used by followers of Ambedkarism), &quot;Namo Buddhay&quot; (used by followers of Buddhism), &quot;Allah Abho&quot; (used by followers of the Baháʼí Faith), &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot; (used by followers of Judaism), &quot;Hamazor Hama Ashobed&quot; (used by followers of Zoroastrianism), &quot;Sahebji&quot; (Persian and Gujarati; used by the Parsi people), &quot;Dorood&quot; (Persian and Gujarati; used by the Irani people), &quot;Om Namah Shivaya/Jai Bholenath&quot; Jaidev (used in Dogri and Kashmiri, also used in the city of Varanasi), &quot;Jai Ambe Maa/Jai Mata di&quot; (used in Eastern India), &quot;Jai Ganapati Bapa&quot; (used in Marathi and Konkani), etc.

These traditional forms of greeting may be absent in the world of business and in India&#x27;s urban environment, where a handshake is a common form of greeting.

==Animals==
The varied and rich wildlife of India has a profound impact on the region&#x27;s popular culture. Common name for wilderness in India is jungle which was adopted by Britons living in India to the English language. The word has been also made famous in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. India&#x27;s wildlife has been the subject of numerous other tales and fables such as the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and the &quot;Jataka tales&quot;.

In Hinduism, the cow is regarded as a symbol of &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence), mother goddess and bringer of good fortune and wealth. For this reason, cows are revered in Hindu culture and feeding a cow is seen as an act of worship. This is why beef remains a taboo food in mainstream Hindu and Jain society.

The Article 48 of the Constitution of India is one of the Directive Principles which directs that the state shall endeavor to prohibit slaughtering and smuggling of cattle, calves and other milch and draught cattle. As of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. Madhya Pradesh enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence.

Gujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India&#x27;s beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing &quot;If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?&quot;

==Cuisine==
Indian food is as diverse as India. Indian cuisines use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques, and culinary presentations. From salads to sauces, from vegetarian to meat, from spices to sensuous, from bread to desserts, Indian cuisine is invariably complex. Harold McGee, a favourite of many Michelin-starred chefs, writes &quot;for sheer inventiveness with the milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India.&quot;


According to Sanjeev Kapoor, a member of Singapore Airlines&#x27; International Culinary Panel, Indian food has long been an expression of world cuisine. Kapoor claims, &quot;if you looked back in India&#x27;s history and study the food that our ancestors ate, you will notice how much attention was paid to the planning and cooking of a meal. Great thought was given to the texture and taste of each dish.&quot; One such historical record is , (, The Delight of Mind), written in the 12th century. The book describes the need to change cuisine and food with seasons, various methods of cooking, the best blend of flavours, the feel of various foods, planning and style of dining amongst other things.

India is known for its love of food and spices. Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and varied demographics of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories – northern, southern, eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many spices and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is vegetarian, many Indian dishes also include meats like chicken, mutton, beef (both cow and buffalo), pork and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly West Bengal and the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge. Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the Central Asians, Arabs, Mughals, and European colonists. Sweets are also very popular among Indians, particularly in West Bengal where both Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims distribute sweets to mark joyous occasions. There is specifically evidence for early influences from East and Southeast Asian-derived cultural areas, primarily via Austroasiatic (Mon Khmer) groups during the Neolithic period, on certain cultural and political elements of Ancient India, and which may have arrived together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia. A significant number of ethnic minorities in central, eastern and northeastern India are Austroasiatic language speakers, most notably the Munda and Khasic.


Indian cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines across the globe. In most Indian restaurants outside India, the menu does not do justice to the enormous variety of Indian cuisine available – the most common cuisine served on the menu would be Punjabi cuisine (chicken tikka masala is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom). There do exist some restaurants serving cuisines from other regions of India, although these are few and far between. Historically, Indian spices and herbs were one of the most sought after trade commodities. The spice trade between India and Europe led to the rise and dominance of Arab traders to such an extent that European explorers, such as Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus, set out to find new trade routes with India leading to the &quot;Age of Discovery&quot;. The popularity of &quot;curry&quot;, which originated in India, across Asia has often led to the dish being labeled as the &quot;pan-Asian&quot; dish.

Regional Indian cuisine continues to evolve. A fusion of East Asian and Western cooking methods with traditional cuisines, along with regional adaptations of fast food are prominent in major Indian cities.

The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana consists of the Telugu cuisine, of the Telugu people as well as Hyderabadi cuisine (also known as Nizami cuisine), of the Hyderabadi Muslim community. Hyderabadi food is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients while, Telugu food is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Telugu food is rich in spices and chillies are abundantly used. The food also generally tends to be more on the tangy side with tamarind and lime juice both used liberally as souring agents. Rice is the staple food of Telugu people. Starch is consumed with a variety of curries and lentil soups or broths. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are both popular. Hyderabadi cuisine includes popular delicacies such as &quot;Biryani&quot;, &quot;Haleem&quot;, &quot;Baghara baingan&quot; and &quot;Kheema,&quot; while Hyderabadi day to day dishes see some commonalities with Telanganite Telugu food, with its use of tamarind, rice, and lentils, along with meat. Yogurt is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness.

==Clothing==

Traditional clothing in India greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by local culture, geography, climate, and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as sari and &quot;mekhela sador&quot; for women and the kurta, dhoti or lungi or panche (in Kannada) for men. Stitched clothes are also popular such as churidar or &quot;salwar-kameez&quot; for women, with &quot;dupatta&quot; (long scarf) thrown over shoulder completing the outfit. The salwar is often loose fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut. The dastar, a headgear worn by Sikhs is common in Punjab.

Indian women perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi, mehendi, earrings, bangles and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various ornaments made with gold, silver or other regional stones and gems. Bindi is often an essential part of a Hindu woman&#x27;s make up. Worn on their forehead, some consider the &quot;bindi&quot; as an auspicious mark. Traditionally, the red bindi was worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi was worn by single women, but now all colours and glitter have become a part of women&#x27;s fashion. Some women wear sindoor – a traditional red or orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called &quot;mang&quot;). Sindoor is the traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. Single Hindu women do not wear &quot;sindoor&quot;; neither do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may be married. The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups, and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and Muslim preferring the Arabic styles. For men, stitched versions include kurta-pyjama and European-style trousers and shirts. In urban and semi-urban centres, men and women of all religious backgrounds, can often be seen in jeans, trousers, shirts, suits, kurtas and variety of other fashions.

==Languages and literature==
===History===

The Rigvedic Sanskrit is one of the oldest attestations of any Indo-Aryan languages, and one of the earliest attested members of the Indo-European languages. The discovery of Sanskrit by early European explorers of India led to the development of comparative Philology. The scholars of the 18th century were struck by the far-reaching similarity of Sanskrit, both in grammar and vocabulary, to the classical languages of Europe. Intensive scientific studies that followed have established that Sanskrit and many Indian derivative languages belong to the family which includes English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Celtic, Greek, Baltic, Armenian, Persian, Tocharian, and other Indo-European languages.

Tamil, one of India&#x27;s major classical language, descends from Proto-Dravidian languages spoken around the third millennium BCE in peninsular India. The earliest inscriptions of Tamil have been found on pottery dating back to 500 BC. Tamil literature has existed for over two thousand years and the earliest epigraphic records found date from around the 3rd century BCE.
The evolution of language within India may be distinguished over three periods: old, middle and modern Indo-Aryan. The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was &quot;Sanskrit&quot; meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to &quot;Prakrit&quot; – the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. &quot;Prakrita&quot; became middle Indo-Aryan leading to &quot;Pali&quot; (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200–300 BCE), &quot;Prakrit&quot; (the language of Jain philosophers) and &quot;Apabhramsa&quot; (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is &quot;Apabhramsa&quot;, scholars claim, that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, and many other languages now in use in India&#x27;s north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structures similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.
Sanskrit has had a profound impact on the languages and literature of India. Hindi, India&#x27;s most spoken language, is a &quot;Sanskritised register&quot; of the Delhi dialect. In addition, all modern Indo-Aryan languages, Munda languages and Dravidian languages, have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (&quot;tatsama&quot; words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (&quot;tadbhava&quot; words). Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated to constitute roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages, and the literary forms of (Dravidian) Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. Tamil, although to a slightly smaller extent, has also been significantly influenced by Sanskrit. Part of the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, the Bengali language arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages and its roots are traced to the 5th-century BCE Ardhamagadhi language.

Another major Classical Dravidian language, Kannada is attested epigraphically from the mid-1st millennium AD, and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 9th- to 10th-century Rashtrakuta Dynasty. Pre-old Kannada (or &quot;Purava Hazhe-Gannada&quot;) was the language of Banavasi in the early Common Era, the Satavahana and Kadamba periods and hence has a history of over 2000 years. The Ashoka rock edict found at Brahmagiri (dated 230 BCE) has been suggested to contain a word in identifiable Kannada. Odia is India&#x27;s 6th classical language in addition to Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. It is also one of the 22 official languages in the 8th schedule of Indian constitution. Odia&#x27;s importance to Indian culture, from ancient times, is evidenced by its presence in Ashoka&#x27;s Rock Edict X, dated to the 2nd century BC.

The language with the largest number of speakers in India is Hindi and its various dialects. Early forms of present-day Hindustani developed from the Middle Indo-Aryan &quot;apabhraṃśa&quot; vernaculars of present-day North India in the 7th–13th centuries. During the time of Islamic rule in parts of India, it became influenced by Persian. The Persian influence led to the development of Urdu, which is more Persianized and written in the Perso-Arabic script. Modern standard Hindi has a lesser Persian influence and is written in the Devanagari script.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Indian English literature developed during the British Raj, pioneered by Rabindranath Tagore, Mulk Raj Anand and Munshi Premchand.

In addition to Indo-European and Dravidian languages, Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages are in use in India. The 2011 Linguistic Survey of India states that India has over 780 languages and 66 different scripts, with its state of Arunachal Pradesh with 90 languages.

===Epics===
The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa are the oldest preserved and well-known epics of India. Versions have been adopted as the epics of Southeast Asian countries like Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (&#x27;) and 500 cantos (&#x27;), and tells the story of Rama (an incarnation or Avatar of the Hindu preserver-god Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana. This epic played a pivotal role in establishing the role of dhárma as a principal ideal guiding force for Hindu way of life. The earliest parts of the Mahabharata text date to 400 BC and is estimated to have reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century AD). Other regional variations of these, as well as unrelated epics include the Tamil Ramavataram, Assamese Saptakanda Ramayana, Kannada &quot;Pampa Bharata&quot;, Hindi &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot;, and Malayalam &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam&quot;. In addition to these two great Indian epics, there are The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature composed in classical Tamil language — &quot;Manimegalai&quot;, &quot;Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi&quot;, &quot;Silappadikaram&quot;, &quot;Valayapathi&quot; and &quot;Kundalakesi&quot;.

==Performing arts==
===Dance===


India has had a long romance with the art of dance. The Hindu Sanskrit texts &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (Science of Dance) and &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; (Mirror of Gesture) are estimated to be from 200 BCE to early centuries of the 1st millennium CE.

The Indian art of dance as taught in these ancient books, according to Ragini Devi, is the expression of inner beauty and the divine in man. It is a deliberate art, nothing is left to chance, each gesture seeks to communicate the ideas, each facial expression the emotions.

Indian dance includes eight classical dance forms, many in narrative forms with mythological elements. The eight classical forms accorded classical dance status by India&#x27;s &quot;National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama&quot; are: &quot;bharatanatyam&quot; of the state of Tamil Nadu, &quot;kathak&quot; of Uttar Pradesh, &quot;kathakali&quot; and &quot;mohiniattam&quot; of Kerala, &quot;kuchipudi&quot; of Andhra Pradesh, &quot;yakshagana&quot; of Karnataka, &quot;manipuri&quot; of Manipur, &quot;odissi (orissi)&quot; of the state of Odisha and the &quot;sattriya&quot; of Assam.

In addition to the formal arts of dance, Indian regions have a strong free form, folksy dance tradition. Some of the folk dances include the &quot;bhangra&quot; of Punjab; the &quot;bihu&quot; of Assam; the zeliang of Nagaland; the Jhumair, Domkach, chhau of Jharkhand; the Ghumura Dance, Gotipua, Mahari dance and Dalkhai of Odisha; the , and of Uttar Pradesh; the jat-jatin, nat-natin and saturi of Bihar; the &quot;ghoomar&quot; of Rajasthan and Haryana; the &quot;dandiya&quot; and &quot;garba&quot; of Gujarat; the kolattam of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; the &quot;yakshagana&quot; of Karnataka; &quot;lavani&quot; of Maharashtra; &quot;Dekhnni&quot; of Goa. Recent developments include adoption of international dance forms particularly in the urban centres of India, and the extension of Indian classical dance arts by the Kerala Christian community, to tell stories from the Bible.

=== Drama ===
Indian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. Kalidasa&#x27;s plays like Shakuntala and Meghadoota are some of the older dramas, following those of Bhasa. Kutiyattam of Kerala, is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the Common Era, and is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It strictly follows the Natya Shastra. Nātyāchārya Māni Mādhava Chākyār is credited for reviving the age old drama tradition from extinction. He was known for mastery of Rasa Abhinaya. He started to perform the Kalidasa plays like &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntala&quot;, &quot;Vikramorvaśīya&quot; and &quot;Mālavikāgnimitra&quot;; Bhasa&#x27;s &quot;Swapnavāsavadatta&quot; and &quot;Pancharātra&quot;; Harsha&#x27;s &quot;Nagananda&quot;.

===Puppetry===
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; there are references to puppets. Kathputli, a form of string puppet performance native to Rajasthan, is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y. K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, Ramdas Padhye, subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Ramdas Padhye&#x27;s son, Satyajit Padhye is also a ventriloquist and puppeteer. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.

*;String puppets

India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes with jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are therefore the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as &quot;Kathputli&quot;. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed. The string puppets of Orissa are known as &quot;Kundhei&quot;. The string puppets of Karnataka are called &quot;Gombeyatta&quot;. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as &quot;Bommalattam&quot;, combine the techniques of rod and string puppets.

*;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but are often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as &quot;Putul Nautch&quot;. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as &quot;Yampuri&quot;.

*;Glove puppets
Glove puppets are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mâché, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long, flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand, the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb in the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays a &quot;dholak&quot; (hand drum) with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogue, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called &quot;Pavakoothu&quot;.

===Shadow play===
Shadow puppets are an ancient part of India&#x27;s culture and art, particularly regionally as the &quot;keelu bomme&quot; and &quot;Tholu bommalata&quot; of Andhra Pradesh, the &quot;Togalu gombeyaata&quot; in Karnataka, the &quot;charma bahuli natya&quot; in Maharashtra, the &quot;Ravana chhaya&quot; in Odisha, the &quot;Tholpavakoothu&quot; in Kerala and the &quot;thol bommalatta&quot; in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose-leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings. Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean &quot;shadow&quot;. The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called &quot;Koothu Madams&quot; or &quot;Koothambalams&quot;. In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.

During the 19th century and early parts of the 20th century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.
According to Beth Osnes, the &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; shadow puppet theatre dates back to the 3rd century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are &quot;translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms&quot;. The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the required art work, then celebrate the &quot;metaphorical birth of a puppet&quot; with flowers and incense.

The &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on a backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. A complete performance of the epic can take forty-one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as the &quot;wayang&quot; of Indonesia are performed by a single puppeteer for the same &quot;Ramayana&quot; story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque puppets are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.

===Music===

Music is an integral part of India&#x27;s culture. Natyasastra, a 2000-year-old Sanskrit text, describes five systems of taxonomy to classify musical instruments. One of these ancient Indian systems classifies musical instruments into four groups according to four primary sources of vibration: strings, membranes, cymbals, and air. According to Reis Flora, this is similar to the Western theory of organology. Archeologists have also reported the discovery of a 3000-year-old, 20-key, carefully shaped polished basalt lithophone in the highlands of Odisha.

The oldest preserved examples of Indian music are the melodies of the &quot;Samaveda&quot; (1000 BC) that are still sung in certain Vedic Śrauta sacrifices; this is the earliest account of Indian musical hymns. It proposed a tonal structure consisting of seven notes, which were named, in descending order, as &quot;Krusht&quot;, &quot;Pratham&quot;, &quot;Dwitiya&quot;, &quot;Tritiya&quot;, &quot;Chaturth&quot;, &quot;Mandra&quot; and &quot;Atiswār&quot;. These refer to the notes of a flute, which was the only fixed frequency instrument. The Samaveda, and other Hindu texts, heavily influenced India&#x27;s classical music tradition, which is known today in two distinct styles: Carnatic and Hindustani music. Both the Carnatic music and Hindustani music systems are based on the melodic base (known as Rāga), sung to a rhythmic cycle (known as Tāla); these principles were refined in the nātyaśāstra (200 BC) and the dattilam (300 AD).

The current music of India includes multiple varieties of religious, classical, folk, filmi, rock and pop music and dance. The appeal of traditional classical music and dance is on the rapid decline, especially among the younger generation.

Prominent contemporary Indian musical forms included filmi and Indipop. Filmi refers to the wide range of music written and performed for mainstream Indian cinema, primarily Bollywood, and accounts for more than 70 percent of all music sales in the country. Indipop is one of the most popular contemporary styles of Indian music which is either a fusion of Indian folk, classical or Sufi music with Western musical traditions.

==Visual arts==
===Painting===
Cave paintings from Ajanta, Bagh, Ellora and Sittanavasal and temple paintings testify to a love of naturalism. Most early and medieval art in India is Hindu, Buddhist or Jain. A freshly made coloured floor design (Rangoli) is still a common sight outside the doorstep of many (mostly South Indian) Indian homes. Raja Ravi Varma is one of the classical painters from medieval India.

Pattachitra, Madhubani painting, Mysore painting, Rajput painting, Tanjore painting and Mughal painting are some notable Genres of Indian Art; while Nandalal Bose, M. F. Husain, S. H. Raza, Geeta Vadhera, Jamini Roy and B. Venkatappa are some modern painters. Among the present day artists, Atul Dodiya, Bose Krishnamacnahri, Devajyoti Ray and Shibu Natesan represent a new era of Indian art where global art shows direct amalgamation with Indian classical styles. These recent artists have acquired international recognition. Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai, Mysore Palace has on display a few good Indian paintings.

===Sculpture===
The first sculptures in India date back to the Indus Valley civilisation, where stone and bronze figures have been discovered. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed further, India produced some extremely intricate bronzes as well as temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at Ellora were not constructed by using blocks but carved out of solid rock.

Sculptures produced in the northwest, in stucco, schist, or clay, display a very strong blend of Indian and Classical Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman influence. The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved almost simultaneously. During the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) sculpture reached a very high standard in execution and delicacy in modeling. These styles and others elsewhere in India evolved leading to classical Indian art that contributed to Buddhist and Hindu sculptures throughout Southeast Central and East Asia.

===Architecture===

Indian architecture encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, constantly absorbing new ideas. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of its earliest production are found in the Indus Valley civilisation (2600–1900 BC) which is characterised by well-planned cities and houses. Religion and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning and layout of these towns.
During the period of the Mauryan and Gupta empires and their successors, several Buddhist architectural complexes, such as the caves of Ajanta and Ellora and the monumental Sanchi Stupa were built. Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura, Brihadeeswara Temple, Thanjavur built by Raja Raja Chola, the Sun Temple, Konark, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, and the Buddha stupa (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at Bhattiprolu. Rajput kingdoms oversaw the construction of Khajuraho Temple Complex, Chittor Fort and Chaturbhuj Temple, etc. during their reign. Angkor Wat, Borobudur and other Buddhist and Hindu temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.

The traditional system of Vaastu Shastra serves as India&#x27;s version of Feng Shui, influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or Prana in Sanskrit and Chi/Ki in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.

With the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. The Qutb complex, a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the Delhi Sultanate is one of the earliest examples. Fatehpur Sikri, Taj Mahal, Gol Gumbaz, Red Fort of Delhi and Charminar are creations of this era, and are often used as the stereotypical symbols of India.

British colonial rule in India saw the development of Indo-Saracenic style and mixing of several other styles, such as European Gothic. The Victoria Memorial and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus are notable examples.

Indian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or stupa, temple spire or shikhara, temple tower or pagoda and temple gate or torana, have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in East Asia and South East Asia. The central spire is also sometimes called a vimanam. The southern temple gate, or gopuram is noted for its intricacy and majesty.

Contemporary Indian architecture is more cosmopolitan. Cities are extremely compact and densely populated. Mumbai&#x27;s Nariman Point is famous for its Art Deco buildings. Recent creations such as the Lotus Temple, Golden Pagoda and Akshardham, and the various modern urban developments of India like Bhubaneswar and Chandigarh, are notable.

==Sports and martial arts==
===Sports===
Field hockey was considered to be the national game of India, but this has been recently denied by the Government of India, clarifying on a Right to Information Act (RTI) filed that India has not declared any sport as the national game. At a time when it was especially popular, the India men&#x27;s national field hockey team won the 1975 Men&#x27;s Hockey World Cup, and 8 gold, 1 silver, and 2 bronze medals at the Olympic Games. However, field hockey in India no longer has the following that it once did.

Cricket is by far the most popular sport in India. The India national cricket team won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. Domestic competitions include the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Series. In addition, BCCI conducts the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition.

Football is popular in the Indian states of Kerala, Goa, West Bengal and the Northeastern states.The city of Kolkata is the home to the largest stadium in India, and the second largest stadium in the world by capacity, Salt Lake Stadium, as well as clubs such as Mohun Bagan A.C., Kingfisher East Bengal F.C., Prayag United S.C., and the Mohammedan Sporting Club.

Chess is commonly believed to have originated in northwestern India during the Gupta empire, where its early form in the 6th century was known as &quot;chaturanga&quot;. Other games which originated in India and continue to remain popular in wide parts of northern India include Kabaddi, Gilli-danda, and Kho kho. Traditional southern Indian games include Snake boat race and Kuttiyum kolum. The modern game of polo is derived from Manipur, India, where the game was known as &#x27;Sagol Kangjei&#x27;, &#x27;Kanjai-bazee&#x27;, or &#x27;Pulu&#x27;.
It was the anglicised form of the last, referring to the wooden ball that was used, which was adopted by the sport in its slow spread to the west. The first polo club was established in the town of Silchar in Assam, India, in 1833.

In 2011, India inaugurated a privately built Buddh International Circuit, its first motor racing circuit. The 5.14-kilometre circuit is in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, near Delhi. The first Formula One Indian Grand Prix event was hosted here in October 2011.

One of the best known forms of ancient Indian martial arts is the &quot;Kalarippayattu&quot; from Kerala. This ancient fighting style is mentioned in Sangam literature 400 BCE and 600 CE and is regarded as one of the oldest surviving martial arts. In this form of martial arts, various stages of physical training include ayurvedic massage with sesame oil to impart suppleness to the body (&quot;uzichil&quot;); a series of sharp body movements so as to gain control over various parts of the body (&quot;miapayattu&quot;); and, complex sword fighting techniques (&quot;paliyankam&quot;).Silambam, which was developed around 200 AD, traces its roots to the Sangam period in southern India. Silambam is unique among Indian martial arts because it uses complex footwork techniques (&quot;kaaladi&quot;), including a variety of spinning styles. A bamboo staff is used as the main weapon. The ancient Tamil Sangam literature mentions that between 400 BCE and 600 CE, soldiers from southern India received special martial arts training which revolved primarily around the use of spear (&quot;vel&quot;), sword (&quot;val&quot;) and shield (&quot;kedaham&quot;).

Among eastern states, &quot;Paika akhada&quot; is a martial art found in Odisha. &quot;Paika akhada&quot;, or &quot;paika akhara&quot;, roughly translates as &quot;warrior gymnasium&quot; or &quot;warrior school&quot;. In ancient times, these were training schools of the peasant militia. Today&#x27;s Paika akhada teach physical exercises and martial arts in addition to the Paika dance, performance art with rhythmic movements and weapons being hit in time to the drum. It incorporates acrobatic manoeuvres and use of the khanda (straight sword), patta (guantlet-sword), sticks, and other weapons.

In northern India, the &quot;musti yuddha&quot; evolved in 1100 AD and focussed on mental, physical and spiritual training. In addition, the &quot;Dhanur Veda&quot; tradition was an influential fighting arts style which considered the bow and the arrow to be the supreme weapons. The &quot;Dhanur Veda&quot; was first described in the 5th-century BCE Viṣṇu Purāṇa and is also mentioned in both of the major ancient Indian epics, the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; and &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. A distinctive factor of Indian martial arts is the heavy emphasis laid on meditation (&quot;dhyāna&quot;) as a tool to remove fear, doubt and anxiety.

Indian martial arts techniques have had a profound impact on other martial arts styles across Asia. The 3rd-century BCE &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; taught how to meditate single-mindedly on points located inside one&#x27;s body, which was later used in martial arts, while various mudra finger movements were taught in Yogacara Buddhism. These elements of yoga, as well as finger movements in the &quot;nata&quot; dances, were later incorporated into various martial arts. According to some historical accounts, the South Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma was one of the main founders of the Shaolin Kungfu.

==Popular media==
===Television===

Indian television started off in 1959 in New Delhi with tests for educational telecasts. Indian small screen programming started off in the mid-1970s. Only one national channel, the government-owned Doordarshan existed around that time. The year 1982 marked a revolution in TV programming in India, as the New Delhi Asian games became the first to be broadcast on the colour version of TV. The Ramayana and Mahabharat were among the popular television series produced. By the late 1980s television set ownership rapidly increased. Because a single channel was catering to an ever-growing audience, television programming quickly reached saturation. Hence the government started another channel that had part of national programming and part regional. This channel was known as DD 2 (later DD Metro). Both channels were broadcast terrestrially.

In 1991, the government liberated its markets, opening them up to cable television. Since then, there has been a spurt in the number of channels available. Today, the Indian small screen is a huge industry by itself and offers hundreds of programmes in almost all the regional languages of India. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind, some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps enjoy popularity among women of all classes. Indian TV also consists of Western channels such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, HBO, and FX. In 2016 the list of TV channels in India stood at 892.

===Cinema===
&quot;Bollywood&quot; is the informal name given to the popular Mumbai-based film industry in India. Bollywood and the other major cinematic hubs (in Bengali cinema, the Oriya film industry, Bhojpuri, Assamese, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Punjabi and Telugu) constitute the broader Indian film industry, whose output is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced and number of tickets sold.

India has produced many cinema-makers like  S.Shankar, S.S.Rajamouli, Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, J. C. Daniel, K. Viswanath, Ram Gopal Varma, Bapu, Ritwik Ghatak, Guru Dutt, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Shaji N. Karun, Girish Kasaravalli, Shekhar Kapoor, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Nagraj Manjule, Shyam Benegal, Shankar Nag, Girish Karnad, G. V. Iyer, Mani Ratnam, and K. Balachander (see also: Indian film directors). With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.

==Perceptions of Indian culture==

India&#x27;s diversity has inspired many writers to describe their perceptions of the country&#x27;s culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of &quot;Indian culture&quot; is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of &quot;Indianness&quot; extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression &quot;Indian&quot; means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.) Hindu Sanskriti Ankh is an ancient series of books originally from northern part of India highlighting the Bharatiya Sanskriti, that is, the culture of India.

According to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society. This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way, many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 gotra, the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas &amp; sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The patriarch often resolves family issues.

Others have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with C.K. Prahalad by Des Dearlove, author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad – who was born in India and grew up there – claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation. In another report, Nancy Lockwood of Society for Human Resource Management, the world&#x27;s largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India&#x27;s 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.

According to Amartya Sen, the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonial rule over centuries and current Western culture – both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference – real or imagined – between India and the West. There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised descriptions of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren&#x27;t born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:
* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, &quot;a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans.&quot;
* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill&#x27;s historiography thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While a great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.
* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be freer from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, has an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.

The curatorial approach, one inspired by a systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.

Susan Bayly, in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. Bayly notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles.

According to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised. Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India, versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:
There is new debate arising as to whether or not Indian culture is decaying.

<doc id="293137" wikidata="Q603925" url="?curid=293137" title="Duke of Somerset">
<text>Duke of Somerset, from the county of Somerset, is a title that has been created five times in the peerage of England. It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England, using a power granted in the will of his brother in law King Henry VIII.

The only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is Baron Seymour, which is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder&#x27;s precedence is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the Duke of Norfolk).

Several other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: Earl of Kendal (created 1443, extinct 1444), Earl of Somerset (created 1397, forfeit 1461), Marquess of Dorset (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), Marquess of Somerset (created 1397, degraded 1399), Earl of Dorset (created 1441, forfeit 1461), &quot;Viscount Rochester&quot; (created 1611, extinct 1645), &quot;Viscount Beauchamp of Hache&quot; (created 1536, forfeit 1552), Earl of Hertford (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), Marquess of Hertford (created 1640, extinct 1675), Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (created 1641, extinct 1750), Baron Percy (created 1722, separated 1750), &quot;Baron Cockermouth&quot; (created 1749, separated 1750), &quot;Earl of Egremont&quot; (created 1749, separated 1750), and &quot;Earl St. Maur&quot; (created 1863, extinct 1885).

The ducal seat is Bradley House in Maiden Bradley, west Wiltshire, with a secondary estate at Berry Pomeroy Castle, Totnes, Devon. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is All Saints&#x27; Church, Maiden Bradley, adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.

==Creation of Empress Matilda==
William de Mohun of Dunster (?–c. 1155), a favourite of Empress Matilda and a loyal supporter of her in the war against King Stephen (during which he earned the epithet of the &quot;Scourge of the West&quot;), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141. In the foundation charter of the priory at Bruton he describes himself as &quot;Willielmus de Moyne, comes Somersetensis&quot;. The title was not recognised by Stephen or Henry II (Matilda&#x27;s son), and his descendants did not use it.

==Beaufort creations==
John Beaufort (1371/1373–1410) was the eldest son from John of Gaunt&#x27;s marriage to Katherine Swynford. He was created Earl of Somerset on 10 February 1397; on 9 September 1397, following his marriage to Margaret Holland, daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, he was promoted to Marquess of Somerset, and a few weeks later on 29 September 1397 he was created also Marquess of Dorset. However, in 1399, when Henry IV came to the throne, his two marquessates were revoked.

The Commons petitioned the King for his restoration, but Somerset himself objected, stating &quot;the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm&quot;. He was succeeded as Earl of Somerset by his son Henry Beaufort (1401–1418), but his early death left the earldom to his brother John Beaufort (1404–1444). He was created Duke of Somerset and Earl of Kendal on 28 August 1443 and died less than a year later on 27 May 1444, perhaps by suicide. The Dukedom of Somerset and Earldom of Kendal became extinct.

The Earldom of Somerset passed to his brother Edmund Beaufort, Count of Mortain (c.1406–1455). Edmund had been created Earl of Dorset on 18 August 1442 and Marquess of Dorset on 24 June 1443. He was created Duke of Somerset under a new creation on 31 March 1448. Despite this, he is usually referred to as the 2nd Duke of Somerset.

The second duke was killed at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455 and his peerages passed to his son Henry Beaufort (1436–1464) who had been known as the Earl of Dorset since his father&#x27;s creation as Duke of Somerset. After the defeat at the battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 he fled to Scotland and was attainted on 4 November 1461. All his honours and estates were declared forfeit. His titles were restored to him on 10 March 1463 but he deserted the King and was captured and beheaded after the battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464.

He was unmarried, but his illegitimate son Charles Somerset became the 1st Earl of Worcester. Henry&#x27;s titles were forfeited by act of Parliament; but his brother Edmund Beaufort (c.1439–1471) was styled Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians. After the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471 he fled and took refuge in Tewkesbury Abbey. He was beheaded by the Yorkists, and buried in the abbey church. Upon his death the house of Beaufort became extinct in the legitimate line.

==Royal family creations==
In 1499 Henry VII nominated his infant son Edmund to the dukedom of Somerset at his baptism, but the child, just over a year old when he died, was probably never formally created a peer.

The illegitimate son of Henry VIII, Henry FitzRoy (1519–1536), by Elizabeth Blount, was created Earl of Nottingham, and Duke of Richmond and Somerset on 18 June 1525. He died without heirs on 23 July 1536 so his titles became extinct.

==Earl of Somerset under James VI and I==
Robert Carr (c. 1587–1645), born Kerr/Ker, son of Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehirst, became a favourite of King James VI and I. On 25 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester, and subsequently a privy councillor. On the death of Lord Salisbury in 1612 he began to act as the king&#x27;s secretary. On 3 November 1613 he was created Earl of Somerset. He died in July 1645, leaving a daughter, Anne. His titles became extinct.

==Seymour creation and 17th century claim to revert to Beaufort creations==
Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c.1500–1552), was the eldest brother of Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII, and was thus the uncle of King Edward VI. Henry had created him Viscount Beauchamp &quot;of Hache&quot; in 1536, at the time of the marriage, and Earl of Hertford in 1537. On the death of Henry VIII on 28 January 1547, Seymour was named in the king&#x27;s will as one of his sixteen executors who then formed a regency council to rule during the minority of his nine-year-old son and successor King Edward VI. Seymour was elected head of the council, which on 1 February 1547 appointed him as &quot;Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King&#x27;s Person&quot;, when he became &quot;the most powerful man in England, a king in all but name&quot; and ruled by proclamation.
On 17 February 1547 the Council created him &quot;Duke of Somerset&quot;, which reflected his ancient title as feudal baron of Hatch in Somerset, centred on the manor of Hatch Beauchamp, inherited by his ancestor Roger Seymour (d.c.1361) from his marriage to Cecily Beauchamp (d.1393), the aunt and heiress of John IV de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp (1330–1361). On 10 August 1547 he obtained royal letters patent to bear the augmented coat of arms previously granted in 1536 by Henry VIII to Jane Seymour. Edward Seymour married twice; in about 1535 he divorced his first wife, Catherine Fillol, disowning her and her children, and married Anne Stanhope who bore him nine children. The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy, although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535–1593), whose son was made a baronet &quot;of Berry Pomeroy&quot;. On the failure of the junior male line in 1750, Sir Edward Seymour, 6th Baronet of Berry Pomeroy became the 8th Duke of Somerset, as the patent allowed, and his descendants, seated at Maiden Bradley House in Wiltshire, continue to bear the title today.

Less than two years after losing his position as Lord Protector, his titles were forfeited and he was beheaded on 22 January 1552. He was replaced in the minority government of Edward VI by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, whose pragmatic style contrasted with Seymour&#x27;s mixture of idealism and arrogance.

In 1644 Charles I granted the earldom of Glamorgan to Edward Somerset (1613–1667). He was a descendant of Charles Somerset, the illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. In return for obtaining military help from Ireland he promised Edward the title of Duke of Somerset. Under the Commonwealth Edward was banished from England and his estates were seized. At the Restoration his estates were restored, and he claimed the dukedom of Somerset as promised to him by Charles I. However, this claim was rejected by the House of Lords, and so was the title of Earl of Glamorgan. This enabled King Charles II to restore the ducal title to the fourth creation family, the Seymours, who descend from the country&#x27;s de facto regent, the lord protector in 1547.
Edward Seymour (1538–1621) was son and heir of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, from his second marriage. He was created the Earl of Hertford in 1559 under Elizabeth I. His grandson William Seymour (1588–1660) secretly married Lady Arbella Stuart (1575–1615) on 22 June 1610. She was the niece of Lord Darnley, a Stuart, first cousin of James I and bar for James&#x27;s children next in succession to Scottish and English thrones. Both William and Arabella were imprisoned but managed to escape. William fled to Paris, but Arbella was recaptured. She was imprisoned in the Tower of London where she died in 1615. William returned to England shortly after her death and inherited his father&#x27;s titles in 1621. Charles I received his support and made him Marquess of Hertford in 1640 and on 13 September 1660, shortly before his death on 24 October, the title of Duke of Somerset was restored to him as its legitimate heir, following its non-existence for 108 years. He outlived his three eldest sons and as the dukedom descends to heirs male of the holder of the 1547 grant it passed to William Seymour (1654–1671) who was the son of the third son mentioned (lived 1626–1654). The 3rd duke died unmarried and the title passed to John Seymour (bef. 1646–1675) the last surviving son of the 2nd Duke, his uncle. On his death without issue on 29 April 1675 only the Marquessate of Hertford became extinct. His distant cousin Francis Seymour, 3rd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (1658–1678) became 5th Duke of Somerset. Francis was the eldest surviving son of Charles Seymour (1621–1665), whose father Sir Francis Seymour (c. 1590–1664), a younger brother of the 2nd Duke of Somerset, had been created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge in 1641.

When the 5th Duke died unmarried in 1678, the title passed to his brother, Charles Seymour (1662–1748), youngest son of the 2nd Baron Trowbridge. The 6th Duke, known as &quot;the Proud Duke&quot;, was a favourite of Queen Anne. He first married Lady Elizabeth Percy, daughter of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670). She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711–1773), daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at Petworth House, Sussex at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage Algernon Seymour (1684–1750).

;Later subsidiary titles
Algernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir Hugh Smithson, husband of Algernon&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730–1776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693–1731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.

;Later descent
Sir Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy (1694–1757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556–1613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535–1593) who was the 1st Duke&#x27;s eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (née Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the House of Commons during the reign of Charles II and he moved the family home from Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon to Bradley House in Maiden Bradley.

Upon this Duke&#x27;s death he was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Seymour (1717–1792). He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother Webb Seymour (1718–1793) who became the 10th Duke. His son Edward Adolphus Seymour (1775–1855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father&#x27;s death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.

==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==

The 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Adolphus Seymour (1804–1885) who was created Earl St. Maur, of Berry Pomeroy in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him Edward A. F. Seymour (1835–1869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted &quot;Earl St. Maur&quot;. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined Garibaldi&#x27;s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near Brighton. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named Ruth (1867–1953) was born whilst the couple were in Tangier and a boy named Richard &#x27;Harold&#x27; St. Maur (1869–1927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl married Rosina, Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather&#x27;s dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of £50 (equal to about £ today) for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.

==13th–19th dukes==
The 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour (1810–1891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur (1813–1894) became the 14th Duke. Three and a half years later he was dead. His son Algernon Seymour (1846–1923) became the 15th Duke.

He died without children and the title passed to his distant cousin Edward Hamilton Seymour (1860–1931), great-great-grandson of Lord Francis Seymour, Dean of Wells (1726–1799), youngest son of the 8th Duke. He was succeeded by his son Evelyn Francis Seymour (1882–1954) who passed the title on to his son Percy Hamilton Seymour (1910–1984). The title is currently held by his son John Michael Edward Seymour who was born in 1952. The current heir to the title is Sebastian Seymour, Lord Seymour who was born in 1982.

<doc id="293150" wikidata="Q494394" url="?curid=293150" title="Hangul Day">
<text>The Korean Alphabet Day, known as Hangeul Day () in South Korea, and Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl Day () in North Korea, is a national Korean commemorative day marking the invention and proclamation of Hangul, the Korean alphabet, by the 15th-century King Sejong the Great. It is observed on October 9 in South Korea and January 15th in North Korea. Excluding the years 1990 to 2012, when the government maximized business days to expedite industrial growth, Hangul Day has been a national holiday in South Korea since 1970.

==Synopsis==
October 9 is dedicated to spreading information and use of Hangul. Because Hangul is one of the few writing systems where both the founder and the founding date are known, the day is also dedicated to commemorating the achievements of King Sejong. The Government of South Korea legislated an amendment regarding the holiday:

The holiday is celebrated in both South and North Korea. In the south the holiday is formally known as Hangeul Proclamation Day, or Hangeul Day for short, and is celebrated on October 9 to commemorate the promulgation of the Hunminjeongeum on October 9, 1446. In the north the holiday is formally known as Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl Day, and is celebrated on January 15 to commemorate the creation of the Hunminjeongeum on January 15, 1444.

The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China has also designated September 2 as the official &quot;Day of the Korean Language&quot; since 2014.

==History==

Before the creation of Hangul, people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predated Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters needed to be learned, there was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn&#x27;t have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common people. Hangul Proclamation Day has been celebrated annually in South Korea on October 9 since 1970. However, this does not include the period from 1990 to 2012 since people were required to work for their businesses on this day instead of taking time off. It is also celebrated in North Korea on January 15. Despite all of Hangul&#x27;s benefits, it nearly went out of existence during the Joseon dynasty. The elite of the time wanting to preserve their status saw Chinese characters as the only true way to write Korean. In the early 16th century, Hangul was effectively banned by the king. However, Hangul had a resurgence in the 19th century, and gradually grew more and more common, especially due to its role in Korean nationalism during the era of Japanese occupation. By the 1970s the use of Chinese characters declined, and these days, almost all Korean is written in Hangul.

According to the &quot;Sejong Sillok&quot; (), King Sejong proclaimed publication of &quot;Hunmin Jeongeum&quot; (), the document introducing the newly created alphabet which was also originally called by the same name, in the ninth month of the lunar calendar in 1446. In 1926, the Korean Language Society, whose goal was to preserve the Korean language during a time of rapid forced Japanization, celebrated the octosexigesimal (68th) anniversary of the declaration of hangeul on the last day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, which is on November 4 of the Gregorian calendar. Members of the Society declared it the first observance of &quot;Gagyanal&quot; (). The name came from &quot;Gagyageul&quot; (), an early colloquial name for hangeul, based on a mnemonic recitation beginning &quot;gagya geogyeo...&quot; (). The name of the commemorative day was changed to &quot;Hangullal&quot; in 1928, soon after the term &quot;hangul&quot;, coined originally in 1913 by Ju Sigyeong, became widely accepted as the new name for the alphabet. The day was then celebrated according to the lunar calendar.

In 1931, the celebration of the day was switched to October 29 of the Gregorian Calendar, the calendar which is in contemporary use. Three years later, the date was moved to October 28, to coordinate the date with that of the Julian Calendar, which had been in use during the 15th century, when King Sejong had made his proclamation.

The discovery in 1940 of an original copy of the &quot;Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye&quot;, a volume of commentary to the &quot;Hunmin Jeongeum&quot; that appeared not long after the document it commented upon, revealed that the &quot;Hunmin Jeongeum&quot; was announced during the first ten days (&quot;sangsun&quot;; ) of the ninth month. The tenth day of the ninth month of the 1446 lunar calendar was equivalent to October 9 of that same year&#x27;s Julian calendar. The South Korean government, established in 1945, declared October 9 to be Hangeul Day, a yearly legal holiday which excused government employees from work.

Major employers pressured the South Korean government to increase the country&#x27;s annual number of work days. In 1991, to balance out the adoption of the United Nations Day, it vacated Hangeul Day&#x27;s status as a holiday. By law, Hangeul Day remained a national commemoration day, and the Hangeul Society campaigned for the holiday&#x27;s restoration. On November 1, 2012, the Society won that campaign, when the National Assembly voted 189 to 4 (with 4 abstaining) in favor of a resolution that called for the return of Hangeul Day as a national holiday. This put pressure on the Lee Myung Bak administration, which applied the change in 2013.

==Celebrations==
In 2009, a heavy bronze statue of King Sejong was revealed to the public Sejongno, Gwanghwamun Plaza in central Seoul, South Korea. It towers over citizens and tourists at approximately 6.2 metres (20.3 feet) high. Underneath the large golden statue there is a museum, which many people visit on Hangul Day. Inside the museum there are many exhibits explaining the creation of the alphabet and technological advancements made during King Sejong&#x27;s reign.

<doc id="293159" wikidata="Q12614595" url="?curid=293159" title="Mithra">
<text>Mithra ( ; ) is an ancient Iranian deity (&quot;yazata&quot;) of covenants, light, oaths, justice, the Sun, contracts, and friendship. In addition to being the divinity of contracts, Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing protector of Truth (&quot;Asha&quot;), and the guardian of cattle, the harvest, and the Waters. 

The Romans attributed their Mithraic mysteries to Zoroastrian Persian sources relating to Mithra. Since the early 1970s, the dominant scholarship has noted dissimilarities between the Persian and Roman traditions, making it, at most, the result of Roman &quot;perceptions&quot; of Zoroastrian ideas.

==Etymology==
Together with the Vedic common noun &quot;mitra&quot;, the Avestan common noun &quot;miθra&quot; derives from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*mitrám&quot; (Mitra), from the root &quot;*mi-&quot; &quot;to bind&quot;, with the &quot;tool suffix&quot; &quot;-tra-&quot; &quot;causing to&quot;. Thus, etymologically &quot;mitra&quot;/&quot;miθra&quot; means &quot;that which causes binding&quot;, preserved in the Avestan word for &quot;Covenant, Contract, Oath&quot;.

In Middle Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian etc.), &quot;miθra&quot; became &quot;mihr&quot;, from which New Persian &quot;mehr&quot; and Armenian &quot;Mihr&quot; and &quot;Mher&quot; ultimately derive.

==In scripture==
Like most other divinities, Mithra is not mentioned by name in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and traditionally attributed to Zoroaster himself, or by name in the &quot;Yasna Haptanghaiti&quot;, a seven-verse section of the Yasna liturgy that is linguistically as old as the Gathas. As a member of the Iranian ahuric triad, along with Ahura Mazda and Ahura Berezaiti (Apam Napat), Mithra is an exalted figure. Together with Rashnu &quot;Justice&quot; and Sraosha &quot;Obedience&quot;, Mithra is one of the three judges at the Chinvat Bridge, the &quot;Bridge of Separation&quot; that all souls must cross. Unlike Sraosha, however, Mithra is not a psychopomp, a guide of souls to the place of the dead. Should the Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds outweigh the Bad, Sraosha alone conveys the Soul across the Bridge.

As the god of contract, Mithra is undeceivable, infallible, eternally watchful, and never-resting. Mithra is additionally the protector of cattle, and his stock epithet is &quot;of Wide Pastures.&quot; He is guardian of the waters and ensures that those pastures receive enough of it.

The lack of Mithra&#x27;s presence in the texts was once a cause of some consternation amongst Iranians. An often repeated speculation of the first half of the 20th century was that the lack of any mention (i.e., Zoroaster&#x27;s silence) of Mithra in these texts implied that Zoroaster had rejected Mithra. This &quot;ex silentio&quot; speculation is no longer followed. Building on that speculation was another series of speculations, which postulated that the reason why Zoroaster did not mention Mithra was that the latter was the supreme God of a bloodthirsty group of &quot;daeva&quot;-worshipers that Zoroaster condemned. However, &quot;no satisfactory evidence has yet been adduced to show that, before Zoroaster, the concept of a supreme god existed among the Iranians, or that among them Mithra – or any other divinity – ever enjoyed a separate cult of his or her own outside either their ancient or their Zoroastrian pantheons.&quot;
The Avestan Hymn to Mithra (&quot;Yasht&quot; 10) is the longest, and one of the best-preserved, of the &quot;Yasht&quot;s. Mithra is described in the Zoroastrian Avesta scriptures as &quot;Mithra of Wide Pastures, of the Thousand Ears, and of the Myriad Eyes,&quot; (Yasna 1:3), &quot;the Lofty, and the Everlasting... the Province Ruler,&quot;(Yasna 1:11), &quot;the Yazad (Divinity) of the Spoken Name&quot; (Yasna 3:5), and &quot;the Holy,&quot; (Yasna 3:13). The Khorda Avesta (Book of Common Prayer) also refer to Mithra in the Litany to the Sun, &quot;Homage to Mithra of Wide Cattle Pastures,&quot; (Khwarshed Niyayesh 5), &quot;Whose Word is True, who is of the Assembly, Who has a Thousand Ears, the Well-Shaped One, Who has Ten Thousand Eyes, the Exalted One, Who has Wide Knowledge, the Helpful One, Who Sleeps Not, the Ever Wakeful. We sacrifice to Mithra, The Lord of all countries, Whom Ahura Mazda created the most glorious, Of the Supernatural Yazads. So may there come to us for Aid, Both Mithra and Ahura, the Two Exalted Ones,&quot;(Khwarshed Niyayesh 6-7), &quot;I shall sacrifice to his mace, well-aimed against the Skulls of the Daevas&quot; (Khwarshed Niyayesh 15). Some recent theories have claimed Mithra represents the Sun itself, but the Khorda Avesta refers to the Sun as a separate entity – as it does with the Moon, with which the Sun has &quot;the Best of Friendships,&quot; (Khwarshed Niyayesh 15).

==In inscriptions==
Although there is no known Mithraic iconography in the Achaemenid period, the deity is invoked in several royal Achaemenid inscriptions:

In Artaxerxes II&#x27;s (r. 404 – 358 B.C.) trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian) inscription at Susa (A2Sa) and Hamadan (A2Hc), which have the same text, the emperor appeals to &quot;Ahuramazda, Anahita, and Mithra protect me against all evil,&quot; and beseeches them to protect what he has built.

Although the Behistun inscription of Darius I (r. 522 – 486 B.C.) invokes Ahuramazda and &quot;the Other Gods who are&quot;, this inscription of Artaxerxes II is remarkable as no Achaemenid king before him had invoked any but Ahura Mazda alone by name. Boyce suggests that the reason for this was that Artaxerxes had chosen Anahita and Mithra as his patron/protector Divinities.

Mithra is invoked again in the single known inscription of Artaxerxes III, A3Pa, found at Persepolis. In that inscription, that emperor appeals to &quot;Ahuramazda and the God Mithra preserve me, my country, and what has been built by me.&quot;

==In tradition==


In the Zoroastrian calendar, the sixteenth day of the month and the seventh month of the year are dedicated to and are under the protection of Mithra. The Iranian civil calendar of 1925 adopted Zoroastrian month-names, and as such also has the seventh month of the year named &quot;Mihr&quot;. The position of the sixteenth day and seventh month reflects Mithra&#x27;s rank in the hierarchy of the Divinities; the sixteenth day and seventh month are respectively the first day of the second half of the month and the first month of the second half of the year. The day on which the day-name and month-name dedications intersect is (like all other such intersections) dedicated to the divinity of that day/month, and is celebrated with a &quot;Jashan&quot; (from Avestan &quot;Yasna&quot;, &quot;Worship&quot;) in honor of that Divinity. In the case of Mithra, this was &quot;Jashan-e Mehregan&quot;, or just Mehregan for short.

In Zoroastrian scripture, Mithra is distinct from the divinity of the Sun, Hvare-khshaeta (literally &quot;Radiant Sun&quot;, from which the Middle Persian word &quot;Khorshed&quot; for the Sun). However, in Zoroastrian tradition, Mithra evolved from being an all-seeing figure (hence vaguely associated with the Sun) into a divinity co-identified with the Sun itself, effectively taking over Hvare-khshaeta&#x27;s role. It is uncertain how and when and why this occurred, but it is commonly attributed to conflation with the Babylonian sun god Shamash and/or the Greek deity Apollo, with whom Mithra shares multiple characteristics such as a judicial function and association with the Sun. This characteristic is part of Mithra&#x27;s Indo-Iranian inheritance in that the Indic Rigveda has solar divinities that are not distinct from Mithra, who is associated with sunrise in the Atharvaveda. &quot;Om Mitraya Namaha&quot; is a Hindu mantra chanted in the practice of Sun Salutation, wherein Mitra is a name of the god of the Sun, Surya.

Royal names incorporating Mithra&#x27;s (e.g., &quot;Mithradates&quot;) appear in the dynasties of Parthia, Armenia, and in Anatolia, in Pontus and Cappadocia.

The youthful Apollonian-type Mithra is found in images from other countries of Iranian culture in the Parthian period, such as Commagene in the Roman-Parthian border and the Kushan Empire on the Indo-Iranian border.

==In Manichaeism==
Persian and Parthian-speaking Manichaeans used the name of Mithra current in their time (&quot;Mihryazd&quot;, q.e. Mithra-yazata) for two different Manichaean angels.

# The first, called &quot;Mihryazd&quot; by the Persians, was the &quot;Living Spirit&quot; (Aramaic &quot;rūḥā ḥayyā&quot;), a savior-figure who rescues the &quot;First Man&quot; from the demonic Darkness into which he had plunged.
# The second, known as &quot;Mihr&quot; or &quot;Mihr Yazd&quot; among the Parthians, is the &quot;Messenger&quot; (Aramaic &quot;īzgaddā&quot;), likewise a savior figure, but one concerned with setting up the structures to liberate the Light lost when the First Man had been defeated.

The second figure mentioned above, the Third Messenger, was the helper and redeemer of mankind, and identified with another Zoroastrian divinity, &quot;Narisaf&quot; (derived from Pahlavi &quot;Narsēh&quot; from Avestan &quot;Nairyō.saȵhō&quot;, meaning &#x27;Potent Utterance&#x27;, the name of a Yazata). Citing Boyce, Sundermann remarks, &quot;It was among the Parthian Manicheans that Mithra as a Sun God surpassed the importance of Narisaf as the common Iranian image of the Third Messenger; among the Parthians the dominance of Mithra was such that his identification with the Third Messenger led to cultic emphasis on the Mithraic traits in the Manichaean God.&quot;

Unrelated to these &quot;Mihr&quot;s are Parthian and Sogdian &quot;Mytr&quot; or &quot;Mytrg&quot;. Although sharing linguistic roots with the name Mithra, Werner Sundermann established that those names denote Manicheanism’s equivalent of Maitreya.

==In literature==

According to Boyce, the earliest literary references to the mysteries are by the Latin poet Statius, about 80 CE, and Plutarch (c. 100 CE).

<doc id="293163" wikidata="Q7757305" url="?curid=293163" title="The Pitts">
<text>The Pitts is an American sitcom that aired on Fox between March and April 2003. It is about a family and their bad luck. The show featured absurd, fantastical plots presented within the context of a seemingly normal family sitcom. It was cancelled after two months.

==Cast==
* Dylan Baker as Bob Pitt, the father of the family.
* Kellie Waymire as Liz Pitt, the mother of the family.
* Lizzy Caplan as Faith Pitt, the oldest child of Bob and Liz.
* David Henrie as Petey Pitt, the youngest child of Bob and Liz.

==Episodes==
==Reception==

The Pitts had a mostly negative reception from critics.

==Cancellation and failed revival==
Fox ordered seven episodes of the series; the network cancelled the show after only five episodes aired. The last two episodes that aired on Fox aired on the same night, the first airing at 7:30/6:30 CT and the second airing at its regular timeslot at 9:30/8:30 CT. The final two episodes of the series aired two years later in the U.K.

On October 10, 2007, Fox announced an animated version of the show was in development. Of the main cast, Lizzy Caplan and Dylan Baker signed on to reprise their roles. Kellie Waymire died in 2003 and Allison Janney had been cast in her role. The part of Petey was to be played by Andy Milonakis replacing David Henrie who was already starring in Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;.

On July 24, 2008, it was announced that the animated series had been taken out of production after a pilot had failed to impress Fox executives.

<doc id="293165" wikidata="Q260533" url="?curid=293165" title="Gigli">
<text>Gigli ( ) is a 2003 American romantic comedy crime film written, co-produced and directed by Martin Brest, and starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bartha, Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Lainie Kazan.

Despite popular media giving attention to and interest in the film during production (primarily because stars Affleck and Lopez were romantically involved), &quot;Gigli&quot; was heavily panned, and in subsequent years, it has been considered one of the worst films of all time. It is also one of the most expensive box-office bombs in history, grossing $7.2 million against a $75.6 million budget. It is the most recent film that Brest directed.

==Plot==
Larry Gigli is a low-ranking Los Angeles mobster who is not nearly as tough as he pretends. Louis, a higher-ranking member of Gigli&#x27;s organization, commands him to kidnap the mentally challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, to use as a bargaining chip to save New York-based mob boss Starkman from prison.

Gigli successfully convinces the young man, Brian, to go with him by promising to take him &quot;to the Baywatch&quot;, apparently a reference to the television show, which seems to be Brian&#x27;s singular obsession. Louis does not trust Gigli to get the job done correctly, so he hires a woman who calls herself Ricki to take charge.

Gigli is attracted to Ricki, but he resents both Louis&#x27;s lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman. He is also frustrated by Brian&#x27;s insistence on going to &quot;the Baywatch&quot; and that Ricki is a lesbian.

Events take a dark turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian&#x27;s thumb, something neither wants to do. At a hospital, Gigli sneaks into the morgue and cuts off a corpse&#x27;s thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian&#x27;s. Gigli and Ricki return to his apartment, where he confesses his love, and they consummate their relationship.

They are summoned to meet with the mob boss. Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor&#x27;s brother nor to cut off Brian&#x27;s thumb. Nevertheless, he is angry because it did not match Brian&#x27;s fingerprint. Therefore, it not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor, but also undermined their credibility.

Starkman kills Louis in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement. He is about to kill Ricki and Gigli, but she talks him out of it. She points out that only they know where Brian is and that only they can silence and prevent him from revealing Starkman&#x27;s organization&#x27;s involvement in the kidnapping.

They leave Starkman&#x27;s, decide to leave the mob, and discuss returning Brian to where they found him. On the way, they notice a &quot;Baywatch&quot;-like music video that is being filmed on the beach. Brian begs to be let off there and, after some convincing, they consent. Gigli convinces Ricki to take his car to escape, but at the last minute, she returns to pick him up, and they leave town together.

==Cast==
* Ben Affleck as Larry Gigli
* Jennifer Lopez as Ricki/Rochelle
* Justin Bartha as Brian
* Lainie Kazan as Mrs. Gigli
* Al Pacino as Starkman
* Lenny Venito as Louis
* Missy Crider as Robin
* Christopher Walken as Stanley Jacobellis
* Terrence Camilleri as Man in Dryer

==Production==
Halle Berry was invited to be the female lead before dropping out due to scheduling conflicts with her film &quot;X2&quot;. She was replaced with Jennifer Lopez, who signed in late 2001 for a reported $12 million. Adam Brody auditioned for the role of Brian.

&quot;Gigli&quot; began shooting in Los Angeles on December 10, 2001. The original ending featured Gigli being killed, but after negative response to a test screening, the ending was re-shot and edited. In a 2023 interview in &quot;Variety&quot;, Martin Brest said: 

== Release ==
The film was released in theaters on August 1, 2003.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Gigli&quot; grossed $3,753,518 during its opening weekend in 2,215 theaters, averaging $1,694 per theater and ranking #8 at the box office. The negative response led the studio to pull the advertisements for the film and replace them with another of their releases, &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;.

At the time, the film set a record for the biggest second-weekend drop in box-office gross of any film in wide release since the statistic began being recorded. It dropped by 81.9% in its second weekend compared to its first, grossing $678,640. By its third weekend in release, only 73 US theaters were showing it, a 97% drop from its first weekend. The film ultimately earned $6,087,542 domestically, and $1,178,667 internationally, for a total of $7,266,209 on a $75.6 million production budget.

After its third week, it was withdrawn, one of the shortest circulation times for a big-budget film. In the UK, the film was dropped by virtually every cinema after critics panned it. &quot;Gigli&quot; was stated to be a major part in Sony Pictures losing $42 million in the quarter of its release, although the studio had the successful &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; during the same period. The worldwide gross of $7.7 million against a $75.6 million budget made &quot;Gigli&quot; one of the most expensive box-office flops of all time.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Gigli&quot; was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 6%, based on 185 reviews, with an average rating of 3.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Bizarre and clumsily plotted, &quot;Gigli&quot; is a mess. As for its stars, Affleck and Lopez lack chemistry.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 18 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

On &quot;Ebert and Roeper&quot;, critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; both gave the film a thumbs down, although Ebert showed some sympathy toward the film, stating that it had &quot;clever dialogue&quot;, but was &quot;...too disorganized for me to recommend it&quot;. Roeper called the film &quot;a disaster&quot; and &quot;one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. He included &quot;Gigli&quot; on his list of the 100 worst films of the decade, at #7.

Ebert and James Berardinelli were two of the few major critics to not write it off completely. Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and made the balanced observation that &quot;the movie tries to do something different, thoughtful, and a little daring with their relationship, and although it doesn&#x27;t quite work, maybe the movie is worth seeing for some scenes that are really very good&quot;. He also considered Lopez and Affleck to be &quot;appealing in their performances&quot;, and that they &quot;have chemistry&quot;. Berardinelli gave it two stars, saying, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a good film, but, when set alongside the likes of &quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot; and &quot;Legally Blonde 2&quot;, Jen &amp; Ben offer less pain.&quot;

Joel Siegel of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; awarded the film a &quot;D&quot; rating and stated in his review, &quot;To qualify as a historic failure, a film needs a measure of pretension and all &quot;Gigli&quot; ever wanted to be was a romantic comedy. What it is is a dreadful romantic comedy.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;C+&quot;, stating, &quot;A watchable bad movie, but it&#x27;s far from your typical cookie-cutter blockbuster. There are no shoot-outs or car chases, and there isn&#x27;t much romantic suspense, either.&quot;

One of the few positive reviews came from Amy Dawes of &quot;Variety&quot;, who wrote that the story was ludicrous, and that the film would tank, but that on balance, she found it a fun film with several good performances.

In recent years, the movie has increasingly been re-evaluated by critics. For example, Jason Bailey, in a piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, notes that &quot;in the 21st century, the mixed review has become an endangered species—most readers look for the Rotten Tomatoes rating and pull-quote, and little beyond that. Everything is the absolute holy-shit best or the godawful worst of all time, and there&#x27;s nothing in between. &quot;Gigli&quot; is in between.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Legacy==
The fim&#x27;s title was named by the Global Language Monitor as one of the top words from Hollywood to have an impact on the English language in 2003. In particular, late-night talk-show hosts lampooned the film in their monologues: Conan O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;The Mets are doing so badly that they will be renamed &#x27;The New York Gigli&#x27;&quot;.

Yahoo! Movies ranks &quot;Gigli&quot; at number one on their &quot;Bottom Rated Movies of All Time&quot;, with a critics&#x27; rating of D−. 

In May 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked &quot;Gigli&quot; #25 on its list of &quot;50 Worst Movie Titles of All Time&quot;.

In a 2013 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Fred Armisen plays Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad performing as Affleck in a movie criticizing the creation of &quot;Argo&quot; while Affleck (who directed, produced and starred in &quot;Argo&quot;) is cast as a member of the filming crew. When his character was asked why he would appear in this film, Affleck responded, &quot;I&#x27;ve long been looking to appear in a movie worse than &quot;Gigli&quot;.&quot; Affleck said that the negative reception of &quot;Gigli&quot; led to his directing career.

<doc id="293176" wikidata="Q70275981" url="?curid=293176" title="Celempungan">
<text>Celempungan is a Sundanese musical genre that includes several musical instruments such as kacapi, kendang, goong/gong, and suling or rebab (optional), and Juru Kawih (singer). Kendang, the drum, controls the tempo of the ensemble and reinforces the meter.

Celempungan is named for the celempung, a bamboo tube zither from West Java. Celempungan ensembles had their golden era from 1935 to 1945. In modern celempungan ensembles, the celempung may be replaced by the siter, kacapi, and kendang. Troupes&#x27; musical repertoires include gamelan salendro kliningan. Dutch ethnomusicologist Jaap Kunst described celempungan in his 1973 book &quot;Music in Java&quot;:

<text>Yogachara (, IAST: &quot;&quot;) is an influential tradition of Buddhist philosophy and psychology emphasizing the study of cognition, perception, and consciousness through the interior lens of meditation, as well as philosophical reasoning (hetuvidyā). Yogachara was one of the two most influential traditions of Mahayana Buddhism in India, along with Madhyamaka. 

The compound &quot;Yogācāra&quot; literally means &quot;practice of yoga&quot;, or &quot;one whose practice is yoga&quot;, hence the name of the school is literally &quot;the school of the yogins&quot;. Yogācāra was also variously termed &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot; (the doctrine of consciousness), &quot;Vijñaptivāda&quot; (the doctrine of ideas or percepts) or &quot;Vijñaptimātratā-vāda&quot; (the doctrine of &#x27;mere representation&#x27;), which is also the name given to its major theory of mind which seeks to deconstruct how we perceive the world. There are several interpretations of this main theory: various forms of Idealism, as well as a phenomenology or representationalism. Aside from this, Yogācāra also developed an elaborate analysis of consciousness (vijñana) and mental phenomena (dharmas), as well as an extensive system of Buddhist spiritual practice, i.e. yoga.

The movement has been traced to the first centuries of the common era and seems to have developed as some yogis of the Sarvāstivāda and Sautrāntika traditions in north India adopted Mahayana Buddhism. The brothers Asaṅga and Vasubandhu (both c. 4-5th century CE), are considered the classic philosophers and systematizers of this school, along with the figure of Maitreya. Yogācāra was later imported to Tibet and East Asia by figures like Shantaraksita (8th century) and Xuanzang (7th-century). Today, Yogācāra ideas and texts continue to be influential subjects of study for Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.

==Doctrine==

Yogācāra philosophy is primarily meant to aid in the practice of yoga and meditation and thus it also sets forth a systematic analysis of the Mahayana path of mental training (see five paths &quot;pañcamārga&quot;). Yogācārins made use of ideas from previous traditions, such as Prajñāpāramitā and the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma tradition, to develop a novel analysis of conscious experience and a corresponding schema for Mahāyāna spiritual practice. Yogācāra sutras such as the &quot;Saṅdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot; developed various core concepts such as &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;, the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; (store consciousness), the turning of the basis (&quot;āśraya-parāvṛtti),&quot; the three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;), and emptiness. These form a complex system, and each can be taken as a point of departure for understanding Yogācāra.

===The doctrine of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;===
One of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy is the concept of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;. It is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;citta-mātra&quot; in modern and ancient Yogacara sources. The standard translation of both terms is &quot;consciousness-only&quot; or &quot;mind-only.&quot; Several modern researchers object to this translation in favor of alternative like &quot;representation-only&quot;. The meaning of this term is at the heart of the modern scholarly disagreement about whether Yogacara Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism (as supported by Garfield, Hopkins, and others) or whether it is definitely not idealist (Anacker, Lusthaus, Wayman).

====Origins====
According to Lambert Schmithausen, the earliest surviving appearance of this term is in chapter 8 of the &quot;Saṅdhinirmocana Sūtra,&quot; which has only survived in Tibetan and Chinese translations that differ in syntax and meaning. The passage is depicted as a response by the Buddha to a question which asks &quot;whether the images or replicas (&quot;*pratibimba&quot;) which are the object (&quot;*gocara&quot;) of meditative concentration (*&quot;samadhi&quot;), are different/separate (&quot;*bhinna&quot;) from the contemplating mind (&quot;*citta&quot;) or not.&quot; The Buddha says they are not different, &quot;Because these images are &quot;vijñapti-mātra.&quot;&quot; The text goes on to affirm that the same is true for objects of ordinary perception.

The term is sometimes used as a synonym with &quot;citta-mātra&quot; (mere &quot;citta&quot;), which is also used as a name for the school that suggests Idealism. Schmithausen writes that the first appearance of this term is in the &quot;Pratyupanna samadhi sutra&quot;, which states &quot;this (or: whatever belongs to this) triple world is nothing but mind (or thought: *&quot;cittamatra&quot;). Why? Because however I imagine things, that is how they appear.&quot; 

Regarding existing Sanskrit sources, the term appears in the first verse of Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; (&quot;Twenty Verses&quot;), which states:
This [world] is &quot;vijñaptimātra&quot;, since it manifests itself as an unreal object (&quot;artha&quot;), just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like (&quot;vijñaptimātram evaitad asad arthāvabhāsanāt yathā taimirikasyāsat keśa candrādi darśanam&quot;).

According to Mark Siderits, what Vasubandhu means here is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but &quot;there is actually no such thing outside the mind.&quot;

The term also appears in Asaṅga&#x27;s classic work, the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (no Sanskrit original, trans. from Tibetan)&quot;:&quot;
These representations (&quot;vijñapti&quot;) are mere representations (&quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;), because there is no [corresponding] thing/object (&quot;artha&quot;)...Just as in a dream there appear, even without a thing/object (&quot;artha&quot;), just in the mind alone, forms/images of all kinds of things/objects like visibles, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, houses, forests, land, and mountains, and yet there are no [such] things/objects at all in that [place]. &quot;MSg II.6&quot;

Another classic statement of the doctrine appears in Dharmakīrti&#x27;s &quot;Pramānaṿārttika&quot; (&quot;Commentary on Epistemology&quot;) which states: &quot;cognition experiences itself, and nothing else whatsoever. Even the particular objects of perception, are by nature just consciousness itself.&quot;

=== Interpretations of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; ===

==== Idealism ====
According to Bruce Cameron Hall, the interpretation of this doctrine as a form of subjective or absolute idealism has been &quot;the most common &#x27;outside&#x27; interpretation of &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot;, not only by modern writers, but by its ancient opponents, both Hindu and Buddhist.&quot; Scholars such as Jay Garfield, Saam Trivedi, Nobuyoshi Yamabe, Paul Williams, and Sean Butler argue that Yogācāra is similar to Idealism (and they compare it to the idealisms of Kant and Berkeley), though they note that it is its own unique form and that it might be confusing to categorize it as such. 

The German scholar and philologist Lambert Schmithausen affirms that Yogācāra sources teach a type of idealism which is supposed to be a middle way between Abhidharma realism and what it often considered a nihilistic position which only affirms emptiness as the ultimate. Schmithausen notes that philological study of Yogācāra texts shows that they clearly reject the independent existence of mind and the external world. He also notes that the current trend in rejecting the idealistic interpretation might be related to the unpopularity of idealism among Western academics. Florin Deleanu likewise affirms the idealist nature of Yogācāra texts, while also underscoring how Yogācāra retains a strong orientation to a soteriology which aims at contemplative realization of an ultimate reality that is an ‘inexpressible essence’ (&quot;nirabhilāpyasvabhāva&quot;) beyond any subject-object duality.

Similarly, Jonathan Gold writes that the Yogācāra thinker Vasubandhu can be said to be an idealist (similar to Kant), in the sense that for him, everything in experience as well as its causal support is mental, and thus he gives causal priority to the mental. At the same time however, this is only in the conventional realm, since &quot;mind&quot; is just another concept and true reality for Vasubandhu is ineffable, &quot;an inconceivable &#x27;thusness&#x27; (&quot;tathatā&quot;).&quot; Indeed, the &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; states that the very idea of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; must &quot;also&quot; be understood to be itself a self-less construction and thus &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; is not the ultimate truth (&quot;paramārtha-satya&quot;) in Yogācāra. Thus according to Gold, while Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; can be said to be a “conventionalist idealism”, it is to be seen as unique and different from Western forms, especially Hegelian Absolute Idealism.

==== Mere representation ====
The interpretation of Yogācāra as a type of idealism was standard until recently, when it began to be challenged by scholars such as Kochumuttom, Anacker, Kalupahana, Dunne, Lusthaus, Powers, and Wayman. 

Some scholars like David Kalupahana argue that it is a mistake to conflate the terms &quot;citta-mātra&quot; (which is sometimes seen as a different, more metaphysical position) with &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; (which need not be idealist). However, Deleanu points out that Vasubandhu clearly states in his &quot;Twenty Verses&quot; and &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot; that &quot;vijñapti&quot; and &quot;citta&quot; are synonymous. Nevertheless, different alternative translations for &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; have been proposed, such as &quot;representation-only, ideation-only, impressions-only&quot; and &quot;perception-only&quot;. 

Alex Wayman notes that one&#x27;s interpretation of Yogācāra will depend on how the qualifier &quot;mātra&quot; is to be understood in this context, and he objects to interpretations which claim that Yogācāra rejects the external world altogether, preferring translations such as &quot;amounting to mind&quot; or &quot;mirroring mind&quot; for &quot;citta-mātra&quot;. For Wayman, what this doctrine means is that &quot;the mind has only a report or representation of what the sense organ had sensed.&quot; The representationalist interpretation is also supported by Stefan Anacker. 

According to Thomas Kochumuttom, Yogācāra is a &quot;realistic pluralism&quot; which does not deny the existence of individual beings. Kochumuttom argues that Yogācāra is not idealism since it denies that absolute reality is a consciousness, that individual beings are transformations or illusory appearances of an absolute consciousness. Thus, for Kochumuttom, &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; means &quot;mere representation of consciousness,&quot; a view which states &quot;that the world &quot;as it appears&quot; to the unenlightened ones is mere representation of consciousness&quot;. Furthermore, according to Kochumuttom, in Yogācāra &quot;the absolute state is defined simply as emptiness, namely the emptiness of subject-object distinction. Once thus defined as emptiness (&quot;sunyata&quot;), it receives a number of synonyms, none of which betray idealism.&quot;
==== Soteriological phenomenology ====
According to Dan Lusthaus, the &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; theory is closer in some ways to Western Phenomenological theories and Epistemological Idealism. However, it is not a form of metaphysical idealism because Yogācāra rejects the construction of any type of metaphysical or ontological theories. Moreover, Western idealism lacks any counterpart to karma, samsara or awakening, all of which are central for Yogācāra. Regarding &quot;vijñapti-mātra,&quot; Lusthaus translates it as &quot;nothing but conscious construction&quot; and states it is a kind of trick built into consciousness which &quot;projects and constructs a cognitive object in such a way that it disowns its own creation - pretending the object is &quot;out there&quot; - in order to render that object capable of being appropriated.&quot; This reification of cognition aids in constructing the notion of a permanent and independent self, which is believed to appropriate and possess external &#x27;things&#x27;. Yogācāra offers an analysis and meditative means to negate this reification, thereby also negating the notion of a solid self. According to Lusthaus, this analysis is not a rejection of external phenomena, and it does not grant foundational or transcendent status to consciousness. In this interpretation, instead of offering an ontological theory, Yogācāra focuses on understanding and eliminating the underlying tendencies (&quot;anuśaya&quot;) that lead to clinging concepts and theories, which are just cognitive projections (&quot;pratibimba&quot;, &quot;parikalpita&quot;). Thus, for Lusthaus, the orientation of the Yogācāra school is largely consistent with the thinking of the Pāli nikāyas and seeks to realign Mahayana with early Buddhist theory.

=== Arguments for consciousness-only ===
According to the contemporary philosopher Jan Westerhoff, Yogācāra philosophers came up with various arguments in defense of the consciousness-only view. He outlines three main arguments: the explanatory equivalence argument, the causation-resemblance argument, and the constant co-cognition argument.

==== Explanatory equivalence argument ====
This argument is found in Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; (&quot;Twenty Verses&quot;) and is an inference to the best explanation. It argues that consciousness-only can provide an account of the various features of experience which are explained by the existence of mind-independent material objects. This is coupled with a principle of ontological parsimony to argue in favor of idealism.

Vasubandhu mentions three key features of experience which are supposed to be explained by matter and refutes them:

# According to critics, the problem of spatio-temporal determination (or non-arbitrariness in regard to place and time) indicates that there must be some external basis for our experiences, since experiences of any particular object do not occur everywhere and at every time. Vasubandhu responds with the dream argument, which shows how a world created by mind can still &quot;seem&quot; to have spatio-temporal localization.
# The problem of inter-subjective experience (multiple minds experiencing the same world). Vasubandhu counters that mass hallucinations (such as those said to occur to hungry ghosts) caused by the fact they share similar karma (which is here understood as traces or seeds in the mind-stream), show that inter-subjective agreement is possible without positing real external objects.
# Another criticism states that hallucinations have no pragmatic results, efficacy or causal function and thus can be determined to be unreal, but entities we generally accept as being &quot;real&quot; have actual causal results (such as the &#x27;resistance&#x27; of external objects) that cannot be of the same class as hallucinations. Against this claim, Vasubandhu argues that waking life is the same as in a dream, where objects have pragmatic results within the very rules of the dream. He also uses the example of a wet dream to show that mental content can have causal efficacy even outside of a dream.

According to Mark Siderits, after disposing of these objections, Vasubandhu believes he has shown that mere cognizance is just as good at explaining the relevant phenomena of experience as any theory of realism that posits external objects. Therefore, he then applies the Indian philosophical principle termed the &quot;Principle of Lightness&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;lāghava,&quot; which is similar to Occam&#x27;s Razor) to rule out realism since &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; is the simpler and &quot;lighter&quot; theory which &quot;posits the least number of unobservable entities.&quot;

Another objection that Vasubandhu answers is that of how one person can influence another&#x27;s experiences, if everything arises from mental karmic seeds in one&#x27;s mind stream. Vasubandhu argues that &quot;impressions can also be caused in a mental stream by the occurrence of a distinct impression in another suitably linked mental stream.&quot; As Siderits notes, this account can explain how it is possible to influence or even totally disrupt (murder) another mind, even if there is no physical medium or object in existence, since a suitably strong enough intention in one mind stream can have effects on another mind stream. From the mind-only position, it is easier to posit a mind to mind causation than to have to explain mind to body causation, which the realist must do. However, Siderits then goes on to question whether Vasubandhu&#x27;s position is indeed &quot;lighter&quot; since he must make use of multiple interactions between different minds to take into account an intentionally created artifact, like a pot. Since we can be aware of a pot even when we are not &quot;linked&quot; to the potter&#x27;s intentions (even after the potter is dead), a more complex series of mental interactions must be posited. Nevertheless, not all interpretations of Yogācāra&#x27;s view of the external world rely on multiple relations between individual minds. Some interpretations in Chinese Buddhism, such as in Huayan, defended the view of a single shared external world (bhājanaloka) which was still made of consciousness, while some later Indian thinkers like Ratnakīrti (11th century CE) defended a type of non-dual monism.

==== Causation-resemblance argument ====
This argument was famously defended in Dignāga&#x27;s &quot;Ālambanaparīkṣā&quot; (&quot;Examination of the Object of Consciousness&quot;) and its main target is Indian atomism, which was the main theory of matter in the 5th century. The argument is based on the premise that a perception must resemble the perceived object (&quot;ālambana&quot;) and have been caused by the object. According to this argument, since atoms are not extended, they do not resemble the object of perception (which appears as spatially extended). Furthermore, collections of atoms might resemble the object of perception, but they cannot have caused it. This is because collections of things are unreal in classic Buddhist thought (thus it is a mereological nihilism), since they are composites and composites made of parts do not have any causal efficacy (only individual atoms do).

In disproving the possibility of external objects, Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; similarly attacks Indian theories of atomism and property particulars as incoherent on mereological grounds.

==== Constant co-cognition argument ====
This argument was defended by Dharmakīrti in his &quot;Ascertainment of Epistemology&quot; (&quot;Pramāṇaviniścaya&quot;), which calls it &quot;the necessity of things only ever being experienced together with experience&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;sahopalambhaniyama&quot;)&quot;.&quot; According to Dharmakīrti:Because [something blue] is not apprehended without the additional qualification of consciousness, [and] because [blue] is apprehended when this [qualification of consciousness] is apprehended, consciousness [itself] has the appearance of blue. There is no external object by itself. (PV 3.335)&quot;&quot;According this argument, any object of consciousness, like blue, cannot be differentiated from the conscious awareness of blue since both are always experienced as one thing. Since we never experience blue without the experience of blue, they cannot be differentiated empirically. Furthermore, we cannot differentiate them through an inference either, since this would need to be based on a pattern of past experiences which included the absence or presence of the two elements. Thus, this is a type of epistemological argument for idealism which attempts to show there is no good reason to accept the existence of mind-independent objects.&quot;&quot;

==== Soteriological importance of mind-only ====
Vasubandhu also explains why it is soteriologically important to get rid of the idea of really existing external objects. According to Siderits, this is because:When we wrongly imagine there to be external objects we are led to think in terms of the duality of &#x27;grasped and grasper&#x27;, of what is &#x27;out there&#x27; and what is &#x27; in here&#x27; - in short, of external world and self. Coming to see that there is no external world is a means, Vasubandhu thinks, of overcoming a very subtle way of believing in an &#x27;I&#x27;... once we see why physical objects can&#x27;t exist we will lose all temptation to think there is a true &#x27; me&#x27; within. There are really just impressions, but we superimpose on these the false constructions of object and subject. Seeing this will free us from the false conception of an &#x27;I&#x27;.Siderits notes how Kant had a similar notion, that is, without the idea of an objective mind independent world, one cannot derive the concept of a subjective &quot;I&quot;. But Kant drew the opposite conclusion to Vasubandhu, since he held that we must believe in an enduring subject, and thus, also believe in external objects.

=== Analysis of Consciousness ===
Yogācāra gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. The central Yogācāra theory of mind is that of the eight consciousnesses.

====Eight consciousnesses====
A key innovation of the Yogācāra school was the doctrine of eight consciousnesses. These &quot;eight bodies of consciousnesses&quot; (&quot;aṣṭa vijñānakāyāḥ&quot;) are: the five sense-consciousnesses (of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and bodily sense), mentation (mano or citta), the defiled self-consciousness (&quot;kliṣṭamanovijñāna&quot;), and the storehouse or substratum consciousness (Skt: &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;). Traditional Buddhist descriptions of consciousness taught just the first six &quot;vijñānas&quot;, each corresponding to a sense base (&quot;ayatana&quot;) and having their own sense objects (sounds etc). Five are based on the five senses, while the sixth (&quot;mano-vijñāna),&quot; was seen as the surveyor of the content of the five senses as well as of mental content like thoughts and ideas. Standard Buddhist doctrine held that these eighteen &quot;elements&quot; (dhatus), i.e. six external sense bases (smells, sounds etc.), six internal bases (sense organs like the eye, ear, etc.), and six consciousnesses &quot;exhaust the full extent of everything in the universe, or more accurately, the sensorium.&quot; The six consciousnesses are also not substantial entities, but a series or stream of events (dharmas), which arise and vanish very rapidly moment by moment. This is the Abhidharma doctrine of &quot;momentariness&quot; (kṣaṇavada), which Yogācāra also accepts.

Yogācāra expanded the six vijñāna schema into a new system which with two new categories. The seventh consciousness developed from the early Buddhist concept of &quot;manas,&quot; and was seen as the defiled mentation (&quot;kliṣṭa-manas&quot;) which is obsessed with notions of &quot;self&quot;. According to Paul Williams, this consciousness &quot;takes the substratum consciousness as its object and mistakenly considers the substratum consciousness to be a true Self.&quot;

====&quot;Ālaya-vijñāna&quot;====
The eighth consciousness, &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; (storehouse or repository consciousness), was defined as the storehouse of all karmic seeds (bīja), where they gradually matured until ripe, at which point they manifested as karmic consequences. Because of this, it is also called the &quot;mind which has all the seeds&quot; (&quot;sarvabījakam cittam&quot;), as well as the &quot;basis consciousness&quot; (&quot;mūla-vijñāna&quot;) and the &quot;appropriating consciousness&quot; (&quot;ādānavijñāna&quot;). According to the &quot;Saṅdhinirmocana Sūtra,&quot; this kind of consciousness &quot;underlies&quot; and &quot;supports&quot; the six types of manifest awareness, all of which occur simultaneously with the &quot;ālaya.&quot; William S. Waldron sees this &quot;simultaneity of all the modes of cognitive awareness&quot; as the most significant departure of Yogācāra theory from traditional Buddhist models of &quot;vijñāna,&quot; which were &quot;thought to occur solely in conjunction with their respective sense bases and epistemic objects&quot;.

As noted by Schmithausen, the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna,&quot; being a kind of vijñāna, has an object as well (as all vijñāna has intentionality). That object is the sentient being&#x27;s surrounding world, that is to say, the &quot;receptable&quot; or &quot;container&quot; (&quot;bhājana&quot;) world. This is stated in the 8th chapter of the &quot;Saṅdhinirmocana Sūtra,&quot; which states that the &quot;ādānavijñāna&quot; is characterized by &quot;an unconscious (or not fully conscious?) steady perception (or &quot;representation&quot;) of the Receptacle (&quot;*asaṃvidita-sthira-bhājana-vijñapti&quot;).&quot;

The &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; is also what experiences rebirth into future lives and what descends into the womb to appropriate the fetal material. Therefore, the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&#x27;s&quot; holding on to the body&#x27;s sense faculties and &quot;profuse imaginings&quot; (&quot;prapañca&quot;) are the two appropriations which make up the &quot;kindling&quot; or &quot;fuel&quot; (lit. &quot;upādāna&quot;) that samsaric existence depends upon. Yogācāra thought thus holds that being unaware of the processes going on in the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; is an important element of ignorance (&quot;avidya&quot;). The &quot;ālaya&quot; is also individual, so that each person has their own &quot;ālaya-vijñāna,&quot; which is an ever changing process and therefore not a permanent self.

According to Williams, this consciousness &quot;seen as a defiled form of consciousness (or perhaps sub- or unconsciousness), is personal, individual, continually changing and yet serving to give a degree of personal identity and to explain why it is that certain karmic results pertain to this particular individual. The seeds are momentary, but they give rise to a perfumed series which eventually culminates in the result including, from seeds of a particular type, the whole ‘inter-subjective’ phenomenal world.&quot; Also, Asanga and Vasubandhu write that the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; ‘ceases’ at awakening, becoming transformed into a pure consciousness.

According to the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;, the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; has both a common character and an uncommon character. The common character refers to those seeds which ripen into the &quot;bhājanaloka&quot;, or container world, which is common to all. On the other hand, its uncommon character refers to those seeds which ripen as an individual&#x27;s own sense faculties. The &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; states that the remedies (i.e. those which comprise the Buddhist path) counteract the uncommon character of the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;, but not that which is common. That is, although they lack any individual karma of their own, purified persons are nonetheless supported by a consciousness of common seeds and that which is sustained by the discriminations of others. And while buddhas have access to that which is shared in common, i.e. the container world, they nonetheless experience it as pure.

According to Waldron, while there were various similar concepts in other Buddhist Abhidharma schools which sought to explain karmic continuity, the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; is the most comprehensive and systematic. Waldron notes that the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; concept was probably influenced by these theories, particularly the Sautrantika theory of seeds and Vasumitra&#x27;s theory of a subtle form of mind &quot;(suksma-citta)&quot;. 

Regarding the status of the seeds, according to the &quot;Chengweishilun&quot;, Sthiramati regarded the seeds to be merely nominal (i.e. conventional and not actually real); while on the other hand, Xuanzang took them to be real.

====Transformations of consciousness====
Yogācāra sources do not necessarily describe the eight consciousnesses as absolutely separate or substantial phenomena. For example, Kalupahana notes that the &quot;Triṃśika&quot; describes the various forms of consciousness as transformations and functions of a being&#x27;s stream of consciousness. These transformations are threefold according to Kalupahana. The first is the &quot;ālaya&quot; and its seeds, which is the flow or stream of consciousness, without any of the usual projections on top of it. The second transformation is &quot;manana&quot;, self-consciousness or &quot;Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love&quot;. It is &quot;thinking&quot; about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness&quot;. The &quot;ālaya&quot; is defiled by this self-interest. The third transformation is &quot;visaya-vijñapti&quot;, the &quot;&quot;concept&quot; of the object&quot;. In this transformation the &quot;concept&quot; of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become &quot;susceptible to grasping after the object&quot; as if it were a real object (&quot;sad artha&quot;) even though it is just a conception (&quot;vijñapti&quot;).

A similar perspective which emphasizes Yogācāra&#x27;s continuity with early Buddhism is given by Walpola Rahula. According to Rahula, all the elements of this theory of consciousness with its three layers of &quot;vijñāna&quot; are already found in the Pāli Canon, corresponding to the terms &quot;viññāna&quot; (sense cognition), &quot;manas&quot; (mental function, thinking, reasoning, conception) and &quot;citta&quot; (the deepest layer of the aggregate of consciousness which retains karmic impressions and the defilements).

=== The three natures ===
Yogācāra works often define three basic modes or &quot;natures&quot; (&quot;svabhāva&quot;) of experience. Jonathan Gold explains that &quot;the three natures are all one reality viewed from three distinct angles. They are the appearance, the process, and the emptiness of that same apparent entity.&quot; According to Paul Williams, &quot;all things which can be known can be subsumed under these Three Natures.&quot; Since this schema is Yogācāra&#x27;s systematic explanation of the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), each of the three natures are also explained as having a lack of own-nature (&quot;niḥsvabhāvatā&quot;). The &quot;Trisvabhāva-nirdeśa&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Three Natures&quot;) gives a brief definition of these three natures: What appears is the dependent. How it appears is the fabricated. Because of being dependent on conditions. Because of being only fabrication. The eternal non-existence of the appearance as it is appears: That is known to be the perfected nature, because of being always the same. What appears there? The unreal fabrication. How does it appear? As a dual self. What is its nonexistence? That by which the nondual reality is there. In detail, three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;) are:

#Parikalpita-svabhāva (the &quot;fully conceptualized&quot; or &quot;imagined&quot; nature). This is the &quot;imaginary&quot; or &quot;constructed&quot; nature, wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual construction, through the activity of language and through attachment and erroneous discrimination which attributes intrinsic existence to things. According to the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;, it also refers to the appearance of things in terms of subject-object dualism (literally &quot;grasper&quot; and &quot;grasped&quot;). The conceptualized nature is the world of everyday unenlightened people, i.e. samsara. It is false and empty, and does not really exist (&quot;Triṃśikā&quot; v. 20). According to Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;, this nature is an &quot;absence of an existential nature by its very defining characteristic&quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;lakṣana-niḥsvabhāvatā&quot;). Because these conceptualized natures and distinct characteristics (&quot;lakṣana&quot;) are wrongly imputed and not truly real, &quot;they are like mirages and blossoms in the sky.&quot;
#Paratantra-svabhāva (literally, &quot;other dependent&quot;), which is the dependently originated nature of dharmas, or the causal flow of phenomena which is erroneously confused into the conceptualized nature. According to Williams, it is &quot;&quot;the basis&quot; for the erroneous partition into supposedly intrinsically existing subjects and objects which marks the conceptualized nature.&quot; Jonathan Gold writes that it is &quot;the causal &quot;process&quot; of the thing&#x27;s fabrication, the causal story that brings about the thing&#x27;s apparent nature.&quot; This basis is considered to be an ultimately existing (&quot;paramārtha&quot;) basis in classical Yogācāra (see &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha,&quot; 2:25). However, as Xuanzang notes, this nature is also empty in that there is an &quot;absence of an existential nature in conditions that arise and perish&quot; (&quot;utpatti-niḥsvabhāvatā&quot;). That is, the events in this causal flow, while &quot;seeming to have real existence of their own&quot; are actually like magical illusions since &quot;they are said to only be hypothetical and not really exist on their own.&quot; As Siderits writes &quot;to the extent that we are thinking of it at all - even if only as the non-dual flow of impressions-only - we are still conceptualizing it.&quot;
#Pariniṣpanna-svabhāva (literally, &quot;fully accomplished&quot;, &quot;perfected&quot;, &quot;consummated&quot;): This is the true nature of things, the experience of Suchness or Thatness (&quot;Tathātā&quot;) discovered in meditation unaffected by conceptualization, causality, or duality. It is defined as &quot;&quot;the complete absence&quot;, in the dependent nature, of objects – that is, the objects of the conceptualized nature&quot; (see &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha,&quot; 2:4). What this refers to is that empty non-dual experience which has been stripped of the duality of the constructed nature through yogic praxis. According to Williams, this is &quot;&quot;what has to be known&quot; for enlightenment&quot; and Siderits defines it as &quot;just pure seeing without any attempt at conceptualization or interpretation. Now this is also empty, but only of itself as an interpretation. That is, this mode of cognition is devoid of all concepts, and so is empty of being of the nature of the perfected. About it nothing can be said or thought, it is just pure immediacy.&quot; According to Xuanzang, this nature has the &quot;absence of any existential nature of ultimate meaning&quot; (&quot;paramārtha-niḥsvabhāvatā&quot;) since it is &quot;completely free from any clinging to entirely imagined speculations about its identity or purpose. Because of this, it is conventionally said that it does not exist. However, it is also not entirely without a real existence.&quot;

=== Two interpretations of the three natures ===
Various Buddhist studies scholars such as Alan Spongberg, Mario D&#x27;amato, Daniel McNamara, and Matthew T. Kapstein have noted that there are two main interpretations of the three natures doctrine among the various texts of the Yogacara corpus. The two models have been named the &quot;pivot&quot; model and &quot;progressive&quot; model by these Western scholars. The &quot;pivot&quot; model, found in texts like the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha,&quot; presents the dependent nature as a kind of &quot;ontological pivot&quot; since it is the basis for conceptual construction (the imagined nature) and for the perfected nature (which is nothing but the absence of the imagined nature in the dependent nature). As such, the imagined nature is an incorrect way of experiencing the dependent, while the perfected nature is the correct way. 

The &quot;progressive model&quot; meanwhile can be found in the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; and in the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra&quot; and its &quot;bhāṣya&quot;. In this model, it is the perfected nature which is the primary element of the three natures schema. Here, the perfected nature is the pure basis of reality, while the other two natures are both impaired by ignorance. As the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; states: &quot;The imputed and the other-dependent are to be known as having defiled characteristics. The perfected is asserted to have the characteristic of purity.&quot; In this text, the dependent nature is seen as something which must be abandoned since it has the &quot;appearance of duality&quot; (dvayākāra). As such, in this &quot;progressive&quot; model, the dependent nature is the basis for the imagined nature, but not the basis for the perfected nature. The perfected nature on the other hand is a fundamentally pure true reality (which nevertheless is covered by adventitious defilements). As the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra&quot; states:Reality - which is always without duality, is the basis of error, and is entirely inexpressible - does not have the nature of discursivity. It is to be known, abandoned, and purified. It should properly be thought of as naturally immaculate, since it is purified from defilements, as are space, gold, and water. Furthermore, according to the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; (TSN 17-20), the three natures are inseparable (abhinna) and as such non-dual. This is a key difference between this model and the pivot model, where the dependent nature is ultimately devoid of the imagined nature. 

Another difference between these sources is that in the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot;, the main model of liberation is a radical transformation of the basis (āśrayaparāvṛtti). The &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; meanwhile claims that liberation occurs through knowledge of the three natures as they are (in their non-duality). Some scholars, like McNamara, argue that these two models are incompatible, ontologically and soteriologically. Kapstein thinks that it is possible that the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; is attempting to reconcile them. These differences have also led some scholars (Kapstein and Thomas Wood) to question the attribution of the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; to Vasubandhu.

===Divisions of consciousness and their relationship to the three natures===
Different Yogācāra philosophers analyzed consciousness into various parts or divisions (&quot;bhāga&quot;). According to Nanda, consciousness was divided into a seeing part (&quot;darśana-bhāga&quot;) and a seen, or image part (&quot;nimitta-bhāga&quot;). Dignāga accepted a third part, the self-cognizing part (&quot;svasaṃvitti-bhāga&quot;), which refers to consciousness&#x27; reflexive knowing within any act of cognition. Dharmapāla added to this yet a fourth part, the cognition of self-cognition, which is the resulting awareness that one is self-aware.

These philosophers differed on the question of the relationship of the various divisions of consciousness to the three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;). For Nanda, the seeing part of consciousness belonged to the dependent nature (&quot;paratantra-svabhāva&quot;), while the seen part belonged to the imagined (&quot;parikalpita-svabhāva&quot;). According to Dharmapāla, the seeing part, seen part, and the self-cognizing part all belong to the dependent nature. For Dharmapāla, it is only when false notions are applied to them (such as existence, nonexistence, identity, difference, etc.) that the seeing and seen parts can be called imagined, but they are otherwise real.

While Sthiramati was influenced by Dignāga&#x27;s three-bhāga theory, he held that the self-cognizing part alone belonged to the dependent nature (with the seeing and seen parts both belonging to the imagined). Thus, for Sthiramati, consciousness really only has one part, and in this he differed from Dharmapāla and Xuanzang. According to Zhihua Yao, the one-bhāga theory is associated with the classical Nirākarāvāda position according to which consciousness is not subject to any divisions.

=== Emptiness ===
The central meaning of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) in Yogācāra is a twofold &quot;absence of duality.&quot; The first element of this is the unreality of any conceptual duality such as &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;non-physical&quot;, &quot;self&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. To define something conceptually is to divide the world into what it is and what it is not, but the world is a causal flux that does not accord with conceptual constructs. The second element of this is a perceptual duality between the sensorium and its objects, between what is &quot;external&quot; and &quot;internal&quot;, between subject (&quot;grāhaka,&quot; literally &quot;grasper&quot;) and object (&quot;grāhya,&quot; &quot;grasped&quot;). This is also an unreal superimposition, since there is really no such separation of inner and outer, but an interconnected causal stream of mentality which is falsely divided up.

An important difference between the Yogācāra conception of emptiness and the Madhyamaka conception is that in classical Yogācāra, emptiness &quot;does exist&quot; (as a real absence) and so does consciousness (which is that which is empty, the referent of emptiness), while Madhyamaka refuses to endorse such existential statements. The &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; for example, states &quot;the imagination of the nonexistent [&quot;abhūta-parikalpa&quot;] exists. In it duality does not exist. Emptiness, however, exists in it,&quot; which indicates that even though that which is dualistically imagined (subjects and objects), is unreal and empty, their basis does exist (i.e. the dependently arisen conscious manifestation). 

The Yogācāra school also gave special significance to the Āgama sutra called &quot;Lesser Discourse on Emptiness&quot; (parallel to the Pali &quot;Cūḷasuññatasutta&quot;, MN 121) and relies on this sutra in its explanations of emptiness. According to Gadjin Nagao, this sutra affirms that &quot;emptiness includes both being and non-being. both negation and affirmation.&quot;

=== Disagreement with Madhyamaka ===
Indian sources indicate that Yogācāra thinkers sometimes debated with the defenders of the Madhyamaka tradition. However, there is disagreement among contemporary Western and traditional Buddhist scholars about the degree to which they were opposed, if at all. The main difference between these schools was related to issues of existence and the nature of emptiness. The Chinese pilgrim Yijing (635–713) concisely summarized the differences thus: “For Yogācāra the real exists, but the conventional does not exist; and [Yogācāra] takes the three natures as foundational. For Madhyamaka the real does not exist, but the conventional does exist; and actually the two truths are primary&quot;. Garfield and Westerhoff write that &quot;Yogācāra is both ontologically and epistemologically foundationalist; Madhyamaka is antifoundationalist in both senses.&quot; Another way to state this key difference is that Madhyamaka defends a &quot;global antirealism&quot; while Yogācāra &quot;restrict[s] the scope of their antirealism to the external and the conventional&quot;. 

While Madhyamaka generally states that asserting the ultimate existence or non-existence of anything (including emptiness) was inappropriate, Yogācāra treatises (like the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot;) often assert that the dependent nature (&quot;paratantra-svabhāva&quot;) really exists and that emptiness is an &quot;actual absence&quot; that also exists ultimately. In a similar fashion, Asaṅga states &quot;that of which it is empty does not truly exist; that which is empty truly exists: emptiness makes sense in this way&quot;. He also describes emptiness as &quot;the non-existence of the self, and the existence of the no-self.&quot; Classical Yogācāras like Vasubandhu and Sthiramati also affirm the reality of conscious appearance, i.e. that truly existent stream of dependent arisen and constantly changing consciousness which projects false and illusory subjective minds and their cognitive objects. It is this real flow of conscious transformation (vijñānapariṇāma) which is said to be empty (of duality and conceptuality). Against the radically anti-foundationalist interpretation of Madhyamaka, the classic Yogācāra position is that there is something (the dependent nature which is mere-consciousness) that &quot;exists&quot; (sat) independently of conceptual designation (prajñapti), and that it is this real thing (vāstu) which is said to be empty of duality and yet is a basis for all dualistic conceptions. 

Furthermore, Yogācāra thinkers like Asaṅga and Vasubandhu critiqued those who &quot;adhere to non-existence&quot; (&quot;nāstikas, vaināśkas&quot;, likely referring to certain Madhyamikas) because they saw them as straying into metaphysical nihilism (&quot;abhāvānta&quot;, see &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; v. 10). They held that there was really something which could be said to &quot;exist&quot;, that is, &quot;vijñapti,&quot; and that was what is described as being &quot;empty&quot; in their system. For Yogācāra, all conventional existence must be based on something which is real (dravya). Sthiramati argues that we cannot say that everything exists conventionally (saṁvṛtisat) or nominally (prajñaptisat) and that nothing truly exists in an ultimate fashion (which would entail a global conventionalism and nominalism without any metaphysical ground). For Sthiramati, this view is false because &quot;what would follow is non-existence even conventionally. That is because conventions are not possible without something to depend upon (or, “without taking up something”—upādāna).&quot; Thus, for Sthiramati, consciousness (vijñana) &quot;since it is dependently arisen, exists as dravya (substance).&quot; 

The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; likewise argues that it is only logical to speak of emptiness if there is &quot;something&quot; (i.e. &quot;dharmatā,&quot; an ultimate nature) that is empty. The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&#x27;s&quot; Chapter on Reality (&quot;Tattvārthapaṭala&quot;) states that emptiness is &quot;wrongly grasped&quot; by those who &quot;do not accept that of which something is empty, nor do they accept that which is empty&quot;. This is because &quot;emptiness holds good only as long as that of which something is [said to be] empty does not exist, but on the other hand, that which is empty exists. If, however, all [elements involved in this relation] were non-existent, in what respect, what would be empty, [and] of what?&quot; For the &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot;, the &quot;right&quot; way to understand emptiness is &quot;one regards that something is empty of that which does not exist in it and correctly comprehends that what remains there does actually exist here&quot;. That which &quot;remains&quot; and &quot;actually exists&quot; is the true reality, the thing itself (vastumātra), the foundation (āśraya) which remains (avaśiṣṭa) after all conceptual constructs have been removed.

Yogācārins also criticized certain Madhyamaka accounts of conventional truth, that is, the view which says that conventional truth is merely erroneous cognitive processes (designations, expressions, and linguistic conventions) which project an inherent nature. The &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;&#x27;s Viniścayasaṃgrahanī states that either Madhyamakas see conventional reality as produced by linguistic expressions and also by causal forces, or they see it as produced merely by linguistic expressions and convention. If the former, then Madhyamikas must accept the reality of causal efficacy, which is a kind of existence (since things which are causally produced can be said to exist in some way). If the latter, then without any basis for linguistic expression and convention, it makes no sense to even use these terms (for Yogācāra these conventions must have some kind of referential basis).

Yogācārins further held that if all phenomena are equally conventional and unreal in the same way this would lead to laxity in ethics and in following the path, in other words to moral relativism. The basic idea behind this critique is that if only convention exists (as Madhyamaka claims) and there are no truths that are independent of convention and linguistic expression, there would be no epistemic foundations for critiquing worldly (non-buddhist) conventions and affirming other conventions as closer to the truth (like the conventions used by Buddhists to establish their ethics and their teachings). 

Madhyamaka thinkers like Bhaviveka, Candrakirti and Shantideva also critiqued Yogācāra views in their works for what they saw as an improper reification (samāropa) of mind and for a nihilistic denial of conventional truth. The work of Xuanzang (7th century) also contains evidence for this Indian debate.

=== Mental images: true vs false ===
An important debate about the reality of mental appearances within Yogācāra led to its later subdivision into two systems of Alikākāravāda (Tib. &quot;rnam rdzun pa&quot;, False Aspectarians, also known as Nirākāravāda) and Satyākāravāda (&quot;rnam bden pa&quot;, True Aspectarians, also known as Sākāravāda). They are also termed &quot;Aspectarians&quot; (&quot;ākāra&quot;) and &quot;Non-Aspectarians&quot; (&quot;anākāra&quot;). The core issue is whether appearances or “aspects” (&quot;rnam pa, ākāra&quot;) of objects in the mind are treated as true (&quot;bden pa, satya&quot;) or false (&quot;rdzun pa, alika&quot;). While this division did not exist in the works of the early Yogācāra philosophers, tendencies similar to these views can be discerned in the works of Yogācāra thinkers like Dharmapāla (c. 530–561?) and Sthiramati (c. 510–570?). According to Zhihua Yao, Dharmapāla was a Sākāravādin, while Sthiramati was a Nirākāravādin.

According to Yaroslav Komarovski the distinction is as follows:Although Yogācāras in general do not accept the existence of an external material world, according to Satyākāravāda its appearances or “aspects” (&quot;rnam pa, ākāra&quot;) reflected in consciousness have a real existence, because they are of one nature with the really existent consciousness, their creator. According to Alikākāravāda, neither external phenomena nor their appearances and/in the minds that reflect them really exist. What exists in reality is only primordial mind (&quot;ye shes, jñāna&quot;), described as self-cognition (&quot;rang rig, svasamvedana/ svasamvitti&quot;) or individually self-cognizing primordial mind (&quot;so so(r) rang gis rig pa’i ye shes&quot;).Davey K. Tomlinson describes the difference (with reference to later Yogacara scholars from Vikramashila) as follows:On one hand is the Nirākāravāda, typified by Ratnākaraśānti (ca. 970–1045); on the other, the Sākāravāda, articulated by his colleague and critic Jñānaśrīmitra (ca. 980–1040). The Nirākāravādin argues that all appearances do not really exist. They are ersatz or false (alīka). Ephemeral forms appear to us but are the erroneous construction of ignorance, which fundamentally characterizes our existence as suffering beings in saṃsāra. In the ultimately real experience of an awakened buddha, no appearances show up at all. Pure experience, unstained by false appearance (which is nirākāra, “without appearance”), is possible. The Sākāravādin, on the other hand, defends the view that all conscious experience is necessarily the experience of a manifest appearance (consciousness is sākāra, or constitutively “has appearance”). Manifest appearances, properly understood, are really real. A buddha&#x27;s experience has appearances, and there is nothing about this fact that makes a buddha&#x27;s experience mistaken.

=== Karma ===
An explanation of the Buddhist doctrine of karma (action) is central to Yogācāra, and the school sought to explain important questions such as how moral actions can have effects on individuals long after that action was done, that is, how karmic causality works across temporal distances. Previous Abhidharma schools like the Sautrantika had developed theories of karma based on the notion of &quot;seeds&quot; (&quot;bījā&quot;) in the mind stream, which are unseen karmic habits (good and bad) which remain until they meet with the necessary conditions to manifest. Yogācāra adopts and expanded this theory. Yogācāra then posited the &quot;storehouse consciousness&quot; as the container of the seeds, as the storage place for karmic latencies and as a fertile matrix of predispositions that bring karma to a state of fruition. In the Yogācāra system, all experience without exception is said to result from karma or mental intention (&quot;cetana&quot;), either arising from one&#x27;s own subliminal seeds or from other minds.

For Yogācāra, the seemingly external or dualistic world is merely a &quot;by-product&quot; (&quot;adhipati-phala&quot;) of karma. The term &quot;vāsanā&quot; (&quot;perfuming&quot;) is also used when explaining karma. Yogācārins were divided on the issue of whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, whether the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds. The type, quantity, quality and strength of the seeds determine where and how a sentient being will be reborn: one&#x27;s race, sex, social status, proclivities, bodily appearance and so forth. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called &quot;saṃskāra&quot;. Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Action&quot; (&quot;Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa&quot;), treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective. 

===Meditation and awakening===
As the name of the school suggests, meditation practice is central to the Yogācāra tradition. Yogācāra texts prescribe various yogic practices such as mindfulness and the four investigations, out of which a revolutionary and radically transformative understanding of the non-duality of self and other is said to arise. This process is referred to as &quot;āśraya-parāvṛtti&quot; (&quot;overturning the cognitive basis&quot;, or &quot;revolution of the basis&quot;), which refers to &quot;overturning the conceptual projections and imaginings which act as the base of our cognitive actions.&quot; This event is seen as the transformation of the basic mode of cognition into &quot;jñāna&quot; (knowledge, direct knowing), which is seen as a non-dual knowledge that is non-conceptual (&quot;nirvikalpa&quot;), i.e., &quot;devoid of interpretive overlay&quot;. Roger R. Jackson describes this as a &quot;&#x27;fundamental unconstructed awareness&#x27; (&quot;mūla-nirvikalpa-jñāna&quot;)&quot;. When this knowledge arises, the eight consciousnesses come to an end and are replaced by direct knowings. According to Lusthaus:Overturning the Basis turns the five sense consciousnesses into immediate cognitions that accomplish what needs to be done (&quot;kṛtyānuṣṭhāna-jñāna&quot;). The sixth consciousness becomes immediate cognitive mastery (&quot;pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna&quot;), in which the general and particular characteristics of things are discerned just as they are. This discernment is considered nonconceptual (&quot;nirvikalpa-jñāna&quot;). &quot;Manas&quot; becomes the immediate cognition of equality (&quot;samatā-jñāna&quot;), equalizing self and other. When the Warehouse Consciousness finally ceases it is replaced by the Great Mirror Cognition (&quot;Mahādarśa-jñāna&quot;) that sees and reflects things just as they are, impartially, without exclusion, prejudice, anticipation, attachment, or distortion. The grasper-grasped relation has ceased. ...&quot;purified&quot; cognitions all engage the world in immediate and effective ways by removing the self-bias, prejudice, and obstructions that had prevented one previously from perceiving beyond one&#x27;s own narcissistic consciousness. When consciousness ends, true knowledge begins. Since enlightened cognition is nonconceptual its objects cannot be described.

===Five Categories of Beings===
One of the more controversial Yogācāra teachings was the &quot;five categories of beings&quot;, which was an extension of the teachings on the seeds of the storehouse consciousness. This teaching states that sentient beings have certain innate seeds that determine their capability of achieving a particular state of enlightenment and no other. Thus, beings were placed into five categories:

# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to practice the bodhisattva path and achieve full Buddhahood
# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of a pratyekabuddha (private Buddha)
# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of an arhat
# Beings whose innate seeds had an indeterminate nature, and could potentially be any of the above
# Beings whose innate seeds were incapable of achieving enlightenment ever because they lacked any wholesome seeds

The fifth class of beings, the icchantika, were described in various Mahayana sutras as being incapable of achieving enlightenment, unless in some cases through the aid of a Buddha or Bodhisattva. Nevertheless, the notion was highly criticized by later Mahayanists who supported the universalist doctrine of ekayana. This tension is important in East Asian Buddhist history and later East Asian Yogācārins attempted to resolve the dispute by softening their stance on the five categories.

== Practice ==

A key early source for the yogic practices of Indian Yogācāra is the encyclopedic &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot; (YBh&quot;, Treatise on the Foundation for Yoga Practitioners).&quot; The YBh presents a structured exposition of the Mahāyāna Buddhist path of &quot;yoga&quot; (here referring to spiritual practice in general) from a Yogācāra perspective and relies in both Āgama/Nikāya texts and Mahāyāna sūtras while also being influenced by Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma. According to some scholars, this text can be traced to communities of &quot;yogācāras,&quot; which initially referred not to a philosophical school, but to groups of meditation specialists whose main focus was Buddhist yoga. Other Yogācāra texts which also discuss meditation and spiritual practice (and show some relationship with the YBh) include the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra,&quot; the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot;, &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra, Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot; and Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;.

The YBh discusses various topics relevant to the bodhisattva practice, including: the eight different forms of dhyāna (meditative absorptions), the three &quot;samādhis&quot;, different types of liberation (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;), meditative attainments (&quot;samāpatti&quot;) such as &quot;nirodhasamāpatti&quot;, the five hindrances (&quot;nivaraṇa&quot;), the various types of foci (&quot;ālambana&quot;) or &#x27;images&#x27; (&quot;nimitta&quot;) used in meditation, the various types contemplative antidotes (&quot;pratipakṣa&quot;) against the afflictions (like contemplating death, unattractiveness, impermanence, and suffering), the practice of &quot;śamatha&quot; through &quot;the nine aspects of resting the mind&quot; (&quot;navākārā cittasthitiḥ&quot;), the practice of insight (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;), mindfulness of breathing (&quot;ānāpānasmṛti&quot;), how to understand the four noble truths, the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (&quot;saptatriṃśad bodhipakṣyā dharmāḥ&quot;), the four immeasurables (&quot;apramāṇa&quot;), and how to practice the six perfections (&quot;pāramitā&quot;).

=== Bodhisattva path ===
Yogācāra sources like the &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot;, the &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn&quot; and the commentaries to the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; also contain various descriptions of the main stages of the bodhisattva path. These Yogācāra sources integrate the Mahayana teaching of the ten bodhisattva stages (bhūmis) with the earlier Abhidharma outline of the path called the &quot;five paths&quot; (&quot;pañcamārga&quot;), to produce a Mahayanist version of &quot;five stages&quot; (pañcāvasthā). In classic Yogācāra, this bodhisattva path is said to last for three incaculable eons (asaṃkhyeya kalpas), i.e. millions upon millions of years. 

The five paths or stages are outlined in Yogācāra sources as follows: 

# Path of accumulation (&quot;sambhāra-mārga,&quot; 資糧位), in which a bodhisattva gives rise to bodhicitta, and works on the two accumulations of merit (puṇya) and wisdom (jñana). These are linked with the practice of the six perfections. In this first stage of the path, one attains merit by doing good deeds like giving (dana) and one also accumulates wisdom by listening to the Mahayana teachings many times, contemplating them and meditating on them. One also associates with good spiritual friends. According to the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;, at this stage the bodhisattva focuses on accumulating wholesome roots (kuśalamūla) and on permeating one&#x27;s mind with learning (bahuśrutaprabhāvita). This leads to the accumulation of great faith and conviction in the Mahayana and in the principle of consciousness-only. 
# Path of engagement (&quot;prayoga-mārga,&quot; 加行位), also termed &quot;the stage of the practice of faith and conviction&quot; (&quot;adhimukticaryābhūmi&quot;). Here, a bodhisattva practices morality, meditation, and wisdom in order to quell the manifest activities of the two types of obscurations: emotionally afflictive and cognitive. While their active elements are quelled, they remain as seeds in the foundation consciousness. Furthermore, one also cultivates the &quot;factors conducive to penetration&quot;, which consists of the &quot;four investigations&quot; and the &quot;four correct cognitions&quot;. These are ways of contemplating the truth of mind-only and lead to the &quot;entrance into the principle of cognizance-only&quot; (vijñaptimātrapraveśa) as well as to &quot;the certainty as to the non-existence of the object&quot; (arthābhāvaniścaya). At this stage one relies on the fourth dhyana and also attains various samadhis (meditative concentrations). The final stage of this path which is just before the path of seeing is called &quot;the elimination of the ideation of cognizance-only&quot; (vijñaptimātrasaṃjñāvibhāvana). As the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; states, at this point, the realization of the absolute nature (pariniṣpannasvabhāvabuddhi) eliminates the very &quot;perception of mind-only&quot; (vijñaptimātratābuddhi). The resulting wisdom is described by Asanga as &quot;the non-conceptual cognition (nirvikalpakajñāna) in which the object (ālambana) and the subject (ālambaka) are completely identical (samasama).&quot; 
# Path of seeing (&quot;darśana-mārga&quot;, 見道位), at this stage (which lasts for only a few moments), a bodhisattva attains an untainted knowledge (Skt. anāsrava-jñāna, 無漏智) into emptiness, the non-duality of self and other, and consciousness-only. The &quot;Cheng wei shi lun&quot; describes this knowledge which realises Suchness (tathatā) as being &quot;entirely undifferentiated (samasama) from Suchness since both are free from the characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of subject (grāhaka) and object (grāhya).&quot; This stage is equated with the first bodhisattva stage, the stage of joy. At this point, one is a proper noble (arya) bodhisattva instead of just a beginner.
# Path of cultivation (&quot;bhāvanā-mārga,&quot; 修道位), at this stage, a bodhisattva continues to train themselves in two main cognitions in order to fully eliminate all the seeds of the two types of obscurations. They train in the non-conceptual gnosis (nirvikalpakajñāna) of ultimate reality, and the wordly or subsequent knowledge (pṛṣṭhtalabdhajñāna) which knows conventional reality as illusory, and is yet able to conceptually understand it and use it for guiding sentient beings according to their needs. Part of this path requires effort, as the bodhisattva is said to &quot;repeatedly (abhīkṣṇam) cultivate the non-conceptual cognition&quot; (&quot;Cheng wei shi lun&quot;). However, after a certain point one advances effortlessly. This path corresponds to the second to ninth stages of the bodhisattva path. The &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; states that at this stage the yogin &quot;dwells in intense cultivation for hundreds of thousands of koṭis of niyutas [an astronomical number] of aeons and consequently attains the transformation of the basis (āśrayaparavṛtti)&quot;.
# Path of fulfillment (&quot;niṣṭhā-mārga&quot;), also known as the path of no more learning (&quot;aśaikṣa-mārga&quot;, 無學位) in other sources. This is equivalent to complete Buddhahood. It also entails attaining the three bodies (trikāya) of the Buddha (a doctrine which was also invented by the Yogācāra school).

=== Bodhisattva practice ===
The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; discusses the Yogācāra school&#x27;s specifically Mahāyāna forms of practice which are tailored to bodhisattvas. The aim of the bodhisattva&#x27;s practice in the &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; is the wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;) which realizes of the inexpressible Ultimate Reality (&quot;tathata&quot;) or the &#x27;thing-in-itself (&quot;vastumatra&quot;), which is essenceless and beyond the duality (&quot;advaya&quot;) of existence (&quot;bhāva&quot;) and non-existence (&quot;abhāva&quot;). 

The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; outlines several practices of bodhisattvas, including the six perfections (&quot;pāramitā&quot;), the thirty-seven factors of Awakening, and the four immeasurables. Two key practices which are unique to bodhisattvas in this text are the four investigations and the four correct cognitions or &quot;the four kinds of understanding in accordance with true reality&quot;. These two sets of four practices and cognitions are also taught in the &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot; and its commentaries. 

==== The four investigations and four correct cognitions ====
The four investigations (catasraḥ paryeṣaṇāḥ) and the corresponding four correct cognitions (catvāri yathābhūtaparijñānāni) are a set of original contemplations found in Yogācāra works. These were seen as very important contemplative methods by the authors of the &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot;. They were considered to lead to awakening, and were linked with the thirty-seven factors leading to Awakening. 

The four investigations and the corresponding four correct cognitions (which are said to arise out of the investigations) are:

# The investigation of the names [of things] (&quot;nāmaparyeṣaṇā&quot;), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of names just for what they are, which is &quot;just names&quot; (&quot;nāmamātra&quot;), i.e. arbitrary linguistic signs.
# The investigation of things (&quot;vastuparyeṣaṇā&quot;), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of things. One sees things just for what they are, namely a mere presence or a thing-in-itself (&quot;vastumātra&quot;). One understands that this is apart from all labels and is inexpressible (&quot;nirabhilāpya&quot;).
# The investigation of verbal designations suggesting and portraying an intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhāva-prajñapti-paryeṣaṇā&quot;), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of such designations. One sees the designations just for what they are, namely as mere designations (&quot;prajñaptimātratā&quot;). Thus, one sees the idea of intrinsic nature to be illusory like a hallucination or a dream.
# The investigation of verbal designations expressing individuation and differences (&quot;viśeṣaprajñaptiparyeṣaṇā&quot;), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of such designations. One sees the designations just for what they are, namely as mere designations. For example, a thing may be designated as existing or non-existing, but such designations do not apply to true reality or the thing-in-itself.
The practice which leads to the realization of the true nature of things is based on the elimination of all conceptual proliferations (&quot;prapañca&quot;) and ideations (&quot;saṃjñā&quot;) that one superimposes on true reality&quot;.&quot; The YBh states that the yogin must &quot;repeatedly remove any ideation conducive to the proliferation directed at all phenomena and should consistently dwell on the thing-in-itself by a non-conceptualizing mental state which is focused on grasping only the object perceived without any characteristics&quot;.

==== Four prayogas ====
Various Yogācāra sources provide a four step process of realization leading to the path of seeing, these four are the four yogic practices (prayogas):

* Yogic practice of observation (upalambha-prayoga) - Outer objects are observed to be nothing but mind.
* Yogic practice of non-observation (anupalambha-prayoga) - Outer objects are not observed as such
* Yogic practice of observation and non-observation (upalambhānupalambha-prayoga) - Outer objects being unobservable, a mind cognizing them is not observed either
* Yogic practice of double non-observation (nopalambhopalambha-prayoga) - Not observing both, nonduality is observed

This process is conceisely explained in the &quot;Trisvabhāvanirdeśa&quot; which says &quot;through the observation of it being merely mind, a knowable object is not observed. Through not observing a knowable object, mind is not observed [either]. Through not observing both, the dharmadhātu is observed.&quot; Thus, the goal of meditation is a totally unified mind that goes beyond all concepts and language to directly know the undifferentiated &quot;uniformity of phenomena&quot; (dharmasamatāḥ) and the thing-in-itself, the supreme reality. The elimination of all concepts applies even to the very idea of mind only or &quot;mere-cognizance&quot; itself. As the &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot; states: &quot;through [referents] being observed in this way, they are observed as mere cognizance. By virtue of observing them as mere cognizance, Referents are not observed, and through not observing referents, mere cognizance is not observed [either].&quot; This elimination of concepts and ideas is the basic framework applied by the bodhisattva to all meditative practices, including the different mindfulness meditations&quot;.&quot; The three &quot;samādhis&quot; (meditative absorptions) are likewise adapted into this new framework. These three are the emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), wishlessness (&quot;apraṇihita&quot;), and imagelessness (&quot;ānimitta&quot;) &quot;samādhis.&quot;

=== Meditation ===
As the &quot;school of yoga practitioners&quot;, meditative practice is discussed in various Yogācāra sources. The sixth chapter (the Maitreya Chapter) of the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra&quot; focuses entirely on meditation. It extensively discusses the meditative aspects of ‘calm’ (śamatha) and ‘insight’ (vipaśyanā) from unique perspectives. Success in both of these is based on pure ethics and on pure views based on listening and reflecting (viśuddhaṃ śrutamayacintāmayadarśanam). Insight is paired with &quot;objects consisting in images accompanied by reflection&quot; (savikalpaṃ pratibimbaṃ) while tranquility is seen as based on objects consisting in images unaccompanied by reflection (nirvikalpaṃ pratibimbaṃ). Thus, insight meditation is based on the uninterrupted contemplation of mental images, while calming meditation is simply focusing on &quot;the continuous flow of mind with uninterrupted attention&quot;. The &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot; also states that the teachings themselves are an important object of meditative contemplation. This includes the Yogācāra teaching of consciousness-only, the teachings on the twofold emptiness (of self and phenomena), and the schematic analysis of the subject and its objects of consciousness.

While insight meditation is initially based on conceptual reflection, these are gradually abandoned at later stages until the yogin lets go of all concepts, teachings, and mental images. Furthermore, at the higher stages of meditation, the calm and insight meditations must ultimately be blended or yoked together (yuganaddha) in a single state of one-pointedness of mind (cittaikāgratā). This unified state is described as that state in which the yogin: &quot;realises that these images (pratibimba) which are the domain of concentration (samādhigocara) are nothing but representation (vijñaptimātra), and having realised this, he contemplates (manasikaroti) Suchness (tathatā).&quot;

==History==
Yogācāra, along with Madhyamaka (Middle Way), is one of the two principal philosophical schools of Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism, though the related movement of Tathāgatagarbha-thought was also influential.

=== Origin and early Yogācāra ===

The term &quot;yogācāra&quot; (yoga practitioner) was originally used to refer to the Buddhist meditation adepts of the first centuries of the common era which were associated with the Sarvāstivāda and Sautrāntika traditions in north India (some of their key centers included Gandhara, Kashmir and Mathura). Modern scholars like Florin Deleanu have suggested that some yogis in this north Indian Buddhist milieu gradually adopted Mahāyāna ideas, eventually developing into a separate movement (a process which was complete by the 5th century). According to Deleanu, the Chinese &quot;Dhyana Sutras&quot; indicate just such a gradual adoption of Mahāyāna elements. 
One of the earliest texts of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra tradition proper is the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Unraveling the Profound Intent&quot;) which might be as early as the first or second century CE. It includes new theories such as the basis-consciousness (&quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot;), the doctrine of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; and the &quot;three natures&quot; (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;). However, these theories were not completely new, as they have predecessors in older theories held by previous Buddhist schools, such as the Sautrāntika theory of seeds (&quot;bīja&quot;) and the Sthavira theory of the bhavanga. Philosophically speaking, Richard King notes that Sautrāntikas defended a kind of representationalism, in which the mind only perceives an image (akara) or representation (vijñapti) of an external object (never the object itself). Mahayana Yogācāras adopted a similar model but removed the need for any external object which acts as a cause for the image. As the doctrinal trailblazer of the Yogācāra, the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot; also introduced the paradigm of the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma, with its own teachings being placed into the final and definitive teaching (which supersedes those of the Prajñaparamita sutras). 

The early layers of the massive &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Stages of the Yogācāras&quot;) also contains very ancient Yogācāra material which is earlier than the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot;. However, in its current form it is a &quot;conglomeration of heterogenous materials&quot; (Schmithausen) which was finally compiled (perhaps by Asanga) after the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot; (hence, later layers quote the sutra directly). Modern scholars consider the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot; to contain the work of several authors (mainly of a Mūlasarvāstivāda milieu), though it has traditionally been attributed in full to the bodhisattva Maitreya or to Asanga. It is influenced by Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma and Sautrāntika traditions, who also had similar texts called by the name &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;, such as the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi of Saṅgharakṣa&quot;.

=== Classical Yogācāra - Asaṅga and Vasubandhu ===
Yogācāra&#x27;s systematic exposition owes much to the brothers Asaṅga (4th c. CE) and Vasubandhu (c. 4th - 5th CE). Little is known of these figures, but traditional accounts (in authors like Xuanzang) state that Asaṅga received Yogācāra teachings from the bodhisattva and future Buddha, Maitreya. However, there are various discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning these so called &quot;five works of Maitreya&quot;. 

Modern scholars argue that the various works traditionally attributed to Maitreya are actually by other authors. According to Mario D&#x27;amato, the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; and the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; are part of a second phase of Yogācāra scholarship which took place after the completion of the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, but before the composition of Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (which quotes the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; as an authoritative text). Regarding the &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; and the &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot;, modern scholars generally see these as the works of different authors.

Asaṅga went on to write many of the key Yogācāra treatises such as the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; and the &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;. Asaṅga also went on to convert his brother Vasubandhu to Yogācāra. Vasubandhu was a top scholar of Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika Abhidharma thought, and the &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; is his main work which discusses the doctrines of these traditions. Vasubandhu also went on to write important Yogācāra works like the &quot;Twenty Verses&quot; and the &quot;Thirty Verses on Consciousness-Only&quot;.

=== The middle period and the epistemological turn ===
The Yogācāra school held a prominent position in Indian Buddhism for centuries after the time of the two brothers. According to Lusthaus and Deleanu, after Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, two distinct &quot;wings&quot; of the school developed during the &quot;Middle Period&quot; of Yogācāra, the epistemological school and the scholastic school. Another important third movement developed a synthesis of Yogācāra with buddha-nature thought. 

Thus, the three main branches of the Yogācāra movement which developed during the so called middle period are: 

# A logico-epistemic tradition (&quot;pramāṇavāda&quot;) focusing on issues of epistemology (Sanskrit: pramāṇa) and logic (hetuvidyā), exemplified by such thinkers as Dignāga, Dharmakīrti, Dharmottara, Devendrabuddhi, Prajñakaragupta, Jinendrabuddhi, Śākyabuddhi
# A scholastic and exegetical tradition which refined and elaborated Yogācāra Abhidharma and wrote various commentaries, exemplified by such thinkers as Gunamati, Asvabhāva, Sthiramati, Jinaputra, Dharmapāla, Śīlabhadra, Xuanzang, and Vinītadeva (710-770).
# The Yogācāra-tathāgatagarbha synthesis, found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, and &quot;Ghanavyūha sūtra&quot;, two treatises attributed to an author named Sāramati: the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga,&quot; and &quot;Dharmadhātvaviśeṣaśāstra&quot; (&quot;Dasheng fajie wuchabie lun&quot; 大乘法界無差別論), as well as in the works of Paramārtha (499-569 CE), including his translations: &quot;Buddhagotraśāstra&quot; (&quot;Fó xìng lùn,&quot; 佛性論)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Anuttarâśrayasūtra&quot;.
These branches of Yogācāra thought were not mutually exclusive however, for example, Vinītadeva wrote &quot;pramāṇa&quot; works as well as commentaries on the works of Vasubandhu. Aside from these, there were also Yogācāra authors writing commentaries on the Prajñaparamita sutras, including the unknown author of the &quot;Abhisamayālaṅkāra&quot; (AA)&quot;,&quot; Arya Vimuktisena (6th century) who commented on the AA, and Daṃṣṭrāsena (author of the &quot;Bṛhaṭṭīkā&quot;). 

The doctrines of the exegetical tradition sometimes came under attack by other Buddhists, especially the notion of &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot;, which was seen as close to the Hindu ideas of &quot;ātman&quot; and &quot;prakṛti.&quot; It was perhaps due to this that the logical tradition shifted over time to using the term &quot;citta-santāna&quot; instead&quot;,&quot; since it was easier to defend a &quot;stream&quot; &quot;(santāna)&quot; of thoughts as a doctrine that did not contradict not-self. By the end of the eighth century, the scholastic tradition had mostly become eclipsed by the pramāṇa tradition as well as by a new hybrid school that &quot;combined basic Yogācāra doctrines with &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; thought.&quot; 

The influential Pramāṇavāda tradition led by Dignāga and Dharmakīrti defined the main epistemological method for Indian Buddhism. Modern scholars see this school as having ushered in an &quot;epistemological turn&quot; for all Indian philosophy. The pramāṇa tradition continued to thrive in Magadha (especially at Nalanda) as well as in Kashmir well into the 11th century. One of the most important late figures of this tradition was Śaṅkaranandana (fl. c. 9th or 10th century), &quot;the second Dharmakīrti&quot;. 

=== Yogācāra-tathāgatagarbha synthesis ===

According to Lusthaus, the synthetic Yogācāra-tathāgatagarbha school accepted the definition of &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (the buddha-womb, buddha-source, or &quot;buddha-within&quot;) as &quot;permanent, pleasurable, &quot;self&quot;, and pure&quot; (&quot;nitya, sukha, ātman, śuddha&quot;) which is found in various &quot;tathāgatagarbha sutras.&quot; This hybrid school eventually went on to link the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; with the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; doctrine. Some key sources of this tendency are the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (&quot;Uttaratantra&quot;), and in China the &quot;Awakening of Faith.&quot;

The synthesis of Yogācāra and Tathāgatagarbha thought became extremely influential in both East Asia and Tibet. During the sixth and seventh centuries, various forms of competing Yogācāra systems were popular in Chinese Buddhism. The translator Bodhiruci (6th century CE) for example, took a more &quot;classical&quot; approach while Ratnamati was attracted to Tathāgatagarbha thought and sought to translate texts like the &quot;Dasabhumika commentary&quot; accordingly. Their disagreement on this issue led to the end of their collaboration as co-translators. The translator Paramārtha is another example of a hybrid thinker. He promoted the theory of a &quot;stainless consciousness&quot; (&quot;amala-vijñāna,&quot; a pure wisdom within all beings, i.e. the tathāgatagarbha), which is revealed once the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; is purified.

According to Lusthaus, Xuanzang&#x27;s travels to India and his translation work was an attempt to return to a more &quot;orthodox&quot; and &quot;authentic&quot; Indian Yogācāra, and thus put to rest the debates and confusions in the Chinese Yogācāra of his time. The &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot; returns to the use of the theory of seeds instead of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; to explain how some beings can reach Buddhahood. However, by the eighth century, the Yogācāra-tathāgatagarbha synthesis became the dominant interpretation of Yogācāra in East Asian Buddhism. Later Chinese thinkers like Fazang would thus criticize Xuanzang for failing to teach the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;.

Karl Brunnhölzl notes that this syncretic tendency also existed in Indian Yogācāra scholasticism, but that it only became widespread during the later tantric era (when Vajrayana became prominent) with the work of thinkers like Jñānaśrīmitra, Ratnākaraśānti, and Maitripa. Kashmir also became an important center for this tradition, as can be seen in the works of Kashmiri Yogacarins Sajjana and Mahājana. 

===Yogācāra and Madhyamaka===
Yogācāra and Madhyamaka philosophers demonstrated two opposing tendencies throughout the history of Buddhist philosophy in India, an antagonistic stance which saw both systems as rival and incompatible views and another inclusive tendency which worked towards harmonizing their views. Some authors like the Madhyamikas Bhaviveka, Candrakīrti, and Śāntideva, and the Yogācāras Asanga, Dharmapala, Sthiramati criticized the philosophical theories of the other tradition. While Indian Yogācāras criticized certain interpretations of Madhyamaka (which they term “those who misunderstand emptiness”), they never criticize the founders of Madhyamaka themselves (Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva), and saw their work as implicitly in agreement with Yogācāra. This inclusivism saw Nāgārjuna&#x27;s teachings as needing further expansion and explication (since it was part of the &quot;second turning&quot; of the wheel of Dharma). Thus, Yogācāra thinkers affirmed the importance Nāgārjuna&#x27;s work and some even wrote commentaries on Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārika&quot; as a way to draw out the implicit meaning of Madhyamaka and show it was compatible with Yogācāra. These include Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Comforming to the Middle Way&quot; (&quot;Shun zhonglun&quot; 順中論) and Sthiramati&#x27;s &quot;Mahayana Middle Way Commentary&quot; (&quot;Dasheng zhongguanshi lun&quot; 大乘中觀釋論 T.30.1567)&quot;.&quot; Similarly, Vasubandhu and Dharmapāla both wrote commentaries on Āryadeva&#x27;s &quot;Catuḥśātaka&quot; (&quot;Four Hundred Verses&quot;). 

The harmonizing tendency can be seen in the work of philosophers like Kambala (5-6th century, author of the &quot;Ālokamālā&quot;), Jñānagarbha (8th century), his student Śāntarakṣita (8th century) and Ratnākaraśānti (c. 1000). Śāntarakṣita (8th century), whose view was later called &quot;Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Madhyamaka&quot; by the Tibetan tradition, saw the Mādhyamika position as ultimately true and at the same time saw the Yogācāra view as a useful way to relate to conventional truth (which leads one to the ultimate). Ratnākaraśānti on the other hand saw Nagarjuna as agreeing with the intent of Yogācāra texts, while criticizing the interpretations of later Madhyamikas like Bhaviveka. Later Tibetan Buddhist thinkers like Shakya Chokden would also work to show the compatibility of the alikākāravāda sub-school with Madhyamaka, arguing that it is in fact a form of Madhyamaka. Likewise, the Seventh Karmapa Chödrak Gyamtso has a similar view which holds that the &quot;profound important points and intents&quot; of the two systems are one. Ju Mipham is also another Tibetan philosopher whose project is aimed as showing the harmony between Yogacara and Madhyamaka, arguing that there is only a very subtle difference between them, being a subtle clinging by Yogacaras to the existence of an &quot;inexpressible, naturally luminous cognition&quot; (&quot;rig pa rang bzhin gyis ’od gsal ba&quot;).

===Yogācāra in East Asia===


Translations of Indian Yogācāra texts were first introduced to China in the early 5th century CE. Among these was Guṇabhadra&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of Chan Buddhism. Influential 5th century figures include the translators Bodhiruci, Ratnamati, and Paramārtha. Their followers founded the Dilun (&quot;Daśabhūmikā Commentary&quot;) and Shelun (&quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;) schools, both of which included Yogācāra and tathāgatagarbha elements. Modern scholars also hold that the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, a very influential work in East Asian Buddhism, was written by a member of the Dilun tradition. 

Xuanzang (fl. c. 602 – 664) is famous for having made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism, obtain more indic Yogācāra sources. Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters and drew on a variety of Indian sources in his studies. Upon his return to China, Xuanzang brought with him 657 Buddhist texts, including the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot; and began the work of translating them. Xuanzang composed the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only&quot;) which drew on many Indian sources and commentaries and became a central work of East Asian Yogācāra. 

Xuanzang&#x27;s student Kuiji continued this tradition, writing several important commentaries. However, another student of Xuanzang, the Korean monk Wŏnch’ŭk, defended some of the doctrines of the Shelun school of Paramārtha, for which he was criticized by the followers of Kuiji. Wŏnch’ŭk&#x27;s teachings were influential on the Yogācāra (&quot;Beopsang&quot;) of Silla Korea. Both of these competing Yogācāra sub-sects were then imported to Japan where they became the two sub-sects (the northern and southern temple lineages) of the Hossō school. Xuanzang&#x27;s school later came under criticism from later Chinese masters like Fazang and it became less influential as the fortunes of other native Chinese schools rose. Nevertheless, Yogācāra studies continued to be important at different times throughout Chinese history, including during the modern revival of Yogācāra in the 20th century.

===Yogācāra in Tibet===

Yogācāra is studied in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, though it receives different emphasis in each of these. Yogācāra thought is an integral part of the history of Tibetan Buddhism. It was first transmitted to Tibet by figures like Śāntarakṣita, Kamalaśīla and Atiśa. 

The Tibetan Nyingma school and its Dzogchen teachings draw on both Madhyamaka and Yogācāra-Tathāgatagarbha thought. Similarly, Kagyu school figures like the Third Karmapa also rely on the Madhyamaka and Yogācāra-Tathāgatagarbha systems in their presentation of the ultimate view (termed Mahamudra in Kagyu). The Jonang school also developed its own synthetic philosophy which they termed &quot;shentong&quot; (&quot;other-emptiness&quot; ), which also included elements from Yogācāra, Madhyamaka and Tathāgatagarbha. In contrast, the Gelug and Sakya schools generally see Yogācāra as a lesser view than the Madhyamaka philosophy of Candrakirti, which is seen as the definitive view in these traditions.

Today, Yogācāra topics remain important in Tibetan Buddhism and Yogācāra texts are widely studied. There are various debates and discussions among the Tibetan Buddhist schools regarding key Yogācāra ideas, like &quot;svasaṃvedana&quot; (reflexive awareness) and the foundational consciousness. Furthermore, the debates between the other-emptiness and self-emptiness views are also similar in some ways to the historical debates between Yogācāra-Tathāgatagarbha and Madhyamaka, though the specific viewpoints have evolved further and changed in complex ways. Modern thinkers continue to discuss Yogācāra issues, and attempt to synthesize it with Madhyamaka. For example, Ju Mipham, the 19th-century Rimé commentator, wrote a commentary on Śāntarakṣita&#x27;s synthesis arguing that the ultimate intent of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra is the same.

=== Influence ===
Virtually all contemporary schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism are influenced by Yogācāra to some extent. This includes modern East Asian Buddhist traditions (like Zen and Pure Land) and Tibetan Buddhism. Zen was heavily influenced by Yogācāra sources, especially the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra.&quot; In Tibetan Buddhism, Yogācāra sources are still widely studied and several are part of the monastic education curriculum in various traditions. Some influential Yogācāra texts in Tibetan Buddhism include: Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;, and the &quot;Five Treatises of Maitreya&quot; including the &quot;Mahayanasutralankara&quot;, and the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;.

Hindu philosophers such as Vācaspati Miśra, Utpaladeva, Abhinavagupta, and Śrīharṣa were also influenced by Yogacara ideas and responded to their theories in their own works.

=== Sūtras ===
The &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sūtra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets&quot;; 2nd century CE), is a key early Yogācāra sutra which is considered to be the foundational sutra for the Yogācāra tradition. There are two Indian commentaries to this, one by Asanga and one by Jñanagarbha. The &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (which includes the &quot;Daśabhūmikasūtra&quot;) also contains numerous teachings on mind-only and is very influential for East Asian Buddhism. Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Daśabhūmikasūtra&quot; is an important commentary to this. Another text, the &quot;Mahāyānābhidharmasūtra&quot; is often quoted in Yogācāra works and is assumed to also be an early Yogācāra sutra&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; also later assumed considerable importance in East Asia, and portions of this text were considered by Étienne Lamotte as being contemporaneous with the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot;. This text equates the Yogācāra theory of &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; with the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (buddha-nature) and thus seems to be part of the tradition which sought to merge Yogācāra with &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; thought. Another sutra which contains similar themes to the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; is the &quot;Ghanavyūha Sūtra&quot;. 

All these five sutras are listed by Kuiji as key sutras for the Yogācāra school in his &quot;Commentary on the&quot; &quot;Cheng weishi lun&quot; (成唯識 論述記; Taishō no. 1830). Another lesser known sutra which was important in East Asian Yogācāra is the &quot;Buddha Land Sutra&quot; (&quot;Buddhabhūmi Sūtra&quot;; Taishō vol. 16, no. 680) which along with its commentaries, teaches that the pure land is not a physical place, but a symbol for wisdom. This sutra was important enough in India to have at least two Indian Yogācāra commentaries written on it, Śīlabhadra&#x27;s &quot;Buddhabhūmi&quot;-&quot;vyākhyāna&quot; and Bandhuprabha&#x27;s &quot;Buddhabhūmyupadeśa&quot;. 

There are also various Indian, Chinese and Tibetan commentaries to these various Mahayana sutras. Furthermore, the Prajñaparamita sutras are also important sources in Yogācāra, even though most do not cover specifically &quot;Yogācāra&quot; doctrines. This is shown by the fact that various Yogācāra commentaries were written on Prajñaparamita sutras, including commentaries by Asanga (&quot;Vajracchedikākāvyākhyā&quot;), Vasubandhu, Dignāga, Daṃṣṭrasena (&quot;Bṛhaṭṭīkā&quot;), Ratnākaraśānti (various), and the &quot;Abhisamayālaṅkāra&quot;. 

=== Treatises ===

Yogācāra authors wrote numerous scholastic and philosophical treatises (&quot;śāstra&quot;) and commentaries (&quot;ṭīkā, bhāṣya&quot;, &quot;vyākhyāna,&quot; etc). The following is a list in historical order and only includes specifically Yogācāra-Vijñānavāda figures and works: 

* &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra,&quot; the earliest Yogācāra treatise, a massive encyclopedic work on Yogācāra theory and praxis which is a composite work reflecting various stages of historical development (compiled 3rd to 5th century CE). 
* &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; and its &quot;bhāṣya,&quot; traditionally attributed to the bodhisattva Maitreya or Asanga, modern scholars like D&#x27;amato place this text (together with the commentary) after the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, but before Asanga.
* &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing the Middle and the Extremes&quot;), another work of the &quot;second phase&quot; of post-&quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot; Yogācāra thought, traditionally attributed to the bodhisattva Maitreya who is said to have revealed it to Asanga.
* &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga (Distinguishing Dharmas and Dharmata),&quot; another work of the so called &quot;Maitreya corpus&quot;
* Nāgamitra&#x27;s (3rd-4th century?) &quot;Kāyatrayāvatāramukha&quot; (a treatise on the trikaya and the three natures)
* The works of Asaṅga (4th-5th century CE): the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; and the &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;. 
* Vasubandhu&#x27;s (4th-5th century CE) &quot;Viṃśaṭikā-kārikā&quot; (Treatise in Twenty Stanzas), &quot;Triṃśikā-kārikā&quot; (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas), &quot;Vyākhyāyukti&quot; (&quot;Proper Mode of Exposition&quot;), &quot;Karmasiddhiprakarana&quot; (&quot;A Treatise on Karma&quot;), and &quot;Pañcaskandhaprakaraṇa&quot; (Explanation of the Five Aggregates).&quot; &quot;
* &quot;Ālokamālāprakaraṇanāma&quot; (&quot;An Explanation named &#x27;Garland of Light&quot;&#x27;) by Kambala (c. fifth to sixth century) which attempts to harmonize Madhyamaka and Yogācāra, mostly by assimilating Madhyamaka under Yogācāra. 
* The &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtravyākhyāna&quot; is a commentary to the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra&quot; attributed to Asanga, but this has been questioned by modern scholars. 
* &quot;Abhisamayālaṅkāra&quot; (&quot;Ornament of Realization&quot;), a commentary on the Prajñaparamita sutras. It is attributed to Maitreya-Asanga by Tibetan tradition, but it is unknown in Chinese sources. Modern scholars see this as a post-Asanga text. Makransky attributes it to Ārya Vimuktisena, the first commentator on this text.

====Criticisms====

Thinkers from the ancient Indian realist schools, such as the Mimamsa, Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita, Nyaya, Yoga, Samkhya, Sauntrantika, Jain, Vaisesika, and others heavily criticized Yogacara, and composed refutations of the Yogacara position.

Sankara, founder of the Advaita school, which holds a form of idealism, also was harshly critical of Yogacara.

<text>Jinul Puril Bojo Daesa (, &quot;Bojo Jinul&quot;; 1158–1210), often called Jinul or Chinul for short, was a Korean monk of the Goryeo period, who is considered to be the most influential figure in the formation of Korean Seon (Zen) Buddhism. He is credited as the founder of the Jogye Order, by working to unify the disparate sects in Korean Buddhism into a cohesive organization.

== Biography ==
Bojo Jinul&#x27;s birthname was Jeong and by age 15 he left his family to be ordained under Seon Master Jonghwi of the Sagulsan School, one of the nine mountain schools of Seon, receiving the ordination name &quot;Jinul&quot;. This occurred in 1173. Regarding his training, Buswell observes:
&quot;The young monk&#x27;s relationship with his preceptor does not seem to have been especially close, for his biographer states that he never had a permanent teacher. Chinul&#x27;s intellect and his natural inclination toward solitude and retreat had been noticeable since his youth; with the fractious climate of the church in his days, he probably felt more comfortable learning to get along on his own considerable talents in seclusion. From early on in his vocation Chinul made up for the lack of personal instruction by drawing inspiration from the Buddhist scriptures. In the spirit of self-reliance that is central to Buddhism, he took responsibility for his own spiritual development and followed the path of practice outlined in the scriptures and confirmed through his own Sŏn meditation. Chinul&#x27;s progress in Buddhist practice was, therefore, based on using scriptural instructions to perfect formal Sŏn practice.&quot;
By 1182, Jinul passed the royal examination for monks and qualified for a higher administrative position, but turned it down to join the Seon sangha at Bojesa in Pyongyang. The community being uninterested in his efforts to reform the retreat community, he moved to Cheongwonsa at Changpyeong, then Bomunsa on Hagasan.

During this period of travel and study, Jinul was said to have studied the entire Tripiṭaka and had a series of awakenings. Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon which he called the &quot;samadhi and prajñā society&quot; (). This movement&#x27;s goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. Jinul eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of Songgwangsa on Jogyesan, and in the process the Jogye Order, which taught a comprehensive approach to Buddhism including meditation, doctrine, chanting and lectures. By 1209, he completed his magnum opus the &quot;Excerpts from the Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record with Personal Notes&quot; (), an extensive exploration of various schools of Chan Buddhism in China, with extensive commentaries on the writings of the Chinese monk Guifeng Zongmi as well as personal notes.

This earned him the respect of the Goryeo, and in particular King Huijong, who ordered that Mount Songgwangsan be renamed Jogyesan in his honor. Upon his death in 1210, he was given a posthumous title of honor by King Huijong as well.

== Teachings ==

=== Essence-Function ===
Essence-Function () is a key concept of Korean Buddhism. Essence-Function takes a particular form in the philosophy and writings of Jinul.

=== View of Nirvana ===
Jinul viewed Nirvana as a sublime essence that is present in all beings. This essence is the very nature of Buddha and has always been present in beings. Writing on the faith in such matters held by his own school, Jinul states:
Jinul further believed that the true nature of all people is unchanging and that their minds are ultimately numinous and marked by awareness, even when seemingly in a state of delusion. In a discussion of Buddhist schools, he writes:

<text>The Hollandse or Hollandsche IJssel (; &quot;Holland IJssel&quot;, as opposed to the &#x27;regular&#x27; or Gelderland IJssel) is a branch of the Rhine delta that flows westward from Nieuwegein on river Lek through IJsselstein, Gouda and Capelle aan den IJssel to Krimpen aan den IJssel, where it ends in the Nieuwe Maas. Another branch called Enge IJssel (&quot;Narrow IJssel&quot;) flows southwest from Nieuwegein. The name IJssel is thought to derive from the Germanic &quot;i sala&quot;, meaning &quot;dark water&quot;. Originally, the Hollandse IJssel forked off from river Lek at Nieuwegein, but the connection was cut off with the Hollandse IJssel nowadays only draining the surrounding pastures.

If the North Sea floods, the Hollandse IJssel allows water through the Rotterdam Waterway to flood low-lying land east of Rotterdam. The Delta Works included a steel barrier that can be lowered within minutes to block the waterway. The sea protection constructions were built at the mouth of the Hollandse IJssel in 1957.

<text>DIN 31635 is a (DIN) standard for the transliteration of the Arabic alphabet adopted in 1982. It is based on the rules of the (DMG) as modified by the International Orientalist Congress 1935 in Rome. The most important differences from English-based systems were doing away with &quot;j&quot;, because it stood for in the English-speaking world and for in the German-speaking world and the entire absence of digraphs like &quot;th, dh, kh, gh, sh&quot;. Its acceptance relies less on its official status than on its elegance (one sign for each Arabic letter) and the &quot;Geschichte der arabischen Literatur&quot; manuscript catalogue of Carl Brockelmann and the dictionary of Hans Wehr. Today it is used in most German-language publications of Arabic and Islamic studies.

Along with rules for the Arabic language, it also includes transliteration standards for Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, Urdu, and Pashto.

== Table ==
:The 28 letters:

== Rules ==
The &#x27; (&#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;) are transliterated as &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;. A &#x27; results in a geminate (consonant written twice). The article is written with the sun letters assimilated.

An &#x27; marking is transliterated as &#x27;. The letter () &#x27; is transliterated as word-final &#x27; normally, or &quot; in a word in the construct state.

&#x27; has many variants, ; depending on its position, all of them are transliterated as . The initial &#x27; () without a &quot; is not transliterated using initially, only the initial vowel is transliterated (if pronounced): &quot;.&quot;

() &#x27; appears as &quot;,&quot; transliterating it indistinguishable from &quot;.&quot;
Long vowels and are transliterated as &#x27; and &quot;.&quot; The &#x27; suffix appears as &#x27; although the former is normally transliterated as &#x27;, and nunation is ignored in transliteration. A hyphen &quot;&quot; is used to separate clitics (the article, the prepositions and the conjunction) from words to which they are attached.

The Eastern Arabic numerals () are rendered as western Arabic numerals ().

<doc id="293217" wikidata="Q1256302" url="?curid=293217" title="Matthew Prior">
<text>Matthew Prior (21 July 1664 – 18 September 1721) was an English poet and diplomat. He is also known as a contributor to &quot;The Examiner&quot;.

==Early life==
Prior was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, where he lived with his father George, a Nonconformist joiner. His father moved to London, and sent him to Westminster School, under Dr Richard Busby. After his father&#x27;s death, he left school, and was cared for by his uncle, a vintner in Channel Row. Here, Lord Dorset found him reading Horace, and set him to translate an ode. He did so well that the Earl offered to contribute to the continuation of his education at Westminster.

One of his schoolfellows and friends at Westminster was Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax. It was to avoid being separated from Montagu and his brother James that Prior accepted, against his patron&#x27;s wish, a scholarship recently founded at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. degree in 1686, and two years later became a fellow. In collaboration with Montagu, he wrote in 1687 the &quot;City Mouse and Country Mouse&quot;, in ridicule of John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Hind and the Panther&quot;.

==Diplomacy and Early Writings==

During an age when satirists could be sure of patronage and promotion, Montagu was promoted at once, and Prior, three years later, became secretary to the embassy at the Hague. After four years, he was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber at court. Apparently, he acted as one of the King&#x27;s secretaries, and in 1697 he was secretary to the plenipotentiaries who concluded the Peace of Ryswick. Prior&#x27;s talent for affairs was doubted by Alexander Pope, who admittedly had little experience in diplomatic affairs, but it is not likely that King William would have employed in this important business a man who had not given proof of diplomatic skill and grasp of details.

The poet&#x27;s knowledge of French was recognised by his being sent in the following year to Paris in attendance on the English ambassador. At this period Prior could say with good reason that &quot;he had commonly business enough upon his hands, and was only a poet by accident.&quot; To verse, however, which had laid the foundation of his fortunes, he still occasionally trusted as a means of maintaining his position. His occasional poems during this period include an elegy on &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in 1695; a satirical version of Boileau&#x27;s &quot;Ode sur le prise de Namur&quot; (1695); some lines on William&#x27;s escape from assassination in 1696; and a brief piece called &quot;The Secretary&quot;.

After his return from France, Prior became under-secretary of state and succeeded John Locke as a commissioner of trade. In 1701 he sat in Parliament for East Grinstead. He had certainly been in William&#x27;s confidence with regard to the Partition Treaty; but when Somers, Orford and Halifax were impeached for their share in it he voted on the Tory side, and immediately on Anne&#x27;s accession he allied himself with Robert Harley and St John. Perhaps as a consequence of this; there is no mention of his name in connection with any public transaction for nine years. But when the Tories came into power in 1710, Prior&#x27;s diplomatic abilities were again called into action, and until the death of Anne he held a prominent place in all negotiations with the French court, sometimes as secret agent, sometimes in an equivocal position as ambassador&#x27;s companion and sometimes as fully accredited but very unpunctually paid ambassador. His share in negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht, of which he is said to have disapproved personally, led to its popular nickname of &quot;Matt&#x27;s Peace.&quot;

Prior is also known as a contributor to &quot;The Examiner&quot; newspaper.

==Imprisonment and Poetry==

When Queen Anne died and the Whigs regained power, Prior was impeached by Robert Walpole and kept in close custody from 1715 to 1717. By this time he had already published a collection of verse, written in 1709.

During his imprisonment, he wrote his longest humorous poem, &quot;Alma; or, The Progress of the Mind&quot;. It was published by subscription in 1718, along with &quot;Poems on Several Occasions.&quot; The sum received for this volume (4000 guineas), with a present of £4000 from Lord Harley, enabled him to live in some comfort.

==Death and Legacy==
Prior died in 1721 at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. A monument to Prior, sculpted by John Michael Rysbrack and designed by Gibbs, was erected in Poets&#x27; Corner of the Abbey.

A biography called &quot;The History of His Own Time&quot; was issued by John Bancks in 1740. The book claimed to be derived from Prior&#x27;s papers, although some scholars doubt its authenticity.

Prior is commemorated by a plaque at Wittenham Clumps in Oxfordshire, where he is said to have written &quot;Henry and Emma&quot;.

He was also commemorated by other poets and writers; Everett James Ellis named Prior as a significant influence and source of inspiration, while William Thackeray (1811-1863) claimed Prior’s works to be “amongst the easiest, the richest, the most charmingly humorous of English lyrical poems.”

<doc id="293226" wikidata="Q276015" url="?curid=293226" title="Analects">
<text>The Analects, also known as the Sayings of Confucius, is an ancient Chinese philosophical text composed of sayings and ideas attributed to Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled by his followers. 

The consensus among scholars is that large portions of the text were composed during the Warring States period (475–221 BC), and that the work achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). During the early Han, the &quot;Analects&quot; was merely considered to be a commentary on the Five Classics. However, by the dynasty&#x27;s end the status of the &quot;Analects&quot; had grown to being among the central texts of Confucianism.

During the late Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) the importance of the &quot;Analects&quot; as a Chinese philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the &quot;Four Books&quot;. The &quot;Analects&quot; has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for more than two millennia; its ideas continue to have a substantial influence on East Asian thought and values.

Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation&#x27;s leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through &quot;ren&quot;, and that the most basic step to cultivating &quot;ren&quot; was filial piety—primarily the devotion to one&#x27;s parents and older siblings. 

He taught that one&#x27;s individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via &quot;li&quot;, rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. Confucius also believed that a ruler&#x27;s sense of &quot;de&quot;, or &#x27;virtue&#x27;, was his primary prerequisite for leadership. 

Confucius&#x27; primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.

== History ==
=== Creation of the text ===
According to Ban Gu, writing in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the &quot;Analects&quot; originated as individual records kept by Confucius&#x27;s disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius&#x27; death in 479 BC. The work was titled &quot;Lunyu&quot; during the Han dynasty: in this context the character for &quot;lun&quot; means &#x27;discuss&#x27; or &#x27;dispute&#x27;, while &quot;yu&quot; means &#x27;speech&#x27; or &#x27;sayings&#x27;. &quot;Lunyu&quot; therefore may mean &#x27;edited conversations&#x27;, or &#x27;selected speeches&#x27; (thus &quot;&quot;). This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the Song dynasty neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stated that &quot;Analects&quot; is the records of Confucius&#x27;s first- and second-generation pupils.

This traditional view has been challenged by Chinese, Japanese, and Western scholars. The Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu argued on linguistic ground that the last five books were produced much later than the rest of the work. Itō Jinsai claimed that, because of differences he saw in patterns of language and content in the &quot;Analects&quot;, a distinction in authorship should be made between the &quot;upper &quot;Analects&quot;&quot; (Books 1–10) and &quot;lower &quot;Analects&quot;&quot; (Books 11–20). Arthur Waley speculated that Books 3–9 represent the earliest parts of the book. E. Bruce Brooks and A. Taeko Brooks reviewed previous theories of the chapters&#x27; creation and produced a &quot;four stratum theory&quot; of the text&#x27;s creation. Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, some time during the Warring States period (476–221 BC), with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings. Prior to 2015, no manuscript dated earlier than has been discovered, and because the &quot;Analects&quot; was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text&#x27;s final compilation. In 2015, the Anhui University acquired a corpus of excavated Warring States period bamboo strips, and they contained fragments of the &quot;Analects&quot; corresponding to the received text.
Regardless of how early the text of the &quot;Analects&quot; existed, most &quot;Analects&quot; scholars believe that by the early Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and that the book acquired its final, complete form during the Han dynasty. However, Han dynasty writer Wang Chong claimed that all copies of the &quot;Analects&quot; that existed during the Han dynasty were incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work. This is supported by the fact that a larger collection of Confucius&#x27;s teachings did exist in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the &quot;Analects&quot;: 75% of Confucius&#x27;s sayings cited by his second-generation student, Mencius, do not exist in the received text of the &quot;Analects&quot;.

=== Textual history ===
According to the Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang, there were two versions of the &quot;Analects&quot; that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the &quot;Lu version&quot; and the &quot;Qi version&quot;. The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.

In the reign of Emperor Jing of Han (), a third &quot;Old Text&quot; version was discovered hidden in a wall of the home believed at the time to have been Confucius&#x27;s, when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu () in order to expand the king&#x27;s palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.

The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden. According to the Han dynasty scholar Huan Tan, the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version—from which the received text is mostly based—and it seriously differed from the Lu version in 27 places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.

Over a century later, , the tutor of the &quot;Analects&quot; to Emperor Cheng of Han, (), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the &quot;Analects&quot; known as the &quot;Zhang Hou Lun&quot;. This text was recognized by Zhang Yu&#x27;s contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the &quot;Analects&quot; today. No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the &quot;Analects&quot; exist today, though fragments of the old text version were discovered at Dunhuang. The Qi version was lost for about 1,800 years, but was rediscovered during the excavation of the tomb of Marquis of Haihun in 2011.

Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the &quot;Analects&quot; known to scholars was found in the &quot;Stone Classics of the Xinping Era&quot;, a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern capital of Luoyang . Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the &quot;Analects&quot; that were written , during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the &quot;Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Pyongyang &quot;Analects&quot;&quot;, after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot; was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang &quot;Analects&quot; was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang &quot;Analects&quot; has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.

The Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot; was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in an earthquake shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the &quot;Analects&quot;. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot; is shorter than the received &quot;Analects&quot;, implying that the text of the &quot;Analects&quot; was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot; was entombed. There was evidence that &quot;additions&quot; may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the &quot;Analects&quot; and included &quot;extra&quot; material for the sake of completeness.

The content of the Pyongyang &quot;Analects&quot; is similar to the Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot;. Because of the secrecy and isolationism of the North Korean government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou &quot;Analects&quot; or the Pyongyang &quot;Analects&quot; represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.

Prior to 2015, the oldest extant manuscript of the &quot;Analects&quot; were the discovered texts found in the Haihunhou Tomb in 2011; the Haihunhou &quot;Analects&quot; &quot;circulated at least seventeen years&quot; before the Dingzhou and Pyongyang ones. The Anhui University in 2015 acquired a corpus of excavated Warring States period bamboo slips that contained fragments of the &quot;Analects&quot; that corresponded to the received text. The manuscript featuring the &quot;Analects&quot; content was officially published by the university in 2022.

=== Importance within Confucianism ===
During most of the Han period the &quot;Analects&quot; was not considered one of the principal texts of Confucianism. During the reign of Han Wudi (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the Five Classics were considered by the government to be canonical (&quot;jing&quot;). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The &quot;Analects&quot; was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius&#x27;s oral &quot;commentary&quot; (&quot;zhuan&quot;) on the Five Classics.

The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the Eastern Han the &quot;Analects&quot; was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the &quot;Analects&quot;. The growing importance of the &quot;Analects&quot; was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the &quot;Seven Classics&quot;: the Five Classics plus the &quot;Analects&quot; and the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late Song dynasty (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the Four Books by Zhu Xi and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.

The writing style of the &quot;Analects&quot; also inspired future Confucian writers. For example, the Sui dynasty writer Wang Tong&#x27;s &quot;Explanation of the Mean&quot; () was purposely written to emulate the style of the &quot;Analects&quot;, a practice praised by the Ming dynasty philosopher Wang Yangming.

=== Commentaries ===

Since the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the &quot;Analects&quot; by reading scholars&#x27; commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the &quot;Analects&quot; since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the &quot;Collected Explanations of the Analects&quot; (&quot;Lunyu Jijie&quot;) by He Yan () and several colleagues, and the &quot;Collected Commentaries of the Analects&quot; (&quot;Lunyu Jizhu&quot;) by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the &quot;Analects&quot; which had been produced by earlier Han and Wei dynasty (220–265 AD) scholars.

He Yan&#x27;s personal interpretation of the &quot;Lunyu&quot; was guided by his belief that Daoism and Confucianism complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that &quot;Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage&quot; (sic). The &quot;Explanations&quot; that was written in 248 AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the &quot;Analects&quot; for nearly 1,000 years, until the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the &quot;Analects&quot; that still exists.

He Yan&#x27;s commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi&#x27;s commentary. Zhu Xi&#x27;s work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu&#x27;s work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single &quot;correct&quot; intellectual orthodoxy that would &quot;save&quot; Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.

In his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the &quot;Analects&quot; by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the &quot;Analects&quot;, demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, &quot;[T]he &quot;Analects&quot; and the &quot;Mencius&quot; are the most important works for students pursuing the Way [...] The words of the &quot;Analects&quot; are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one&#x27;s] nature.&quot;

From the first publication of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the Ming state endorsed Zhu&#x27;s commentary. Until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the &quot;Analects&quot; by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.

== Contents ==
Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, but because the history contains a significant amount of material unverifiable in other sources and possibly legendary, the biographical material on Confucius found in the &quot;Analects&quot; makes the &quot;Analects&quot; arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius. Confucius viewed himself as a &quot;transmitter&quot; of social and political traditions originating in the early Zhou dynasty (), and claimed not to have originated anything (§7.1), but Confucius&#x27;s social and political ideals were not popular in his time.

=== Social philosophy ===
Confucius&#x27; discussions on the nature of the supernatural (§3.12; §6.20; §11.11) indicate his belief that while &quot;ghosts&quot; and &quot;spirits&quot; should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius&#x27; social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of &quot;ren&quot; by every individual in a community.

Later Confucian philosophers explained &quot;ren&quot; as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words &quot;humane&quot;, &quot;altruistic&quot;, or &quot;benevolent&quot;, but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses &quot;ren&quot; in the &quot;Analects&quot;, very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term &quot;ren&quot; to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term &quot;ren&quot; is peculiar to the &quot;Analects&quot;.)

Throughout the &quot;Analects&quot;, Confucius&#x27;s students frequently request that Confucius define &quot;ren&quot; and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students&#x27; questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with &quot;ren&quot; and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of &quot;ren&quot; would speak carefully and modestly (§12.3); be resolute and firm (§12.20), courageous (§14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (§9.28; §6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (§12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (§17.6); and love others (§12.22). Confucius recognized his followers&#x27; disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of &quot;ren&quot;, but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (§7.24).

To Confucius, the cultivation of &quot;ren&quot; involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one&#x27;s own character (§1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated &quot;ren&quot; could be distinguished by their being &quot;simple in manner and slow of speech.&quot; He believed that people could cultivate their sense of &quot;ren&quot; through exercising the inverted Golden Rule: &quot;Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself&quot; (§12.2; §15.23) ; &quot;a man with &quot;ren&quot;, desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed&quot; (§6.28).

Confucius taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (§4.15; see also §5.12; §6.30; §15.24). Confucius regarded the exercise of devotion to one&#x27;s parents and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate &quot;ren&quot;. (§1.2).

Confucius believed that &quot;ren&quot; could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one&#x27;s understanding of &quot;li&quot;: rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (§3.3). Confucius said that one&#x27;s understanding of &quot;li&quot; should inform everything that one says and does (§12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to &quot;li&quot; did not mean suppressing one&#x27;s desires but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one&#x27;s family and broader community.

By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of &quot;li&quot; was the basis of a well-ordered society (§2.3). Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of &quot;li&quot; was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In Confucian philosophy these &quot;five relationships&quot; include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.

&quot;Ren&quot; and &quot;li&quot; have a special relationship in the &quot;Analects&quot;: &quot;li&quot; manages one&#x27;s relationship with one&#x27;s family and close community, while &quot;ren&quot; is practiced broadly and informs one&#x27;s interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of &quot;ren&quot; and &quot;li&quot; meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: &quot;You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion&quot; (§9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (§15.8).

=== Political philosophy ===
Confucius&#x27; political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord&quot; (§2.3; see also §13.6). Confucius&#x27; political theories were directly contradictory to the Legalistic political orientations of China&#x27;s rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China&#x27;s leaders within his own lifetime.

Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China&#x27;s ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of Qi asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: &quot;Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son&quot; (§12.11).

The analysis of the need to raise officials&#x27; behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the rectification of names, and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (§13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (§12.19).

Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of &quot;de&quot; (&#x27;virtue&#x27;): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (§2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of &quot;de&quot; is through a devotion to the correct practices of &quot;li&quot;. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler&#x27;s &quot;de&quot; include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.

=== Education ===
The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the &quot;Analects&quot;. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (§7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (§2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the &quot;Analects&quot; as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (§7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (§3.8)

His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things (§12.11; see also §13.3). He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn (§7.7; §15.38). He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught practical skills, but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.

=== Chapters ===
The traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three incipits. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the &quot;Analects&quot; are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.

Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius&#x27;s behaviors in various daily activities. Voltaire and Ezra Pound believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. Simon Leys, who recently translated the &quot;Analects&quot; into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. Elias Canetti wrote: &quot;Confucius&#x27;s &quot;Analects&quot; is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important.&quot;

Chapter 20, &quot;Yao Yue&quot;, particularly the first verse, is bizarre in terms of both language and content. In terms of language, the text appears to be archaic (or a deliberate imitation of the archaic language of the Western Zhou) and bears some similarity with the language of the speeches in the &quot;Shujing&quot;. In terms of the content, the passage appears to be an admonition by Yao to Shun on the eve of Yao&#x27;s abdication, which seems to be only tangentially related to Confucius and his philosophy. Moreover, there appear to be some problems with the text&#x27;s continuity, and scholars have speculated that parts of the text were lost in the process of transmission and possibly transmitted with errors in the order. The fragmentary nature of the final chapter of the received Lu text has been explained by the &quot;accretion theory&quot;, in which the text of the &quot;Analects&quot; was gradually accreted over a 230-year period, beginning with the death of Confucius and ending suddenly with the conquest of Lu in 249 BC.

Within these incipits, a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic &quot;ziyue&quot;, &quot;The Master said,&quot; but without punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows &quot;ziyue&quot; is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as &quot;the Master said that..&quot; and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.

<text>São Tomé is the capital and largest city of the Central African island country of São Tomé and Príncipe. Its name is Portuguese for &quot;Saint Thomas&quot;. Founded in the 15th century, it is one of Africa&#x27;s oldest colonial cities.

==History==

Álvaro Caminha founded the colony of São Tomé in 1493. The Portuguese came to São Tomé in search of land to grow sugarcane. The island was uninhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese sometime around 1470. São Tomé, situated about north of the equator, had a climate wet enough to grow sugarcane in wild abundance. In 1497, 2,000 Jewish children, eight years old and under, were taken from the Iberian peninsula, to receive catholic education, following the national policy of conversion to Catholicism. The nearby African Kingdom of Kongo eventually became a source of slave labor as well. The island of São Tomé was the main center of sugar production in the sixteenth century; it was overtaken by Brazil by 1600.

São Tomé is centred on a sixteenth-century cathedral, that was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. Another early building is Fort São Sebastião, built in 1566 and now the São Tomé National Museum. On July 9, 1595, a slave revolt led by Rei Amador took control of the capital; they were subjugated in 1596. In 1599, the Dutch took the city as well as the islands for two days; they re-occupied it in 1641 for a year. The city served as the capital of the Portuguese colony of São Tomé and Príncipe and, from São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s independence in 1975, as capital of the sovereign nation.

<doc id="293240" wikidata="Q682207" url="?curid=293240" title="François de Bourbon, Prince of Conti">
<text>François de Bourbon, Prince of Conti (19 August 1558 – 3 August 1614) was the third son of Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, a junior line of the House of Bourbon, and his first wife Eléanor de Roucy de Roye. He was given the title of Marquis of Conti and between 1581 and 1597 was elevated to the rank of a prince. The title of Prince of Conti was honorary and did not carry any territorial jurisdiction.

==Biography==

François was born in La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, in the Île-de-France region. He was a member of a junior line of the House of Bourbon, his first cousin being the future Henry IV of France. Brought up within a highly Protestant family, his mother died in 1564 followed by his father in 1569. His father remarried Françoise d&#x27;Orléans, Mademoiselle de Longueville in 1565 and had a further three children, Charles, Count of Soissons being the only child to survive infancy.
Conti, who belonged to the older faith, appears to have taken no part in the French Wars of Religion until 1587, when his distrust of Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise caused him to declare against the League and to support his cousin Henry of Navarre, afterwards King Henry IV.

In 1589 after the murder of Henry III he was one of the two &quot;princes of the blood&quot; who signed the declaration recognising Henry IV as king, and continued to support him even though he himself was mentioned as a candidate for the throne upon the death of Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon in 1590.

Conti&#x27;s first wife was Jeanne de Coesme, heiress of Bonnétable. She was the mother of Anne de Montafié by her previous marriage to the Count of Montafié. The couple were married at the Palais du Louvre on 17 December 1581, Jeanne died in 1601 having had no children. On 24 July 1605 he married Louise Marguerite of Lorraine (1588–1631), daughter of Duke Henri of Guise and Catherine of Cleves, who was desired by Henry IV. The couple were married at the Château de Meudon. Conti died in 1614 and the title of Prince of Conti lapsed following his death in 1614, as his only child, Marie, predeceased him in 1610. She was only three weeks old.

His widow followed the fortunes of Maria de&#x27; Medici, from whom she received many marks of favour, and was secretly married to François de Bassompierre, who joined her in conspiring against Cardinal Richelieu. Upon the exposure of the plot the cardinal exiled her to her estate at Eu, near Amiens, where she died.

==Issue==
*Marie de Bourbon (8 March 1610 – 20 March 1610) died in infancy.

He also had an illegitimate son;

*Nicolas de Conti (d. 1648), abbot of Gramont

<doc id="293242" wikidata="Q7127487" url="?curid=293242" title="Palgrave's Golden Treasury">
<text>The Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics is a popular anthology of English poetry, originally selected for publication by Francis Turner Palgrave in 1861. It was considerably revised, with input from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, about three decades later. Palgrave excluded all poems by poets then still alive.

The book continues to be published in regular new editions; still under Palgrave&#x27;s name. These reproduce Palgrave&#x27;s selections and notes, but usually include a supplement of more recent poems.

<text>Henry Flynt (born 1940 in Greensboro, North Carolina) is an American philosopher, musician, writer, activist, and artist connected to the 1960s New York avant-garde. He coined the term &quot;concept art&quot; in the early 1960s, during which time he was associated with figures in the Fluxus scene. He later received attention for his anti-art demonstrations against New York cultural institutions in 1963 and 1964.

Since 1983, he has focused on philosophical writing related to nihilism, science, mathematical logic, post-capitalist economics, and personhood. A number of his archival musical recordings, which fuse hillbilly music with avant-garde techniques, were released in the 2000s. He has collaborated with artists such as C.C. Hennix, La Monte Young, George Maciunas, and John Berndt.

==Background==
Henry Flynt was born and raised in North Carolina, where he first studied classical violin. He became interested in logical positivism as a teenager, and later attended Harvard University on a scholarship, where he studied mathematics alongside companions Tony Conrad and John Alten. At Harvard, Flynt was introduced to jazz and the &quot;New Music&quot; of John Cage by graduate students Christian Wolff and Frederic Rzewski, and he also discovered country blues music through Samuel Charters&#x27;s 1959 book on the subject at this time. He soon dropped out and visited New York in 1960, where through Conrad he was introduced to La Monte Young and other figures in the city&#x27;s avant-garde scene. Young would dedicate his 1960 composition &quot;X for Henry Flynt&quot; to him. In 1960 and 1961, Flynt took part in the monthly concert series held at Yoko Ono&#x27;s Chambers Street loft. He moved permanently to New York in 1963.

Flynt’s work developed from what he called &quot;cognitive nihilism&quot;, a concept he first announced in the 1960 and 1961 drafts of a paper called &quot;Philosophy Proper.&quot; The concept derives from insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics, and aims to turn the principles of scientific positivism and analytical philosophy against themselves. Embracing Rudolf Carnap&#x27;s empiricism and his positivist critique of metaphysics, Flynt concluded that science itself did not satisfy the syntactical criteria for empirical claims; he therefore set about developing a &quot;radical empiricism&quot; (or &quot;radical unbelief&quot;) which undermined scientific systematization and much &quot;avant-garde&quot; art. Flynt refined these dispensations in the essay &quot;Is there language?&quot; that was published as &quot;Primary Study&quot; in 1964.

==Concept art and activism==
In 1961, Flynt coined the term &quot;concept art&quot; in the proto-Fluxus book &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; (co-published by Jackson Mac Low and La Monte Young), released in 1963, alongside works by Fluxus artists such as George Brecht and Dick Higgins. Flynt&#x27;s &quot;concept art&quot;, he maintained, devolved from cognitive nihilism and described art in which the medium was concepts. Drawing exclusively on the syntax of logic and mathematics, concept art was meant to surpass both mathematics and &quot;serious&quot; compositional practices by evacuating concepts of substance via logical paradox. Flynt maintained that, to merit the label &quot;concept art&quot;, a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which the material is a linguistic concept, a quality which he claims is absent from subsequent &quot;conceptual art&quot;.

In 1962, Flynt began to campaign for an anti-art approach to the arts. He advocated that avant-garde art and its institutions be superseded by the terms of &quot;veramusement&quot; and &quot;brend&quot;—neologisms meaning (approximately) pure recreation. As part of his campaign, he demonstrated against cultural institutions in New York City (such as MoMA and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts) with Tony Conrad and Jack Smith in 1963 and against the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen twice in 1964 (accusing Stockhausen of white supremacy and cultural imperialism). Flynt read publicly from his text, &quot;From Culture to Veramusment&quot;, at Walter De Maria&#x27;s loft on February 28, 1963—an act which can, in hindsight, be considered performance art. In the mid 1960s, Flynt converted himself to Marxism, joining the Workers World Party, and published the article &quot;Communists Must Give Revolutionary Leadership in Culture&quot; in collaboration with George Maciunas, criticizing the white supremacist cultural touchstones of the left-wing tradition and championing African-American music. From 1964 to 1966, Flynt wrote regularly for the WWP&#x27;s &quot;Workers World&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Harry Stone&quot;, and edited the newspaper briefly in 1965. He left the party in 1967 after becoming dissatisfied with the party&#x27;s support of the Soviet Union.

In 1987 he revived his &quot;concept art&quot; for tactical reasons; and spent seven years in the art world.

==Music==
Henry Flynt is known for musical work that attempts to fuse hillbilly music with the avant-garde, often with him performing on violin or guitar. Other influences included the free jazz of Ornette Coleman; rockabilly and country blues music; and the North Indian classical music he learned with singer Pandit Pran Nath. With the exception of the 1981 German cassette &quot;You Are My Everlovin&#x27;/Celestial Power&quot;, Flynt&#x27;s recordings remained unreleased until the 21st century, via labels such as Recorded and Locust.

Flynt performed duets with La Monte Young in the 1960s, but recordings of these performances were rejected by Mainstream Records employee Earle Brown as being too unconventional for a classical label. In an early 1960s conversation with John Cage, Flynt announced his intention to abandon &quot;serious&quot; modern composition and pursue music in the style of rock artists like Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, to which Cage expressed confusion. Flynt briefly performed violin with the Velvet Underground in 1966 as a fill-in for John Cale, and received guitar lessons from Lou Reed. In 1966, he recorded several rehearsal demo tapes with Walter De Maria, Art Murphy, and Paul Breslin in the garage rock band the Insurrections, which were later compiled and released in 2004 on Locust Music as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna&quot;.

In 1974 and 1975, Flynt led the group Nova&#x27;Billy and recorded material spanning rock, jazz, country, and funk that was later collected on &quot;Henry Flynt &amp; Nova&#x27;Billy&quot; (Locust, 2007). With Catherine Christer Hennix, Flynt formed the jazz-rock group Dharma Warriors in 1978, initially including Arthur Russell on keyboard. &quot;Dharma Warriors&quot; (Locust, 2008) showcases another meeting between Hennix &amp; Flynt recorded in 1980 in Woodstock, New York. &quot;Purified by the Fire&quot;, recorded in December 1981, features Hennix on tamboura and Flynt on electric violin and was released in 2005 on Locust.

Flynt&#x27;s first CD release was a reissue of &quot;You Are My Everlovin&#x27;/Celestial Power&quot; on Recorded (curated by John Berndt, and initiating the &quot;New American Ethnic Music&quot; series on that label), quickly followed by &quot;Spindizzy&quot; and &quot;Hillbilly Tape Music&quot; also on Recorded. Later Recorded released NAEM 4, &quot;Ascent to The Sun.&quot; Recently, Flynt&#x27;s &quot;Glissando No. 1&quot; was published by Recorded (2010).

==Philosophy==
Flynt&#x27;s philosophical writing attempts to sketch out a post-capitalist, post-scientific civilization which would be at odds with the current civilization&#x27;s values. Flynt&#x27;s early philosophical writings on logic and epistemology, including the 1961 draft of &quot;Philosophy Proper&quot;, was published in Milan in the book &quot;Blueprint for a Higher Civilization&quot; (1975). Deriving broadly from his early arguments around &quot;cognitive nihilism&quot; and positivism, Flynt&#x27;s work aims to overturn the dogmatic scientism and apparent coherence of contemporary scientific and mathematical discourse.

In the early 1970s, he returned to college to study communist economics. In the late 1970s, he organized several meetings on the &quot;crisis in physics&quot; in an attempt to identify the areas where modern science represses incoherent or irrational logics in order to propagate its &quot;objective&quot; worldview. From about 1980, Flynt has written on philosophy and economics in mostly unpublished papers, focusing on two concepts which did not achieve the notoriety of the early actions: his concepts of meta-technology and personhood theory. These concepts continue his work in sketching a worldview which would supersede scientific objectification and dissolve contemporary determinations of objective reality. Much of his writing is now available on his website.

==Relationship with Fluxus==
Because of his friendship and collaboration with La Monte Young and George Maciunas, Flynt sometimes is linked to Fluxus. While Flynt himself describes Fluxus as his &quot;publisher of last resort&quot; (Flynt did permit Fluxus to publish his work, and took part in several Fluxus exhibitions) he claims no affiliation or interest in the Fluxus sensibility. In fact, he is a strong critic of the neo-Dada sensibility.
