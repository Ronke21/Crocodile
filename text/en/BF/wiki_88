<text>Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard disk drive, solid-state drive, floppy disk, memory card or USB flash drive for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part of the formatting process that performs basic medium preparation is often referred to as &quot;low-level formatting&quot;. Partitioning is the common term for the second part of the process, dividing the device into several sub-devices and, in some cases, writing information to the device allowing an operating system to be booted from it. The third part of the process, usually termed &quot;high-level formatting&quot; most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. In some operating systems all or parts of these three processes can be combined or repeated at different levels and the term &quot;format&quot; is understood to mean an operation in which a new disk medium is fully prepared to store files. Some formatting utilities allow distinguishing between a quick format, which does not erase all existing data and a long option that does erase all existing data.

As a general rule, formatting a disk by default leaves most if not all existing data on the disk medium; some or most of which might be recoverable with privileged or special tools. Special tools can remove user data by a single overwrite of all files and free space.

== History ==

A block, a contiguous number of bytes, is the minimum unit of storage that is read from and written to a disk by a disk driver. The earliest disk drives had fixed block sizes (e.g. the IBM 350 disk storage unit (of the late 1950s) block size was 100 six-bit characters) but starting with the 1301 IBM marketed subsystems that featured variable block sizes: a particular track could have blocks of different sizes. The disk subsystems and other direct access storage devices on the IBM System/360 expanded this concept in the form of Count Key Data (CKD) and later Extended Count Key Data (ECKD); however the use of variable block size in HDDs fell out of use in the 1990s; one of the last HDDs to support variable block size was the IBM 3390 Model 9, announced May 1993.

Modern hard disk drives, such as Serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Serial ATA (SATA) drives, appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of fixed-size blocks; for many years 512 bytes long but beginning in 2009 and accelerating through 2011, all major hard disk drive manufacturers began releasing hard disk drive platforms using the Advanced Format of 4096 byte logical blocks.

Floppy disks generally only used fixed block sizes but these sizes were a function of the host&#x27;s OS and its interaction with its controller so that a particular type of media (e.g., 5¼-inch DSDD) would have different block sizes depending upon the host OS and controller.

Optical discs generally only use fixed block sizes.

== Disk formatting process ==

Formatting a disk for use by an operating system and its applications typically involves three different processes.

# Low-level formatting (i.e., closest to the hardware) marks the surfaces of the disks with markers indicating the start of a recording block (typically today called sector markers) and other information like block CRC to be used later, in normal operations, by the disk controller to read or write data. This is intended to be the permanent foundation of the disk, and is often completed at the factory.
# Partitioning divides a disk into one or more regions, writing data structures to the disk to indicate the beginning and end of the regions. This level of formatting often includes checking for defective tracks or defective sectors.
# High-level formatting creates the file system format within a disk partition or a logical volume. This formatting includes the data structures used by the OS to identify the logical drive or partition&#x27;s contents. This may occur during operating system installation, or when adding a new disk. Disk and distributed file system may specify an optional boot block, and/or various volume and directory information for the operating system.

=== Low-level formatting of floppy disks ===

The low-level format of floppy disks (and early hard disks) is performed by the disk drive&#x27;s controller.

For a standard 1.44 MB floppy disk, low-level formatting normally writes 18 sectors of 512 bytes to each of 160 tracks (80 on each side) of the floppy disk, providing 1,474,560 bytes of storage on the disk.

Physical sectors are actually larger than 512 bytes, as in addition to the 512 byte data field they include a sector identifier field, CRC bytes (in some cases error correction bytes) and gaps between the fields. These additional bytes are not normally included in the quoted figure for overall storage capacity of the disk.

Different low-level formats can be used on the same media; for example, large records can be used to cut down on inter-record gap size.

Several freeware, shareware and free software programs (e.g. GParted, FDFORMAT, NFORMAT, VGA-Copy and 2M) allowed considerably more control over formatting, allowing the formatting of high-density 3.5&quot; disks with a capacity up to 2 MB.

Techniques used include:

* head/track sector skew (moving the sector numbering forward at side change and track stepping to reduce mechanical delay),
* interleaving sectors (to boost throughput by organizing the sectors on the track),
* increasing the number of sectors per track (while a normal 1.44 MB format uses 18 sectors per track, it is possible to increase this to a maximum of 21), and
* increasing the number of tracks (most drives could tolerate extension to 82 tracks: though some could handle more, others could jam).

Linux supports a variety of sector sizes, and DOS and Windows support a large-record-size DMF-formatted floppy format.

After establishing the structure of tracks, a formatter also needs to fill the entire floppy and look for bad sectors. Traditionally, the physical sectors were initialized with a fill value of codice_1 as per the INT 1Eh&#x27;s Disk Parameter Table (DPT) during format on IBM compatible machines. This value is also used on the Atari Portfolio. CP/M 8-inch floppies typically came pre-formatted with a value of codice_2, and by way of Digital Research this value was also used on Atari ST and some Amstrad formatted floppies. Amstrad otherwise used codice_3 as a fill value.

=== Low-level formatting (LLF) of hard disks ===
Hard disk drives prior to the 1990s typically had a separate disk controller that defined how data was encoded on the media. With the media, the drive and/or the controller possibly procured from separate vendors, users were often able to perform low-level formatting. Separate procurement also had the potential of incompatibility between the separate components such that the subsystem would not reliably store data.

User-instigated low-level formatting (LLF) of hard disk drives was common for minicomputer and personal computer systems until the 1990s. IBM and other mainframe system vendors typically supplied their hard disk drives (or media in the case of removable media HDDs) with a low-level format. Typically this involved subdividing each track on the disk into one or more blocks which would contain the user data and associated control information. Different computers used different block sizes and IBM notably used variable block sizes but the popularity of the IBM PC caused the industry to adopt a standard of 512 user data bytes per block by the middle 1980s.

Depending upon the system, low-level formatting was generally done by an operating system utility. IBM compatible PCs used the BIOS, which is invoked using the MS-DOS debug program, to transfer control to a routine hidden at different addresses in different BIOSes.

==== Transition away from LLF ====

Starting in the late 1980s, driven by the volume of IBM compatible PCs, HDDs became routinely available pre-formatted with a compatible low-level format. At the same time, the industry moved from &quot;historical (dumb) bit serial interfaces&quot; to modern (intelligent) &quot;bit serial interfaces&quot; and &quot;word serial interfaces&quot; wherein the low-level format was performed at the factory. Accordingly, it is not possible for an end user to low-level format a modern hard disk drive.

=== Modern disks: reinitialization ===
Modern hard drives can no longer perform post-production LLF, i.e. to re-establish the basic layout of &quot;tracks&quot; and &quot;blocks&quot; on the recording surface. &quot;Reinitialization&quot; refers to processes that return a disk to a factory-like configuration: no data, no partitioning, all blocks available to use.

==== Command-set support ====
SCSI provides a command. This command performs the needed certification step to weed out bad sectors and has the ability to change sector size. The command-line sg_format program may be used to issue the command. A variety of sector sizes may be chosen, but are not available on all devices: 512, 520, 524, 528, 4096, 4112, 4160, and 4224-byte sectors. Although the SCSI command provides many options, even resizing, it does not touch on the track layer where low-level format happens.

ATA does not expose a low-level format functionality, but they allow the sector size to be changed via ( in codice_4). (Consumer drives usually only support 512 and 4096-byte sectors.) Although sector-size change may scramble data, it is not a safe way of erasing data, nor is any certification done. ATA offers a separate ( in codice_4) command for erasure.

NVMe drives have a standard method of formatting, available in, for example, the Linux command-line program . Sector size change and secure erase options are available. Note that NVMe drives are generally solid-state, making this &quot;track&quot; distinction useless.

Seagate Technology drives offer a TTL serial debugging console. Among other things, the console can format the &quot;system&quot; and &quot;user&quot; partitions while performing defect checks (re-initialization over pre-established logical blocks) and modify track parameters (managing the &quot;real&quot; low-level format).

==== Disk-filling ====
When the hard drive&#x27;s built-in reinitialization function (see above) is unavailable due to driver or system limitations, it is possible to fill the entire disk instead. On older hard drives without bad sector management, a program will also need to check for any damaged sectors and try to spare them out. On newer drives with defect management, reallocated sectors may be left unerased, whereas the built-in re-initialization function will erase them.

In modern times, it is most common to fill hard drives with value of codice_6. One popular method for performing this zero-fill operation on a hard disk is by writing zero-value bytes to the drive using the Unix dd utility with the /dev/zero stream as the input file and the drive itself (or a specific partition) as the output file. This command may take many hours to complete, and will erase all files and file systems.

A value of codice_7 is used on flash disks to reduce wear . The latter value is typically also the default value used on ROM disks (which cannot be reformatted). Some advanced tools allow configuring the fill value.

Zero-filling a drive is not a secure method of preparing a drive for use with an encrypted filesystem. Doing so voids the plausible deniability of the process, as the encrypted areas (indistinguishable from random without a key, unless the cipher is compromised) will stand out among zero blocks. The correct technique is to zero-fill inside a temporary encrypted layer then discard the key and layer setup. (/dev/urandom provides similar safety, but tends to be slow.)

==== Confusion ====

The present ambiguity in the term &quot;low-level format&quot; seems to be due to both inconsistent documentation on web sites and the belief by many users that any process below a high-level (file system) format must be called a &quot;low-level&quot; format. Since much of the low-level formatting process can today only be performed at the factory, various drive manufacturers describe reinitialization software as LLF utilities on their web sites. Since users generally have no way to determine the difference between a complete LLF and &quot;reinitialization&quot; (they simply observe running the software results in a hard disk that must be high-level formatted), both the misinformed user and mixed signals from various drive manufacturers have perpetuated this error.

Note: whatever possible misuse of such terms may exist, many sites do make such &quot;reinitialization&quot; utilities available (possibly as bootable floppy diskette or CD image files), to both overwrite every byte &quot;and&quot; check for damaged sectors on the hard disk.

=== Partitioning ===
Partitioning is the process of writing information into blocks of a storage device or medium to divide the device into several sub-devices, each of which is treated by the operating system as a separate device and, in some cases, to allow an operating system to be booted from the device.

On MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and UNIX-based operating systems (such as BSD, Linux and macOS) this is normally done with a partition editor, such as fdisk, GNU Parted, or Disk Utility. These operating systems support multiple partitions.

Floppy disks are not partitioned; however depending upon the OS they may require volume information in order to be accessed by the OS.

Partition editors and ICKDSF today do not handle low-level functions for HDDs and optical disc drives such as writing timing marks, and they cannot reinitialize a modern disk that has been degaussed or otherwise lost the factory formatting.

IBM operating systems derived from CP-67, e.g., z/VM, maintain partitioning information for minidisks externally to the drive.

=== High-level formatting ===

High-level formatting is the process of setting up an empty file system on a disk partition or a logical volume and for PCs, installing a boot sector. This is often a fast operation, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;quick formatting&quot;.

Formatting an entire logical drive or partition may optionally scan for defects, which may take considerable time.

In the case of floppy disks, both high- and low-level formatting are customarily performed in one pass by the disk formatting software. Eight-inch floppies typically came low-level formatted and were filled with a format filler value of codice_2. Since the 1990s, most 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppies have been shipped pre-formatted from the factory as DOS FAT12 floppies.

In current IBM mainframe operating systems derived from OS/360 and DOS/360, such as z/OS and z/VSE, formatting of drives is done by the INIT command of the ICKDSF utility. These OSs support only a single partition per device, called a volume. The ICKDSF functions include writing a Record 0 on every track, writing IPL text, creating a volume label, creating a Volume Table of Contents (VTOC) and, optionally, creating a VTOC index (VTOCIX); high level formatting may also be done as part of allocating a file, by a utility specific to a file system or, in some older access methods, on the fly as new data are written. In z/OS Unix System Services, there are three distinct levels of high-level formatting:
*Initializing a volume with ICKDSF
*Initializing a VSAM Linear Data Set (LDS) as part of allocating it on the volume with Access Method Services (IDCAMS) DEFINE
*Initializing a zFS aggregate in the LDS using ioeagfmt.

In IBM operating systems derived from CP-67, formatting a volume initializes track 0 and a dummy VTOC. Guest operating systems are responsible for formatting minidisks; the CMS FORMAT command formats a CMS file system on a CMS minidisk.

== Host protected area ==
The host protected area, sometimes referred to as hidden protected area, is an area of a hard drive that is high-level formatted such that the area is not normally visible to its operating system (OS).

== Reformatting ==
Reformatting is a high-level formatting performed on a functioning disk drive to free the medium of its contents. Reformatting is unique to each operating system because what actually is done to existing data varies by OS. The most important aspect of the process is that it frees disk space for use by other data. To actually &quot;erase&quot; everything requires overwriting each block of data on the medium; something that is not done by many high-level formatting utilities.

Reformatting often carries the implication that the operating system and all other software will be reinstalled after the format is complete. Rather than fixing an installation suffering from malfunction or security compromise, it may be necessary to simply reformat everything and start from scratch. Various colloquialisms exist for this process, such as &quot;wipe and reload&quot;, &quot;nuke and pave&quot;, &quot;reimage&quot;, etc. However, reformatting a drive containing only user data does not require reinstallation of the OS.

== Formatting ==

=== DOS, OS/2 and Windows ===
&quot;format command&quot;: Under MS-DOS, PC DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, disk formatting can be performed by the codice_9 command. The codice_10 program usually asks for confirmation beforehand to prevent accidental removal of data, but some versions of DOS have an undocumented codice_11 option; if used, the usual confirmation is skipped and the format begins right away. The WM/FormatC macro virus uses this command to format drive C: as soon as a document is opened.

&quot;Unconditional format&quot;: There is also the codice_12 parameter that performs an &quot;unconditional&quot; format which under most circumstances overwrites the entire partition, preventing the recovery of data through software. Note however that the codice_12 switch only works reliably with floppy diskettes (see image to the right). Technically because unless codice_14 is used, floppies are always low level formatted in addition to high-level formatted. Under certain circumstances with hard drive partitions, however, the codice_12 switch merely prevents the creation of codice_16 information in the partition to be formatted while otherwise leaving the partition&#x27;s contents entirely intact (still on disk but marked deleted). In such cases, the user&#x27;s data remain ripe for recovery with specialist tools such as EnCase or disk editors. Reliance upon codice_12 for secure overwriting of hard drive partitions is therefore inadvisable, and purpose-built tools such as DBAN should be considered instead.

&quot;Overwriting&quot;: In Windows Vista and upwards the non-quick format will overwrite as it goes. Not the case in Windows XP and below.

&quot;OS/2&quot;: Under OS/2, format will overwrite the entire partition or logical drive if the codice_18 parameter is used, which specifies a &quot;long&quot; format. Doing so enhances the ability of CHKDSK to recover files.

=== Unix-like operating systems ===

High-level formatting of disks on these systems is traditionally done using the codice_19 command. On Linux (and potentially other systems as well) codice_20 is typically a wrapper around filesystem-specific commands which have the name codice_21, where &quot;fsname&quot; is the name of the filesystem with which to format the disk. Some filesystems which are not supported by certain implementations of codice_20 have their own manipulation tools; for example Ntfsprogs provides a format utility for the NTFS filesystem.

Some Unix and Unix-like operating systems have higher-level formatting tools, usually for the purpose of making disk formatting easier and/or allowing the user to partition the disk with the same tool. Examples include GNU Parted (and its various GUI frontends such as GParted and the KDE Partition Manager) and the Disk Utility application on Mac OS X.

== Recovery of data from a formatted disk ==

As in file deletion by the operating system, data on a disk are not fully erased during every high-level format. Instead, the area on the disk containing the data is merely marked as available, and retains the old data until it is overwritten. If the disk is formatted with a different file system than the one which previously existed on the partition, some data may be overwritten that wouldn&#x27;t be if the same file system had been used. However, under some file systems (e.g., NTFS, but not FAT), the file indices (such as $MFTs under NTFS, inodes under ext2/3, etc.) may not be written to the same exact locations. And if the partition size is increased, even FAT file systems will overwrite more data at the beginning of that new partition.

From the perspective of preventing the recovery of sensitive data through recovery tools, the data must be completely overwritten (every sector), either by a separate tool, or during formatting. Data are destroyed in DOS, OS/2, and Windows when the /L (long) option is used on format and always for a Partitioned Data Set (PDS) in MVS and for newer file systems on IBM mainframes.
It is disputed whether one pass of zero-fill is enough to destroy sensitive data on older (until 1990s) magnetic storage: Gutmann (known for his 35-pass Gutmann method) claims that magnetic force microscopy may be able to &quot;see&quot; old bits on a floppy, but the sources he cited does not prove such. Random fill is believed to be stronger than a fixed pattern fill. One pass of zero fill is sufficient to prevent data remanence, according to NIST (2014) and Wright et al (2008). The &quot;Secure Erase&quot; option built into hard drives is considered trustworthy, with the caveat that early solid state drives are known to mis-implement the function.

Degaussing is effective without controversy; however, this may render the drive unusable.

<doc id="305746" wikidata="Q2254408" url="?curid=305746" title="Sauria">
<text>Sauria is the clade of diapsids containing the most recent common ancestor of Archosauria (which includes crocodilians and birds) and Lepidosauria (which includes squamates and the tuatara), and all its descendants. Since most molecular phylogenies recover turtles as more closely related to archosaurs than to lepidosaurs as part of Archelosauria, Sauria can be considered the crown group of diapsids, or reptiles in general. Depending on the systematics, Sauria includes all modern reptiles or most of them (including birds, a type of archosaur) as well as various extinct groups.

Sauria lies within the larger total group Sauropsida, which also contains various stem-reptiles which are more closely related to reptiles than to mammals. Prior to its modern usage, &quot;Sauria&quot; was used as a name for the suborder occupied by lizards, which before 1800 were considered crocodilians.

==Systematics==
Sauria was historically used as a partial equivalent for Squamata (which contains lizards and snakes). The redefinition to cover the last common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs was the result of papers by Jacques A. Gauthier and colleagues in the 1980s.

Genomic studies and comprehensive studies in the fossil record suggest that turtles are closely related to archosaurs as part of Sauria, and not to the non-saurian parareptiles as previously thought. In a 2018 cladistic analysis, Pantestudines (turtles and close relatives) were placed within Diapsida but outside of Sauria.

===Synapomorphies===
The synapomorphies or characters that unite the clade Sauria also help them be distinguished from stem-saurians in Diapsida or stem-reptiles in clade Sauropsida in the following categories based on the following regions of the body.
*Cephalad Region
**Dorsal origin of temporal musculature
**Loss of caniniform region in maxillary tooth row
**External nares close to the midline
**Postparietal absent
**Squamosal mainly restricted to top of skull
**The occipital flange of the squamosal is little exposed on the occiput
**Anterior process of squamosal narrow
**Quadrate exposed laterally
**Unossified dorsal process of stapes
**Stapes slender
*Trunk Region
**Sacral ribs oriented laterally
**Ontogenetic fusion of caudal ribs
**Trunk ribs mostly single headed
*Pectoral Region
**Cleithrum absent
*Pelvic Region
**Modified ilium
*Limb Region
**Tubular bone lost
**Entepicondylar foramen absent
**Radius as long as ulna
**Small proximal carpals and tarsal
**Fifth distal tarsal absent
**Short and stout fifth or hooked metatarsal
**Perforating foramen of manus lost

However, some of these characters might be lost or modified in several lineages, particularly among birds and turtles; it is best to see these characters as the ancestral features that were present in the ancestral saurian.

===Phylogeny===
The cladogram shown below follows the most likely result found by an analysis of turtle relationships using both fossil and genetic evidence by M.S. Lee, in 2013. This study found &quot;Eunotosaurus&quot;, usually regarded as a turtle relative, to be only very distantly related to turtles in the clade Parareptilia.
The cladogram below follows the most likely result found by another analysis of turtle relationships, this one using only fossil evidence, published by Rainer Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. This study found &quot;Eunotosaurus&quot; to be an actual early stem-turtle, though other versions of the analysis found weak support for it as a parareptile.
The cladogram below follows the analysis of Li &quot;et al&quot;. (2018). It places turtles within Diapsida but outside of Sauria (the Lepidosauromorpha + Archosauromorpha clade).
The following cladogram was found by Simões &quot;et al&quot;. (2022):

<doc id="305748" wikidata="Q772956" url="?curid=305748" title="Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria">
<text>The Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (often abbreviated as NAV) is a standardized nomenclature. It is made by World Association of Veterinary Anatomists (WAVA). It is used as the standard reference for anatomical (zootomical) terminology in the field of veterinary science regarding domestic mammals (domestic birds are regarded in the &quot;Nomina Anatomica Avium&quot;). It is based on cats, dogs, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, rabbits and horses—horses being their main subjects.

== History ==
Veterinary anatomists split at the 6th International Congress of the International Anatomical Nomenclature Committee in Paris in 1955, due to disagreements about the &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot;. Following professor Clement Bressou in 1959 in Freiburg (Germany), they formed the International Committee on Veterinary Anatomical Nomenclature, renamed World Association of Veterinary Anatomists in 1962, and published the first edition of the &quot;Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV)&quot; in 1968. There have been six editions of the &quot;NAV&quot;, the latest one published in 2017. The 4th edition, published in 1994, was the last commercially printed edition, fifth and sixth edition are available in pdf.

<doc id="305751" wikidata="Q1194568" url="?curid=305751" title="Tsuen Wan line">
<text>The Tsuen Wan line () is one of the ten lines of the metro network in Hong Kong&#x27;s MTR. It is indicated in  on the MTR map.

There are 16 stations on the line. The southern terminus is Central station on Hong Kong Island and the northwestern terminus is Tsuen Wan station in the New Territories. A journey on the entire line takes 35 minutes.

As a cross-harbour route that goes through the heart of Kowloon and densely populated Sham Shui Po and Kwai Chung, the line is very heavily travelled.

==History==

===Construction===
The Tsuen Wan line was the second of the three original lines of the MTR network. The initial plan for this line was somewhat different from the current line, especially in the names and the construction characteristics of the New Territories section.

The original plan envisioned a terminus in a valley further west of the present Tsuen Wan station. That Tsuen Wan West station is different from the current Tsuen Wan West station on the Tuen Ma line, which is located under land reclaimed at a much later time. The line was supposed to run underground in Tsuen Wan rather than on the ground level, as is currently the case.

The approved route was truncated, terminating at Tsuen Wan station. The construction of the Tsuen Wan Extension project was approved in 1975 and commenced soon afterwards. Testing of the new line began on 1 March 1982.

The extension was formally opened on 10 May 1982 by Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, the acting governor and former chairman of the Mass Transit Railway Provisional Authority. The project was opened seven and a half months ahead of schedule, and cost HK$3.9 billion, under budget compared to the original estimate of HK$4.1 billion.

The new section from Tsuen Wan to Lai King and skipping all intermediate stations to Prince Edward opened on 17 May 1982 and joined the section under Nathan Road in Kowloon that had been in service since 1979 as part of the Kwun Tong line. On opening, Prince Edward was an interchange-only station with no option to enter or exit. It did not become a standard station until the remaining stations on the line in Sham Shui Po District, i.e. Sham Shui Po, Cheung Sha Wan, Lai Chi Kok and Mei Foo, opened a week later.

Several stations differ in names or location from the initial plan. During planning, Kwai Hing was named Kwai Chung, Kwai Fong was Lap Sap Wan (literally &quot;rubbish bay&quot;, as the location was close to a now-disused landfill in Gin Drinker&#x27;s Bay), Lai Wan (now Mei Foo) was Lai Chi Kok, Lai Chi Kok was Cheung Sha Wan, Cheung Sha Wan was So Uk. These stations were all renamed in English and Chinese before service began.

Upon the opening of the Island line, Chater, Waterloo, and Argyle, originally named based on the streets crossing or above the stations, Chater Road, Argyle Street, and Waterloo Road respectively, were renamed to Central, Yau Ma Tei, and Mong Kok, resembling the names of the station in Chinese. Lai Wan was renamed to Mei Foo in both English and Chinese.

Mong Kok station was planned to be built a bit further north of its present location and Sham Shui Po a bit further south of its present location before the need to accommodate an intermediate station, Prince Edward.

===Transfer with Tung Chung line===
When the Tung Chung line was constructed, Lai King was selected as an interchange so that passengers did not have to go all the way to Hong Kong Island to change trains. The northbound tracks on the Tsuen Wan line were moved to run above the southbound tracks at Lai King to support cross-platform interchange with the Tung Chung line.

The original platform 1 for Tsuen Wan-bound trains was removed and filled, becoming part of the current, wider low-level island platform. This allowed interchange with platform 4 for Hong Kong-bound Tung Chung line trains, which run on tracks further away from the original platform.

The new platform was opened in 1997, nearly a year before the Tung Chung line began service. Tracks were also built to the south of Lai King station linking the Tsuen Wan line and Tung Chung line; this is the only point where the Tung Chung line&#x27;s tracks connects with the other urban lines.

===Transfer with former KCR systems===
To cope with extensions and new lines, Mei Foo and Tsim Sha Tsui stations had new subsurface walkways added to connect to KCR West Rail&#x27;s Mei Foo and East Tsim Sha Tsui stations. The interchange facilities at Mei Foo opened in 2003 when the West Rail was opened. The interchange located at Tsim Sha Tsui entered service in 2004, along with the completion of the East Rail line&#x27;s (formerly KCR East Rail) extension to East Tsim Sha Tsui.

===Chronology===

* 1967: Tsuen Wan line was included in Hong Kong Mass Transport Study
* 1970: Tsuen Wan line was included in Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies, as Kong Kow line and Tsuen Wan Branch
* 1977: Construction was approved and, not long after, started on 1 March 1979
* 16 Dec 1979: Jordan and Tsim Sha Tsui opened as part of Kwun Tong line
* 22 Dec 1979: Waterloo and Argyle opened as part of Kwun Tong line
* 12 Feb 1980: Admiralty and Chater opened as part of Kwun Tong line
* 26 Apr 1982: The original Kwun Tong line was split into two sections: the new Kwun Tong line ran as far as Waterloo, while the Tsuen Wan line ran from Chater to Argyle; there were non-passenger Tsuen Wan line trains that continued to Tsuen Wan
* 17 May 1982: Begin operation
* 31 May 1985: On the opening of the Island line, 8 stations of the line were renamed. (See station list below for details)
* 23 May 1986: Central became an interchange station upon the extension of the Island line to Sheung Wan
* 11 Mar 1991: The line broke down and public transport was adversely affected
* 23 Apr 1993: Two interlinking carriages disconnected during operation within the section between Tsuen Wan and Tai Wo Hau. Nobody was hurt, and MTRC reported that a hook between the two concerned carriages was not fastened, leading to the incident
* Jun 1996: the current system (supposedly) that the line uses has fully replaced the old system
* 2 Jul 1997: The new platform 1 situated on the new high-level platform at Lai King opened
* 20 Mar 2003: To connect with the new KCR West Rail Mei Foo station, a passageway was built between the two stations, with a new exit D near about midway of the passageway to the West Rail platforms. It&#x27;s a 8-minute walk.
* 5 Jan 2004: A fire started in a train on its way to Admiralty station with 14 people injured. A 55-year-old male arsonist was responsible for the fire and was arrested the following day. A similar incident occurred at Tsim Sha Tsui station on 10 February 2017.
* 24 Oct 2004: A new exit G at Tsim Sha Tsui was constructed for a passageway under Mody Road to connect the station with new KCR East Rail 
* 30 Mar 2005: A new exit F at Tsim Sha Tsui was constructed for a passageway under Middle Road to connect to East Tsim Sha Tsui station
* 21 Oct 2010: An overhead electric cable near Yau Ma Tei station had a problem during service hours; at least 280,000 passengers were affected, with noises above the train ceiling heard by the driver when the problem emerged, and the driver drove the train into Yau Ma Tei station and unloaded the passengers. Service resumed on the line three hours later.
* 10 Feb 2017: In the first car of Metro Cammell EMU (DC) A113/A192, a 60-year-old man (surname Cheung) was talking to himself, and suddenly yelled &quot;You killed my son!&quot;, and swear words. He later got a flammable bottle, splashed it on himself and some other passengers. Some passengers tried to stop him, but resulted in vain as he used a lighter and lit himself up. Some other passengers clothes caught on fire, and in return gave them burns. Emergency ventilation windows were opened, people escaped to other cars, and some yelled, creating a mad sight. The fire was extinguished at Tsim Sha Tsui station, but still caused all trains to not stop at Tsim Sha Tsui station for the day, with a temporary bus service connecting Tsim Sha Tsui station and Yau Ma Tei station. A total of 19 people were injured, including the perpetrator. The perpetrator had mental problems and died three months later in Prince of Wales Hospital.
* 7 Mar 2018: a driver fainted in the cockpit of a train, and was sent to hospital. The train was driven back to depot and all affected passengers were arranged to board a train 2 mins later.
* 16 Mar 2019: a totally naked foreign man entered the tracks in Lai King station at 8 p.m. and left the tracks near Kwai Hing station. Police later arrested him and are investigating the reason why. Train service resumed at 8:35 p.m. after the delay due to the incident.

==Route description==
The Tsuen Wan line runs north–south. It is mostly underground, beginning at Central and crossing Victoria Harbour after Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui. Then, the line first runs underneath Nathan Road (Tsim Sha Tsui to Prince Edward), then Cheung Sha Wan Road (Sham Shui Po to Mei Foo), before emerging from the hills at Lai King.

The line is elevated between Lai King and Kwai Hing. Between Kwai Fong and Kwai Hing, the tracks are covered to minimise disturbance to residents nearby. After Kwai Hing, the line re-enters the tunnel to Tai Wo Hau before ending at Tsuen Wan.

Some of the underground stations on the line are significantly deeper than the others. Tsim Sha Tsui and Admiralty stations are deeper because they precede harbour crossings. Admiralty and Central are deeper as they provide cross-platform interchange with the deep-level Island line.

==Incidents==
On 18 March 2019, two trains crashed in the crossover track section between Admiralty and Central while MTR was testing a new version of the SelTrac train control system provided by Toronto-based Canadian unit of Thales Group. There were no passengers aboard either train, although the operators of both trains were injured. Before the crash site had been cleaned up, all Tsuen Wan line trains terminated at Admiralty and returned to Tsuen Wan Depot instead of Central. Both MTR and Thales will be conducting their separate investigations. The same vendor also provided a similar signalling system in Singapore, which resulted in the Joo Koon rail accident in 2017. In July 2019, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) published an investigation report into the incident and concluded that a programming error in the signalling system led the ATP system to malfunction, resulting in the collision.

<doc id="305752" wikidata="Q179767" url="?curid=305752" title="X Japan">
<text>is a Japanese rock band from Chiba, formed in 1982 by drummer and pianist Yoshiki and lead vocalist Toshi. Starting as a predominantly power/speed metal band with heavy symphonic elements, they later gravitated towards a progressive sound with an emphasis on ballads. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam.

Originally named , they released their debut album &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; (1988) on Yoshiki&#x27;s own Extasy Records one year after finalizing their line-up including bassist Taiji, lead guitarist Hide and rhythm guitarist Pata. They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album &quot;Blue Blood&quot;. Following 1991&#x27;s &quot;Jealousy&quot;, Taiji left the band in early 1992. He was replaced by Heath and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album &quot;Art of Life&quot; (1993), which is composed solely of the 29-minute title track. In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released &quot;Dahlia&quot; (1996), which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold-out New Year&#x27;s Eve concerts the group held at the stadium.

After ten years, X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song &quot;I.V.&quot;. Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, and formally added Sugizo as lead guitarist in place of Hide, who died in 1998, before holding a North American tour in 2010. In 2011, the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia. Shortly after reuniting, work began on their sixth studio album. During its ten years of production, several release dates were announced, but it remains unreleased despite Yoshiki&#x27;s claim of its completion in September 2018.

X Japan has released five studio albums, six live albums, and 21 singles. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; ranked &quot;Blue Blood&quot; number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time. In 2017, &quot;Loudwire&quot; named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan. It has been reported that X Japan has sold over 30 million records.

== History ==

=== 1977–1992: X ===

In 1977, Yoshiki and Toshi formed a band called Dynamite in their hometown of Tateyama, Chiba, when they were just 11 years old. Dynamite changed its name to Noise in 1978, while they were still in high school. At this time, Toshi played guitar and they had a singer named Kurata. In 1982, Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, they named it X while they tried to think of another name, but the name stuck. X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup. They originally attempted to pitch in with Japan&#x27;s underground punk movement, but the band did not fit in with it as they were considered too commercial and flamboyant. Their first single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Kill You&quot; was released on Dada Records in June and the band contributed &quot;Break the Darkness&quot; to the sampler &quot;Heavy Metal Force III&quot; in November, which also featured a song by Saver Tiger. In November 1985 bassist Taiji (ex:Dementia) joined X, though he left the group shortly thereafter.

To ensure a continuous outlet for the band&#x27;s music, Yoshiki founded the independent label Extasy Records in April 1986, and released their second single &quot;Orgasm&quot;. Taiji would officially rejoin the band in November of that same year. The songs &quot;Stab Me in the Back&quot; and &quot;No Connexion&quot;, for the February 1987 Victor Records sampler &quot;Skull Thrash Zone Volume I&quot;, were recorded with Pata (ex:Judy) as a support guitar player. Soon after these recordings Hide (ex:Saver Tiger) joined as a guitarist. After Pata once again provided support, this time at a live show, he officially joined completing the group&#x27;s first well-known lineup.
In August 1987 they performed at the Rock Monster event at Kyoto Sports Valley and gave out their first home video, &quot;Xclamation&quot;. On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony which led to a recording contract in August of the following year. In the meantime the band released its first album, &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; through Extasy Records on April 14, 1988, and toured extensively in support of the record. The album&#x27;s first press of 10,000 copies sold out in a week, topping the Oricon indies chart and reaching number 19 on the main Oricon Albums Chart, making them the first independent band to appear on the main chart. The Vanishing Tour Vol.2 took the band to 20 locations for 24 shows from June to July, while the Burn Out Tour had 12 performances throughout October. In November, X participated in music magazine &quot;Rockin&#x27;f&quot;&#x27;s Street Fighting Men concert at Differ Ariake Arena. That year the members also made a brief cameo appearance in the American film &quot;Tokyo Pop&quot;, starring Carrie Hamilton and Diamond Yukai.

X&#x27;s sold out Blue Blood Tour started on March 13, with two of the concerts selling out in advance, including the March 16 show at Shibuya Public Hall, which was later released on home video as &quot;Blue Blood Tour Bakuhatsu Sunzen Gig&quot;. The album &quot;Blue Blood&quot; was released on April 21, 1989, and debuted at number six on the Oricon chart. The single &quot;Kurenai&quot; reached number five and the band went on the Rose &amp; Blood Tour, which was temporarily suspended when Yoshiki collapsed after a November 22 concert. This success earned the band the &quot;Grand Prix New Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1990. On November 24, 1990, X flew to Los Angeles to begin recording their follow-up album, &quot;Jealousy&quot;. When members arrived back in Japan in June, 500 members of the Japan Self-Defence Forces were at the airport to control the crowd. The album was released on July 1, 1991, and debuted at number one, selling over 600,000 copies. It was later certified million by the RIAJ. In August the band performed their first concert at Japan&#x27;s largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. Footage from most of the band&#x27;s shows in that stadium would later be released on CD and home video. The show was part of the Violence in Jealousy Tour, which lasted to the end of the year and once again saw Yoshiki collapse after the October 24 Yokohama Arena gig. December 8 saw the X with Orchestra concert at NHK Hall, where, as the name suggests, the band performed backed by an orchestra.

1992 began with three sold-out concerts at the Tokyo Dome, titled Tokyo Dome 3 Days: On the Verge of Destruction, on January 5–7. On January 31, it was announced that bass player Taiji had left the group. The official reason given for his departure was due to musical differences. However, in his autobiography, Taiji claims he was asked to leave because he confronted Yoshiki due to the substantial income gap between Yoshiki and each of the other members. When asked about Taiji&#x27;s departure in 2016, Yoshiki said &quot;he crossed the line of our band&#x27;s rules&quot; and &quot;To this day I still don&#x27;t know if the decision was right or wrong, but we didn&#x27;t have a choice.&quot; On August 24, 1992, the band held a press conference in New York at Rockefeller Center. There, Heath (ex: Media Youth) was announced as their new bass player. Around this time, the band&#x27;s success in Japan made an international breakthrough appear likely, leading to them leaving Sony for an American record contract with Atlantic Records and the renaming of the band from X to X Japan, in order to distinguish from the American punk group X. (An American album release would never happen.) Their first show with Heath was at the October 1992 Extasy Summit at Osaka-jō Hall.

=== 1993–1997: X Japan ===
&quot;Art of Life&quot; was released on August 25, 1993, by Atlantic Records, and consists solely of the 29-minute, heavily orchestrated title track. It debuted at number one, however the band only performed two concerts that year, as each member began solo careers. Aptly titled X Japan Returns, the concerts were held at the Tokyo Dome on December 30 and 31, marking the beginning of a New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition that would last until the group&#x27;s disbandment. The solo careers continued into the following year, with X Japan only performing four shows. The first two were the last two days of The Great Music Experience, and the others were December 30–31 at the Tokyo Dome, titled and respectively.

1995 was also quiet, until November 19 when the band began the tour for their next album, Dahlia Tour 1995–1996. Around this time, the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look. While it wasn&#x27;t released until November 4, 1996, singles from the album had been released as early as a few months after &quot;Art of Life&quot;. Though this caused &quot;Dahlia&quot; to contain relatively little new material, the album reached number one on the charts. The tour was originally scheduled to end on March 31, 1996, however, it was cut short when Yoshiki herniated cervical vertebrae after the March 13 show. They did however perform their tradition of two Tokyo Dome concerts on December 30–31, titled and .

On September 22, 1997, Yoshiki, Hide, Pata and Heath held a press conference where they announced that X Japan would disband. Vocalist Toshi decided to leave the band, claiming that the glamorous, success-oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally, as opposed to a simpler life and career. He stated that he had made the decision back in April 1996, though it was not publicly disclosed. However, around twelve years later, he confirmed what was long-reported in the media; that he was &quot;brainwashed&quot; via violence and abuse and conned out of money, leading to bankruptcy. X Japan performed their farewell show, titled The Last Live: Last Night, at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive New Year&#x27;s Eves the group performed at the stadium. Although later that same day they played &quot;Forever Love&quot; at that year&#x27;s &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, marking their true last performance.

=== 1998–2007: Post X Japan ===
While reissues, compilations and live footage continued to be released, the members of X Japan pursued solo careers and other projects. Hide, who released his first solo album &quot;Hide Your Face&quot; in 1994, continued his solo career with a sound distinctively different from X Japan&#x27;s music, leaning more towards alternative rock, until his death on May 2, 1998. Just two months later, the debut album &quot;3.2.1.&quot; from his American-based band Zilch, which included Ray McVeigh (The Professionals), Paul Raven (Killing Joke) and Joey Castillo (Queens of the Stone Age), was released. His third solo album &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot;, formally including his live band Spread Beaver, was released in November 1998 and became his most successful, having reached number one and sold over a million copies. Prior to his death, Hide and Yoshiki talked about restarting X Japan with a new vocalist in the year 2000.

Toshi&#x27;s solo career, which began in 1992, has been extensive, with him having released over 30 albums and performed numerous acoustic shows for smaller audiences. According to his website, his Utatabi Traveling Concert tour included over 3,000 concerts between 1999 and 2003. After both having released solo albums in the early 90s, Pata and Heath teamed up with Spread Beaver percussionist/programmer I.N.A., who worked on several of X Japan&#x27;s releases, to provide a track for the 1998 Hide tribute album &quot;Tribute Spirits&quot;. The three would reunite again in 2000 to form Dope HEADz, which released two albums before ceasing activity. Heath then continued his solo career and Pata formed the instrumental rock group Ra:IN, which later added Spread Beaver keyboardist DIE.

Before the band&#x27;s breakup, Yoshiki had already independently collaborated with Queen drummer Roger Taylor on the single &quot;Foreign Sand&quot; and provided the Japanese contribution to the international Kiss tribute album &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved&quot;, an orchestral arrangement of the song &quot;Black Diamond&quot;. A compilation with orchestral treatments of X Japan songs, titled &quot;Eternal Melody&quot; was also released. It was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and among others featured The Beatles producer George Martin as an arranger.

Since 1998 Yoshiki has engaged in numerous activities, such as briefly being a member of the pop band Globe, producing singles for the Korean rock band TRAX and numerous others, as well as working on his solo project Violet UK, which has yet to publish a major release. He has also contributed music to the movie &quot;Catacombs&quot; and produced the soundtrack of &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot;. On May 25, 2007, the formation of the supergroup S.K.I.N. was announced, which besides Yoshiki consists of pop/rock artists Gackt and Miyavi, as well as Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo. The band gave its first and only performance at the Anime Expo convention in Long Beach, California, on June 29, 2007.

=== 2007–2008: Reunion ===
According to a report by the newspaper &quot;Sponichi&quot;, Toshi visited Yoshiki in Los Angeles in November 2006 to work on the song &quot;Without You&quot; as a tribute to Hide. On March 21, 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a &quot;new project&quot; would commence soon. Rumors of an X Japan reunion subsequently began, and in June Yoshiki was reported as having expressed interest in a tour (beginning in Los Angeles), &quot;Without You&quot; being released as a single, and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata regarding their participation.

The band made its first public appearance on October 22, 2007, on the rooftop of the shopping center Aqua City in Odaiba, Tokyo, to film a music video for the newly recorded song &quot;I.V.&quot;. The song was used as the theme of the American horror movie &quot;Saw IV&quot;. It was written by Yoshiki and recorded with all X Japan members of the pre-breakup lineup, as it utilizes previously unreleased guitar tracks by Hide. &quot;I.V.&quot; was released through iTunes on January 23, 2008, topping the store&#x27;s charts on that day.
On January 20, 2008, two Tokyo Dome concert dates were announced for March 28 and March 30. Due to popular demand, they added another concert for the 29th. These three shows were entitled X Japan Resume Attack 2008 I.V. – Towards Destruction, with each individual concert titled Night of Destruction, Night of Madness and Night of Creation, respectively, and featured three guest guitarists filling in for the late Hide – Wes Borland, Richard Fortus and Sugizo. The March 28 concert was aired live on the pay-per-view channel WOWOW. During the song &quot;Art of Life&quot; a hologram of Hide (taken from footage of the &quot;Art of Life&quot; performance at the Tokyo Dome in 1993) played alongside the band. Because of technical difficulties, possibly due to the hologram, the first concert was delayed for over two hours and later came to an abrupt end when drummer Yoshiki collapsed eight songs into the performance. The subsequent shows were without such difficulties and during a press conference, plans for a concert in Paris on July 5, 2008, were announced, with an intended audience of 20,000 people. In addition to the Paris date, plans for concerts at the Madison Square Garden in New York City on September 13, and at the Taipei World Trade Center in Taipei on August 2 were also announced.

=== 2008–2010: Delays, Sugizo joins and first overseas performances ===
The Hide memorial summit took place on May 3 and 4, 2008, at Ajinomoto Stadium, with X Japan performing the second day, as a tribute to the musician who was also a former X guitarist. Numerous other popular acts such as T.M.Revolution, Oblivion Dust and Versailles also performed, with Phantasmagoria and Luna Sea even reuniting for one day. Organizers planned for an estimated 100,000 fans to attend the two shows. On June 8, it was reported that all of X Japan&#x27;s previously scheduled shows would be postponed until further notice, due to a recurrence of Yoshiki&#x27;s disc herniation. The Paris and Taipei concerts were rescheduled, Paris for November 22, 2009.
On September 15, 2008, Yoshiki held a press conference in Tokyo, where he announced a new, unnamed X Japan song was in the works. Concerts at Saitama Super Arena on Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008 were also announced. After the conference Yoshiki went on a promotional tour across Asia. On November 7, the French ticketing website Avos announced that the planned ticket sale for the show in Paris would be canceled. Later that day, X Japan released a press statement through their French language website apologizing for the second postponement and announced that the planned Christmas shows would likely suffer a similar fate. On December 31, X Japan performed their New Year&#x27;s Eve countdown performance at the Akasaka Blitz.
On January 15, 2009, the band arrived in Hong Kong for their January 16 and 17 shows. On May 1, it was announced that Sugizo officially joined X Japan as lead guitarist. Since the band still considers the deceased Hide a member, Sugizo became the sixth member of X Japan. Their first show with him as a full member was held the next day at the Tokyo Dome, where they played &quot;Jade&quot; for the first time. The Taiwan concert that was postponed for a second time in January, was finally held on May 30, 2009.

On January 9, 2010, the band made its first public U.S. appearance by shooting four new music videos in Hollywood. The four videos were for &quot;Rusty Nail&quot;, &quot;Endless Rain&quot;, &quot;I.V.&quot;, and their new song &quot;Jade&quot;. In February, Yoshiki confirmed that X Japan would be performing at Lollapalooza in August. Later that month, he announced at a press event that the band would be relocating to Los Angeles, California, with a concert being planned for a &quot;simple&quot; venue in the city area to mark the band&#x27;s first official North American show. It was also announced that a sixth album was in the works and was expected to be released in the fall.

In March 2010, Yoshiki filed a lawsuit against Nexstar Corporation, for 375 million yen in damages. The band&#x27;s contract with the company included the use of recordings, the initial deal was for 600 million yen in advance royalties and contract money, which the band claims not to have received. Between 2008 and 2009, the company also sponsored several concerts around Asia and Japan, not having paid performance fees and merchandise sales to X Japan. In all, the total unpaid amount was more than 900 million yen. The lawsuit sought only 375 million yen for the revenue earned from the concerts, with an additional claim of 600 million yen in case the trial proceeded. Yoshiki&#x27;s side eventually won the lawsuit in 2014, where the Tokyo District Court ordered Nexstar to pay 660 million yen in damages. 

On July 1, the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic setlist, and recorded a music video for the new song, &quot;Born to Be Free&quot;. On July 4, the two founding members Toshi and Yoshiki, appeared in Paris at the Japan Expo 2010 where they performed some songs. During the following month, X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. X Japan performed at Lollapalooza 2010 in Grant Park, Chicago on August 8. In the following days, Yoshiki did a Q&amp;A article with the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; and was interviewed by ABC News.

On August 14 and 15, 2010, the band performed a two-day show at Nissan Stadium, the largest stadium in Japan. Some media reported an estimated attendance of 140,000 for the two concerts. Ex-bassist Taiji joined them on stage both nights as a guest for the song &quot;X&quot;; he would die the following year. Soon after, formerly deceased guitarist Hide&#x27;s management company, Headwax Organization, filed a lawsuit against Yoshiki and X Japan&#x27;s management, Japan Music Agency, for using images of the former member without a formal agreement in place. The claim states that in 2000 the two companies signed an agreement allowing Yoshiki and X Japan to use visual images of Hide during concerts. However, images were used at these Nissan Stadium shows, when apparently the contract already expired.

From September 25 to October 10, X Japan performed their first ever North American tour with dates in Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto and New York City. On December 17, Yoshiki announced that a new X Japan song, &quot;Scarlet Love Song&quot;, was composed for the animated movie adaptation of the &quot;Buddha&quot; manga.

=== 2011–2014: World tour and Madison Square Garden ===

It was announced on January 27, 2011, that X Japan signed a 3-year agreement with EMI in November 2010. The label will handle the American distribution of their single &quot;Jade&quot;, which was to be released on March 15, and their untitled album, which was set for release in late summer. In promotion of the new album, it was also stated they would be touring extensively around the world throughout 2011. X Japan performed on March 6 at Asia Girls Explosion, a fashion event and music concert that Yoshiki created with Jay FR. It was announced they would perform in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru later in the year.

Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11, the band decided to postpone the release of &quot;Jade&quot; until June 28. Yoshiki also decided to auction off one of his used signature Kawai crystal grand pianos, of which all proceeds were sent to help provide aid to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami through Yoshiki Foundation America.

&quot;Scarlet Love Song&quot; was released in Japan on June 8, and on June 28 their first worldwide single, &quot;Jade&quot;, was released, both on iTunes. That same day they performed in London, the first concert of the European leg of their ongoing world tour, which was followed by Paris on July 1, Utrecht on July 2 and Berlin on July 4.
X Japan also performed at the 2011 Summer Sonic festival that was held on August 13 and 14, in Tokyo and Osaka. Their world tour&#x27;s South American leg took them to; Santiago on September 9, São Paulo on September 11, Buenos Aires on September 14, Lima on September 16 and Mexico City on September 18. The Asian leg of the tour brought stops in Seoul on October 28, Shanghai on October 30, Hong Kong on November 4, Taipei on November 6 and Bangkok on November 8. The Beijing show, originally scheduled for November 2, was cancelled by the promoters on October 25 due to &quot;technical and production issues&quot;.

After more than two years of inactivity, X Japan announced the remastered compilation album &quot;The World ~X Japan Hatsu no Zensekai Best~&quot; for release on June 17, 2014. Prior to its physical release, a digital version titled &quot;X Japan World Best&quot; became available in 111 countries via iTunes on May 21. They performed at Yokohama Arena on September 30 and October 1, and at Madison Square Garden on October 11. At both concerts, the cover of the song &quot;Beneath The Skin&quot; was played, originally written by Sugizo for S.K.I.N., the group formed by Yoshiki in 2007. They participated in &quot;Music Station Super Live 2014&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve, marking their first television appearance in seventeen years, the last being on &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; in 1997.

=== 2015–present: Unreleased sixth studio album, &quot;We Are X&quot;, and Heath&#x27;s death===
In June 2015, Yoshiki announced X Japan&#x27;s sixth and first studio album in 20 years would be released on March 11, 2016. The band has announced that the sixth album would contain between 13 and 14 tracks, including some short pieces. It was also announced that they would perform at the Wembley Arena in London on the following day, where &quot;We Are X&quot;, a documentary film about the band, would be premiered. The band performed on June 28 at Makuhari Messe as part of the second night of Luna Sea&#x27;s Lunatic Fest. The first single from the album, &quot;Born to Be Free&quot;, was released on November 6, 2015. X Japan&#x27;s first domestic tour of Japan in 20 years began with three consecutive dates at Yokohama Arena on December 2, continued with Osaka-jō Hall on December 7, Marine Messe Fukuoka on December 9, Hiroshima Green Arena on December 11, and finished on December 14 at the Nippon Gaishi Hall. They also performed on &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; for the first time in 18 years.
On January 15, 2016, Pata was rushed to the intensive care unit of a Tokyo hospital. He was diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, which included a severe blood clot, but was in stable condition. On February 3, X Japan announced the postponement of their album release and March 12 concert at the Wembley Arena for a whole year; the concert subsequently taking place on March 4, 2017. In June, Yoshiki stated that Pata was discharged from the hospital in March, but had to go back for surgery in August. Pata announced he was discharged on August 10. X Japan headlined all three nights of the Visual Japan Summit on October 14–16, 2016 at Makuhari Messe. The &quot;We Are X&quot; soundtrack album was released on March 3, 2017. The soundtrack reached No. 4 in its first week in the Oricon Albums Chart, No. 27 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 1 in the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart. On March 3, 2017, an album signing took place at HMV in Oxford Street, London. All the physical copies of the &quot;We Are X&quot; soundtrack available at the signing were sold in the event. According to store staff, this was the first time there was a sell-out of all physical copies at such a signing. A new song, &quot;La Venus&quot; was used as the ending theme song for &quot;We Are X&quot; and was one of 91 songs in contention for nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the 89th Academy Awards. In April 2017, Yoshiki announced that the sixth album&#x27;s songs were ready and only mixing and mastering remained, and the release was expected &quot;in the next few months&quot;. When Yoshiki performed on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Front Row&quot; on October 20, 2017, it was announced the sixth album would be released in Spring 2018.

On May 9, 2017, Yoshiki&#x27;s management announced that the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, it was reported that concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed as an acoustic tour, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain whether he would be able to play the drums in the future. In November it was announced that X Japan will perform at the year-end &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, as part of the White Team. The band performed a medley of &quot;Endless Rain&quot; and &quot;Kurenai&quot;, and during the performance Yoshiki played drums again for the first time since his neck surgery.

The January 2018 issue of &quot;Neo&quot; magazine named X Japan the &quot;Best Musical Act&quot; in their annual awards, with &quot;We Are X&quot; named the &quot;Best Asian Movie&quot;. In February 2018, the band&#x27;s performance at Wembley in 2017 was named the &quot;Best Event&quot; at Wembley Arena in the 2017 SSE Live Awards. In March 2018, &quot;We Are X&quot; was named the &quot;Best Music Film&quot; in the Space Shower Music Awards. On April 10 and 11 the band performed at Zepp Divercity in Tokyo for a limited audience, and the concert was broadcast live across Asia in selected theaters. Richard Fortus, Wes Borland, and Miya appeared as guest musicians. Fortus and Borland also joined X Japan on stage for their first performance at the Coachella festival on April 14 and 21. At the second weekend of the festival, Marilyn Manson joined the band on stage and performed &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; with Yoshiki on piano. When interviewed for KLOS&#x27;s &quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, Yoshiki said the album would be released in either summer or fall 2018.

In July, it was also announced that X Japan would perform at the TV Asahi Dream Festival on September 15, 2018. On Christmas Day 2018, X Japan were named 43rd in that year&#x27;s Oricon Favorite Artists poll. In an interview with JRock News on February 13, 2019, Yoshiki said, &quot;X Japan&#x27;s album is actually completed. It took over 10 years to record, I&#x27;m looking for the perfect timing to release it.&quot;

X Japan released the single &quot;Angel&quot; on July 28, 2023. It was the first new song released by the band in eight years. That same month, following Elon Musk&#x27;s move to rebrand Twitter as &quot;X&quot;, it was reported that the Japanese branch of the company, then named &quot;Twitter Japan&quot;, would be rebranded as &quot;X Japan&quot;. This led to Yoshiki commenting on Twitter that: &quot;I think it&#x27;s already trademarked.&quot; As a result of the band having the trademark for &quot;X Japan&quot;, it was reported that &quot;Twitter Japan&quot; would instead be rebranded &quot;X Nippon&quot;. Yoshiki said in an interview with &quot;Consequence&quot; that he respected Musk and felt fans should decide the name of the platform.

On November 7, 2023, news outlets reported that longtime bassist Heath had died in late October shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. On November 11, an official statement posted on the musician&#x27;s website disclosed that Heath was diagnosed with colon cancer in June and died in a hospital on October 29, 2023, after his condition suddenly worsened that month. It was also announced that X Japan leader Yoshiki has been entrusted with organizing a memorial concert per Heath&#x27;s wishes.

== Musical style ==
X Japan&#x27;s music developed in the wake of American and British glam and heavy metal music, and was characterized by driving speed/power metal compositions with symphonic elements (e.g. &quot;Kurenai&quot;, &quot;Silent Jealousy&quot;) and emotional ballads (e.g. &quot;Endless Rain&quot;, &quot;Forever Love&quot;). Many of the group&#x27;s songs make use of orchestrated passages, particularly on longer tracks such as the ten and a half minute &quot;Tears&quot;, &quot;Crucify My Love&quot;, and the twenty-nine-minute &quot;Art of Life&quot;.

The majority of the band&#x27;s lyrics are in Japanese, the band&#x27;s native language, however many instances show the lyrics alternating from Japanese to English and back. Examples of this include the spoken-word background vocals during the bridge of &quot;Rusty Nail&quot;, and multiple lines (including the entire pre-chorus) of the song &quot;Week End&quot;. The first recorded version of &quot;Kurenai&quot; from &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; contains lyrics entirely in English.

The majority of the band&#x27;s catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. Hide contributed several songs, including the single &quot;Scars&quot;, while Pata&#x27;s only claim is &quot;White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata&#x27;s Nap~&quot;. Toshi&#x27;s contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music to a couple of songs, notably &quot;Voiceless Screaming&quot; from the album &quot;Jealousy&quot;, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and &quot;Desperate Angel&quot;. Heath&#x27;s only writing credit is the instrumental song &quot;Wriggle&quot; on the 1996 album &quot;Dahlia&quot;, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, &quot;Easy Fight Rambling&quot; on the 1989 album &quot;Blue Blood&quot;. Of songs from the band&#x27;s lesser-known former members, only the track &quot;Time Trip Loving&quot; from the single &quot;Orgasm&quot;, composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since. That year, Yoshiki claimed that their new material was &quot;pretty much the same thing, maybe a little edgier.&quot; However, in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before, adding that it will be very heavy, melodic, and &quot;more contemporary&quot;.

Yoshiki&#x27;s songwriting process begins with writing the score for each song by hand before playing it with the band. His composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter, Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan&#x27;s later material. During live performances, the band relies on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments) and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings, spoken word passages, and more recently, some of Hide&#x27;s guitar parts.

==Appearance and image==
X Japan&#x27;s appearance was inspired by glam rock, Kiss, David Bowie, as well as traditional Japanese kabuki theatre, where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women. Visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage. According to Josephine Yun, &quot;like its music, X&#x27;s look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime &quot;Gundam&quot;. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata&#x27;s sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as Hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewitchingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next.&quot; Will Hodgkinson of &quot;The Times&quot; described X Japan as having, &quot;the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with a healthy dose of melodrama.&quot;

Their early image was characterized by heavy make-up, dark eyeliner and eyeshadow, face-painting and high-standing hair, which one critic described as &quot;skyscraper hair&quot;. Yoshiki&#x27;s highly androgynous looks, dressed in lace and pearls, were referred to as &quot;decadent&quot;. The band also used accessories reminiscent of glam-goth (metal jewelry, crosses). Their stage reflected the band&#x27;s duality in nature: the forceful, &quot;masculine&quot; heavy metal songs were balanced out by Toshi&#x27;s high-pitched tenor voice and Yoshiki&#x27;s soft piano playing, where he would often wear long female dresses, and act effeminate.

By the release of their 1995 studio album &quot;Dahlia&quot;, the band toned its stage appearance down, cutting their hair and wearing more rock-inspired outfits. In a 2010 interview, Yoshiki stated that the abandoning of stronger make-up and outrageous outfits was a natural progression in their style, however, they still do use make-up on stage, &quot;sometimes heavy, sometimes less&quot;, and that he still considers the band visual kei.

== Legacy and influence ==

X Japan is considered one of the founders of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan &quot;Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock&quot;. In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement&#x27;s development, saying &quot;when we started the band, the problem was we didn&#x27;t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn&#x27;t belong anywhere&quot;, &quot;[We did our own thing and] that eventually became visual kei.&quot; He added &quot;But visual kei is more like a spirit, it&#x27;s not a music style or, you know... I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that&#x27;s what I believe visual kei is.&quot; Upon former guitarist Hide&#x27;s death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Steve McClure declared it &quot;the end of an era&quot;, explaining &quot;X was the first generation of visual kei bands[...] For the next generation of bands, it&#x27;s like: &quot;That&#x27;s it. The torch has been passed to us.&quot;&quot;

Many bands and artists, most related to visual kei, count them as an influence or look up to them, including Miyavi, Dir En Grey, Kisaki, Syu and Fumiya of Galneryus, The Gazette, D, Sadie vocalist Mao, Tōru Kawauchi from 12012, Maya of LM.C, Flow, Yuuki from Unsraw, DJ Ozma, Kei of Dio – Distraught Overlord, aie from Deadman, Screw&#x27;s Jin, Mari of Mary&#x27;s Blood, and Daizystripper. The members of Versailles named X and Luna Sea as influences, with singer Kamijo saying &quot;I think there isn&#x27;t anyone in the Japanese music business who hasn&#x27;t been influenced by them.&quot; Likewise, Leda of Galneryus and Deluhi claims he was not even interested in music until a friend played him X Japan and Luna Sea, and also declared X Japan&#x27;s music his &quot;Bible&quot;. Established musicians Dancho (Nogod), Miya (Mucc), Yuu (Merry), Akane (ex-The Scanty) and Daisuke (Jupiter) occasionally perform in a X Japan cover band called X Suginami. American musician Marty Friedman called X Japan the biggest band in visual kei and &quot;by far the most versatile musically,&quot; and cited them as the reason he got into Japanese rock music. Kai from Esprit D&#x27;Air named X Japan as one of his top ten rock and metal bands from Japan and also covered their song &quot;Kurenai&quot;.

In &quot;We Are X&quot;, Gene Simmons claims that if the X Japan members were &quot;born in America or England and sang in English, they might be the biggest band in the world.&quot; Due to band&#x27;s various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi&#x27;s brainwashing and lack of overseas success, X Japan has been described in &quot;The Times&quot; as: &quot;The world&#x27;s unluckiest band&quot;, in an article published on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: &quot;Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can&#x27;t say &#x27;the world&#x27;s unluckiest band&#x27;, but what I can say is &#x27;the world&#x27;s luckiest band&#x27;. Thanks to our fans.&quot;

The group was popular among rebellious youths, who were attracted to, as &quot;Asiaweek&quot; put it, &quot;the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered.&quot; Their music was described by &quot;Asiaweek&quot; as having &quot;an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society.&quot; In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained &quot;In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they dress like it, they breathe it.&quot; In the documentary &quot;Global Metal&quot;, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, &quot;but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice&quot;.

X Japan has also been named one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent record label. In 1990, they won the &quot;Grand Prix New Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards. HMV Japan ranked the band number 40 on a 2003 list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts, and in 2010 they came in third in a poll by Oricon on which Japanese bands people want around for future generations. In 2011, Consequence of Sound named X Japan one of their Top 15 Cult Acts. In April 2012, X Japan won the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Award for &quot;Best International Artist&quot;. They were awarded &quot;Most Devoted Fans&quot; in the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards on January 17, 2013, and won the poll again two years later on February 3, 2015. Later that year, they also won the website&#x27;s Best Live Band Tournament in August, beating out Pearl Jam in the final round. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; ranked X Japan tenth on an October 2014 list of the 10 Best Prog Metal Bands. In March 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan writing that &quot;their high-octane power metal and exhilarating live show make them the pinnacle of heavy music in the &#x27;Land of the Rising Sun&#x27;.&quot;

However, X Japan has also made a mark outside of the music industry. In 1999, at the request of the Japanese government, Yoshiki composed and performed a classical song for Japan&#x27;s Emperor Akihito at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of his enthronement. Japan&#x27;s former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is a well-known fan of the band. His political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, even used X Japan&#x27;s song &quot;Forever Love&quot; in several commercials in 2001. It was also reported that Koizumi was influential in getting the Hide Museum opened in Yokosuka in 2000.

Yoshiki stated he loved &quot;the punkish elements&quot; of the albums &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Killers&quot; by Iron Maiden. He also cited Sex Pistols, the Clash, GBH, and Chaos UK as favorite bands.

<text>Dir En Grey (stylized as DIR EN GREY and previously as Dir en grey) is a Japanese heavy metal band formed in February 1997 and currently signed to Firewall Div., a sub-division of Free-Will. With a consistent lineup of guitarists Kaoru and Die, vocalist Kyo, drummer Shinya and bassist Toshiya, they have released eleven full-length albums. Numerous stylistic changes have made the genre of their music difficult to determine, though it is generally considered to be a form of metal. Originally a visual kei band, the members later opted for more subtle attire, but have continued to maintain a dramatic image on stage.

==History==

===1997–1999: Early career===
Dir En Grey was preceded by the independent rock band La:Sadie&#x27;s, which was formed by vocalist Kyo and bassist Kisaki in November 1995. They were joined by guitarists Die and Shio, as well as drummer Shinya and made their live debut on January 14, 1996. Shio seceded after three shows and Kaoru joined them in April 1996. After a very successful independent career and over 80 shows in one year of activity, La:Sadie&#x27;s disbanded on January 15, 1997. The reasons for the disbandment are unknown, but later statements made by the individual members hint at disagreements between bassist Kisaki and the other members in regards to their status as an independent band. Kisaki said he was asked to leave the band and that he failed to take care of the other members, &quot;I thought doing lots of good live shows would please the members, but I was wrong. By not giving them time to rest and deciding on recording schedules in between, I must have put a lot of stress and burden on them.&quot; After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show as a Kuroyume cover-band called &quot;Deathmask&quot; at the live house Nagano J on January 24, they officially formed Dir En Grey on February 2, 1997.

The band name is a combination of German &quot;dir&quot;, French &quot;en&quot; and English &quot;grey&quot; and was thought to mean ; the Japanese translation was used as the name of their fanclub&#x27;s magazine. They wanted to convey a musical image that was neither black nor white, so they picked grey. In an early interview, vocalist Kyo explained that he knew the name before the band was formed. During the WOWOW Special in 2020, Kaoru elaborates that they took the name from another band that was famous around that time. This band was Lareine, who had released a song called &quot;Dir en gray&quot; in 1995. The song starts with the line &quot;&quot;, with the Latin part being a correct translation of the Japanese part. Both mean &quot;to you in grey&quot;. In a later interview, Kaoru explained that &quot;at the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn&#x27;t express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn&#x27;t exist elsewhere.&quot;

They released their first EP, &quot;Missa&quot;, a few months later and attracted mainstream attention in 1998, by entering the top ten on the Oricon music charts with the still independently produced songs &quot;Jealous&quot; and &quot;-I&#x27;ll-&quot;. Five subsequent singles, arranged and produced by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki Hayashi, were published during the first half of 1999. The band&#x27;s first full-length record, &quot;Gauze&quot;, followed. One of the shows in support for the album (filmed at the Osaka-jo Hall) would later become the first of several live concerts to be released on VHS and DVD.

===2000–2004: From &quot;Macabre&quot; to &quot;Vulgar&quot;===
In 2000, vocalist Kyo was hospitalized with hearing trouble and several dates of the tour in support of Dir En Grey&#x27;s then-upcoming album, &quot;Macabre&quot;, had to be postponed. Tour 00 » 01 Macabre eventually took off later the same year and was concluded at Nippon Budokan shortly after the release of the single &quot;Ain&#x27;t Afraid to Die&quot; in April 2001.

In the following year, along with the release of a third full-length album, &quot;Kisō&quot;, Dir En Grey gave their first performances abroad, touring China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Back in Japan, the last dates of the lengthy Rettou Gekishin Angya tour were already in support for the band&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Six Ugly&quot;. In the same year, they released the single &quot;Child Prey&quot;, which was featured as the second opening theme of the &quot;Baki the Grappler&quot; anime series, and also the beginning of their fourth album called &quot;Vulgar&quot;. In summer 2003, Dir En Grey performed at Akasaka Blitz for five evenings in a single week, with each show (except the first) themed after a certain album, the last featuring songs from the then yet to be released &quot;Vulgar&quot;. A DVD set, titled &quot;Blitz 5 Days&quot;, was later released exclusively for members of the band&#x27;s official fan club, titled &quot;A Knot&quot;. &quot;Vulgar&quot; was released in September 2003 and tours in support for the record would last well into 2004.

===2005–2006: Early non-Asian touring===
In 2005, Dir En Grey performed in Europe for the first time. Their concerts in Berlin and Paris (as part of the It Withers and Withers tour) sold out without promotion save for newsletters by import record stores and internet-based word of mouth. The band also performed at two major festivals, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park. Becoming more involved with the international music scene, French band Eths opened for them at the Paris concert and Dir En Grey invited American musician Wednesday 13 and his band to play at a show in Japan. Dir En Grey also appeared at the Japanese leg of that year&#x27;s Taste of Chaos tour.

2005 saw the group&#x27;s first official European releases as well, beginning with &quot;Withering to Death&quot;. The band&#x27;s music had previously been available through means of import and Internet file-sharing only for European fans. The album achieved Dir En Grey&#x27;s first non-Asian chart position, reaching No. 31 in the Finnish album charts. The subsequent single, &quot;Clever Sleazoid&quot;, later climbed to No. 15 on the singles charts in the same country. Several Dir En Grey songs were also featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 film &quot;Death Trance&quot;.

In early 2006 touring expanded to the United States. The band performed in Austin, Texas, at the South by Southwest festival, New York City at the Avalon Club and Los Angeles, California, at the Wiltern Theatre, followed by the North American release of &quot;Withering to Death.&quot; Again, all shows sold out within days. After more concerts and festival appearances in Germany during the summer, singer Kyo was again hospitalized due to inflamed vocal cords. While two concert dates in Japan had to be postponed, Dir En Grey was still able to join Korn&#x27;s Family Values Tour 2006. In October, the band was back in Japan to perform at the Loudpark Festival, along with bands such as Megadeth, Slayer and Children of Bodom. Their 22nd single &quot;Agitated Screams of Maggots&quot; was released on 15 November during the Japanese leg of the Inward Scream tour. On 30 December, the music video for -Saku- was voted the No. 1 video of the year on the MTV2 show &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

===2007–2009: &quot;The Marrow of a Bone&quot; and &quot;Uroboros&quot;===
In February, Dir En Grey went on its first North American headlining tour, visiting sixteen cities as its sixth full-length album &quot;The Marrow of a Bone&quot; was released on February 7 in Japan and in the United States and Europe in the following months. It saw a change in capitalization of the band name, from a sentence case capitalization (&quot;Dir en grey&quot;) to an all caps variant (&quot;DIR EN GREY&quot;). From May to July, the group opened for the Deftones on their United States tour and afterwards did another European tour, which included their debut shows in Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as several festival performances across the continent, including Ankkarock, M&#x27;era Luna Festival and Wacken Open Air.

The group went on another international tour in September named after their most recent single &quot;Dozing Green&quot;, beginning in Japan and continuing in Europe, including their first performance in the Netherlands and Switzerland. In late November, Dir En Grey opened two shows for Linkin Park at Saitama Super Arena and in December performed another Japan tour with 10 Years as a supporting act. Commemorating Dir En Grey&#x27;s tenth anniversary as a band, two greatest hits compilations, titled &quot;Decade 1998–2002&quot; and &quot;Decade 2003–2007&quot; respectively, were released on December 19.

At the beginning of 2008, Dir En Grey announced plans to begin recording a new studio album. Their first touring of the year in May was another Japan tour with a conclusion of three shows at Shinkiba Studio Coast, titled Death over Blindness. Between touring, Dir En Grey performed at one night of the two-night hide memorial summit on May 4, alongside X Japan, Luna Sea, and others. A second Japanese tour, titled Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again began on September 10, the same day as the release of their single &quot;Glass Skin&quot;.

On August 1, Dir En Grey announced the release of their seventh studio album, &quot;Uroboros&quot;, which was released on November 11, 2008, in the United States. The band also toured the United States and Canada in support of the album, with dates scheduled for November and December (overlapping the release of &quot;Uroboros&quot;) with opening act The Human Abstract. Touring that fall included a series of four shows titled Bajra, two being fan-club exclusive, and a single show on December 29 under the moniker Uroboros -Breathing- at the famous Osaka-jo Hall where Dir En Grey had not performed since December 18, 1999 (as seen on &quot;1999.12.18 Osakajo Hall&quot;).

Beginning in 2009, Dir En Grey made their first thorough tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Relentless Tour &#x27;09&quot; alongside Mindless Self Indulgence, Bring Me the Horizon, Black Tide and In Case of Fire. In February, the band announced the public release of the live DVD, &quot;Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again&quot;, as well as switching European record labels to the newly founded Okami Records, a sister label of their former European representation, Gan-Shin.

During spring of 2009, the band began to fully promote &quot;Uroboros&quot; with a series of nationwide tours under the title Tour 09 Feast of V Senses. The tour was interrupted briefly while in Sapporo and Sendai, with an announcement on the band&#x27;s official website, explaining that Kyo had been diagnosed with edema of the larynx, and would require the postponement of three shows, which were rescheduled for early May.
Dir En Grey continued their Feast of V Senses tour in Europe, with a mixture of festival performances, headlining shows, and one co-headlining show with Killswitch Engage. The festival performances included their third appearances at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, as well as their initial concerts at Download Festival, Nova Rock, and Metaltown. Among the headlining shows, Dir En Grey were also making debut concerts in Italy and the Czech Republic.

After several shows of their late-summer tour, All Visible Things, Dir En Grey announced their next single for December, &quot;Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu no Yami&quot;, as well as a North American and South American tour also under the title All Visible Things. Their new single was released on December 2, 2009, and reached number 2 on the Oricon Weekly Chart: the highest position to date for the band. Their 2009 tour season ended with a three-live tour titled Dorje. They finally ended their long &quot;Uroboros&quot; centered tour by doing two back to back performances at the Nippon Budokan, titled Uroboros: with the proof in the name of living..., where tickets sold out in 15 minutes.

===2010–2013: &quot;Dum Spiro Spero&quot; and &quot;The Unraveling&quot;===
It was announced on April 7, 2010, that the band would be returning to the United Kingdom in August on the lineup for the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, playing on a bill headlined by Iron Maiden and Rammstein. According to the festival website, this was to be their only UK festival performance during the year. Regarding the announcement, Kaoru (on the Sonisphere UK website) is quoted as saying:
&quot;&quot;&quot;I&#x27;d never have thought that we would play a festival of this caliber! It is like a dream come true to be playing with such great bands at Sonisphere. Although we&#x27;re not back in the UK for a tour, we wanted to play this festival to give something back to the fans who were disappointed last year from our cancelled finale in London.&quot;

It was announced on April 28, 2010, that Dir En Grey would be playing an exclusive club date at London&#x27;s Koko venue on August 3 as part of The Unwavering Fact of Tomorrow Tour 2010. Dir En Grey announced later on that they also would do their debut performances in Russia by adding one show in Moscow at Tochka Club on August 5 and one show in St Petersburg at Glav Club on August 6. Dir En Grey also toured North America on a co-headlining tour with the Finnish band Apocalyptica with a special guest of Kyo interpreting the song &quot;Bring Them to Light&quot;, one of the tracks of the cello-metalers latest record.

In September 2010 the band confirmed in an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine that they were in the process of writing new material for the follow-up to &quot;Uroboros&quot;. In addition to &quot;Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu no Yami&quot; appearing on the soundtrack of the American movie &quot;Saw 3D&quot;, they also participated on December 1, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Romantist - The Stalin, Michiro Endo Tribute Album&quot; by covering &quot;Warushawa no Gensō&quot; in celebration of the 60th birthday of The Stalin&#x27;s frontman Michiro Endo. The album also featured bands such as Buck-Tick, Group Tamashii, Merry, Jun Togawa, and Wagdug Futuristic Unity.

The single &quot;Lotus&quot; was released on January 26, 2011, along with a new fan-club only tour named The Decomposition of the Moon, scheduled to run from May 14 to 26. The band released &quot;Different Sense&quot; on June 22. On August 1, 2011, Dir En Grey released an open letter on their official Facebook that accused the Japanese government of lying to its people and hiding the true danger of the radiation levels after the nuclear accidents caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In October, the band launched a campaign called Scream for the Truth, complete with a website and a billboard hanging in Times Square in New York City, in hopes of stopping the alleged misinformation and getting correct numbers. Their eighth studio album, &quot;Dum Spiro Spero&quot;, was released on August 3. Material from this album was showcased on the band&#x27;s South and North American tour Age Quod Agis in November and December 2011.

In February 2012, following a doctor&#x27;s visit, vocalist Kyo was diagnosed with vocal nodule dysphonia, leading to Dir En Grey pulling out of the North American The Still Reckless Tour consisting of Asking Alexandria, Trivium, Motionless in White, and I See Stars. Although Kyo had been hospitalized before in 2006 and 2009 for vocal inflammation, he had not required surgery until this time. Kyo later stated that his condition was treated with medication.

On August 11, 2012, Dir En Grey won the Extreme Metal Olympics organized by &quot;Loudwire&quot;, beating Death in the final. The band released the single &quot;Rinkaku&quot; on December 19 after their one-year and a half hiatus since their previous single release. Also, a tour titled In Situ began on December 25 in Tokyo.
On April 3, 2013, they released their third EP, titled &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, with one new song and six re-recordings. Just a couple of days later on April 5, the band started their supporting tour Tabula Rasa for the new EP. In June 2013, the band participated in a short European tour.

In September 2013, the band started their Ghoul tour, which ran from September 18 until October 23 in Japan and continued on November 3 in North America. The band also announced two back-to-back shows at the Nippon Budokan for March 2014 titled &quot;Dum Spiro Spero&quot; along with a new single, &quot;Sustain the Untruth&quot;, which was released in January 2014.

On August 5, 2014, it was announced that Dir En Grey&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Arche,&quot; would be released on December 10, 2014. After its release, the album was accompanied by the 2014–2015 tour &quot;By the Grace of God&quot;. The tour was followed by another one called &quot;The Unstoppable Life&quot;, in April and May 2015. On 27 June 2015, Dir En Grey performed at Luna Sea&#x27;s Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe. On 5–6 February 2016, Dir En Grey performed their album &quot;Arche&quot; at Nippon Budokan with a June 2016 release date of Blu-ray &amp; DVD.

==Musical style and influences==
Dir En Grey has been categorized in many genres such as extreme metal, alternative, experimental, avant-garde and various others. Dir En Grey&#x27;s format has been subject to change throughout their career, initially being a rather experimental form of alternative rock. Some tracks of their debut album &quot;Gauze&quot; also demonstrated a distinct pop appeal, which was largely dropped in favor of a more progressive sound on the following albums, &quot;Macabre&quot; and &quot;Kisou&quot;. While up to that point some songs had already been more fast-paced, raw and aggressive than others, the band&#x27;s music took a decisive turn with the release of the EP Six Ugly, from then on sporting more metal influences in general. Dir En Grey&#x27;s style gravitated towards riffs and song structures more along the lines of contemporary North American fusion genres, such as nu metal and metalcore, until 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Marrow of a Bone&quot;. In a review of their sixth full-length album, &quot;The Marrow of a Bone&quot;, AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek comments on their evolution and diversity, saying:

Since the release of their album &quot;Uroboros&quot; in 2008, Dir En Grey have been repeatedly described as progressive metal. Uroboros and their 2011 album &quot;Dum Spiro Spero&quot; represent a particular musical departure from previous albums, with critics noting that their sound on these albums bears almost nothing in common to their earliest work. With Uroboros, and particularly on &quot;Dum Spiro Spero&quot;, the band have moved away from their alternative rock roots towards a heavier metal sound. These albums feature complex song structures and guitarwork, longer track lengths, and a broader variety of particularly western influences, such as death metal, deathcore and groove metal.

Kyo&#x27;s singing is considered a pivotal aspect of the band, and he has gained recognition for his distinctive vocal work and for his large range and versatility, being able to &quot;howl, croon, emote cleanly, scream, shriek, growl, bellow, and make nearly inhuman sounds.&quot; Jurek has compared him favorably to experimental and avant-garde vocalists Mike Patton and Diamanda Galas. &quot;Loudwire&quot; wrote &quot;Sporting incredibly low death metal gutturals, Kyo can also turn a complete 180 as one of metal&#x27;s highest shriekers.&quot; Dane Prokofiev of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that his &quot;natural ease at and inclination towards striking such a stark contrast between the two opposite ends of the human vocal spectrum can be obtained as only a kind of pre-birth winning lottery ticket—you know, that much coveted prize we call &quot;talent&quot;.&quot;

Commentators have noted how Dir En Grey have gained a significant international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said &quot;when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English and I had no idea what they were saying. But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier.&quot; When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that &quot;We consider our music [to be] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork.&quot; The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers &quot;the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that.&quot; However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, so they also plan to use English when they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on &quot;Uroboros&quot;), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.

Although they got their start as a visual kei band, the members of Dir En Grey seem to be irked being associated with the term in some later interviews. Speaking of the change in their appearance, Kaoru said &quot;Eventually, we felt that dressing like we used to onstage put up a wall between us and the audience, so we stopped wearing the kind of makeup we did before.&quot; However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained &quot;To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha.&quot; Die said &quot;They saw us as idols but we aren&#x27;t idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly.&quot; Kyo stated that for Dir En Grey it was always about the music and when wearing lots of makeup became popular, &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to be associated with a lot of the poor quality bands in that scene.&quot;

Dir En Grey have created some controversy in Japan as some of their music videos have been banned from television for &quot;abrasive visuals including baby-eating, murder, [and] gore.&quot; Similarly, stations refused to play the video for 2008&#x27;s &quot;Vinushka&quot; which included stock footage of World War II and newspaper headlines following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Kyo cited Bauhaus&#x27;s &quot;Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape&quot; and David Sylvian&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; as his favorite albums. Kaoru listed X&#x27;s &quot;Blue Blood&quot;, Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1967–1970&quot; in his favorite albums list. Die&#x27;s inspirations included D&#x27;erlanger&#x27;s &quot;La Vie En Rose&quot; and Ziggy&#x27;s &quot;Kool Kizz&quot;. Toshiya hailed Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot; and Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Shinya cited Aion&#x27;s &quot;Absolute&quot; and Gargoyle&#x27;s &quot;Furebumi&quot; as his influences.

<text>Abigail&#x27;s Party is a play for stage and television, devised and directed in 1977 by Mike Leigh. It is a suburban situation comedy of manners, and a satire on the aspirations and tastes of the new middle class that emerged in Britain in the 1970s. The play developed in lengthy improvisations during which Mike Leigh explored the characters with the actors, but did not always reveal the incidents that would occur during the play. The production opened in April 1977 at the Hampstead Theatre, and returned after its initial run in the summer of 1977, for 104 performances in all. A recording was arranged at the BBC as a &quot;Play for Today&quot;, produced by Margaret Matheson for BBC Scotland and transmitted in November 1977.

==Performances==
The stage play was first performed at the Hampstead Theatre on 18 April 1977, enjoying great success, leading to a revival over the summer of that year, which was another sellout.

The television version was abridged from over two hours to 104 minutes; the record played by Beverley in the original stage production was &quot;Light My Fire&quot; by José Feliciano and in the TV production it was the 1976 hit &quot;Forever and Ever&quot; by Demis Roussos – Leigh had to replace nearly all the music with artists recorded on British labels, for copyright reasons, in case the BBC sold the play to the United States. As José Feliciano became Demis Roussos, so Elvis Presley gave way to Tom Jones. Other music used in the BBC production included &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; by Donna Summer (sung here by Clare Torry) and a piece of library music by Robert Farnon entitled &quot;Blue Theme&quot;.

The BBC version was a film of a play, rather than a film in its own right, about which Leigh commented:
==Original cast==
The original production starred Alison Steadman as Beverley, and Tim Stern as her husband Laurence. They are holding a drinks party for their new neighbours, Angela (Janine Duvitski) and her husband Tony (John Salthouse). They also invite Susan (Thelma Whiteley), another neighbour. Abigail herself is never seen—she is Susan&#x27;s 15-year-old daughter, who is holding her first teenager party next door. For the television version, the original cast reprised their roles, with the exception of Thelma Whiteley, who was replaced by Harriet Reynolds.

Each of the original cast largely devised the back story to their character. John Salthouse brought his early career as a footballer with Crystal Palace to that of Tony. According to Leigh, discussions at the improvised sessions included whether Beverley&#x27;s name should have a third &quot;e&quot; or not. The most complex relationship was worked out between Angela and Tony. Little of this is disclosed during the narrative, although something of it becomes apparent when Angela steps in to care first for Sue, then the stricken Laurence, and the centre of power between the couple starts to shift noticeably.

==Characters==
;Beverley Moss: An ex-department store cosmetics demonstrator, &quot;a beautician&quot;, she has failed her driving test three times. During the play, she flirts with Tony and is always trying to impress her guests. She considers her taste in music (Jose Feliciano/Demis Roussos, Tom Jones) and art (kitsch erotica) to be every bit as good as that of her husband. Immensely proud of her home, she nonetheless admits that she cannot use the gadgets in her kitchen. Throughout the evening, Beverley offers her guests drinks and cigarettes (despite the fact that Tony and Angela have recently given up), which they usually refuse but end up taking due to her being unable to take no for an answer. Beverley effectively forces her guests to agree with her on most topics, for instance on the music they should listen to, or whether olives should be served, in each instance using their apparent consensus to score points with her husband. Despite her &quot;sophisticated&quot; tastes and carefully groomed appearance, she was described by Alan Bennett as having &quot;shoulders like a lifeguard, and a walk to match.&quot; According to the critic Michael Coveney, &quot;Beverley is undoubtedly a monster. But she is also a deeply sad and vulnerable monster… The whole point about Beverley is that she is childless, and there is a sense in which that grotesque exterior carapace is a mask of inner desolation.&quot;

:Interviewed in 2012, Steadman said of the play, &quot;Overnight, that piece was incredibly powerful. ... They were very strong, identifiable characters. We laugh at them because we say, &#x27;Oh my God, I know that person, thank goodness I&#x27;m not like that&#x27;, and you cringe, but you know they&#x27;re true. We can safely sit in the comfort of our living rooms or theatre seats and laugh our heads off. But we&#x27;ve perhaps all got a bit of Beverley in us.&quot; In a 2017 piece written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Leigh described Beverley as &quot;an aspirational working class girl who is totally preoccupied with appearances and received notions of behaviour and taste. A bundle of contradictions, she espouses the idea of people freely enjoying themselves, yet endlessly bullies everybody into doing what she wrongly thinks they&#x27;ll enjoy, or what is good for them. But, while she may be perceived as monstrous, she is in fact vulnerable, insecure and sad&quot;.
;Laurence Moss: Estate agent with &quot;Wibley Webb&quot;. Laurence is Beverley&#x27;s husband, and the pair frequently argue. He aspires to the finer things in life: leather-bound Shakespeare (which he thinks &quot;can&#x27;t be read&quot;), prints of Van Gogh and Lowry paintings, and Beethoven, which he forces on his guests at unfortunate moments. He seems powerless to compete with Beverley&#x27;s more flamboyant persona, and compensates by working too much, as his wife points out on several occasions. He considers a brisk handshake to be correct etiquette after a dance. While Laurence starts off behaving normally during the party, as he becomes increasingly hen-pecked by his wife, he begins to act in a more neurotic manner, to the point where he too becomes an annoyance to his guests. Unlike Sue, Laurence does not embrace the increasing &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot; of the area.
;Tony Cooper: Tony works in computing—merely as a computer operator, his wife twice points out—and used to play professional football for Crystal Palace but it &quot;didn&#x27;t work out&quot;. Tony is quiet throughout most of the play, appearing tense, uneasy and only able to give one-word answers. As the scene progresses, he becomes increasingly irate and fierce-tempered, particularly with his wife Angela. Beverley flirts with him, much to Laurence&#x27;s suppressed annoyance, and at one point, Beverley asks Angela if he is violent. &quot;No, he&#x27;s not violent. Just a bit nasty. Like, the other day, he said to me, he&#x27;d like to sellotape my mouth. And that&#x27;s not very nice, is it?&quot;. Leigh later attributed Tony&#x27;s aggression to an underlying shyness and self-consciousness. The surname Cooper was not mentioned in the original script or teleplay, and is taken from a picture on the &quot;Mike Leigh at the BBC&quot; DVD box set.
;Angela Cooper: Tony&#x27;s wife. A nurse, Angela appears meek and somewhat childlike, dim, and cheerfully tactless. She and Tony have just bought their house and are struggling with the necessary frugality. She cannot drive: Tony does not wish her to do so, possibly to curtail any ideas of independence even though he seems to find her a constant irritant. Angela displays an unexpectedly practical and decisive side when Sue feels queasy and later after Laurence collapses. Mike Leigh has noted that &quot;underneath Angela&#x27;s apparent silliness is the tough, practical reliability of an experienced working nurse&quot;.
;Susan Lawson: Sue is middle-aged and her 15-year-old daughter Abigail is holding the eponymous party. A long-standing resident she was (as pointed out by Angela) divorced at the same time the other characters were married. A quiet and conventional middle-aged woman, of &quot;middle middle-class&quot; rectitude, she wears a blouse and skirt compared to Bev and Angie&#x27;s &#x27;dressing up&#x27;, thinking her invitation was for an informal neighbourly supper. Without the courage to break stifling social norms by refusing her hosts she tries to assauge her hunger on peanuts whilst Beverley&#x27;s &quot;little top-ups&quot; of gin make her ill. As the evening progresses, Laurence repeatedly attempts to find common ground with her by mouthing common platitudes of what he supposes to be cultural refinement but when Beverley insists she dance with Laurence this only compounds their mutual awkwardness as she towers over him by at least 8 inches.

==Plot==
The terrain is &quot;the London side of Essex&quot;, &quot;theoretical Romford&quot; according to Leigh. Beverley Moss invites her new neighbours, Angela and Tony, who moved into the road just two weeks ago, over for drinks. She has also invited her neighbour Susan (Sue), divorced for three years, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Abigail is holding a party at home. Beverley&#x27;s husband Laurence comes home late from work, just before the guests arrive. The gathering starts off in a stiff fashion as the virtual strangers tentatively gather, until Beverley and Laurence start sniping at each other. As Beverley serves more drinks and the alcohol takes effect, Beverley flirts more and more overtly with Tony, as Laurence sits impotently by. After a tirade when Beverley insists on showing off her kitsch print &quot;Wings of Love&quot;, Laurence suffers a fatal heart attack.

==Class==
Beverley, Tony and, to a lesser extent Angela, all speak with an accent centred on Essex or Estuary English. Laurence&#x27;s accent, more non-descript and less regional, makes him sound slightly more educated, while Sue&#x27;s is much nearer to Received Pronunciation.

Sue represents the middle class, being the ex-wife of an architect and living in one of the older houses on the street. She also brings a bottle of wine, and has not yet eaten, indicating that she is expecting dinner, as opposed to an extended evening of drinks. The others present have already had their &quot;tea&quot;. Beverley and Laurence represent the aspirational lower middle class, and Tony and Angela—the &quot;new arrivals&quot;—are also lower middle class, but Tony is less successful than Laurence.

Despite their similar background, Laurence seeks to differentiate between himself and Tony by highlighting the differences in their general level of culture, and makes a couple of condescending comments directed at him, and/or for Sue&#x27;s benefit. For example, Laurence shows off a leather-bound collected works of Shakespeare to Sue (which we know are unread), after pointedly asking Tony if he reads, insinuating that he does not.

==Critical response==
In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; was placed 11th. It also appeared in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll to find the top 40 greatest TV shows on British television, published in August 2003.

Some critics, such as Tom Paulin, have responded more negatively, saying that &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; appears to represent a middle-class &quot;schadenfreude&quot;, with the only true middle-class character, Sue, looking on at the antics of the couples with disdain. Likewise, Dennis Potter wrote a critical review of the play in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, saying it was &quot;based on nothing more edifying than rancid disdain, for it is a prolonged jeer, twitching with genuine hatred, about the dreadful suburban tastes of the dreadful lower middle classes&quot;. Leigh has rejected this, describing it as a tragi-comedy which is &quot;sympathetic to all the characters, whatever their foibles, not least Beverley... The play is a lamentation, not a sneer&quot;. He has also argued that the characters (Beverley and Laurence in particular) reflected the real-life behaviour of aspiring couples in mid-1970s suburbia.

Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2002, David Thomson noted that Beverley&#x27;s gauche storing of the beaujolais in the refrigerator had become standard practice; &quot;the gaffe has turned suave.&quot;

==Revival==
The TV version was released on VHS in 1984 and DVD in 2003.

The play was staged in London&#x27;s West End in 2003 with Elizabeth Berrington as Beverley. It was revived in Wolverhampton at the Grand Theatre (2005), and at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter (2006).

Interviewed in 2009, writer Leigh said: &quot;Of course I recognise the enduring popularity of &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;. It still hits a nerve about the way we live. It&#x27;s real even though it&#x27;s apparently a heightened and comic play. It&#x27;s a reflection of the realities of how we live on several different levels. It&#x27;s about aspirationalism and materialism, love and relationships. Like much of my work, it&#x27;s about the disease I call &#x27;the done thing&#x27;—basically, keeping up with the Joneses. It&#x27;s actually quite a complex play. People may not analyse its complexity but it&#x27;s so popular precisely for that reason.&quot;

In March 2012, a new revival of the play directed by Lindsay Posner opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Starring Jill Halfpenny as Beverley, Joe Absolom as Tony, Natalie Casey as Angela, Susannah Harker as Sue and Andy Nyman as Laurence, it subsequently transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in the West End. Commenting on the character, Halfpenny said, &quot;To her mind Beverley isn&#x27;t a monster and even warrants sympathy. &quot;When you learn about her upbringing—her mother and father haven&#x27;t spoken to her for 20 years—you see why a woman who&#x27;s been brought up like that and carries so many insecurities could take them out on others.&quot;

In May 2013, &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; played at San Francisco Playhouse and received outstanding reviews.

In March 2017, a new revival of &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; opened at the Theatre Royal Bath as a 40th anniversary production, starring Amanda Abbington as Beverley, Ciarán Owens as Tony, Charlotte Mills as Angela, Rose Keegan as Sue, and Ben Caplan as Laurence.

In November 2021, a further revival of &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; opened at the Park Theatre Finsbury Park, starring Kellie Shirlie as Beverley, Matt Di Angelo as Tony and Ryan Early as Laurence.

Another UK tour took place in 2023 under the direction of Michael Cabot, starring Rebecca Birch, Jo Castleton, Alice De-Warrenne, George Readshaw and Tom Richardson.

From September 6th to October 12th 2024 Nadia Fall directed a London revival at Stratford East featuring TV stars Tamsin Outhwaite and Kevin Bishop alongside Ashna Rabheru, Omar Malik, and Pandora Colin.

In 1985 the pop band ABC sampled dialogue from the play, by Beverley, on the 12&quot; remix of their single &quot;Vanity Kills&quot;.

<text>Aris Christofellis (; born 5 February 1960) is a Greek sopranist (male soprano singer) and musicologist.

==Life and career==
Aris Christofellis was born in Athens. After studying piano in Athens and Paris with several teachers including the famous pianist France Clidat, he decided to concentrate on developing his male soprano singing voice, studying with Fofi Sarandopoulo. He made his debut in Bordeaux in 1984. In 1985 he sang Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot; at Cannes Midem Classique inauguration concert.

His repertoire extends from Renaissance to contemporary music, but he focuses on the Italian baroque opera of the 18th and early 19th century. As a musicologist, he has brought to light many works of this period and has dealt in particular with the ornamentation of the vocal music of the 18th and 19th centuries. As a performer, in addition to lieder and folk songs he concentrates on Baroque opera, and he is known for singing roles written for castrati. He maintains an extensive discography with several recordings for EMI Classics between the mid 1990s and early 2000.

Since the end of the 1990s, Christofellis has significantly reduced his concert and opera performances and has started a career as a singing teacher.

<text>Lahti (; ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Päijät-Häme. It is located in the Finnish Lakeland. The population of Lahti is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the sixth most populous urban area in the country.

Lahti is situated on a bay at the southern end of lake Vesijärvi about north-east of the capital city Helsinki, south-west of Heinola and east of Hämeenlinna, the capital of the region of Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme). Lahti is situated at the intersection of Highway 4 (between Helsinki and Jyväskylä) and Highway 12 (between Tampere and Kouvola), which are the most significant main roads of Lahti. Its neighboring municipalities are Asikkala, Heinola, Hollola, Iitti and Orimattila.

In English, the Finnish word Lahti literally means &quot;bay&quot;. Lahti is also dubbed the &quot;Chicago of Finland&quot; due to the similarity of early industries of both cities, when they were known as &quot;slaughterhouse cities&quot;. Also, the troubled history of both cities in terms of crime has been seen as one of the similarities.

Lahti is a long-time pioneering city in environmental sustainability, dating back to as early as 1990 and before. The European Commission has named Lahti as the European Green Capital of 2021. 

Lahti is the headquarters of the Salpausselkä UNESCO Global Geopark, one of 4 UNESCO Geoparks in Finland. Salpausselkä was added to the list of over 170 UNESCO Global Geoparks in the world in 2022.

The coat of arms of the city depicts a train wheel surrounded by flames. It refers to the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway, which had a decisive influence on the birth of the city at its crossroads.

==History==
Lahti was first mentioned in documents in 1445. The village belonged to the parish of Hollola and was located at the medieval trade route of Ylinen Viipurintie, which linked the towns of Hämeenlinna and Viipuri.

The completion of the Riihimäki – St. Petersburg railway line in 1870 and the Vesijärvi canal in 1871 turned Lahti into a lively station, and industrial installations began to spring up around it. For a long time, the railway station at Vesijärvi Harbour was the second busiest station in Finland. Craftsmen, merchants, a few civil servants and a lot of industrial workers soon mixed in with the existing agricultural peasantry.

On 19 June 1877, almost the entire village was burned to the ground. However, the accident proved to be a stroke of luck for the development of the place, as it led to the authorities resuming their deliberations about establishing a town in Lahti. The village was granted market town rights by Emperor Alexander II of Russia in 1878 and an empire-style, grid town plan was approved, which included a large market square and wide boulevards. This grid plan still forms the basis of the city center. Most of the buildings were low wooden houses bordering the streets.

Lahti was founded during a period of severe economic recessions. The Russian Empire was encumbered by the war against Turkey, which also affected the economy of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The recession also slowed down building of the township: land would not sell and often plots were not built on for some time. In its early years, the town with its meagre 200 inhabitants was too small to provide any kind of foundation for trade. At the end of the 1890s, Lahti&#x27;s Township Board increased its efforts to enable Lahti to be turned into a city. In spring 1904, the efforts finally bore fruit as the Senate approved of the application, although it was another eighteen months before Tsar Nicholas II finally gave his blessing and issued an ordinance for establishing the city of Lahti.

At the end of 1905, the area that now comprises Lahti accommodated around 8,200 people of whom just under 3,000 lived in the city itself. All essential municipal institutions were built in just ten years, including a hospital and a city hall. At the same time, a rapid increase in brick houses was taking place in the centre of the city. The Battle of Lahti was fought in the 1918 Finnish Civil War as the German Detachment Brandenstein took the town from the Reds.

In the early 1920s, the city gained possession of the grounds of the Lahti Manor, an important piece of land previously blocking the city from the lake. Large-scale industrial operations grew rapidly in the 1930s as did the population; Lahti, at the time, was one of Finland&#x27;s fastest-growing cities, and before the start of the Winter War its population was approaching 30,000.

Through the addition of new areas in 1924, 1933 and 1956, Lahti grew, both in terms of population and surface area. The increase in population was especially strong after WWII, when 10,000 evacuees from ceded territories to the Soviet Union were settled in the city, and then later in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of urbanization. The rapid population growth came to a sharp end in 1975 and the city has since grown significantly slower albeit more steadily, with the latest notable growth in population happening in 2016 when the municipality of Nastola became a part of Lahti.

In December 2018, Lahti became the first new university city in Finland after Rovaniemi in 1979 when the Parliament accepted a change in the university law. LUT University nowadays consists of two campuses, Lappeenranta and Lahti.

== Geography ==

The terrain of Lahti is dominated by the first Salpausselkä ridge, a terminal moraine that cuts through the city from west to east. The city is located in the transition from the southern coastal area to the Finnish Lakeland; prominent to the north of the Salpausselkä are rocky hills and fragmented lakes, while its south side is dominated by forests and small rivers. The divide is also apparent in the soil, which mostly consists of till in the north and clay in the south. The biggest lake is Vesijärvi which also is a gateway to Central Finland via Lake Päijänne. There is also a pond called Pikku-Vesijärvi (&quot;Little Vesijärvi&quot;) near the Lanu-puisto park.

Production also decreased in the textile and clothing industry. In 1990, there were 90,370 jobs in the Lahti region. The number of jobs diminished over the next couple of years, so that in 1993 there were fewer than 70,000 jobs in the region. The number of jobs had slowly increased to 79,138 in 1999.

==Culture==

Lahti harbors cultural ambitions, manifested notably in the construction of a large congress and concert centre, the Sibelius Hall (2000) by architects Kimmo Lintula and Hannu Tikka. Lahti has one of Finland&#x27;s most widely known symphony orchestras, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra (&quot;Sinfonia Lahti&quot; ), based at the Sibelius Hall, which performs both classical and popular music, notably concentrating on music by Jean Sibelius. The orchestra has won several well respected international prizes, and is often heard on BBC Radio 3.

==Sports==

=== Winter sports ===
Lahti has a rich sporting tradition, especially in various wintersports. The city is well known for the annually held Lahti Ski Games (&quot;Salpausselän kisat&quot;) and the Finlandia-hiihto cross-country skiing contest. It is also the only city to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships seven times, doing so in 1926, 1938, 1958, 1978, 1989, 2001 and 2017.

=== Ice hockey ===
The Pelicans have competed in the top level of Finnish ice hockey, the SM-liiga, since 1999. Before the new millennium Reipas represented Lahti in top-flight hockey for 50 years. Many former NHL players, such as Janne Laukkanen, Toni Lydman and Pasi Nurminen, have started their careers in Reipas.

=== Association football ===
Historically the city&#x27;s most successful association football club has been Kuusysi. In their golden years lasting from the early 1980s to the 1990s they won five Finnish championships as well as two Finnish Cup titles, with appearances in European competitions each year. Their greatest rivals, Reipas, won a total of three championships and seven cup titles from 1963 to 1978 but diminished in the early 1980s as Kuusysi got stronger.

In the 1990s both clubs ended up in such massive financial difficulties that a merger was executed in 1996, with the newly formed club adopting a new name, crest and colours. FC Lahti has played in the Veikkausliiga since 1999, excluding a season-long visit to the first division in 2011, having placed twice third and appearing in Europe three times.

=== Other events ===
The Kärpänen motorcycle speedway track existed from circa.1950 to circa.1980, it was located where the Kärpäsen koulu sports field is today and hosted a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1957 in addition to the Finnish Speedway Championship, multiple times between the years 1963 and 1978. Another former speedway track at Pipoo (built in 1980), off the Vanhanradankatu held the final of the Finnish Championship in 1980, 1987 and 1990.

The 1997 World Games and the 2009 World Masters Athletics Championships were held in Lahti. For the 1952 Summer Olympics, some of the football matches were played at Kisapuisto.

Lahti will host the 2023 Ironman 70.3 World Championship August 26–27, an annual event which rotates venue and is the 2nd most important event in long course triathlon after Kona World Championship held annually in Hawaii.

==Transportation==
=== Local transport ===
The city is served by 20 local bus lines, most of which are pendulum lines between two different areas via city centre. Bus transport in the Päijänne Tavastia region is organised by the regional transportation authority, known as Lahden seudun liikenne or &quot;LSL&quot;, and run by several private companies which have bid for the right to run their lines. LSL buses cover all urban areas at 10–20 minute intervals and most nearby municipalities at 30–60 minute intervals.

Lahti is served by VR commuter rail, the Z train to Helsinki and the G train to Riihimäki run hourly. Most services to Kouvola don&#x27;t have a letter designation and are run every three hours aside from rush hours. There are plans for building two new train stops inside the city limits before 2020, Hennala and Karisto. A local service to Heinola has been proposed but renovating the old line has been deemed too expensive and unprofitable in the long term, unless the Finnish state reaches an agreement with regional councils to finance a direct rail link from Lahti to either Jyväskylä or Mikkeli.

=== Long-distance transport ===

The city&#x27;s main transportation hubs are the market square (&quot;Kauppatori&quot;) and the travel centre (&quot;Matkakeskus)&quot;, with local buses providing a non-stop service between the two. The travel centre, which replaced the old Lahti bus station that had been in use since 1939, was built between 2014 and 2016 around the Lahti railway station by building new local bus stops around the station, a long-distance bus terminal next to the station building and an automated parking facility for commuters.

All local and long-distance trains and buses stop at the travel centre, making it convenient to transfer from one mode of transport to another. The city council has sold the old bus station in the city centre and it will be redeveloped for other uses in the near future.

Lahti&#x27;s proximity to Helsinki provides a fast and well-serviced operation between the cities. Long-distance and commuter trains service the city at least twice an hour in the daytime. There is also a commuter train service towards Riihimäki in the south-west and to Kouvola / Kotka in the east. All the east and north-east long-distance train services to and from Helsinki railway station call at Lahti. From Lahti, it is also convenient to travel to Helsinki airport. Travel time to Helsinki airport via Tikkurila station is between 49min to 65min.

Additionally to the train connections, the long-distance busses are well-serviced in Lahti. Thanks to its geographical location, Lahti provides a hub-like possibility for busses too. From Lahti, the long-distance busses service routes to Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, Mikkeli, Oulu, Rovaniemi amongst the other destinations.

==Education==

=== Comprehensive and private education ===
Lahti has 16 comprehensive schools and eight secondary schools. Comprehensive education is also available in English and Swedish. &quot;Lahden yhteiskoulu&quot; is the city&#x27;s only private school offering both comprehensive and upper secondary education.

=== Upper secondary and vocational education ===
All four upper secondary schools in Lahti have a specialty: the Lyceum has expertise on subjects such as mathematics and biology, and sports (formerly in Salpauselkä), Tiirismaa focuses on music in association with the Lahti Conservatory, Kannas organises theatre classes and Lahden yhteiskoulu offers an economy-centered class. In 2022, Tiirismaa and Kannas merged to form Gaudia which is currently the largest upper secondary school in Finland with 1350 students. 

Salpaus is an educational consortium owned by the municipalities in Päijänne Tavastia arranging most of the region&#x27;s vocational education and trade schooling. The privately owned Dila and Lahti Conservatory educate students for healthcare and music-related professions, respectively.

=== Higher education and LUT University ===
Lahti&#x27;s greatest educational assets are the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT as well as also highly valued Institute of Design and Fine Arts, which is a part of LAB University of Applied Sciences.

LUT University offers education in engineering science as well as in business and management. The Institute of Design and Fine Arts has gained international recognition in particular for jewelry and industrial design, while other areas of expertise include metal, woodworking and furniture.

There are two national sports institutes in greater Lahti. The Vierumäki International Sports Institute based in Heinola is the most versatile centre of sports and physical education in the country, operating under the Ministry of Culture and Education. In addition the Pajulahti Sports Institute, located in the district of Nastola in Lahti, is one of the leading sports and training centres in Finland.

Furthermore one of Finland&#x27;s six multidisciplinary university campuses is based in Lahti. The University of Helsinki&#x27;s Department of Environmental Sciences is the university&#x27;s sole science department located outside the Helsinki metropolitan area.

==Trivia==
The asteroid 1498 Lahti was named after the city by its discoverer, the Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä.

The radio masts on top of the &quot;Radiomäki&quot; are tall.

Lahti won the European Green Capital Award of the year 2021.

Although the Institute for the Languages of Finland recommend for Norway and Denmark to use the Swedish names for all Finnish towns, the use of Lahtis in those countries is almost non-existent even among major newssites, especially as a result of Lahti being the branding name used for skiing events held there.

<text>Kuopio ( , ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of North Savo. It is located in the Finnish Lakeland. The population of Kuopio is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the seventh most populous urban area in the country.

Kuopio has a total area of , of which is water and half is forest. Although the city&#x27;s population is spread over , the city&#x27;s urban areas are comparatively densely populated (urban area: 1,618 /km²), making Kuopio the second most densely populated city in Finland. At the end of 2018, its urban area had a population of approximately 90,000. Together with Joensuu, Kuopio is one of the major urban, economic and cultural centres of Eastern Finland.

Kuopio is nationally known as one of the most important study cities and centres of attraction and growth. The city&#x27;s history has been marked by several municipality mergers since 1969, as a result of which Kuopio now encompasses much of the countryside; Kuopio&#x27;s population surpassed 100,000 when the town of Nilsiä joined the city in early 2013. When Maaninka joined Kuopio at the beginning of 2015, Kuopio became the largest milk-producing municipality in Finland and the second largest beef-producing municipality in Finland. In addition, at the end of the 2010s, Kuopio was characterised by numerous large projects, the largest in the country after the Helsinki metropolitan area. Kuopio has also become a major tourist city with the large tourist centre in Tahkovuori. Kuopio Airport, located in the municipality of Siilinjärvi, is Finland&#x27;s fifth busiest airport with over 235,000 passengers in 2017.

According to the Kuntarating 2017 survey, Kuopio has the most satisfied residents among the 20 largest cities, and according to the 2018 survey, Kuopio is the best city for property investors. In the &quot;Kuntien imago 2018&quot; survey, Kuopio ranks second among Finland&#x27;s large cities after Seinäjoki in South Ostrobothnia. In &quot;T-media&#x27;s&quot; study on the attractiveness and influence of the ten largest cities in 2021, 2022 and 2023, Kuopio is the second most attractive city in Finland, with Tampere in first place.

Kuopio was the European Region of Gastronomy in 2020. It is also known as the home of &quot;Kalakukko&quot;, a traditional Savonian food, which is why Kuopio is also known as the &quot;Promised Land of Kalakukko&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Several explanations are behind the name &quot;Kuopio&quot;. The first is that in the 16th century, a certain influential person named Kauhanen in Tavinsalmi changed his name to Skopa and the people&#x27;s pronunciation was &quot;Coopia&quot; and finally &quot;Cuopio&quot;. The second explanation is that it comes from the verb &quot;kuopia&quot;, meaning &quot;paw&quot;, as when a horse paws the ground with its hoof. A third explanation is that it came from a certain Karelian man&#x27;s name &quot;Prokopij&quot;, from Ruokolahti in the Middle Ages. This explanation is the most likely, and is supported by the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland.

== Heraldry ==

The coat of arms of Kuopio was designed in 1823 based on a drawing by the town councilor Karl Hårdh or possibly his artist son, Adolf Hårdh. The coat of arms was approved for use in 1823 by the Kuopio Magistrate in accordance with the order of Alexander I of Russia. The coat of arms building, which represents Kuopio Cathedral, has often been mistakenly considered to be Kuopio City Hall, completed in 1886.

The current design of the coat of arms is the work of architect Seppo Ruotsalainen. The coat of arms in its current form was approved at a meeting of Kuopio City Council on 25 November 1957, and the Ministry of the Interior confirmed the coat of arms and its explanation on 12 June 1958.

== History ==

In the 1550s, under the influence of Mikael Agricola, a church and a parish were founded in Kuopionniemi. Governor Per Brahe the Younger founded the city of Kuopio in 1653, but the official date is recognized as 17 November 1775, when King Gustav III of Sweden ordered the formal establishment of the city.

The period of Grand Duchy (1809–1917) brought notable transportation development within Eastern Finland. The Saimaa Canal (1856) opened up a summer route towards the Baltic Sea, and the Savonia railway (1889) improved transport in winter.
After World War II, the city&#x27;s population grew significantly, due in part to the settlement of Karelian evacuees and the high birth rate. The rapid growth of the population forced the expansion of schools; at the end of the 1940s, support was also provided for school transports and the provision of free school meals (the poor people had received it in Kuopio since 1902). In the 1960s, the first construction of the actual suburb, Puijonlaakso, began. Since then, the new areas have each grown in turn: in the 1960s, Puijonlaakso and Tiihotar (as part of Saarijärvi); In the 1970s Saarijärvi, Kelloniemi and Levänen; In the 1980s, Jynkkä and Neulamäki.

The municipality of Maaninka joined the city of Kuopio in 2015, the town of Nilsiä in 2013, and Karttula in 2011, as did Vehmersalmi in 2005, Riistavesi in 1973, and Kuopion maalaiskunta in 1969.

== Geography ==

The city is surrounded by Lake Kallavesi, and several parts of it are built on islands. With an area of Lake Kallavesi is the tenth largest lake in Finland. In the wake of the Yoldia Sea, which followed the Weichselian glaciation and preceded the Baltic Sea, there are ancient beaches up to 140 m above the current sea level, of which the current Lake Kallavesi is 82 m above sea level. Kuopio&#x27;s ample waterfronts and islands are also used in the &quot;Saaristokaupunki&quot; (lit. &quot;Archipelago city&quot;) -project, the biggest residential area currently being built in Finland. Saaristokaupunki will accommodate a total of 14,000 inhabitants in 2015. All houses will be situated no more than from the nearest lakeshore.

Kuopio Market Square is the undisputed center of the city and the city center follows a densely built grid pattern with several parks and narrow gutter streets. The environment of the city is quite distinctive; the surface shapes of the waterfront-lined center are so variable that a flat property is a desired rarity. The settlement has spread outside the center of Kuopio according to a dense and sparse finger model that is affordable for public transport, and the new districts have been built in a municipal drive at once; for example, the Saaristokaupunki was banned for building for the previous 25 years, and this Kuopio zoning tradition has a long history. Due to the above-mentioned factors, the population density of the Kuopio city center is the highest in Finland.

With the surrounding lakes, the shoreline in Kuopio is 4,760 kilometers. The terrain is also characterized by rich forests, and the clear center of the Kuopio&#x27;s lund forest is mainly located in the area between Kuopio, Nilsiä and Siilinjärvi. Of the Finnish municipalities, Kuopio has the second largest number of summer cottages and holiday homes. In 2013, the number of summer cottages was 8,684. The number of summer homes in Kuopio has increased in recent years due to municipal associations. Due to the abundance of water bodies, Kuopio also has a remarkably favorable climate compared to the latitude. The annual sum of the effective temperature is about as high in Kuopio as in places further south than it, for example, Tampere and Lahti.

== Culture ==
Kuopio is known as the cultural center of Eastern Finland. One of Kuopio&#x27;s most important cultural venues are the Kuopio Museum, the Kuopio Art Museum and the Kuopio City Theatre in the city center. A wide range of musical (from kindergarten to doctorate-level studies) and dance education is available and the cultural life is active. Notable events include ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival, Kuopio Dance Festival, Kuopio Rockcock, Kuopio Wine Festival, Kuopio Marathon and Finland Ice Marathon in winter. A notable place, however, to enjoy the local flavor of Kuopio life and food is Sampo, a fish restaurant loved by locals and tourists as well.

Kuopio is known for its association with a national delicacy, Finnish fish pastry (Kalakukko), and the dialect of Savo, as well as the hill of Puijo and the Puijo tower. Besides being a very popular outdoor recreation area, Puijo serves also as a stage for a yearly World Cup ski jumping competition.

In inhabitants of Kuopio have a special reputation: they are known as jovial and verbally joking. Within the Savo culture, the onus is placed on the listener to interpret the story. People of the Kuopio region and Eastern Finland have always had many health problems and the mortality has been higher than on an average in Finland. Because of this, Eastern Finland has been a hotspot for Public Health studies. The North Karelia Project by the University of Kuopio in coordination with the National Public Health Institute and the World Health Organization, beginning in the 1970s was one of its first steps towards world class research. Niuvanniemi a historical psychiatric hospital is also located in the western part of the city in the Niuva district.

During the 2000s, Kuopio has placed very well in a number of image, popularity and city-attractiveness surveys. In 2007 it was placed third, behind Tampere and Oulu.

== Sports ==
Kuopio bid for the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, a youth sports festival in the tradition of the Olympics. It became a finalist in November 2008, but ultimately lost to Innsbruck, Austria. Kuopio&#x27;s image as a small city with a large University and many active young people was considered a model of what the International Olympic Committee seeks for the Games.

== Transport ==

The city has a nationally unique feature in its street network, where every other street is reserved for pedestrian and cycle traffic, so-called &quot;rännikatu&quot; (derived from the Swedish &quot;gränd&quot;, alley). These streets provide pedestrians a calm environment away from vehicular traffic. This setup dates back to Kuopio&#x27;s first town plan by Pehr Kjellman in 1776. Originally, rännikadut were created as a fire barrier to prevent a possible fire escalating in a mainly wood-constructed city.

Two Finnish highways cross Kuopio: Finnish national road 5 (Vt 5; part of E63 in the northern side of city), which extends south to Helsinki and north to Sodankylä, and Finnish national road 9 (Vt 9; part of E63 in the western side of city), which extends west to Turku and east to the Niirala checkpoint on the Finnish-Russian border. The Blue Highway passes through Kuopio. It is an international tourist route from Mo i Rana, Norway to Pudozh, Russia via Sweden and Finland.

Long-distance transport connections from Kuopio include Pendolino and InterCity trains from Kuopio railway station to several destinations around Finland, operated by VR, as well as multiple daily departures from Kuopio Airport on Finnair to Helsinki. The passenger harbour of the port of Kuopio, located on the shore of Lake Kallavesi, is the busiest port for passenger traffic in the Vuoksi drainage basin and the Finnish Lakeland.

== Education ==
Kuopio has always been a city of education. Some of the first schools offering education in Finnish (such as the School for the Blind in 1871, and the Trade School in 1887) were established in Kuopio. Currently the most important institutions are the University of Eastern Finland, the Savonia University of Applied Sciences, Vocational College of Northern Savonia and the Kuopio department of the Sibelius Academy. One of the oldest schools in the city is Kuopio Lyceum High School, which was officially established in 1872, but was originally built in 1826 and designed by Carl Ludvig Engel.

Kuopio is known as a strong center of health (e.g. it has the biggest yearly enrollment rate of medical students in Finland), pharmacy, environment, food &amp; nutrition (all legalized Clinical and Public Health Nutritionists in Finland graduate from the University of Eastern Finland), safety (education in Emergency Services is centered in Kuopio) and welfare professions, as the major organisations University of Kuopio (now part of the University of Eastern Finland since January 2010.), Savonia University of Applied Sciences and Technopolis Kuopio are particularly oriented to those areas.

<text>M.A.S.K. is a 1985 animated television series produced by DIC and ICC TV Productions, Ltd. The series was based on the M.A.S.K. action figures produced by Kenner Products. It was animated in Japan by Ashi Productions, Studio World and K.K. DiC Asia (later known as K.K. C&amp;D Asia).

==Overview==
M.A.S.K. (an acronym for &quot;Mobile Armored Strike Kommand&quot;) is a special task force led by Matt Trakker, who operate transforming armored vehicles in their ongoing battle against the terrorist organization V.E.N.O.M. (an acronym for Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem) with an emphasis on superpowered helmets (called &quot;masks&quot;) worn by the characters of both factions.

V.E.N.O.M.&#x27;s primary goal was obtaining money through either robbery, extortion, counterfeiting, kidnapping, or attempting to steal historical artifacts, but M.A.S.K. always found a way to foil their plans.

===Season 1 (1985)===
===Season 2 (1986)===
==Production==
One of many cartoons produced during the 1980s as a vehicle for toy merchandising, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; was a hybrid of popular era cartoons &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; and &quot;The Transformers&quot;. When originally broadcast, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; was the first closed-captioned series to air in first-run syndication.

==Home video==
Several episodes of the series were released under Karl-Lorimar&#x27;s &quot;Kideo Video&quot; branding on VHS in the 1980s, with two episodes per tape. The &quot;racing&quot; second season was distributed by Tempest Video.

In the United Kingdom, two releases titled &quot;M.A.S.K The Movie&quot;, and &quot;M.A.S.K The Movie II&quot; were released by Tempo Video, featuring episodes edited into a feature-length format. Several episodes of season one were distributed by The Video Collection in association with Karl Lorimar&#x27;s Kideo Video, then a lot of these episodes would be distributed on later VHS tapes by Castle Vision. While episodes from season two would be distributed by Golden Book Video.

M.A.S.K. episodes have been released on DVD in three different regions:
* USA: Shout! Factory acquired the Region 1 DVD rights and released a &quot;Complete Series&quot; set on 9 August 2011 containing only the episodes from the first season of the original series (65 episodes), as well as a separate 2-disc collection of the first 11 episodes, called &quot;Volume 1&quot; and released the same day. The second season, which consists of 10 episodes, are owned by WildBrain and are not part of the acquisition.
* UK: A single DVD set containing the first 5 episodes was released by Maximum Entertainment (under license from Jetix Europe) in August 2004. In November 2007, Maximum released Collection 1, containing the same number of episodes as the Australian set. Collection 1 was re-released on 31 August 2009, and Collection 2 was finally released on 28 September the same year. Both sets (the re-issue Collection 1 and Collection 2) are distributed through Lace DVD, replacing Maximum Entertainment, and both sets are in Region 2 PAL format. All 75 episodes were released across both sets.
* Australia and New Zealand: Madman Entertainment released the complete series over two DVD collections for the first time in Australia and New Zealand. Collection 1 was released in November 2006 and contains episodes 1–38, while Collection 2 was released in March 2007 and contains episodes 39–75 which includes the season 2 episodes.

==Reception==
While certain critics criticized the show for showing the weaponry and vehicles &quot;at the expense of anything deeper in terms of plotting and characterization&quot;, the show was quite successful. IGN voted &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; the 99th-best animated series in 2009, calling it one of the most popular cartoon/toy marketing franchises of the 1980s, stating that it took many of the strengths of &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot; while taking few of their flaws.

==In other media==
In 2015, Hasbro and Paramount were planning a cinematic universe combining &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; with &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Micronauts&quot;, and &quot;Rom&quot;. In April 2016, a writers&#x27; room was formed consisting of Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, and others to develop storylines, but it disbanded in July 2017. The next year, F. Gary Gray was announced as the director for a live-action &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; adaptation, with Chris Bremner hired in 2020 to write the script. The project has since remained in development.

<text>Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living genus, &quot;Inia&quot;, and four extinct genera. The extant genus inhabits the river basins of South America, but the family formerly had a wider presence across the Atlantic Ocean. 

Iniidae are highly morphologically different from marine dolphins by way of adaptations suited to their freshwater riverine habitat. They also display a high amount of sexual dimorphism in the form of color and size. Seasonal movement between flooded plains and rivers is common, due to the variation of seasonal rain. There has been little research done on the family, in particular the species aside from the Amazon river dolphin.

==Evolution==
The South American river basins were flooded by marine waters, creating a new brackish habitat that allowed marine mammals to move into them. During the Miocene era, the sea level began to recede, trapping the mammals within the continent.

== Morphology ==
Their necks are flexible, since their cervical vertebra are movable; this is remarkable since nearly all cetaceans&#x27; neck vertebra are fused, which rigidly aims most other cetaceans&#x27; heads forward. The Iniidae have other morphology common to species adapted to freshwater riverine habitats; which include highly reduced or absent dorsal fins, so they do not become entangled in vegetation from the flooded terrestrial plains; and large, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins that allow maneuverability in confined areas cramped by vegetation. Other riverine adaptations including a long rostrum, skull and jaw and reduced orbits.

Iniidae share many other characteristics in common with their marine odontocete relatives: Their stomachs include a fore-stomach, singled chambered main stomach, and a pyloric stomach with connecting channels. Like most other cetaceans Iniidae have lost their fur and lack true vocal cords. They share the similar structure of the tympanic bulla and lung shape, the position of their diaphragm and the position of the blowhole to the back of the head with their marine ancestors.

The dentition of Iniidae dolphins is heterodont, having conical, small teeth that differ slightly in the front of the mouth. The teeth extend lingually in the back and in the front they have a small depression on the side of each. These mammals are carnivorous, finding prey by using echolocation.

==Speciation==
There is scientific debate on the number of species within the genus &quot;Inia&quot;: The main issue is whether there are two or three species, or whether those can be considered sub-species. According to some researchers
* &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;
* &quot;Inia humboldtiana&quot;
* &quot;Inia boliviensis&quot; 

are three separate species, while many consider &quot;I. geoffrensis&quot; and &quot;I. boliviensis&quot; to be the only two. Martin in 2004 found supporting evidence that genetic exchange occurs between multiple sites on the Amazon, even places hundreds of kilometres apart.

==Taxonomy==
The family was described by John Edward Gray in 1846.

Current classifications include a single living genus, &quot;Inia&quot;, with one to four species and several subspecies.
The family also includes three extinct genera described from fossils found in South America, Florida, Libya, and Italy.

<text>Lipotidae is a family of river dolphins containing the possibly extinct baiji of China and the fossil genus &quot;Parapontoporia&quot; from the Late Miocene and Pliocene of the Pacific coast of North America. The genus &quot;Prolipotes&quot;, which is based on a mandible fragment from Neogene coastal deposits in Guangxi, China, has been classified as an extinct relative of the baiji, but is dubious. The oldest known member of the family is &quot;Eolipotes&quot; from the Late Miocene of Japan.

The only species of the Lipotidae family that has flourished until recent times is the baiji (&quot;Lipotes vexillifer&quot;), which lives in the Yangtze River system, but its population has declined drastically since the second half of the 20th century due to the severe aggression of industrial and fishing activities in China, and is thought to have become extinct in the early 21st century.

The putative kentriodontid &quot;&quot;Lophocetus&quot; pappus&quot; is a possible relative of Lipotidae.

<text>Diversitas (the Latin word for “diversity”) was an international research programme aiming at integrating biodiversity science for human well-being. In December 2014 its work was transferred to the programme called Future Earth, which was sponsored by the Science and Technology Alliance for Global Sustainability, comprising the International Council for Science (ICSU), the International Social Science Council (ISSC), the Belmont Forum of funding agencies, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

==Diversitas mission ==
Biodiversity underpins the life-support system of our planet. Both natural and managed ecosystems deliver important ecological services such as the production of food and fibre, carbon storage, climate regulation and recreation opportunities.
The program was established to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services and to offer science-based solutions to this crisis.

The program is an international programme of biodiversity science with a dual mission:
* Promoting, facilitating and conducting integrative biodiversity science, that links biological, ecological and social disciplines; and
* Providing the sound scientific basis for decision making to secure the planet’s variety of life, while contributing to human well-being and poverty eradication.
The program achieves its mission by:
* Fostering an integrated network of the world’s leading biodiversity scientists to address critical biodiversity issues;
* Producing new knowledge by catalysing exchanges between scientists across nations and disciplines;
* Synthesising new biodiversity knowledge to address the global science priorities;
* Ensuring an effective engagement of the biodiversity science community globally with policy and decision makers, especially with relevant international conventions;
* Developing biodiversity science capacity by nurturing younger scientists around the world.

The international Secretariat is based in Paris, France (hosted by the French National Museum of Natural History - Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle (MNHN)), while the different core projects are based all around the world.

==Diversitas history==

=== Phase 1 (1991-2001): Biodiversity gains attention on the global scale ===

The program was established in 1991 by three international organizations: the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) and the International Union of Biological Science (IUBS), at the time the need to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss of and change in global biodiversity was identified. The goal of the initiative was to develop an international, non-governmental umbrella programme for research projects.

In 1996, the program welcomed two new sponsors, the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS).

The key findings during its first decade were synthesised in a series of books and laid the groundwork for experimental and theoretical research carried out by the program and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). 
These findings also contributed to the Global Biodiversity Assessment, an initiative of the World Resources Institute (WRI), and to the work of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), established in 1992, and with which Diversitas has a Memorandum of Understanding.

=== Phase 2 (2002-2011): An international framework for biodiversity science ===

In 2001, the program organised an international consultation of its stakeholders on the need to launch a second phase of the programme. The conclusions of this consultation were in favour of launching a second phase, which would be more integrative and inter-disciplinary, and more policy relevant. 

The new science Plan was published in 2002. To implement this science plan, nine projects were established embracing a cycle of discovery, observation, analysis, and information sharing, on overarching scientific questions on biodiversity and related ecosystem services: 
* Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) – a project aiming at preventing and managing invasive species
* Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) – a project aiming at exploring and understanding mountain biodiversity
* – a project aiming at providing an evolutionary framework for biodiversity science
* – a project aiming at assessing, monitoring, and predicting biodiversity change
* – a project aiming at exploring the links between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services
* – a project aiming at building adaptive governance and management of ecosystem services
* – a project aiming at developing a new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable agro-ecosystems
* – a project aiming at exploring links between biodiversity and emerging infectious diseases
* – a project aiming at developing a new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable freshwater ecosystems
In addition to these scientific projects, the program has been strongly engaged in the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), a partnership for the integrated study of the Earth System, the ways that it is changing, and the implications for global and regional sustainability.
During this second phase, the program continued its engagement in serving policy fora, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in particular.
The program organized its first Open Science Conference in Oaxaca, Mexico, in October 2005, where the scientific community reiterated its support for the establishment of a scientific panel on biodiversity that included an intergovernmental component (cf. International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity (IMoSEB )) and its second Open Science Conference in Cape Town, South Africa, in October 2009; the Cape Town conference attracted an international audience of 700 scientists and policy makers from about 70 countries representing many facets of biodiversity science and policy.

=== Phase 3 (2012-2020): Biodiversity and ecosystem services science for a sustainable planet ===

Since mid-2009, and in the light of the changes in the biodiversity science-policy landscape, the program has been engaged in a phase of reviewing its activities and revising its 2002 Science Plan. The new science Plan was published in 2012. 
During this on-going phase, the program has been or is being strongly involved in:
* the establishment of a global observing system for biodiversity, called GEO BON - Group on Earth Observations - Biodiversity Observation Network. GEO BON represents the biodiversity component of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO),
* the consultation on an Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) which was launched in April 2012,
* the launch of the new scientific initiative Future Earth: research towards sustainability, which was launched at Rio+20, 
* the Planet Under Pressure conference in 2012, and
* the Rio+20 conference in 2012.

<text>Kreuzberg () is a district of Berlin, Germany. It is part of the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg borough located south of Mitte. During the Cold War era, it was one of the poorest areas of West Berlin, but since German reunification in 1990, it has become more gentrified and is known for its arts scene.

The borough is known for its large percentage of immigrants and descendants of immigrants, many of whom are of Turkish ancestry. As of 2006, 31.6% of Kreuzberg&#x27;s inhabitants does not have German citizenship. Kreuzberg is known for its diverse cultural life and experimental alternative lifestyles, and is an attractive area for many. However, some parts of the district are still characterized by higher levels of unemployment.

==Geography==

===Layout===
Kreuzberg is bounded by the river Spree in the east. The Landwehrkanal flows through Kreuzberg from east to west, with the Paul-Lincke-Ufer street running alongside it. Other characteristics are the old U-Bahn line of the present-day U1, Görlitzer Park in the SO36 district, and Viktoriapark on the slope of Kreuzberg hill in &quot;SW 61&quot;.

===Subdivision===
Kreuzberg is divided into 2 zones (&quot;Ortslagen&quot;):
#Östliches Kreuzberg (&quot;Berlin SO 36&quot;)
#Westliches Kreuzberg (&quot;Kreuzberg 61&quot;)

== History ==
In contrast to many other areas of Berlin, which were villages before their integration into Berlin, Kreuzberg has a rather short history. It was formed on 1 October 1920 by the Greater Berlin Act, which provided for the incorporation of suburbs and the reorganisation of Berlin into twenty boroughs. The eastern Friedrichsvorstadt, the southern Friedrichstadt, the western and southern Luisenstadt, and the Tempelhofer Vorstadt were merged into the new sixth borough of Berlin, first named &quot;Hallesches Tor&quot;. On 27 September 1921, the borough assembly of Hallesches Tor decided to rename the borough after the homonymous hill. Kreuzberg, literally meaning &#x27;cross hill&#x27;, is the point of the highest elevation in the Kreuzberg locality, which is above sea level. The hill is traditionally a place for weekend trips. It received its name from the 1821 Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars by Karl Friedrich Schinkel within the Viktoriapark, built in commemoration of the Napoleonic Wars. Except for its northernmost part—the quarter Friedrichstadt (established at the end of the 17th century)—today&#x27;s Kreuzberg was a very rural place until well into the 19th century.

This changed when, in the 1860s, industrialization caused Berlin to grow rapidly. This called for extensive housing—much of which was built exploiting the dire needs of the poor, with widespread land speculation. Many of Kreuzberg&#x27;s buildings originate from that time. They were built on the streets laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring.

Far into the 20th century, Kreuzberg was the most populous of Berlin&#x27;s boroughs even in absolute numbers, with more than 400,000 people, although it was and still is geographically the smallest. As a result, with more than , Kreuzberg had the highest population density in Berlin.

Kreuzberg became a district of migration during the late 19th century when Berlin began growing rapidly as an economic and cultural hub. Before World War II, it was home to a diverse population, with a large portion of the population being Ashkenazi Jews. Central to Kreuzberg Jewish life was the Fraenkelufer Synagogue, with a capacity of 2,000. This synagogue was destroyed during Kristallnacht, as were numerous Jewish businesses and property. The vast majority of Kreuzberg&#x27;s Jews were deported to their deaths between 1942 and 1944 by the Nazis during The Holocaust, and their houses and businesses were seized and given to ethnic Germans. The Jewish Museum Berlin stands in Kreuzberg, and many &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; can be seen on Kreuzberg streets, commemorating the murdered Jews who lived in the area. 
In addition to housing, Kreuzberg was also an industrial center of Berlin. The &quot;export quarter&quot; along Ritter Street consisted of many profitable small businesses, and the &quot;press quarter&quot; along Koch Street (Friedrichstadt) was the home of most of Germany&#x27;s large newspapers, as well as the Ullstein, Scherl, and Mosse book publishers.

Both industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed by air raids during World War II, with the American bombing by over a thousand aircraft on 3 February 1945. In remembrance of the old tradition, the Axel Springer press company erected its German headquarters at Kochstraße again, right next to the Berlin Wall.


In July 1945, most of the then district was assigned to the American Sector. After the Berlin Wall was built, the most important transit location to East Berlin was Checkpoint Charlie. 

After World War II, Kreuzberg&#x27;s housing rents were regulated by law which made investments unattractive. As a result, housing was of low quality, but cheap, which made the borough greatly attractive to immigrants. 
Starting in the late 1960s, increasing numbers of students, artists, and immigrants began moving to Kreuzberg. Enclosed by the Berlin Wall on three sides, the area became famous for its alternative lifestyle and its squatters, especially the SO36 part of Kreuzberg. Starting in 1987, there have been violent riots in SO36 on Labour day.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kreuzberg suddenly found itself in the middle of the city again. The initially cheap rents and the high concentration of 19th-century housing made some parts of the borough more attractive as a residential area for a much wider (and richer) variety of people. Today, Kreuzberg has one of the youngest populations of all European city boroughs; statistically, its population has been completely swapped twice in the last two decades.

Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform combined Kreuzberg with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Since the two areas are linked only by a single bridge over the Spree River, the , The two areas not being able to agree on a common location for the future borough&#x27;s city hall, the present location in Friedrichshain was decided by flipping a five-Mark coin.

== Culture ==
Kreuzberg has historically been home to Berlin&#x27;s punk rock movement as well as other alternative subcultures in Germany. The SO36 club remains a fixture on the Berlin music scene. It was originally focused on punk music and in the 1970s was often frequented by Iggy Pop and David Bowie. In those days, the club rivalled New York&#x27;s CBGB as one of the finest new-wave venues in the world.

There has also been a significant influence stemming from African-American and hip hop culture on Kreuzberg&#x27;s youth and the area has become a centre for rap and breakdance within Berlin. Though the majority of Kreuzberg&#x27;s residents are of German or Turkish descent, some identify more with (African-)American or other cultures.
Hip hop was largely introduced to the youth of Kreuzberg by the children of American servicemen who were stationed nearby until the reunification of Germany. The art collective Berlin Kidz who are known for their &quot;pichação&quot; influenced graffiti, parkour, and train surfing are from the Kreuzberg area. 

The Carnival of Cultures, a large annual festival, celebrates different cultures and heritages with colourful street parades and festivities including street entertainment, food, arts and craft stalls, music, and art.

Kreuzberg has long been the epicenter of LGBTQ life and arts in Berlin. Kreuzberg is home to the Schwules Museum, established in the 1980s and dedicated to preserving, exhibiting, and discovering queer history, art, and culture.

<text>Petrozavodsk (, ; Karelian, Vepsian and ) is the capital city of the Republic of Karelia, Russia, which stretches along the western shore of Lake Onega for some . The population of the city is 280,890 as of 2022.

== Etymology ==
The name of the city is a combination of words Peter (Peter the Great) and &quot;zavod&quot; (meaning factory).

It was previously known as &quot;Shuysky Zavod&quot; (1703–1704) and &quot;Petrovskaya Sloboda&quot; (1704–1777), which was the first name of the city related to Peter the Great. It was renamed to Petrozavodsk after Catherine the Great granted the settlement the status of a city.

It was unofficially planned in the 1930s to rename the city to &quot;Gyllinggrad&quot;, (lit. Gylling&#x27;s city) in honor of the long-time leader of the Karelian ASSR, Edvard Gylling. However, Gylling quickly became unpopular amongst Soviet authorities during the same decade and ended up being executed as part of the Great Purge, leading to the city never being renamed. Petrozavodsk is sometimes referred to as &quot;Kalininsk&quot;, after Mikhail Kalinin, in some older Soviet-era maps, regardless of the city never officially having such a name.

An ancient Swedish name was &quot;Onegaborg&quot;, known from a map from 1592 of the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius, and hence translated to Finnish as &quot;Äänislinna&quot;, a name used during the occupation of Eastern Karelia by Finnish forces during the Continuation War (1941–1944) in the context of World War II.

==History==

Archeological discoveries in the urban area indicate the presence of a settlement as far back as seven thousand years ago, and during the Middle Ages the site of modern city was marked by several lakeside villages. Within the city limits, the district of Solomennoje appears in surviving records dating back to the sixteenth century, and a map produced by the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius at the end of that century places a settlement here called Onegaborg on the site of modern Petrozavodsk.

On 11 September 1703, Prince Menshikov founded the settlement of Petrovskaya Sloboda (&quot;Petrine Sloboda&quot;). He did so at the behest of Tsar Peter the Great, who needed a new iron foundry to manufacture cannons and anchors for the Baltic Fleet at the time of the Great Northern War (1700–1721). At first the foundry used the name &quot;Shuysky zavod&quot; (literally, &quot;factory at the Shuya River&quot;), but a decade later it became &quot;Petrovsky zavod&quot; (&quot;Petrine factory&quot;), after the name of the reigning monarch. From this form the present name of the city derives.

By 1717, Petrovskaya Sloboda had grown into the largest settlement in Karelia, with about 3,500 inhabitants, a timber fort, a covered market, and miniature palaces of the Tsar and Menshikov. The town&#x27;s best-known landmark became the wooden church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, which was rebuilt in 1772 and renovated in 1789. The church retained its original iconostasis until this relic of the Tsar Peter the Great&#x27;s reign was destroyed by fire on October 30, 1924.

After Peter&#x27;s death, Petrovskaya Sloboda became depopulated and the factory declined. It closed down in 1734, although foreign industrialists maintained copper factories in the vicinity.

The industry revived in 1773 when Catherine the Great established a new iron foundry upstream the Lososinka River. Designed to provide cannons for the ongoing Russo-Turkish Wars, the foundry was named Alexandrovsky, after Alexander Nevsky, who was considered a patron saint of the region. The factory was modernized and expanded under supervision of Charles Gascoigne in 1787–96. Local pundits claim that the first railway in the world (чугунный колесопровод) was inaugurated for industrial uses of the Alexandrovsky foundry in 1788.
During Catherine&#x27;s municipal reform of 1777, Petrovskaya Sloboda was incorporated as a town, whereupon its name was changed to Petrozavodsk. A new Neoclassical city center was then built, focused on the newly planned Round Square. In 1784 Petrozavodsk was large enough to supplant Olonets as the administrative center of the region. Although Emperor Paul abolished Olonets Governorate, it was revived as a separate guberniya in 1801, with Petrozavodsk as its administrative center.

During the Finnish occupation in the Continuation war  (1941–1944), the city was styled as &quot;Äänislinna&quot; (or &quot;Ääneslinna&quot;), rather than the traditional &quot;Petroskoi&quot;. This name was a literal translation of &quot;Onegaborg&quot;, the name of a settlement marked on a 16th-century map by Abraham Ortelius near the present-day city, &quot;Ääninen&quot; being the Finnish toponym for Lake Onega. On 14 October 1941, occupation authorities opened the first concentration camp. By the liberation of Petrozavodsk there were 11 concentration camps.

In 1977, Petrozavodsk was the epicenter of what is called the Petrozavodsk phenomenon.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Petrozavodsk is the capital of the republic and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Prionezhsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of republic significance of Petrozavodsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the administrative divisions of the Republic of Karelia. As a municipal division, the city of republic significance of Petrozavodsk is incorporated as Petrozavodsky Urban Okrug.

==Politics==

The Petrozavodsk city council is a representative body of the city district, consisting of 28 deputies elected for five years according to a mixed system - 14 by party lists and 14 by single-member constituencies. The current membership was elected in the elections on 19 September 2021. On 7 October 2021, Nadezhda Dreyzis (United Russia) was elected Chairman of the City Council.

==Landmarks==

Petrozavodsk is distinguished among other towns of North Russia by its Neoclassical architectural heritage, which includes the Round Square (1775, reconstructed in 1789 and 1839) and the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (consecrated in 1832). Among the town&#x27;s landmarks are the outdoor statues of Peter I (bronze and granite, Ippolit Monighetti, 1873), Gavrila Derzhavin (a Russian poet who was the governor of Olonets in the 18th century), and Alexander Nevsky (erected outside Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in 2010).

The city has a fine frontage on the Gulf of Petrozavodsk. The modern embankment, inaugurated in 1994, displays an assortment of Karelian granites and marbles. It is lined with extravagant postmodernist sculptures presented by sister cities of Petrozavodsk from around the world. There is also a birch copse, where the first church of Petrozavodsk was built in 1703.

Petrozavodsk is home to the Karelia Philharmonic Orchestra (1933), the Karelian Musical Theater (1955, statuary by Sergey Konenkov), National Library of Karelia (1959), Finnish-speaking National Theatre of Karelia (1965), Petrozavodsk State University, a conservatory, a city museum founded in 1871, and a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

One of the city&#x27;s central landmarks is Lenin Square, an oval space with a large Soviet-era statue of Lenin in the center. The square is especially notable for English-speaking visitors because it is also called &quot;round square&quot; - an oxymoron in English, but not in Russian (&quot;kruglaya ploshad&quot;).

==Suburbs==

The village of Shoksha near Petrozavodsk contains a quarry of red and pink quartzite (Shoksha quartzite) which was used in construction of Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral and Lenin Mausoleum, among many other notable structures. There are also other quarries in the region excavating road aggregates (Goloday Gora – gabbro-diabase) near Derevyanka.

The suburb of Martsialnye Vody is the oldest spa in Russia, founded by Peter the Great in 1714 and visited by the Tsar on four occasions. Its name means &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot; in Russian. Although Peter&#x27;s palace at Martsialnye Vody has not survived, there is a museum devoted to the spa&#x27;s history.

From Petrozavodsk Harbor, a hydrofoil service of &quot;KareliaFlot&quot; company carries people to the island of Kizhi, a World Heritage Site with an outdoor museum of ancient wooden architecture.

Timofeeva shuttling people from Petrozavodsk to Sulazhgora. In April of 1918, Ivan Artemievich Maminov launched the first &quot;bus&quot; in Petrozavodsk, which shuttled people from the railway station to the city centre, breaking the monopoly that cab drivers had previously held. The state bus fleet in Petrozavodsk appeared in 1921, which would later become Convoy No. 1126. As of 2025, the bus system links the neighborhoods of Sulazhgora, Drevlyanka, and Kukkovka to the city center.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Petrozavodsk experiences a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) and unlike other localities in Russia on its latitude, temperatures are relatively mild for the latitude. This is due to the influence of the milder oceanic and maritime air masses reaching the city from the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, especially in winter and the moderating effect of the nearby lakes. The alternation of milder and colder air masses causes rapid changes in temperatures, especially during the cool half of the year. Winters, though long and cold, are mild for the high latitude, while summers are short and warm. The city experiences an average of 161 frost days per year, which is still less than places further east at the same latitude. The lake influence is stronger in summer, where Petrozavodsk has quite low diurnal temperature variation with mild nights for its latitude. Summer is moderately warm, autumn starts with clear but usually cool weather in the first half of September. Precipitation averages annually.

<text>Olivenza () or Olivença () is a town in southwestern Spain, close to the Portugal–Spain border. It is a municipality belonging to the province of Badajoz, and to the wider autonomous community of Extremadura.

The town of Olivença was under Portuguese sovereignty continuously between 1297 (Treaty of Alcañices) and 1801, when it was occupied by Spain during the War of the Oranges and ceded that year under the Treaty of Badajoz. Spain has since administered the territory (now split into two municipalities, Olivenza and Táliga), whereas Portugal invokes the self-revocation of the Treaty of Badajoz, plus the Congress of Vienna of 1815, to claim the return of the territory. In spite of the territorial dispute between Portugal and Spain, the issue has not been a sensitive matter in the relations between these two countries.

Olivenza and other neighbouring Spanish (La Codosera, Alburquerque and Badajoz) and Portuguese (Arronches, Campo Maior, Estremoz, Portalegre and Elvas) towns reached an agreement in 2008 to create a euroregion.

==Geography==
Olivenza is located on the left (east) bank of the Guadiana river, at an equal distance of south of Elvas in Portugal and Badajoz in Spain. The territory is triangular, with a smaller side resting on the Guadiana and the opposite vertex entering south-east and surrounded by Spanish territory. Besides the city, the municipality of Olivenza also includes other minor villages: (), (), (), (), (), and ().

The catchment area which drains Olivenza consists of irregular water streams regularly drying up in the Summer. The Olivenza river—whose water is dammed up in the reservoir of Piedra Aguda, opened in 1956 and with a capacity of 16.3 hm3—discharges into the Guadiana, leaving the city to its west and, then, south. Closer to the city (which is sandwiched in between the course of the lesser creeks of the Arroyo de la Charca and the Arroyo de la Higuera), there is an artificial pond, the &quot;charca&quot; of Ramapallas.

==History==

===Before the modern period===
It is possible the settlement did not exist during the Muslim period. A 1278 document refers to the place as &#x27;populated again&#x27;, but this is not conclusive. Badajoz and its surrounding territory (including the lands around Olivenza) were conquered by Alfonso IX of León in 1230. Taken away from the &quot;alfoz&quot; of Badajoz, the Knights Templars had occupied the territory already by 1258, founding an &quot;encomienda&quot; in Olivenza integrated in the Bailiwick of Jerez de los Caballeros. They proceeded to build a castle and a church as core of the hamlet, following the templar model of repopulation.

The second half of the 13th century saw continual territorial disputes between the Order of the Temple and the council of Badajoz over the lands north of the Fragamuñoz creek, and the municipal militias of Badajoz invaded Cheles, Alconchel and Barcarrota in 1272, although those territories were retroceded to the Order by means of a 1277 settlement. Soon later, by 1278, Alfonso X recognised the jurisdiction of the Council of Badajoz and the Diocese over Olivenza, putting an end to the Templar control over the hamlet. Amid a situation of unrest in the Crown of Castile in the wake of the death of King Sancho IV, King Dinis of Portugal forced King Ferdinand IV to sign the Treaty of Alcañices in 1297 and cede, amongst other possessions, Olivenza to the Kingdom of Portugal. On 4 January 1298, Dinis granted Olivenza a &quot;foral&quot; (charter) similar to that of Elvas.

*1510 – King Manuel I of Portugal renews the town charter and orders the building of fortifications and the Olivenza Bridge over the Guadiana River (&quot;Ponte de Olivenza&quot;, later known as &quot;Ponte de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda&quot; (Our Lady of Help Bridge) or, simply as Ajuda bridge), on the road to Elvas. Construction of Santa Maria Madalena Church begins. This church would be the residence of the Bishop of Ceuta for many years.

Following the start of the war between Castile and Portugal in 1640 (variously known as Secession, Aclamation, Restoration or Portuguese Independence War), Olivenza was taken in 1657 by forces loyal to the Spanish Monarchy led by Neapolitan governor Francesco Tuttavilla, Duke of San Germán after a long siege. By means of the 1668 Treaty of Lisbon, Olivenza was returned to the Kingdom of Portugal.
In the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, the Ajuda Bridge was used for the retreat of the Anglo-Portuguese army after they were crushed at the Battle of La Gudiña in May 1709. The victorious Spanish Bourbon army led by the Marquis de Bay ordered its destruction to prevent the Portuguese using it again.
===19th century===
In the wake of the Portuguese refusal to enter an alliance with France and Spain against Britain, the brief War of the Oranges began in 1801, with the French troops marching on Portugal, then followed by Spanish troops. Olivenza capitulated to the Spanish army led by Godoy on 20 May 1801. The 1801 Treaty of Badajoz putting an end to the war returned to Portugal the occupied towns except those on the left bank of the Guadiana river (the territory of Olivenza), which were ceded to Spain, including its inhabitants, on a &#x27;perpetual&#x27; basis. The Treaty also stipulated that the breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation.

The Spanish representative to the Congress, Pedro Gomes Labrador, refuses to sign the Treaty, registering a protest against several of the Congress resolutions, including article 105.
**27 October 1815 – Expecting the quick restitution of Olivenza, Prince Regent John nominates José Luiz de Sousa as Plenipotentiary.
*29 January 1817 – Portugal occupies Uruguay due to rebel threats against Brasil.

*1818–1819 – Spain and Portugal, with the mediation of France, the United Kingdom, Russia and Austria, negotiate in the Conference of Paris toward a peaceful restitution of Uruguay to Spain. Spain accepts the terms of an agreement proposed by the mediators but due to internal problems and the Liberal Revolution in 1820, actions never took place.

The demarcation of the border is not pursued further because of the situation of Olivenza.
===20th century===
*1918/1919 – With the end of World War I, the Portuguese government studies the possibility of taking the situation of Olivenza to the Paris Peace Conference. However, as Spain had not participated in the War, the intervention of the international community in this issue is not possible.
*29 June 1926 – Portugal and Spain sign the Convention of Limits (1926) an agreement demarcating the border from the confluence of Ribeira de Cuncos with the Guadiana, just south of Olivenza, to the estuary of the Guadiana, on the far South. The border between Portugal and Spain from the confluence of the Caya river to the confluence of the Cuncos is not demarcated and remains so nowadays, with the Guadiana being the &quot;de facto&quot; border.
*1936–1939 – During the Spanish Civil War, Portuguese Colonel Rodrigo Pereira Botelho volunteers to occupy Olivenza. The 8th Portuguese Regiment, stationed in nearby Elvas, prepares to take Olivenza but is ordered not to.

*24 January 1967 – The Portuguese government declares the Ponte da Ajuda Bridge a National Heritage Monument.
*1968 – A covenant between Portugal and Spain on exploitation of hydraulic resources in the frontier rivers is signed. All frontier rivers (including the non-demarcated section in the Guadiana river) are covered, distributing the hydraulic exploitation between both countries. The hydraulic exploitation of the non-demarcated section in the Guadiana river is assigned to Portugal (in the same way as the rights on hydraulic exploitation over other frontier rivers are assigned either to Portugal or to Spain). The only difference between this section and the rest is that the term &quot;international&quot; is omitted (all the sections are named &quot;international section&quot; but the non-demarcated one in the Guadiana river).
*1977 – A Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and Portugal is signed, in which both countries ratified the integrity and inviolability of their respective territories thereby effectively assuming Olivenza is under Spanish control.

The municipality lost an important chunk of its population from 1960 to 1975, with many working-age migrants moving to other Spanish cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Lleida) in the wake of the implementation of the Stabilization Plans but also moving abroad to countries such as Switzerland, Germany and France.

*1981 – Former prime minister of Portugal, admiral Pinheiro de Azevedo publishes a book on Olivenza and visits the town, leading Spain to send a contingent of the Civil Guard (&quot;Guardia Civil&quot;) to prevent any confrontation.

*1990
**In an Iberian Summit, the prime ministers of Portugal and Spain sign a covenant for the joint effort to preserve the Ponte da Ajuda Bridge, as well as the construction of a new bridge alongside it, also as a joint effort.
**Elvas and Olivenza became friendship towns.
*1994, November – After internal criticism that the agreement of 1990 would mean the recognition of the &quot;de facto&quot; border by the government of Portugal, the agreement is modified in another Iberian Summit. Portugal is now in full charge of constructing the new bridge and preserving the old bridge, therefore not putting the Portuguese claim to the territory of Olivenza at stake.
*March 1995 – The Portuguese government sends its Spanish counterpart a study on the effects that the construction of the Alqueva Dam would have on Spanish territory. Information on Olivenza is not included. Later, Portugal sends further information, including data on Olivenza, under the title &quot;Territory of Spain and Olivenza&quot;.
*October 1999 – The Spanish police stop preservation works being undertaken by the Portuguese on the old Ponte da Ajuda Bridge on the left bank (Spanish side) of the Guadiana river. The Portuguese had been working on that side of the bridge without Spanish permits assuming that the left bank-side of the Guadiana river belonged to Portugal, according to the 1968 covenant. In subsequent events, a Portuguese court order prevents Spain from taking over the works.
*11 November 2000 – The new Olivenza Bridge, constructed by Portugal and Spain, is inaugurated.
===21st century===
*2003
**Spain restarts work on the old bridge, under protest from the Portuguese government.
*2004

*December 2014 – Portuguese nationality is given to 80 residents of Olivenza, after their formal request. 90 other similar requests from residents of Olivenza are received by the Portuguese authorities. That represents less than 0.75 per cent of Olivenza&#x27;s population which, as of the 2021 census, is 11,871 inhabitants. In the beginning of 2018, the number of residents with Portuguese nationality is around 800 (6% of the town&#x27;s population).
*1 December 2018 – The Olivenza Marching Band participates in the Portuguese bands parade in Lisbon, in commemoration of the 1640 Restoration of the Portuguese Independence.
*2019 – For the first time, citizens of Olivenza with Portuguese citizenship could vote for the 2019 Portuguese legislative election (though by postal voting).
*2024 – During a ceremony marking Cavalry Regiment No. 3 (RC3) Day in Estremoz, Portugal&#x27;s Defense Minister Nuno Melo stated that Olivença &quot;is Portuguese&quot; and that the country &quot;will not give up&quot; on it. Later, he clarified on his X page that this was a personal opinion he had expressed while leader of the CDS – People&#x27;s Party, not in his capacity as defense minister.

== Demographics ==
The total population is 11,871 (2021). The total area is . Like the surrounding regions, population density is low, at 11 inhabitants per km2.

There are still traces of Portuguese culture and language in the people, although the younger generations speak Spanish.

At the beginning of the 1940s the city was reportedly mainly Portuguese-speaking (mother language spoken at home), even after close to 150 years under Spanish control.
It was after the 1940s, under Franco dictatorship, that a gradual language shift towards Spanish as native language took place as it looked to unite Spain and erase all signs of other cultures: the typically Portuguese looking streets had their names changed to Spanish, the Portuguese language was banned (making most people only able to speak Portuguese secretly inside their home), the education of children was controlled and even the names of Portuguese people changed to Spanish equivalent names (although some families kept using their Portuguese names and attributing Portuguese nicknames per family as an act of rebellion against the government).

After the 1970s, there was an ease on the early dictatorship policy.

Since 2021, around 1,300 inhabitants (8% of the town&#x27;s population) have asked for dual citizenship, and about 92% have not acquired Portuguese citizenship. As of 2018, 1,500 inhabitants (about 12% of the population) are bilingual Portuguese-Spanish (mostly among those born before 1950).

The European Commission showed some concern over the years regarding the need to protect the Portuguese language in the area. After some time, the children of Olivenza started learning Portuguese in school again.

An unofficial census carried out among the citizens of Olivenza overwhelmingly stated that the citizens of the town feel more Spanish than Portuguese, and most of them want to remain in Spain, even though it is unclear whether this is due to a sense of Spanish identity or simply due to Portugal&#x27;s current economic status. However, it must also be noted that even in the twenty-first century, after the Franco dictatorship, many who tried to stand for their heritage and culture were declared &quot;personae non gratae&quot; and some were accused of &quot;disrespecting the Spanish flag&quot; for protecting the Portuguese language.

== Landmarks ==
In 1964, Olivenza became one of the first municipalities in the province of Badajoz that earned a heritage protection status of &quot;conjunto histórico-artístico&quot; for their historic cores. The report for the declaration cited that the city of Olivenza, &quot;surrounded by a beautiful landscape of pasture and farmland, dominated by the imposing castle&#x27;s keep&quot;, &quot;offers a number of buildings, enclosures and places of notable importance in the monumental aspect&quot;.

Some landmarks include the church of Saint Mary of the Castle (, ), Holy Ghost Chapel (, ), Saint Mary Magdalene Church (, , considered a masterwork of Portuguese Manueline architecture), Saint John of God Monastery (, ), the keep (, ), and the ruins of the Our Lady of Help Bridge (, , destroyed in 1709 and never rebuilt).
==Claims of sovereignty==

Portugal does not recognise Spanish sovereignty over the territory, based on the rulings of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Spain accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivença and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved and Portugal holds a claim over it. Olivenza was under Portuguese sovereignty from 1297. During the War of the Oranges, French and Spanish troops, under the command of Manuel de Godoy, took the town on 20 May 1801. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Treaty of Badajoz was signed, with the Olivenza territory remaining a part of Spain. According to Portugal, however, the treaty is void since Portugal was coerced into signing it, meaning it does not show the deliberate intent and &quot;free will&quot; necessary for treaty validity under international law and the subsequent position of Portugal after 200 years of not recognising it as a legitimate part of Spain seems to confirm exactly that.

Spain claims ‘de jure’ sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked, thus making the case that the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated as said by the treaty.

Portugal claims &quot;de jure&quot; sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds of the cancellation of the Treaty of Badajoz, since it was revoked by its own terms. The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation, and that happened when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807. Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 (which Spain signed in 1817) that states that the winning countries are &quot;committed to employ the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority&quot; and that the winning countries &quot;recognize that the return of Olivenza and its territories must be done&quot;. Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297 and that the duty acknowledged by Spain to give back the region must be carried out.

Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz.

Even though Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, it has not directly acknowledged Spanish sovereignty over Olivença either but has funded several projects connected to the region instead of the Spanish Government.

Portuguese military maps do not show the border at that area, implying it to be undefined. Also, the latest road connection between Olivenza and Portugal (entirely paid by the Portuguese state, although it involved the building of a bridge over the Guadiana, an international river) has no indication of the Portuguese border, again implying an undefined status.

There is no research on the opinion of the inhabitants of Olivenza about their status. Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza. On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public.

<doc id="305835" wikidata="Q1066914" url="?curid=305835" title="Dog fighting">
<text>Dog fighting is a type of blood sport that turns game and fighting dogs against each other in a physical fight, often to the death, for the purposes of gambling or entertainment to the spectators. In rural areas, fights are often staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights are often staged in garages, basements, warehouses, alleyways, abandoned buildings, neighborhood playgrounds, or in the streets. Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, dies, or jumps out of the pit. Sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner; for instance, the dog&#x27;s owner may call off the fight.
Dog fighting generates revenue from stud fees, admission fees and gambling. Most countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries, such as Japan, and Albania. The sport is also popular in Russia.

== History ==


=== Europe ===
Blood sports in general can be traced back to the Roman Empire. In 13 BC, for instance, the ancient Roman circus slew 600 African beasts. Dog fighting, more specifically, can also be traced to ancient Roman times. In AD 43, for example, dogs fought alongside the Romans and the British in the Roman Conquest of Britain. In this war, the Romans used a breed that originated from Greece called the Molossus; the Britons used broad-mouthed Mastiffs, which were thought to descend from the Molossus bloodline and which also originated from Greece. Though the British were outnumbered and ultimately lost this war, the Romans were so impressed with the English Mastiffs that they began to import these dogs for use in the Colosseum, as well as for use in times of war. While spectators watched, the imported English Mastiffs were pitted against animals such as elephants, lions, bears and bulls, and also against gladiators.

Later, the Romans bred and exported fighting dogs to Spain, France and other parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England. Though bull-baiting and bear-baiting were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears. In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting to the rest of the British population. In later years, bull-baiting and bear-baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558 to 1603, was an avid follower of bull- and bear-baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England. In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London. The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight. Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden Museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.

With the popularity of bull- and bear-baiting, bears needed for such fights soon became scarce. With the scarcity of the bear population, the price of bears rose and, because of this, bull-baiting became more common in England over time. Bulls who survived the fights were slaughtered afterwards for their meat, as it was believed that the fight caused bull meat to become more tender. In fact, if a bull was offered for sale in the market without having been baited the previous day, butchers were liable to face substantial fines. Animal fights were temporarily suspended in England when Oliver Cromwell seized power, but were reinstated again after the Restoration. Dog fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting were officially outlawed in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. The official ban on all fights, however, actually served to promote dog fighting in England. Since a small amount of space was required for the pit where a dog fight took place, as compared to the ring needed for bull- or bear-baiting, authorities had a difficult time enforcing the ban on dog fighting.

=== United States ===
In 1817, the bull and terrier crossbreeds were brought to America and dog fighting slowly became part of American culture. Yet, though historical accounts of dog fighting in America can be dated back to the 1750s, it was not until the end of the Civil War (1861–1865) that widespread interest and participation in the blood sport began in the United States. For instance, in 1881, the Mississippi and Ohio railroads advertised special fares to a dog fight in Louisville; public forums such as Kit Burns&#x27; Tavern, &quot;The Sportman&#x27;s Hall&quot;, in Manhattan regularly hosted matches. Many of these dogs thrown into the &quot;professional pits&quot; that flourished during the 1860s came from England and Ireland — where citizens had turned to dogs when bull-baiting and bear-baiting became illegal in their countries.

In 20th century America, despite the expansion of laws to outlaw dog fighting, dog fighting continued to flourish underground. Aiding in the expansion of dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting as a form of entertainment amongst their ranks. In fact, the Police Gazette served as a go-to source for information about where one could attend a fight. When Henry Bergh, who started the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York. Additionally, Bergh&#x27;s 1867 revision to New York&#x27;s animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal. However, According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA has been disbanded and NYPD has taken over its duty. As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high-profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.

On July 8, 2009, one of the largest dog fighting raids in U.S. history occurred. Law enforcement seized over 350 dogs, mostly pit bulls, and arrested 26 people across eight states. Most of the dogs were expected to have to be euthanized, as their harsh upbringing did not prepare them to be able to be safely placed in an adoptive home.

== Breed origins ==
According to one scholar, Richard Strebel, the foundation for modern fighting dogs came from five dog types: the Tibetan Mastiff, the English Mastiff (out of which came the Dogue de Bordeaux, the Bulldog, and the Pug), the Great Dane (out of which came the Broholmer and the Boxer), the Newfoundland, and the Saint Bernard (out of which came the Leonberger). However, Dieter Fleig disagreed with Strebel and offered the following list as composing the foundation of modern fighting dogs: the Tibetan Mastiff, the Molossus, the Bullenbeisser, the Great Dane, the English Mastiff, the Bulldog, the bull and terrier, and the Chincha Bulldog. Other early dog types used for fighting included the Blue Paul Terrier, the Córdoba Fighting Dog, and the Dogo Cubano.

The foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build, strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice. Additionally, these foundation breeds were also bred for a powerful jaw that would enable them to defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals. These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.

When bull-baiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull-baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat. When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull&#x27;s nose and pin the bull&#x27;s head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw. These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.

However, when countries started outlawing bull- and bear-baiting, dog fighters started pitting dogs against other dogs. With the prevalence of such combat, dog fighters soon realized Bulldogs were inadequate and began to breed Bulldogs with terriers for more desired characteristics. Terriers were most likely crossbred with Bulldogs due to their &quot;generally rugged body structure&quot;, speed, aggression, and &quot;highly developed gameness&quot;. Yet, there is a debate over which type of terrier was bred with Bulldogs in order to create the bull and terrier. For instance, Joseph L. Colby claimed that it was the old English White Terrier that the bull and terrier is descended from, while Rhonda D. Evans and Craig J. Forsyth contend that its ancestor is the Rat Terrier. Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the bull and terrier.

Eventually, out of crossbreeding Bulldogs and terriers, the English created the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. When the Staffordshire Bull Terrier came to America in 1817, Americans began to selectively breed for gameness and created the American Pit Bull Terrier (originally known as the Pit Bull Terrier), which is a unique breed due to its absence of threat displays when fighting. Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, and American Staffordshire Terriers, are all breeds that are commonly labeled as &quot;pit bulls&quot;. The fact that pit bulls were historically bred to fight dogs, bulls, and bears has been used as one of the justifications in some US cities to implement breed-specific legislation. Other breeds in which dogs at various stages of the breed history have sometimes been used as fighters include the Akita Inu, the Boston terrier, the Bully Kutta, the Ca de Bou, the Dogo Argentino, the Gull Dong, the Gull Terrier, the Neapolitan Mastiff, the Presa Canario, the Spanish Mastiff, and the Tosa.

== Societal aspects ==
After interviewing 31 dogmen and attending 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting&#x27;s attractiveness in terms of masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One way to do this is through dog fighting. This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men.

Aside from enjoyment of the sport and status, people are also drawn to dog fighting for money. In fact, the average dog fight could easily net more money than an armed robbery or a series of isolated drug transactions.

=== Bait animals ===

&quot;Bait&quot; animals are animals used to test a dog&#x27;s fighting instinct; they are often mauled or killed in the process. Many of the training methods involve torturing and killing of other animals. Often &quot;bait&quot; animals are stolen pets such as puppies, kittens, rabbits, small dogs and even stock (pit bulls acquired by the dog fighting ring which appear to be passive or less dominant). Other sources for bait animals include wild or feral animals, animals obtained from a shelter or animals obtained from &quot;free to good home&quot; ads. The snouts of bait animals are often wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from fighting back and they are used in training sessions to improve a dog&#x27;s endurance, strength or fighting ability. A bait animal&#x27;s teeth may also be broken to prevent them from fighting back. If the bait animals are still alive after the training sessions, they are usually given to the dogs as a reward and the dogs finish killing them.

=== Types of dog fighters ===
==== Street fighters ====
Often associated with gang activity, street fighters fight dogs over insults, turf invasions, or simple taunts like &quot;my dog can kill your dog&quot;. These type of fights are often spontaneous; unorganized; conducted for money, drugs, or bragging rights; and occur on street corners, back alleys, and neighborhood playgrounds. Urban street fighters generally have several dogs chained in backyards, often behind privacy fences, or in basements or garages. After a street fight, the dogs are often discovered by police and animal control officers either dead or dying. Due to the spontaneity and secrecy of a street fight, they are very difficult to respond to unless reported immediately.

Hobbyists and professionals often decry the techniques that street fighters use to train their dogs. Such techniques include starving, drugging, and physically abusing the dog.

==== Hobbyists ====
Hobbyists fight dogs for supplemental income and entertainment purposes. They typically have one or more dogs participating in several organized fights and operate primarily within a specific geographic network. Hobbyists are also acquainted with one another and tend to return to predetermined fight venues repeatedly.

==== Professionals ====
Professional fighters breed generations of skilled &quot;game dogs&quot; and take great pride in their dogs&#x27; lineage. These fighters make a tremendous amount of money charging stud fees to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them. They also tend to own a large number of dogs — sometimes 50 or more. Professionals also use trade journals, such as &quot;Your Friend and Mine&quot;, &quot;Game Dog Times&quot;, &quot;The American Warrior&quot;, and &quot;The Pit Bull Chronicle&quot;, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks. When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method. Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.

=== Gang and criminal activities ===
Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, a person can be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other — depending on the evidence. In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, 48 states and the District of Columbia have provisions within their dog fighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dog fighting exhibition. Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, 46 states and the District of Columbia make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.

While dog fighting was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues — and therefore rarely enforced, the last decade has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs. Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer them on. Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid. There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dog fighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal. The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.

=== Animal welfare and rights ===
Animal advocates consider dog fighting to be one of the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because of the suffering they often endure in training, which ultimately can lead to death.

According to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published by &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces &quot;being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method&quot;.
Some of the training of fighting dogs may entail the use of small animals (including kittens) as prey for the dogs.

== Legal status ==

Dog fighting has been popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally and illegally around the world. In the 20th and 21st centuries, dog fighting has increasingly become an unlawful activity in most jurisdictions of the world, despite the fact that in cultural practice it may be common.

Dog fighting is illegal throughout the entire European Union and most of South America. The American Pit Bull Terrier is by far the most common breed involved in the blood sport. The Dogo Cubano and Córdoba Fighting Dog were used for fighting a century ago, but both of these breeds have become extinct.

=== Afghanistan ===
Previously banned by the Taliban during their rule, dog fighting has made a resurgence throughout Afghanistan as a common winter weekend pastime,
especially in Kabul, where the fights are public and often policed to maintain safety to the spectators. Dogs are not fought to the death, but to submission.

=== Albania ===
Dog fighting has been legal in Albania for over 25 years in professional fights.

=== Argentina ===

=== Australia ===
Dog fighting and the possession of any fighting equipment designed for dog fighting is illegal in all Australian states and territories. The illegal nature of dog fighting in Australia means that injured dogs rarely get veterinary treatment, placing the dog&#x27;s health and welfare at even greater risk. &quot;Restricted Breed Dogs&quot; cannot be imported into Australia. These include the Dogo Argentino, the Tosa, the Fila Brasileiro, the Perro de Presa Canario and the American Pit Bull Terrier. Of these, the American Pit Bull Terrier and the Perro de Presa Canario are the only breeds currently known to exist in Australia and there are strict regulations on keeping these breeds, including a prohibition on transferring ownership.

=== Bolivia ===
Bolivia passed a law in 2003 or 2004 criminalising dog fighting.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, Federal Decree 24.645 promulgated in 1934 by president Getúlio Vargas specifically prohibited &#x27;to cause an animal to fight with another&#x27;. Additionally, article 32 of the Federal Environmental Crimes Law (9.605 of 12 February 1998) prohibits abuse and cruelty against animals under the penalty of imprisonment from three months to one year, and a fine.

=== Canada ===
Dog fighting has been illegal in Canada since 1892; however, the current law requires police to catch individuals during the unlawful act, which is often difficult.

=== China ===
Dog fighting is allowed under Chinese law, although gambling remains illegal.

=== Costa Rica ===
In Costa Rica, dog fights were illegal for decades as a misdemeanor; since 2014 and after a legal reform, they became a felony and are punished with up to three years of imprisonment.

=== India ===
Dog fighting is prevalent in some parts of India, particularly in the state of Haryana. The practice is illegal under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

=== Japan ===

According to historical documents, Hōjō Takatoki, the 14th shikken (&quot;shōgun&quot;″s regent) of the Kamakura shogunate was known to be obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his samurai to pay taxes with dogs. During this period, dog fighting was known as .

Dog fighting was considered a way for the samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords), such as Chōsokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Yōdō, both from Tosa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in Akita Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.

Dog fighting evolved in Kōchi to a form that is called . Under modern rules, dogs fight in a fenced ring until one of the dogs barks, yelps, or loses the will to fight. Owners are allowed to admit defeat, and matches are stopped if a doctor judges that it is too dangerous. Draws usually occur when both dogs will not fight or both dogs fight until the time limit. There are various other rules, including one that specifies that a dog will lose if it attempts to copulate. Champion dogs are called yokozuna, as in sumo. Dog fighting is not banned at a nationwide level, but the prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Fukui, Ishikawa, Toyama and Hokkaidō all ban the practice. Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are of the Tosa breed, which is native to Kōchi.

=== The European Union ===
Dog fighting is illegal throughout the European Union.

==== Bulgaria ====

=== Honduras ===
Dog fighting had previously been popular for decades amongst the poorest people of Honduras. The most common dog of choice for trainers was the American Pit Bull Terrier. Matches were held in the shanty towns of Tegucigalpa, with fights taking place in a simple sand pit surrounded by bleachers, often with only a few dozen spectators. Dog Fighting was more of a spectating pastime for those living in poverty than a form of gambling for locals. Dog Fighting On The Rise Among Poor Of Honduras | The Seattle Times

On November 12, 2015, the Honduran National Congress approved the Animal Welfare Act which banned the use and ownership of fighting dogs. Anyone found subjecting a dog to, assisting in the management or organization of any form of dog fight training, matches or breeding programs can be imprisoned for 3–6 years.Honduras Bans Use Of Animals In Circuses And Dog Fighting

=== Pakistan ===
Even though it has recently been banned by law, it is still being practiced in rural Pakistan, especially in provinces such as Punjab, Azad Kashmir, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. Now Karachi is the most popular city about pit bull fighting with the proper rules. There can be as much as millions of rupees at stake for the owners of winning dogs, so different breeds have carefully been bred and selected specifically for the purpose, such as the Bully Kutta.

=== Panama ===
Law 308 on the Protection of Animals was approved by the National Assembly of Panama on 15 March 2012. Article 7 of the law states: &#x27;Dog fights, animal races, bullfights – whether of the Spanish or Portuguese style – the breeding, entry, permanence and operation in the national territory of all kinds of circus or circus show that uses trained animals of any species, are prohibited.&#x27; Horse racing and cockfighting were exempt from the ban.

=== The Philippines ===
Dog fighting is illegal in the Philippines, with those involved being convicted under animal cruelty laws.

=== Russia ===
Although animal cruelty laws exist in Russia, dog fighting is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dog fights have been passed in certain places like Moscow by order of that city&#x27;s mayor. In much of Russia, dog fights are legally held, generally using Caucasian Shepherd Dogs, Georgian shepherds and Central Asian Shepherd Dogs. Temperament tests, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Most dog fights are traditional contests used to test the stamina and ability of working dogs used to protect livestock. Unlike fights with pit bulls and other fighting breeds, a veterinarian is always on hand, the contests are never to the death, and serious injuries are very rare. Most fights are over in minutes when it is clear which dog is superior. At the end of three rounds, the contest is declared a draw.

=== South Africa ===
Dog fighting has been declared illegal in the Republic of South Africa. However, it is still very popular in the underground world, with dog fighting being a highly syndicated and organized crime. The NSPCA (National Council of SPCAs) is the largest animal welfare organization in Africa, and has been the organization that has conducted the most raids and busts, of which the most recent was in 2013, where 18 people were arrested, and 14 dogs were involved. Dog fighting is practiced throughout the country, in the townships area where gangs and drugs are mostly associated with dog fighting.

Dog fighting has been well documented in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region of Stellenbosch. The Stellenbosch Animal Welfare Society (AWS) frequently responds to complaints of nighttime dog fighting in the town of Cloetesville, in which hundreds of dogs fight. Young children may be used to transport fighting dogs to avoid the arrest of the owners.

==== Tsakane dog fighting case ====
In November 2013, the NSPCA arrested 18 suspects who were caught in the act of illegal dog fighting in Tsakane in the East Rand. The suspects were arrested and charged for illegal dog fighting. Dog fighting is a criminal and prosecutable offence in South Africa. 14 pit bull-type dogs were confiscated from the property and were used for fighting purposes. Some of the dogs were badly injured as a result of the fighting and had to be humanely euthanised. On 5 February 2018, a guilty verdict was handed down on 17 of the suspects by the presiding Magistrate in the Nigel Regional Court. 10 men were found guilty of being spectators at this dog fight and were sentenced to two years under strict house arrest (Benedict Ngcobo, Gift Nkabinde, Sabelo Mtshali, Thabiso Mahlangu, Bongani Skakane, Lehlohonolo Nomadola, Thulane Dhlosi, Mxolisi Khumalo, Nkosana Masilela, Sipho Masombuka). All the convicted men were found unfit to possess firearms and found unfit to own dogs and, if found to be in possession of a dog, would be liable to 12 months direct imprisonment. Further to the life-changing conditions of house arrest, the 10 spectators were also sentenced to 360 hours of community service and a total of R50 000 to be paid to the NSPCA. During the course of this trial, one of the accused chose to plead guilty and was sentenced to R20 000 or 20 months imprisonment, which was suspended for five years on the condition that he did not re-offend.

=== South Korea ===
Dog fighting is illegal in South Korea.

=== Taiwan ===

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Dog fighting is illegal in the United Arab Emirates according to Federal Law No. 16 of 2007 on animal welfare and its amendments in Federal Law No. 18 of 2016. It is considered an &#x27;act of animal cruelty&#x27; that is punishable by either imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or a fine of 200,000 United Arab Emirates dirham, or both.

=== United Kingdom ===
Dog fighting remains illegal under U.K. law. Despite periodic dog fight prosecutions, however, illegal canine pit battles continued after the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 of England and Wales. The Protection of Animals Act 1911 was specific in outlawing &quot;the fighting or baiting of animals&quot;.

Sporting journals of the 18th and 19th centuries depict the Black Country and London as the primary English dog fight centers of the period.

On 13 February 2019, the BBC News released an exposé on global dog fighting with strong U.K. links. The investigation started in June 2016, run by Hidden-in-Sight for the League Against Cruel Sports and latterly with the BBC. The exposé centred on a dog fighting group out of Bulgaria, who had been shipping fighting dogs around the world to over 20 countries. This exposé was the final piece of the Project BLOODLINE campaign that was set up to raise awareness of this cruel sport, the current weak sentencing options in the U.K. and show how animal crime links closely to existing policing priorities.

=== United States ===

Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In most of the U.S., a spectator at a dog fight can be charged with a felony, while some areas only consider it a misdemeanor offense. In addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture, except as performed outside the limits of the states of the U.S.

In the second largest dog fighting raid in U.S. history in August 2013, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama handed down the longest prison term ever handed down in a federal dog fighting case: eight years.

According to a Michigan State University College of Law study published in 2005, in the U.S., dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the Colonial period through the Victorian and well into the 20th century. In the second half of the 19th century, dog fighting started to be criminalized in the U.S.

There is a US$5,000 reward for reporting dog fighting to the Humane Society of the United States From the HSUS: How to spot signs of dog fighting in your community: an inordinate number of pit bull-type dogs being kept in one location, especially multiple dogs who are chained and seem unsocialized; dogs with scars on their faces, front legs and stifle area (hind end and thighs); dog fighting training equipment, such as &quot;breaking sticks&quot; or &quot;break sticks&quot; used to pry apart the jaws of dogs locked in battle, which are a foot long, flat on one side and appear to be sharpened; tires or &quot;spring poles&quot; (usually a large spring with rope attached to either end) hanging from tree limbs; or unusual foot traffic coming and going from a location at odd hours.

CNN in 2007 estimated that in the U.S., more than 100,000 people are engaged in dog fighting on a non-professional basis and roughly 40,000 individuals are involved as professionals in the sport of dog fighting as a commercial activity. Top fights are said to have purses of $100,000 or more.

<text>Juris Hartmanis (July 5, 1928 – July 29, 2022) was a Latvian-born American computer scientist and computational theorist who, with Richard E. Stearns, received the 1993 ACM Turing Award &quot;in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Hartmanis was born in Latvia on July 5, 1928. He was a son of , a general in the Latvian Army, and Irma Marija Hartmane. He was the younger brother of the poet Astrid Ivask. After the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940, Mārtiņš Hartmanis was arrested by the Soviets and died in prison. Later in World War II, the wife and children of Mārtiņš Hartmanis left Latvia in 1944 as refugees, fearing for their safety if the Soviet Union took over Latvia again.

They first moved to Germany, where Juris Hartmanis received the equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree in physics from the University of Marburg. He then moved to the United States, where in 1951 he received a master&#x27;s degree in applied mathematics at the University of Kansas City (now known as the University of Missouri–Kansas City) and in 1955 a Ph.D. in mathematics from Caltech under the supervision of Robert P. Dilworth. The University of Missouri–Kansas City honored him with an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1999.
After teaching mathematics at Cornell University and Ohio State University, Hartmanis joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in 1958. While at General Electric, he developed many principles of computational complexity theory. In 1965, he became a professor at Cornell University. He was one of the founders and the first chair of its computer science department (which was one of the first computer science departments in the world).

Hartmanis contributed to national efforts to advance computer science and engineering (CS&amp;E) in many ways. Most significantly, he chaired the National Research Council study that resulted in the 1992 publication &quot;Computing the Future – A Broad Agenda for Computer Science and Engineering&quot;, which made recommendations based on its priorities to sustain the core effort in CS&amp;E, to broaden the field, and to improve undergrad education in CS&amp;E. He was assistant director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) from 1996 to 1998.

In 1989, Hartmanis was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for fundamental contributions to computational complexity theory and to research and education in computing. He was a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the American Mathematical Society, also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a foreign member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, which bestowed him their in 2001 for his contributions to computer science.

Hartmanis died on July 29, 2022.

==Computational complexity: foundational contributions==
In 1993, Hartmanis and R.E. Stearns received 
the highest prize in computer science, the Turing Award. The citation reads,
&quot;In recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field
of computational complexity theory.&quot;
Their paper
defined the foundational notion of a Complexity class, a way of
classifying computational problems according to the time required to solve them.
They went on to prove a number of fundamental results such as the
Time hierarchy theorem. In his own Turing Award lecture, Richard M. Karp remarks that &quot;[I]t is the 1965 paper by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns that marks the beginning of the modern era of
complexity theory.&quot;

With P.M. Lewis II, Hartmanis and Stearns also defined complexity classes based on space usage. They proveded
the first space hierarchy theorem. In the same year they 
also proved that every context-free language has deterministic
space complexity , which contained the essential idea that led
to Savitch&#x27;s theorem on space complexity.

Hartmanis continued to make significant contributions to the field of computational complexity for decades. With Leonard Berman, he proved that all natural NP-complete languages are polynomial-time isomorphic and conjectured
that this holds for all NP-complete sets. Although 
the conjecture itself remains open, it has led to
a large body of research on the structure of NP-complete sets, culminating
in Mahaney&#x27;s theorem on the nonexistence of sparse NP-complete sets. He and his coauthors also 
defined the Boolean hierarchy.

Hartmanis&#x27;s 1981 article gives a personal account of developments in this area and in automata theory and discusses
the underlying beliefs and philosophy that guided his research. The book
written in honor of his 60th birthday, in particular, the chapter by Stearns, is a valuable resource on computational complexity.

In the late 1980s, Hartmanis&#x27;s exposition on a newly discovered letter dated 20 March 1956
from Gödel to von Neumann brought fresh insight
into the early history of computational complexity before his landmark paper with Stearns,
touching on interactions among Turing, Gödel, 
Church, Post, and Kleene.
Gödel, in this letter, was the first to question whether a problem equivalent to an NP-complete
problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time, presaging the P = NP? question.

<text>Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory (also known as VC theory) was developed during 1960–1990 by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis. The theory is a form of computational learning theory, which attempts to explain the learning process from a statistical point of view.

== Introduction ==
VC theory covers at least four parts (as explained in &quot;The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory&quot;):
*Theory of consistency of learning processes 
**What are (necessary and sufficient) conditions for consistency of a learning process based on the empirical risk minimization principle?
*Nonasymptotic theory of the rate of convergence of learning processes 
**How fast is the rate of convergence of the learning process?
*Theory of controlling the generalization ability of learning processes
**How can one control the rate of convergence (the generalization ability) of the learning process?
*Theory of constructing learning machines
**How can one construct algorithms that can control the generalization ability?

VC Theory is a major subbranch of statistical learning theory. One of its main applications in statistical learning theory is to provide generalization conditions for learning algorithms. From this point of view, VC theory is related to stability, which is an alternative approach for characterizing generalization.

In addition, VC theory and VC dimension are instrumental in the theory of empirical processes, in the case of processes indexed by VC classes. Arguably these are the most important applications of the VC theory, and are employed in proving generalization. Several techniques will be introduced that are widely used in the empirical process and VC theory. The discussion is mainly based on the book &quot;Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes: With Applications to Statistics&quot;.

== Overview of VC theory in empirical processes ==
=== Background on empirical processes ===
Let formula_1 be a measurable space. For any measure formula_2 on formula_1, and any measurable functions formula_4, define

:formula_5

Measurability issues will be ignored here, for more technical detail see. Let formula_6 be a class of measurable functions formula_4 and define:

:formula_8

Let formula_9 be independent, identically distributed random elements of formula_1. Then define the empirical measure

:formula_11

where here stands for the Dirac measure. The empirical measure induces a map formula_12 given by:

:formula_13

Now suppose is the underlying true distribution of the data, which is unknown. Empirical Processes theory aims at identifying classes formula_6 for which statements such as the following hold:

*uniform law of large numbers:formula_15

:That is, as formula_16,
:formula_17
:uniformly for all formula_18.

*uniform central limit theorem: 
::formula_19

In the former case formula_6 is called &quot;Glivenko–Cantelli&quot; class, and in the latter case (under the assumption formula_21) the class formula_6 is called &quot;Donsker&quot; or -Donsker. A Donsker class is Glivenko–Cantelli in probability by an application of Slutsky&#x27;s theorem .

These statements are true for a single formula_23, by standard LLN, CLT arguments under regularity conditions, and the difficulty in the Empirical Processes comes in because joint statements are being made for all formula_18. Intuitively then, the set formula_6 cannot be too large, and as it turns out that the geometry of formula_6 plays a very important role.

One way of measuring how big the function set formula_6 is to use the so-called covering numbers. The covering number

:formula_28

is the minimal number of balls formula_29 needed to cover the set formula_6 (here it is obviously assumed that there is an underlying norm on formula_6). The entropy is the logarithm of the covering number.

Two sufficient conditions are provided below, under which it can be proved that the set formula_6 is Glivenko–Cantelli or Donsker.

A class formula_6 is -Glivenko–Cantelli if it is -measurable with envelope such that formula_34 and satisfies:

:formula_35

The next condition is a version of the celebrated Dudley&#x27;s theorem. If formula_6 is a class of functions such that

:formula_37

then formula_6 is -Donsker for every probability measure such that formula_39. In the last integral, the notation means

:formula_40.

=== Symmetrization ===
The majority of the arguments of how to bound the empirical process rely on symmetrization, maximal and concentration inequalities, and chaining. Symmetrization is usually the first step of the proofs, and since it is used in many machine learning proofs on bounding empirical loss functions (including the proof of the VC inequality which is discussed in the next section) it is presented here.

Consider the empirical process:

:formula_41

Turns out that there is a connection between the empirical and the following symmetrized process:

:formula_42

The symmetrized process is a Rademacher process, conditionally on the data formula_43. Therefore, it is a sub-Gaussian process by Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality.

Lemma (Symmetrization). For every nondecreasing, convex and class of measurable functions formula_6,

:formula_45

The proof of the Symmetrization lemma relies on introducing independent copies of the original variables formula_46 (sometimes referred to as a &quot;ghost sample&quot;) and replacing the inner expectation of the LHS by these copies. After an application of Jensen&#x27;s inequality different signs could be introduced (hence the name symmetrization) without changing the expectation. The proof can be found below because of its instructive nature. The same proof method can be used to prove the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem.

 = \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \dfrac{1}{n} \left|\sum_{i = 1}^n f(X_i) - \mathbb{E} f(Y_i) \right| \leq \mathbb{E}_{Y} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \dfrac{1}{n} \left|\sum_{i = 1}^n f(X_i) - f(Y_i) \right|&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, by Jensen&#x27;s inequality:
:formula_47
Taking expectation with respect to formula_48 gives:
:formula_49
Note that adding a minus sign in front of a term formula_50 doesn&#x27;t change the RHS, because it&#x27;s a symmetric function of formula_48 and formula_52. Therefore, the RHS remains the same under &quot;sign perturbation&quot;:
:formula_53
for any formula_54. Therefore:
:formula_55
Finally using first triangle inequality and then convexity of formula_56 gives:
:formula_57
Where the last two expressions on the RHS are the same, which concludes the proof.

A typical way of proving empirical CLTs, first uses symmetrization to pass the empirical process to formula_58 and then argue conditionally on the data, using the fact that Rademacher processes are simple processes with nice properties.

=== VC Connection ===
It turns out that there is a fascinating connection between certain combinatorial properties of the set formula_6 and the entropy numbers. Uniform covering numbers can be controlled by the notion of &quot;Vapnik–Chervonenkis classes of sets&quot; – or shortly &quot;VC sets&quot;.

Consider a collection formula_60 of subsets of the sample space formula_61. formula_60 is said to &quot;pick out&quot; a certain subset formula_63 of the finite set formula_64 if formula_65 for some formula_66. formula_60 is said to &quot;shatter&quot; if it picks out each of its subsets. The &quot;VC-index&quot; (similar to VC dimension + 1 for an appropriately chosen classifier set) formula_68 of formula_60 is the smallest for which no set of size is shattered by formula_60.

Sauer&#x27;s lemma then states that the number formula_71 of subsets picked out by a VC-class formula_60 satisfies:

:formula_73

Which is a polynomial number formula_74 of subsets rather than an exponential number. Intuitively this means that a finite VC-index implies that formula_60 has an apparent simplistic structure.

A similar bound can be shown (with a different constant, same rate) for the so-called &quot;VC subgraph classes&quot;. For a function formula_76 the &quot;subgraph&quot; is a subset of formula_77 such that: formula_78. A collection of formula_6 is called a VC subgraph class if all subgraphs form a VC-class.

Consider a set of indicator functions formula_80 in formula_81 for discrete empirical type of measure (or equivalently for any probability measure ). It can then be shown that quite remarkably, for formula_82:

:formula_83

Further consider the &quot;symmetric convex hull&quot; of a set formula_6: formula_85 being the collection of functions of the form formula_86 with formula_87. Then if

:formula_88

the following is valid for the convex hull of formula_6:

:formula_90

The important consequence of this fact is that

: formula_91

which is just enough so that the entropy integral is going to converge, and therefore the class formula_85 is going to be -Donsker.

Finally an example of a VC-subgraph class is considered. Any finite-dimensional vector space formula_6 of measurable functions formula_4 is VC-subgraph of index smaller than or equal to formula_95.

Proof: Take formula_96 points formula_97. The vectors:
:formula_98
are in a dimensional subspace of . Take , a vector that is orthogonal to this subspace. Therefore:
:formula_99
Consider the set formula_100. This set cannot be picked out since if there is some formula_23 such that formula_102 that would imply that the LHS is strictly positive but the RHS is non-positive.

There are generalizations of the notion VC subgraph class, e.g. there is the notion of pseudo-dimension.

== VC inequality ==
A similar setting is considered, which is more common to machine learning. Let formula_61 is a feature space and formula_104. A function formula_105 is called a classifier. Let formula_6 be a set of classifiers. Similarly to the previous section, define the &quot;shattering coefficient&quot; (also known as growth function):

:formula_107

Note here that there is a 1:1 go between each of the functions in formula_6 and the set on which the function is 1. We can thus define formula_60 to be the collection of subsets obtained from the above mapping for every formula_110. Therefore, in terms of the previous section the shattering coefficient is precisely

:formula_111.

This equivalence together with Sauer&#x27;s Lemma implies that formula_112 is going to be polynomial in , for sufficiently large provided that the collection formula_60 has a finite VC-index.

Let formula_114 is an observed dataset. Assume that the data is generated by an unknown probability distribution formula_115. Define formula_116 to be the expected 0/1 loss. Of course since formula_115 is unknown in general, one has no access to formula_118. However the &quot;empirical risk&quot;, given by:

:formula_119

can certainly be evaluated. Then one has the following Theorem:

===Theorem (VC Inequality)===
For binary classification and the 0/1 loss function we have the following generalization bounds:

:formula_120

In words the VC inequality is saying that as the sample increases, provided that formula_6 has a finite VC dimension, the empirical 0/1 risk becomes a good proxy for the expected 0/1 risk. Note that both RHS of the two inequalities will converge to 0, provided that formula_112 grows polynomially in .

The connection between this framework and the Empirical Process framework is evident. Here one is dealing with a modified empirical process

:formula_123

but not surprisingly the ideas are the same. The proof of the (first part of) VC inequality, relies on symmetrization, and then argue conditionally on the data using concentration inequalities (in particular Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality). The interested reader can check the book Theorems 12.4 and 12.5.

<text>The stere or stère (st) is a unit of volume in the original metric system equal to one cubic metre. The stere is typically used for measuring large quantities of firewood or other cut wood, while the cubic meter is used for uncut wood. The name was coined from the Greek στερεός &quot;stereós&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, in 1795 in France as a metric analogue to the cord. The unit was introduced to remove regional disparities of this former unit, for which the length could vary greatly from 6 to 13.5 m. It is not part of the modern metric system (SI) and is no longer a legal unit in France, but remains used in the commerce of firewood.

==Background==
The correspondence between stere and cubic meters of stacked wood is imprecise because it depends on the length of the logs used and on how irregular they are. The stere corresponds to of wood, made exclusively with logs of in length, all stacked parallel and neatly arranged. If the logs are less than 1 m, the volume of visible wood decreases because the voids are better occupied. Thus the &quot;stere&quot; no longer corresponds to 1 m3, but to for logs, for logs and for logs.

In Dutch and German, a closely related unit called &quot;kuub&quot; (Dutch), short for &quot;kubieke meter&quot;, or &quot;Kubikmeter&quot; (German) which differs from a stere. Whereas a &quot;kuub&quot; or &quot;Kubikmeter&quot; is a solid cubic metre, as it was traditionally used for wood, a stere (in German: Raummeter) is a cubic metre pile of woodblocks. A stere or Raummeter is less than a kuub or full cubic metre of wood, because the spaces between the woodblocks are included in a stere, while they do not count towards a kuub or Kubikmeter. In Finnish, the same unit is known as &quot;motti&quot; (from Swedish &quot;mått&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;).

The stere as used in contexts outside the timber industry is not subject to the same ambiguity. In particular, stere and kilostere are sometimes used in hydrology, as the kilostere ( or megalitre) is a slightly smaller metric analogue of an acre-foot (approximately ), similar to the relationship of the metric tonne to the short ton.

<text>In Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the size (capacity, complexity, expressive power, richness, or flexibility) of a class of sets. The notion can be extended to classes of binary functions. It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter, which means the algorithm can always learn a perfect classifier for any labeling of at least one configuration of those data points. It was originally definyed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis.

Informally, the capacity of a classification model is related to how complicated it can be. For example, consider the thresholding of a high-degree polynomial: if the polynomial evaluates above zero, that point is classified as positive, otherwise as negative. A high-degree polynomial can be wiggly, so that it can fit a given set of training points well. But one can expect that the classifier will make errors on other points, because it is too wiggly. Such a polynomial has a high capacity. A much simpler alternative is to threshold a linear function. This function may not fit the training set well, because it has a low capacity. This notion of capacity is made rigorous below.

== Definitions ==
=== VC dimension of a set-family ===

Let formula_1 be a set family (a set of sets) and formula_2 a set. Their &quot;intersection&quot; is defined as the following set family:
:formula_3

We say that a set formula_2 is &quot;shattered&quot; by formula_1 if formula_6 contains all the subsets of formula_2, i.e.:
:formula_8

The &quot;VC dimension&quot; formula_9 of formula_1 is the cardinality of the largest set that is shattered by formula_1. If arbitrarily large sets can be shattered, the VC dimension is formula_12.

=== VC dimension of a classification model ===
A binary classification model formula_13 with some parameter vector formula_14 is said to &quot;shatter&quot; a set of generally positioned data points formula_15 if, for every assignment of labels to those points, there exists a formula_14 such that the model formula_13 makes no errors when evaluating that set of data points.

The VC dimension of a model formula_13 is the maximum number of points that can be arranged so that formula_13 shatters them. More formally, it is the maximum cardinal formula_9 such that there exists a generally positioned data point set of cardinality formula_9 that can be shattered by formula_13.

== Examples ==
# formula_13 is a constant classifier (with no parameters); Its VC dimension is 0 since it cannot shatter even a single point. In general, the VC dimension of a finite classification model, which can return at most formula_24 different classifiers, is at most formula_25 (this is an upper bound on the VC dimension; the Sauer–Shelah lemma gives a lower bound on the dimension).
# formula_13 is a single-parametric threshold classifier on real numbers; i.e., for a certain threshold formula_14, the classifier formula_28 returns 1 if the input number is larger than formula_14 and 0 otherwise. The VC dimension of formula_13 is 1 because: (a) It can shatter a single point. For every point formula_31, a classifier formula_28 labels it as 0 if formula_33 and labels it as 1 if formula_34. (b) It cannot shatter all the sets with two points. For every set of two numbers, if the smaller is labeled 1, then the larger must also be labeled 1, so not all labelings are possible.
# formula_13 is a single-parametric interval classifier on real numbers; i.e., for a certain parameter formula_14, the classifier formula_28 returns 1 if the input number is in the interval formula_38 and 0 otherwise. The VC dimension of formula_13 is 2 because: (a) It can shatter some sets of two points. E.g., for every set formula_40, a classifier formula_28 labels it as (0,0) if formula_42 or if formula_43, as (1,0) if formula_44, as (1,1) if formula_45, and as (0,1) if formula_46. (b) It cannot shatter any set of three points. For every set of three numbers, if the smallest and the largest are labeled 1, then the middle one must also be labeled 1, so not all labelings are possible.
# formula_13 is a straight line as a classification model on points in a two-dimensional plane (this is the model used by a perceptron). The line should separate positive data points from negative data points. There exist sets of 3 points that can indeed be shattered using this model (any 3 points that are not collinear can be shattered). However, no set of 4 points can be shattered: by Radon&#x27;s theorem, any four points can be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls, so it is not possible to separate one of these two subsets from the other. Thus, the VC dimension of this particular classifier is 3. It is important to remember that while one can choose any arrangement of points, the arrangement of those points cannot change when attempting to shatter for some label assignment. Note, only 3 of the 23 = 8 possible label assignments are shown for the three points.
# formula_13 is a single-parametric sine classifier, i.e., for a certain parameter formula_14, the classifier formula_28 returns 1 if the input number formula_31 has formula_52 and 0 otherwise. The VC dimension of formula_13 is infinite, since it can shatter any finite subset of the set formula_54.
== Uses ==

=== In statistical learning theory ===
The VC dimension can predict a probabilistic upper bound on the test error of a classification model. Vapnik proved that the probability of the test error (i.e., risk with 0–1 loss function) distancing from an upper bound (on data that is drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution as the training set) is given by:

:formula_55

where formula_9 is the VC dimension of the classification model, formula_57, and formula_58 is the size of the training set (restriction: this formula is valid when formula_59. When formula_9 is larger, the test-error may be much higher than the training-error. This is due to overfitting).

The VC dimension also appears in sample-complexity bounds. A space of binary functions with VC dimension formula_9 can be learned with:

:formula_62

samples, where formula_63 is the learning error and formula_64 is the failure probability. Thus, the sample-complexity is a linear function of the VC dimension of the hypothesis space.

=== In computational geometry ===
The VC dimension is one of the critical parameters in the size of ε-nets, which determines the complexity of approximation algorithms based on them; range sets without finite VC dimension may not have finite ε-nets at all.

== Bounds ==
# The VC dimension of a finite set-family formula_1 is at most formula_66. This is because formula_67 by definition.
# Given a set-family formula_1, define formula_69 as a set-family that contains all intersections of formula_70 elements of formula_1. Then: formula_72
# Given a set-family formula_1 and an element formula_74, define formula_75 where formula_76 denotes symmetric set difference. Then: formula_77

== Examples of VC Classes ==

=== VC dimension of a finite projective plane ===
A finite projective plane of order &quot;n&quot; is a collection of &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1 sets (called &quot;lines&quot;) over &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1 elements (called &quot;points&quot;), for which:

* Each line contains exactly &quot;n&quot; + 1 points.
* Each line intersects every other line in exactly one point.
* Each point is contained in exactly &quot;n&quot; + 1 lines.
* Each point is in exactly one line in common with every other point.
* At least four points do not lie in a common line.

The VC dimension of a finite projective plane is 2.

&quot;Proof&quot;: (a) For each pair of distinct points, there is one line that contains both of them, lines that contain only one of them, and lines that contain none of them, so every set of size 2 is shattered. (b) For any triple of three distinct points, if there is a line &quot;x&quot; that contain all three, then there is no line &quot;y&quot; that contains exactly two (since then &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; would intersect in two points, which is contrary to the definition of a projective plane). Hence, no set of size 3 is shattered.

=== VC dimension of a boosting classifier ===
Suppose we have a base class formula_78 of simple classifiers, whose VC dimension is formula_9.

We can construct a more powerful classifier by combining several different classifiers from formula_78; this technique is called boosting. Formally, given formula_81 classifiers formula_82 and a weight vector formula_83, we can define the following classifier:
:formula_84

The VC dimension of the set of all such classifiers (for all selections of formula_81 classifiers from formula_78 and a weight-vector from formula_87), assuming formula_88, is at most:
:formula_89

=== VC dimension of a neural network ===

A neural network is described by a directed acyclic graph &quot;G&quot;(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;), where:
* &quot;V&quot; is the set of nodes. Each node is a simple computation cell. 
* &quot;E&quot; is the set of edges, Each edge has a weight. 
* The input to the network is represented by the sources of the graph – the nodes with no incoming edges.
* The output of the network is represented by the sinks of the graph – the nodes with no outgoing edges.
* Each intermediate node gets as input a weighted sum of the outputs of the nodes at its incoming edges, where the weights are the weights on the edges.
* Each intermediate node outputs a certain increasing function of its input, such as the sign function or the sigmoid function. This function is called the &quot;activation function&quot;.

The VC dimension of a neural network is bounded as follows:
* If the activation function is the sign function and the weights are general, then the VC dimension is at most formula_90.
* If the activation function is the sigmoid function and the weights are general, then the VC dimension is at least formula_91 and at most formula_92.
* If the weights come from a finite family (e.g. the weights are real numbers that can be represented by at most 32 bits in a computer), then, for both activation functions, the VC dimension is at most formula_93.

== Generalizations ==
The VC dimension is defined for spaces of binary functions (functions to {0,1}). Several generalizations have been suggested for spaces of non-binary functions.

* For multi-class functions (e.g., functions to {0...,&quot;n-1&quot;}), the Natarajan dimension, and its generalization the DS dimension can be used.
* For real-valued functions (e.g., functions to a real interval, [0,1]), the Graph dimension or Pollard&#x27;s pseudo-dimension can be used.
* The Rademacher complexity provides similar bounds to the VC, and can sometimes provide more insight than VC dimension calculations into such statistical methods such as those using kernels.
* The Memory Capacity (sometimes Memory Equivalent Capacity) gives a lower bound capacity, rather than an upper bound (see for example: Artificial neural network#Capacity) and therefore indicates the point of potential overfitting.

<doc id="305847" wikidata="Q335081" url="?curid=305847" title="Megali Idea">
<text>The Megali Idea () is a nationalist and irredentist concept that expresses the goal of reviving the Byzantine Empire, by establishing a Greek state, which would include the large Greek populations that were still under Ottoman rule after the end of the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) and all the regions that had large Greek populations (parts of the southern Balkans, Anatolia and Cyprus).

The term appeared for the first time during the debates of Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis with King Otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution. It came to dominate foreign relations and played a significant role in domestic politics for much of the first century of Greek independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche, which long had hopes of liberation from Ottoman rule and restoration of the Byzantine Empire.

Πάλι με χρόνια με καιρούς,
:πάλι δικά μας θα &#x27;ναι!
(&quot;Once more, as years and time go by, once more they shall be ours&quot;).

The Megali Idea implies establishing a Greek state, which would be a territory encompassing mostly the former Byzantine lands from the Ionian Sea in the west to Anatolia and the Black Sea to the east and from Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus in the north to Crete and Cyprus to the south. This new state would have Constantinople as its capital: it would be the &quot;Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas&quot; (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan Seas). If realized, this would expand modern Greece to roughly the same size and extent of the later Byzantine Empire, after its restoration in 1261 AD.

The Megali Idea dominated foreign policy and domestic politics of Greece from the War of Independence in the 1820s through the Balkan wars in the beginning of the 20th century. It started to fade after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), followed by the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Despite the end of the Megali Idea project in 1922, by then the Greek state had expanded four times, either through military conquest or diplomacy (often with British support). After the creation of Greece in 1830, it acquired the Ionian Islands (Treaty of London, 1864), Thessaly (Convention of Constantinople (1881)), Macedonia, Crete, (southern) Epirus and the Eastern Aegean Islands (Treaty of Bucharest), and Western Thrace (Treaty of Neuilly, 1920). The Dodecanese were acquired after the Second World War (Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947).

A related concept is &quot;enosis&quot;.

==Fall of Constantinople==

The Byzantine Empire was Eastern Roman in origin and was called the &quot;Roman Empire&quot; by its inhabitants, though often not by the Latin West, which regarded it as Greek. After its fall, Hieronymus Wolf popularized the usage of &quot;Byzantium&quot;. An informal cultural division had existed within the Roman Empire for centuries. Although Latin was the official language of the empire, Greek was the lingua franca in the East and was regularly used alongside Latin in official business. The division of the Empire following the death of Emperor Theodosius in AD 395 added a formal political layer to the informal cultural division. Following the adoption of Christianity in the 4th century, Greek was also the dominant liturgical language, as exemplified by the fact the New Testament was written in Greek. These factors ultimately led to Greek replacing Latin as the official language in AD 620. 

Byzantium held out against numerous invasions over the centuries and during the 10th and early 11th centuries managed to reclaim considerable territory in the Balkans, Anatolia and to a lesser extent Syria. The Turkish invasion of the mid to late 11th century however greatly weakened the Empire and, although it partially recovered under the Komnenos dynasty, it never managed to regain control of the Anatolian interior, cutting the empire off from a valuable source of manpower and tax revenue. In 1204 Constantinople was besieged and sacked during the Fourth Crusade and became the Capital of what has come to be known as the Latin Empire, a French dominated crusader state, until it was liberated by the Empire of Nicaea, the Byzantine state in exile, in 1261. However, Byzantine strength would rapidly diminish towards the end of the 13th century and evaporated almost entirely during the 14th century, to the extent that by 1400 little remained of the Empire except Constantinople, the city’s immediate surroundings and some small territories in modern-day Greece. In 1453 the Ottoman Turks besieged and captured Constantinople officially marking the end of the Roman Empire and also the end of Greek predominance in the city; although it would continue to have a considerable Greek speaking population and the Patriarch of Constantinople continued to reside in the city.

== Greeks under Ottoman rule==
Under the &quot;millet&quot; system which was in force during the Ottoman Empire, the population was classified according to religion rather than language or ethnicity. Orthodox Greeks were seen as part of the &quot;millet-i Rûm&quot; (literally &quot;Roman community&quot;) which included all Orthodox Christians, including beside Greeks also Bulgarians, Serbs, Vlachs, Slavs, Georgians, Romanians and Albanians, despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was Greek dominated. It is not clear to what extent one can speak of a Greek identity during those times as opposed to a Christian or Orthodox identity. In the late 1780s, Catherine II of Russia and Joseph II of Austria intended to reclaim the Byzantine heritage and restore the Greek statehood as part of their joint Greek Plan.

During the Middle Ages and the Ottoman period, Greek-speaking Christians identified as &quot;Romans&quot; and thought of themselves as the descendants of the Roman Empire (including the medieval Eastern Roman Empire). The term &quot;Roman&quot; was often interpreted as synonymous with &quot;Christian&quot; throughout Europe and the Mediterranean during this time. The terms &quot;Greek&quot; or &quot;Hellene&quot; were largely seen by Ottoman Christians as referring to the ancient pagan peoples of the region. This changed during the late stages of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of the Greek independence movement.

For much of the period of the &quot;Tourkokratia&quot;, the Russians were viewed by the Greeks as the &quot;xanthon genos&quot;, a fair-haired race and the sole Orthodox power that would liberate Constantinople from the Ottomans. The Greek legend of the &quot;xanthon genos&quot; eventually liberating Constantinople was also referenced in the 15th-century &quot;Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad&quot;, which itself was widely circulated in Russia between the 16th and 18th centuries.

==Greek War of Independence and later==

After the Greek War of Independence ended in 1829, a new southern Greek state was established, with assistance from the British Empire, Kingdom of France, and Imperial Russia. However, this new Greek state under John Capodistrias after the Greek War of Independence was, with Serbia, one of the only two countries of the era whose population was smaller than the population of the same ethnicity outside its borders; most ethnic Greeks still resided within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. This version of Greece was designed by the Great Powers, who had no desire to see a larger Greek state replace the Ottoman Empire.

The Great Idea embodied a desire to bring all ethnic Greeks into the Greek state, and subsequently revive the Byzantine Empire; it applied specifically to the Greeks in Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, Thrace, the Aegean Islands, Crete, Cyprus, parts of Anatolia, and the city of Constantinople (which would replace Athens as the capital).

When the young Danish prince Wilhelm Georg was elected king in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was &quot;not&quot; &quot;King of Greece&quot;, the title of his deposed predecessor, King Otto; but rather &quot;King of &quot;the Hellenes&quot;&quot;. Implicit in the wording was that George I was to be king of all Greeks, regardless of whether they then lived within the borders of his new kingdom.

The first additional areas to be incorporated into the Kingdom were the Ionian islands in 1864, and later Thessaly with the 1878 Treaty of Berlin.

==Revolts, Cretan crisis and Greco-Turkish War (1897)==


In January 1897, violence and disorder were escalating in Crete, polarizing the population. Massacres of the Christian population took place in Chania and Rethimno. The Greek government, pressured by public opinion, intransigent political elements, extreme nationalist groups (e.g. Ethniki Etairia) and with the Great Powers reluctant to intervene, decided to send warships and personnel to assist the Cretans. The Great Powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island, but they were too late. A Greek force of 1,500 men had landed at Kolymbari on 1 February 1897, and its commanding officer, Colonel Timoleon Vassos, declared that he was taking over the island &quot;in the name of the King of the Hellenes&quot; and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece. This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers finally decided to land their troops and stopped the Greek army force from approaching Chania. At the same time their fleets blockaded Crete, preventing both Greeks and Turks from bringing any more troops to the island.

The Ottoman Empire, in reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, relocated a significant part of its army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly, close to the borders with Greece. Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces and followers of the Megali Idea acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts, leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece; the war is known as the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. The Turkish army, far outnumbering the Greek, was also better prepared, due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under Baron von der Goltz. The Greek army fell back in retreat. The other Great Powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in May 1897. The war, however, only ended in December of that year.

The military failure in the Greco-Turkish war cost Greece small territorial losses along the border line in northern Thessaly, and a large sum of financial reparations that wrecked Greece&#x27;s economy for years, while giving no lasting solution to the Cretan Question. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) in order to prevent future clashes and trying to avoid the creation of a revanchist climate in Greece, imposed what they thought of as a lasting solution; Crete was proclaimed an autonomous &quot;Cretan State&quot;. The four Great Powers assumed the administration of Crete; and, in a decisive diplomatic victory for Greece, Prince George of Greece (second son of King George I) became High Commissioner.

==Early 20th century==

===Balkan Wars===


A major proponent of the Megali Idea was Eleftherios Venizelos, under whose leadership Greek territory doubled in the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 — southern Epirus, Crete, Lesbos, Chios, Ikaria, Samos, Samothrace, Lemnos and the majority of Macedonia were attached to Greece. Born and raised in Crete, in 1909 Venizelos was already a prominent Cretan and had influence in mainland Greece. As such, he was invited after the Goudi coup in 1909 by the Military League to become Prime Minister of Greece. Venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society, as well as the military and administration, which helped Greece succeed in its goals during the Balkan Wars.

===World War I===
Following the Greek gains in the Balkan Wars, the Ottomans began to persecute ethnic Greeks living in the Empire, which led to ethnic cleansing in the Greek genocide. This persecution continued into World War I when the Ottomans declared for the Central Powers on late 1914. Greece remained neutral until 1917 when they joined the Allies. Refugees reports of Turkish atrocities as well as the Allied victory in World War I seemed to promise an even greater realization of the Megali Idea. Greece gained a foothold in Asia Minor with a protectorate over Smyrna and its hinterland. Following 5 years of Greek administration, a referendum was to be held to determine whether the territory would revert to Ottoman control or join Greece. Greece also gained the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, Western and Eastern Thrace, the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of Constantinople.

===Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)===

Greece&#x27;s efforts to take control of Smyrna in accordance with the Treaty of Sèvres were thwarted by Turkish revolutionaries, who were resisting the Allies. The Turks finally prevailed and expelled the Greeks from Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) (part of the Turkish War of Independence). The war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne which saw Greece cede Eastern Thrace, Imbros, Tenedos and Smyrna to the nascent Turkish Republic. To avoid any further territorial claims, both Greece and Turkey engaged in an &quot;exchange of populations&quot;: During the conflict, 151,892 Greeks had already fled Asia Minor. The Treaty of Lausanne moved 1,104,216 Greeks from Turkey, while 380,000 Turks left the Greek territory for Turkey. The transfers ended any further appetite for pursuing the concept of a Greater Greece and ended the 3000 year Greek habitation of Asia Minor. Further population exchanges occurred after World War I, including 40,027 Greeks from Bulgaria, 58,522 from Russia (because of the defeat of the White Army led by Pyotr Wrangel) and 10,080 from other lands (for example Dodecanese or Albania), while 70,000 Bulgarians from Thrace and Macedonia had moved to Bulgaria. From the Bulgarian refugees ca. 66,000 were from Greek Macedonia.

The immediate reception of refugees to Greece cost 45 million francs, so the League of Nations arranged for a loan of 150 million francs to aid settlement of refugees. In 1930, Venizelos even went on an official visit to Turkey, where he proposed that Mustafa Kemal be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Greek novelist Yiorgos Theotokas described the psychological impact of the defeat of 1922:&quot;For a short time, while the Treaty of Serves ran its joyful but uncertain course, it seemed to them that the...long-buried hopes of their ancestors were to be fulfilled. But the terrible summer of 1922 came all too soon. From the hermitage of Arsenios they watched, tense with anxiety, the daily unfolding of the national tragedy, the last desperate efforts of the Royalist Governments of Greece to save the situation, the failure of King Constantine&#x27;s attempt to take Constantinople, and the final Catastrophe.&lt;br&gt;In mid-August Mustapha Kemal broke through the Greek front and the Greek army, exhausted by ten years of warfare and the privations of the Asia Minor campaign, was vanquished in two weeks. The Turks, advancing rapidly, recaptured in quick succession Afion-Karahisar, Eski-Shehir, Kiutahia, Brussa, Oushak—and then Smyrna! Once again the banners of Islam floated proudly, tauntingly, over the Aegean coast opposite Chios and Mytilene. The whole of Ionia was in flames. Slaughter and pillage descended on the smiling city of Smyrna and in a few short days turned it into a ruin...As day succeeded day, Greece seemed to have become paralyzed, to have lost all will, all ability to resist the blows of fate. The swiftness of the catastrophe completely overwhelmed the State, flooded as it was by the thousands of fleeting soldiers and refugees who sought shelter on the Greek coasts.The nation was plunged into deep despair...&lt;br&gt;Greece had lost her big gamble and had been uprooted from Asia Minor. St. Sophia remained in the hands of the Moslems. The brilliant plans of 1918 were mocking visions, hallucinations, dreams. And the return of reality was truly heartbreaking. The tale of the years was not yet told, then, the historic hour, the fulfillment of the Great Idea, the moment they had longed for with such faith and such anxiety for five tortured, bloody centuries, had not yet come! It was all a lie!&quot;

== World War II, annexation of Dodecanese and Cyprus dispute ==
Although the Great Idea ceased to be a driving force behind Greek foreign policy, some remnants continued to influence Greek foreign policy throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

Thus, after his coup d&#x27;état of 4 August 1936, Ioannis Metaxas proclaimed the advent of the &quot;Third Hellenic Civilization&quot;, similar to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich (influenced by pan-Germanism). The attack by Italy from Albania and the Greek victories enabled Greece to conquer, during the winter of 1940–1941, parts of southern Albania (Northern Epirus, as it is identified by Greeks) which were administered as a province of Greece for a short time until the German offensive of April 1941.

The occupation, resistance and the civil war initially put the Great Idea in the background. Nevertheless, another very good diplomatic performance by the Greek side at the Paris Peace Conference, 1946 secured a further enlargement of Greek territory, in the form of the Dodecanese Islands, despite the very strong opposition of Vyacheslav Molotov and the Soviet delegates.

The British colony of Cyprus became the &quot;apple of discord&quot; between the two countries, putting an end to the positive Greco-Turkish relations that had existed since the Kemal-Venizelos agreement in the 1930s. In 1955, a Greek army colonel of Greek Cypriot origin, George Grivas, began a campaign of civil disobedience whose purpose was primarily to drive the British from the island, then move for &quot;Enosis&quot; with Greece. The Greek prime minister, Alexandros Papagos, was not unfavourable to this idea. There was increasing polarisation of opinion between the dominant Greek population and the minority Turks.

The problems in Cyprus affected the continent itself. In September 1955, in response to the demand for &quot;Énosis&quot;, an anti-Greek riot took place in Istanbul. During the Istanbul Pogrom 4,000 stores, 100 hotels and restaurants and 70 churches were destroyed or damaged. This led to the last great wave of migration from Turkey to Greece.
The Zürich Agreement of 1959 culminated in independence of the island with Greece, Turkey and UK as guarantee powers. The inter-ethnic clashes from 1960 led to the dispatch of a peacekeeping force of the United Nations in 1964.

The Cyprus issue was revived by the dictatorship of the colonels, who presented their April 21, 1967, &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; as the only way to defend the traditional values of what they called the &quot;Hellenic-Christian Civilization&quot;.

Brigadier General Ioannidis arranged, in July 1974, to overthrow Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios, and proceed with &quot;Enosis&quot; (union with Greece). This led to Turkey invading the island in response, with the expulsion of Greek Cypriots in areas controlled by Turkey, and the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south. In 1983, the north declared independence and to this day, Turkey is the only country that recognizes Northern Cyprus.

==Attempted revival by Golden Dawn==
The ultra-nationalist Golden Dawn party, which had electoral support from 2010 to 2019, supports the Megali Idea, with party leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos stating:

Michaloliakos criticized Thessaloniki mayor Yiannis Boutaris for wanting to name a street after Atatürk, who was born in the city when it was still part of the Ottoman Empire.
In January 2013, a group of Golden Dawn supporters attacked the car of Turkish consul-general Osman İlhan Şener and hurled insults at Atatürk, during an anti-Turkey protest in Komotini.

Mihaloliakos has also called for the &quot;liberation&quot; of Northern Epirus. Golden Dawn and its former Cypriot counterpart ELAM support enosis.

In 2015, close to 100 Golden Dawn members and leaders were arrested on a range of charges, including murder and racketeering. In 2019, the party&#x27;s level of support, slumped to less than 2%. In October 2020, most of Golden Dawn&#x27;s leadership was convicted, including Michaloliakos. As of 2023, the party, which never enjoyed electoral support above 10% of the popular vote, now has no remaining members in either the Hellenic or European Parliament.

<text>Alexey Yakovlevich Chervonenkis (; 7 September 1938 – 22 September 2014) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician. Along with Vladimir Vapnik, he was one of the main developers of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, also known as the &quot;fundamental theory of learning&quot;, an important part of computational learning theory. Chervonenkis held joint appointments with the Russian Academy of Sciences and Royal Holloway, University of London.

Alexey Chervonenkis got lost in Losiny Ostrov National Park on 22 September 2014, and later during a search operation was found dead near Mytishchi, a suburb of Moscow. He had died of hypothermia.

<text>Text messaging, or simply texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile phones, tablet computers, smartwatches, desktops/laptops, or another type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular network or may also be sent via satellite or Internet connection.

The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) on mobile devices. It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich Communication Services (RCS), which can contain digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and on various instant messaging apps. Text messaging has been an extremely popular medium of communication since the turn of the century and has also influenced changes in society.

== Overview ==
Text messages are used for personal, family, business, and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing. This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and voicemail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.

=== Terminology ===

The service is referred to by different colloquialisms depending on the region. It may simply be referred to as a &quot;text&quot; in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines; an &quot;SMS&quot; in most of mainland Europe; or an &quot;MMS&quot; or &quot;SMS&quot; in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The sender of a text message is commonly referred to as a &quot;texter&quot;.

== History ==

The electrical telegraph systems, developed in the early 19th century, used electrical signals to send text messages. In the late 19th century, wireless telegraphy was developed using radio waves.

In 1933, the German &quot;Reichspost&quot; (Reich postal service) introduced the first &quot;telex&quot; service.

The University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as early as 1971, using ALOHAnet. Friedhelm Hillebrand conceptualised SMS in 1984 while working for Deutsche Telekom. Sitting at a typewriter at home, Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter, number, punctuation mark, and space. Almost every time, the messages contained fewer than 160 characters, thus giving the basis for the limit one could type via text messaging. With Bernard Ghillebaert of France Télécom, he developed a proposal for the GSM (Groupe Spécial Mobile) meeting in February 1985 in Oslo. The first technical solution evolved in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby. It was further developed under the leadership of Kevin Holley and Ian Harris (see Short Message Service). SMS forms an integral part of Signalling System No. 7 (SS7). Under SS7, it is a &quot;state&quot; with 160 characters of data, coded in the ITU-T &quot;T.56&quot; text format, that has a &quot;sequence lead in&quot; to determine different language codes and may have special character codes that permit, for example, sending simple graphs as text. This was part of ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), and since GSM is based on this, it made its way to the mobile phone. Messages could be sent and received on ISDN phones, and these can send SMS to any GSM phone. The possibility of doing something is one thing; implementing it is another, but systems existed in 1988 that sent SMS messages to mobile phones (compare ND-NOTIS).

SMS messaging was used for the first time on 3 December 1992, when Neil Papworth, a 22-year-old test engineer, used a computer to send the text message &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis, who was at a party in Newbury, Berkshire celebrating the event. Papworth later said &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel momentous at all&quot;. Modern SMS text messaging is usually sent from one mobile phone to another. Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja&#x27;s domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera), also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as a commercial basis. GSM was allowed in the United States, but the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US &quot;Carriers&quot; to use US technology, which limited development of mobile messaging services in the US. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services (PCS) – what the ITU frequency régime had blocked for DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) – a 1,000-foot range picocell, but it survived. American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America, provided the first text-messaging service in the United States. Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses. APC operated under the brand name Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on 15 November 1995, in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. Vice President Al Gore in Washington, D.C., made the initial phone call to launch the network, calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.

Initial growth of text messaging worldwide was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0,4 messages per GSM customer per month. One factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and to eliminate billing fraud, which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators. Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs that allowed the blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through them. SMS is available on a wide range of networks, including 3G networks. However, not all text-messaging systems use SMS; some notable alternate implementations of the concept include J-Phone&#x27;s SkyMail and NTT Docomo&#x27;s Short Mail, both in Japan. E-mail messaging from phones, as popularized by NTT Docomo&#x27;s i-mode and the RIM BlackBerry, also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP/IP. , text messaging was the most widely used mobile data service, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide, or 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers, being active users of the Short Message Service at the end of 2007. In countries such as Finland, Sweden, and Norway, over 85% of the population used SMS. The European average was about 80%, and North America was rapidly catching up, with over 60% active users of SMS . The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers occurs in the Philippines, with an average of 27 texts sent per day per subscriber.

== Uses ==
Text messaging is most often used between private mobile phone users, as a substitute for voice calls in situations where voice communication is impossible or undesirable (e.g., during a school class or a work meeting). Texting is also used to communicate very brief messages, such as informing someone that you will be late or reminding a friend or colleague about a meeting. As with e-mail, informality and brevity have become an accepted part of text messaging. Some text messages such as SMS can also be used for the remote control of home appliances. It is widely used in domotics systems. Some amateurs have also built their own systems to control (some of) their appliances via SMS. A Flash SMS is a type of text message that appears directly on the main screen without user interaction and is not automatically stored in the inbox. It can be useful in cases such as an emergency (e.g., fire alarm) or confidentiality (e.g., one-time password).

SMS has historically been particularly popular in Europe, Asia (excluding Japan; see below), the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, while also gaining influence in Africa. Popularity has grown to a sufficient extent that the term &quot;texting&quot; (used as a verb meaning the act of mobile phone users sending short messages back and forth) has entered the common lexicon. In 2012, young Asians considered SMS as the most popular mobile phone application. In the same year, 50 percent of American teens send 50 text messages or more per day, making it their most frequent form of communication. In 2004 in China, SMS was very popular and brought service providers significant profit (18 billion short messages were sent in 2001).

It has been a very influential and powerful tool in the Philippines, where in 2008 the average user sent 10–12 text messages a day. The same year, the Philippines alone sent on average over 1 billion text messages a day, more than the annual average SMS volume of the countries in Europe, and even China and India. SMS saw hugely popular in India, where youngsters often exchanged many text messages, and companies provide alerts, infotainment, news, cricket scores updates, railway/airline booking, mobile billing, and banking services on SMS.

Similarly, in 2008, text messaging played a primary role in the implication of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick in an SMS sex scandal. Short messages are particularly popular among young urbanites. In many markets, the service is comparatively cheap. For example, in Australia, a message typically costs between A$0.20 and $0.25 to send (some prepaid services charge $0.01 between their own phones), compared with a voice call, which costs somewhere between $0.40 and $2.00 per minute (commonly charged in half-minute blocks). The service is enormously profitable to the service providers. At a typical length of only 190 bytes (including protocol overhead), more than 350 of these messages per minute can be transmitted at the same data rate as a usual voice call (9 kbit/s). There are also free SMS services available, which are often sponsored, that allow sending and receiving SMS from a PC connected to the Internet. Mobile service providers in New Zealand, such as One NZ and Spark New Zealand, provided up to 2000 SMS messages for NZ$10 per month. Users on these plans sent on average 1500 SMS messages every month. Text messaging became so popular that advertising agencies and advertisers jumped into the text messaging business. Services that provide bulk text message sending are also becoming a popular way for clubs, associations, and advertisers to reach a group of opt-in subscribers quickly.

In 2013, research suggested that Internet-based mobile messaging would grow to equal the popularity of SMS by the end of 2013, with nearly 10 trillion messages being sent through each technology. Services such as Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp, Signal (software), Snapchat, Telegram (software), and Viber have led to a decline in the use of SMS in parts of the world. A survey conducted by MetrixLabs showed that 63% of Baby Boomers, 63% of Generation X, and 67% of Generation Y said that they used instant messengers in place of texting. A Facebook survey showed that 65% of people surveyed thought that messaging applications made group messaging easier.

== Applications ==

=== Microblogging ===

Of many texting trends, a system known as microblogging has surfaced, which consists of a miniaturized blog, inspired mainly by people&#x27;s tendency to jot down informal thoughts and post them online. They consist of websites like X (formerly Twitter) and its Chinese equivalent Weibo (微博). As of 2016, 21% of all American adults used Twitter. As of 2017, Weibo had 340 million active users.

=== Emergency services ===
In some countries, text messages can be used to contact emergency services. In the UK, text messages can be used to call emergency services only after registering with the emergency SMS service. This service is primarily aimed at people who, because of disability, are unable to make a voice call. It has recently been promoted as a means for walkers and climbers to call emergency services from areas where a voice call is not possible due to low signal strength.

In the US, there is a move to require both traditional operators and over-the-top messaging providers to support texting to 911. In Asia, SMS is used for tsunami warnings and in Europe, SMS is used to inform individuals of imminent disasters. Since the location of a handset is known, systems can alert everyone in an area that the events have made impossible to pass through e.g. an avalanche. A similar system, known as Emergency Alert, is used in Australia to notify the public of impending disasters through both SMS and landline phone calls. These messages can be sent based on either the location of the phone or the address to which the handset is registered.

In the early 2020s, device manufacturers have begun to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into conventional mobile phones for use in remote regions, where there is no reliable terrestrial cellular network.

=== Reminders of medical appointments ===
SMS messages are used in some countries as reminders of medical appointments. Missed outpatient clinic appointments cost the National Health Service (England) more than £600 million ($980 million) a year. SMS messages are thought to be more cost-effective, swifter to deliver, and more likely to receive a faster response than letters. A 2012 study by Sims and colleagues examined the outcomes of 24,709 outpatient appointments scheduled in mental health services in South-East London. The study found that SMS message reminders could reduce the number of missed psychiatric appointments by 25–28%, representing a potential national yearly saving of over £150 million.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical facilities in the United States are using text messaging to coordinate the appointment process, including reminders, cancellations, and safe check-in. US-based cloud radiology information system vendor AbbaDox includes this in their patient engagement services.

=== Commercial uses ===

==== Short codes ====
Short codes are special telephone numbers, shorter than full telephone numbers, that can be used to address SMS and MMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones. There are two types of short codes: dialling and messaging.

==== Text messaging gateway providers ====
SMS gateway providers facilitate the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, as well as the level of text messaging services, SMS gateway providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider&#x27;s SMSC or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with SS7. SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated–MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on short codes or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.

==== Premium content ====
SMS has been widely used for delivering digital content, such as news alerts, financial information, pictures, GIFs, logos and ringtones. Such messages are also known as premium-rated short messages (PSMS). The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content, and the amount is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the value added service provider (VASP), either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Services like 82ASK and Any Question Answered have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers&#x27; questions, using on-call teams of experts and researchers. In November 2013, amidst complaints about unsolicited charges on bills, major mobile carriers in the US agreed to stop billing for PSMS in 45 states, effectively ending its use in the United States.

Outside the United States, premium short messages have been used for &quot;real-world&quot; services. For example, some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium-rated short message, so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user&#x27;s phone bill or subtracted from the user&#x27;s prepaid credits. Recently, premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills. A new type of free-premium or hybrid-premium content has emerged with the launch of text-service websites. These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale, or when new items are introduced. An alternative to inbound SMS is based on long numbers (international mobile number format, e.g., +44 7624 805000, or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS, e.g., 01133203040), which can be used in place of short codes or premium-rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications, such as TV voting, product promotions and campaigns. Long numbers are internationally available, as well as enabling businesses to have their own number, rather than short codes, which are usually shared across a lot of brands. Additionally, long numbers are non-premium inbound numbers.

=== In workplaces ===
The use of text messaging for workplace purposes grew significantly during the mid-2000s. As companies seek competitive advantages, many employees used new technology, collaborative applications, and real-time messaging such as SMS, instant messaging, and mobile communications to connect with teammates and customers. Some practical uses of text messaging include the use of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks, for instant communication between a service provider and a client (e.g., a payment card company and a consumer), and for sending alerts. Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts. One such example is Penn State.

As text messaging has proliferated in business, so too have regulations governing its use. One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks, equities, and securities trading is &quot;Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007&quot;, issued to member firms by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In Regulatory Notice 07-59, FINRA noted that &quot;electronic communications&quot;, &quot;e-mail&quot;, and &quot;electronic correspondence&quot; may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging. Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees&#x27; text messages.

Security, confidentiality, reliability, and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services, energy and commodities trading, health care and enterprises demand in their mission-critical procedures. One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs (Service Level Agreement), which are common in IT contracts. By providing measurable SLAs, corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services. Just one of many SMS applications that have proven highly popular and successful in the financial services industry is mobile receipts. In January 2009, Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) published the &quot;Mobile Banking Overview&quot; for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services (SMS), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.

Mobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty. Typical business-to-business applications are telematics and Machine-to-Machine, in which two applications automatically communicate with each other. Incident alerts are also common, and staff communications are also another use for B2B scenarios. Businesses can use SMS for time-critical alerts, updates, and reminders, mobile campaigns, content and entertainment applications. Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer-to-business interactions, such as media voting and competitions, and consumer-to-consumer interaction, for example, with mobile social networking, chatting and dating.

Text messaging is widely used in business settings; as well, it is used in many civil service and non-governmental organization workplaces. The U.S. And Canadian civil service both adopted BlackBerry smartphones in the 2000s.

=== Group texts ===
Group texts involve more than two users. They are often used when it is helpful to message many people at once, such as inviting multiple people to an event or arranging groups. They are also used in business for marketing and other customer notifications as well as intracompany communication.

Group texts are often sent as MMS messages and therefore require an internet connection to send instead of using the sender&#x27;s text messaging plan.

=== Online SMS services ===
There are a growing number of websites that allow users to send free SMS messages online. Some websites provide free SMS for promoting premium business packages.

=== Worldwide use ===

==== Europe ====

In 2003, Europe followed next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS. That year, an average of 16 billion messages were sent each month. Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003. In Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure was around 35–40 SMS messages per month. In each of these countries, the cost of sending an SMS message varied from €0.04–0.23, depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or several texts for free). In the United Kingdom, text messages are charged between £0.05–0.12. Curiously, France did not take to SMS in the same way, sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month. France has the same GSM technology as other European countries, so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions.

In the Republic of Ireland, in 2012, 1.5 billion messages were sent every quarter, on average 114 messages per person per month. In the United Kingdom, over 1 billion text messages were sent every week. The Eurovision Song Contest organized the first pan-European SMS voting in 2002, as a part of the voting system (there was also a voting over traditional landline phone lines). In 2005, the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever (with SMS and phone voting). During roaming, (that is, when a user connects to another network in different country from their own) the prices may be higher, but in July 2009, EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to €0.11.

Mobile service providers in Finland offered contracts in which users can send 1000 text messages a month for €10. In Finland, which has very high mobile phone ownership rates, some TV channels began &quot;SMS chat&quot;, which involved sending short messages to a phone number, and the messages would be shown on TV. Chats are always moderated, which prevents users from sending offensive material to the channel. The craze evolved into quizzes and strategy games and then faster-paced games designed for television and SMS control. Games require users to register their nicknames and send short messages to control a character onscreen. Messages usually cost 0.05 to 0.86 Euro apiece, and games can require the player to send dozens of messages. In December 2003, a Finnish TV channel, MTV3, put a Santa Claus character on-air reading aloud text messages sent in by viewers. On 12 March 2004, the first entirely &quot;interactive&quot; TV channel, VIISI, began operation in Finland. However, SBS Finland Oy took over the channel and turned it into a music channel named &quot;The Voice&quot; in November 2004. In 2006, the Prime Minister of Finland, Matti Vanhanen, made the news when he allegedly broke up with his girlfriend with a text message. In 2007, the first book written solely in text messages, &quot;Viimeiset viestit&quot; (&quot;Last Messages&quot;), was released by Finnish author Hannu Luntiala. It is about an executive who travels through Europe and India.

==== United States ====
In the United States, text messaging is very popular; as reported by CTIA in December 2009, the 286 million US subscribers sent 152.7 billion text messages per month, for an average of 534 messages per subscriber per month. The Pew Research Center found in May 2010 that 72% of U.S. adult cellphone users send and receive text messages. CTIA reported in 2022 that 2 trillion SMS and MMS were sent in the United States in 2021, showing continued popularity of the technology.

In the U.S., SMS is often charged both at the sender and at the destination, but, unlike phone calls, it cannot be rejected or dismissed. The reasons for lower uptake than other countries are varied. Many users have unlimited &quot;mobile-to-mobile&quot; minutes, high monthly minute allotments, or unlimited service. Moreover, &quot;push to talk&quot; services offer the instant connectivity of SMS and are typically unlimited. The integration between competing providers and technologies necessary for cross-network text messaging was not initially available. Some providers originally charged extra for texting, reducing its appeal. In the third quarter of 2006, at least 12 billion text messages were sent on AT&amp;T&#x27;s network, up almost 15% from the preceding quarter.

While texting is mainly popular among people from 13 to 22 years old, it is also increasing among adults and business users. The age that a child receives their first cell phone has also decreased, making text messaging a popular way of communicating. The number of texts sent in the US has gone up over the years as the price has gone down to an average of $0.10 per text sent and received. To convince more customers to buy unlimited text messaging plans, some major cellphone providers have increased the price to send and receive text messages from $.15 to $.20 per message. This is over $1,300 per megabyte. Many providers offer unlimited plans, which can result in a lower rate per text, given sufficient volume.

==== Japan ====
Japan was among the first countries to adopt short messages widely, with pioneering non-GSM services including J-Phone&#x27;s SkyMail and NTT Docomo&#x27;s Short Mail. Japanese adolescents first began text messaging, because it was a cheaper form of communication than the other available forms. Thus, Japanese theorists created the selective interpersonal relationship theory, claiming that mobile phones can change social networks among young people (classified as 13- to 30-year-olds). They theorized this age group had extensive but low-quality relationships with friends, and mobile phone usage may facilitate improvement in the quality of their relationships. They concluded this age group prefers &quot;selective interpersonal relationships in which they maintain particular, partial, but rich relations, depending on the situation&quot;. The same studies showed participants rated friendships in which they communicated face-to-face and through text messaging as being more intimate than those in which they communicated solely face-to-face. This indicates participants make new relationships with face-to-face communication at an early stage, but use text messaging to increase their contact later on. As the relationships between participants grew more intimate, the frequency of text messaging also increased. However, short messaging has been largely rendered obsolete by the prevalence of mobile Internet e-mail, which can be sent to and received from any e-mail address, mobile or otherwise. That said, while usually presented to the user simply as a uniform &quot;mail&quot; service (and most users are unaware of the distinction), the operators may still internally transmit the content as short messages, especially if the destination is on the same network.

==== China ====
Text messaging has historically been popular and cheap in China. About 700 billion messages were sent in 2007. Text message spam has also been a problem in China. In 2007, 353.8 billion spam messages were sent, up 93% from the previous year. It is about 12.44 messages per week per person. In 2010, it was routine that the People&#x27;s Republic of China government monitored text messages across the country for illegal content.
Among Chinese migrant workers with little formal education, it is common to refer to SMS manuals when text messaging. These manuals are published as cheap, smaller-than-pocket-size booklets that offer diverse linguistic phrases to utilize as messages.

==== Philippines ====
SMS was introduced to selected markets in the Philippines in 1995. In 1998, Philippine mobile service providers launched SMS more widely across the country, with initial television marketing campaigns targeting hearing-impaired users. The service was initially free with subscriptions, but Filipinos quickly exploited the feature to communicate for free instead of using voice calls, which they would be charged for. After telephone companies realized this trend, they began charging for SMS. The rate across networks is 1 peso per SMS (about US$0.023). Even after users were charged for SMS, it remained cheap, about one-tenth of the price of a voice call. This low price led to about five million Filipinos owning a cell phone by 2001. Because of the highly social nature of Philippine culture and the affordability of SMS compared to voice calls, SMS usage shot up. Filipinos used texting not only for social messages but also for political purposes, as it allowed the Filipinos to express their opinions on current events and political issues. It became a powerful tool for Filipinos in promoting or denouncing issues and was a key factor during the 2001 EDSA II revolution, which overthrew then-President Joseph Estrada, who was eventually found guilty of corruption. According to 2009 statistics, there were about 72 million mobile service subscriptions (roughly 80% of the Filipino population), with around 1.39 billion SMS messages being sent daily. Because of the large number of text messages being sent, the Philippines became known as the &quot;text capital of the world&quot; during the late 1990s until the early 2000s.

==== New Zealand ====
There are three mobile network companies operating in New Zealand, with some sub-brands and MVNOs.
Spark NZ (formerly Telecom NZ), was the first telecommunication company in New Zealand. In 2011, Spark was broken into two companies by regulation, with Chorus Ltd taking the landline infrastructure and Spark NZ providing services including over their mobile network. Vodafone NZ (now One NZ) acquired mobile network provider Bellsouth New Zealand in 1998 and had 2.32 million customers as of July 2013. Vodafone launched the first Text messaging service in 1999 and has introduced innovative TXT services like SafeTXT and CallMe 2degrees Mobile Ltd launched in August 2009.
In 2005, around 85% of the adult population had a mobile phone. In general, texting is more popular than making phone calls, as it is viewed as less intrusive and therefore more polite.

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
In 2009, it was predicted that text messaging would become a key revenue driver for mobile network operators in Africa over the following couple of years. Today, text messaging is already slowly gaining influence in the African market. One such person used text messaging to spread the word about HIV and AIDS. In September 2009, a multi-country campaign in Africa used text messaging to expose stock-outs of essential medicines at public health facilities and put pressure on governments to address the issue.

== Social effects ==
The advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before. A person could carry out a conversation with another user without the constraint of being expected to reply within a short amount of time and without needing to set time aside to engage in conversation. With voice calling, both participants need to be free at the same time. Mobile phone users can maintain communication during situations in which a voice call is impractical, impossible, or unacceptable, such as during a school class or work meeting. Texting has provided a venue for participatory culture, allowing viewers to vote in online and TV polls, as well as receive information while they are on the move. Texting can also bring people together and create a sense of community through &quot;Smart Mobs&quot; or &quot;Net War&quot;, which create &quot;people power&quot;.
Research in 2015 has also proven that text messaging is somehow making the social distances larger and could be ruining verbal communication skills for many people.

=== Effect on language ===
The small phone keypad and the rapidity of typical text message exchanges have caused a number of spelling abbreviations: as in the phrase &quot;txt msg&quot;, &quot;u&quot; (an abbreviation for &quot;you&quot;), &quot;HMU&quot;(&quot;hit me up&quot;; i.e., call me), or use of camel case, such as in &quot;ThisIsVeryLame&quot;. To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using Cyrillic or Greek letters, speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the Latin alphabet for their own language. In certain languages utilizing diacritic marks, such as Polish, SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language: characters normally written with diacritic marks (e.g., &quot;ą&quot;, &quot;ę&quot;, &quot;ś&quot;, &quot;ż&quot; in Polish) are now being written without them (as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) to enable using cell phones without Polish script or to save space in Unicode messages. Historically, this language developed out of shorthand used in bulletin board systems and later in Internet chat rooms, where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly, though the amount of time saved was often inconsequential. However, this became much more pronounced in SMS, where mobile phone users either have a numeric keyboard (with older cellphones) or a small QWERTY keyboard (for 2010s-era smartphones), so more effort is required to type each character, and there is sometimes a limit on the number of characters that may be sent. In Mandarin Chinese, numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words. For example, the numbers 520 in Chinese (&quot;wǔ èr líng&quot;) sound like the words for &quot;I love you&quot; (&quot;wǒ ài nǐ&quot;). The sequence 748 (&quot;qī sì bā&quot;) sounds like the curse &quot;go to hell&quot; (&quot;qù sǐ ba&quot;).

Predictive text software, which attempts to guess words (Tegic&#x27;s T9 as well as iTap) or letters (Eatoni&#x27;s LetterWise) reduces the labour of time-consuming input. This makes abbreviations not only less necessary but slower to type than regular words that are in the software&#x27;s dictionary. However, it makes the messages longer, often requiring the text message to be sent in multiple parts and, therefore, costing more to send. The use of text messaging has changed the way that people talk and write essays, some believing it to be harmful. Children today are receiving cell phones at an age as young as eight years old; more than 35 per cent of children in second and third grade have their own mobile phones. Because of this, the texting language is integrated into the way that students think from an earlier age than ever before. In November 2006, New Zealand Qualifications Authority approved the move that allowed students of secondary schools to use mobile phone text language in the end-of-the-year-exam papers. Highly publicized reports, beginning in 2002, of the use of text language in school assignments, caused some to become concerned that the quality of written communication is on the decline, and other reports claim that teachers and professors are beginning to have a hard time controlling the problem. However, the notion that text language is widespread or harmful is refuted by research from linguistic experts.

An article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; explores how text messaging has anglicized some of the world&#x27;s languages. The use of diacritic marks is dropped in languages such as French, as well as symbols in Ethiopian languages. In his book, &quot;&quot; (which translates as &quot;Texting: the Great Debate&quot;), David Crystal states that texters in all eleven languages use &quot;lol&quot; (&quot;laughing out loud&quot;), &quot;u&quot;, &quot;brb&quot; (&quot;be right back&quot;), and &quot;gr8&quot; (&quot;great&quot;), all English-based shorthands. The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language. They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in 2day or b4. This is commonly used in other languages as well. Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian &quot;sei&quot;, &quot;six&quot;, is used for &quot;sei&quot;, &quot;you are&quot;. Example: dv6 = &quot;dove sei&quot; (&quot;where are you&quot;) and French k7 = &quot;cassette&quot; (&quot;cassette tape&quot;). There is also the use of numeral sequences, substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals. For example, in French, a12c4 can be said as &quot;à un de ces quatres&quot;, &quot;see you around&quot; (literally: &quot;to one of these four &quot;[days]&quot;&quot;). An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of &quot;@&quot;. Whenever it is used in texting, its intended use is with the English pronunciation. Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of &quot;@&quot; in &quot;@F&quot;, pronounced ataf, meaning &quot;to me&quot;. In character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese, numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number, sometimes the English pronunciation of the number. In this way, numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages, such as in Chinese, &quot;8807701314520&quot; () can be literally translated as &quot;Hug hug you, kiss you, whole life, whole life I love you.&quot; English influences worldwide texting in variation, but still in combination with the individual properties of languages.

American popular culture is also recognized in shorthand. For example, Homer Simpson translates into: ~(_8^(|). Crystal also suggests that texting has led to more creativity in the English language, giving people opportunities to create their own slang, emoticons, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. The feeling of individualism and freedom makes texting more popular and a more efficient way to communicate. Crystal has also been quoted in saying that &quot;In a logical world, text messaging should not have survived.&quot; But text messaging didn&#x27;t just come out of nowhere. It originally began as a messaging system that would send out emergency information. But it gained immediate popularity with the public. What followed is the SMS we see today, which is a very quick and efficient way of sharing information from person to person. Work by Richard Ling has shown that texting has a gendered dimension and it plays into the development of teen identity. In addition we text to a very small number of other persons. For most people, half of their texts go to 3 – 5 other people.

Research by Rosen &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) found that those young adults who used more language-based textisms (shortcuts such as LOL, 2nite, etc.) in daily writing produced worse formal writing than those young adults who used fewer linguistic textisms in daily writing. However, the exact opposite was true for informal writing. This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing, which may then help them to be better &quot;informal&quot; writers. Due to text messaging, teens are writing more, and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers. This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words and this may be able to be used as a bridge, to get them more interested in formal writing.

Joan H. Lee in her thesis, &quot;What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints&quot; (2011), she associates exposure to text messaging with more rigid acceptability constraints. The thesis suggests that more exposure to the colloquial, Generation Text language of text messaging contributes to being less accepting of words. In contrast, Lee found that students with more exposure to traditional print media (such as books and magazines) were more accepting of both real and fictitious words. The thesis, which garnered international media attention, also presents a literature review of academic literature on the effects of text messaging on language. Texting has also been shown to have had no effect or some positive effects on literacy. According to Plester, Wood and Joshi and their research done on the study of 88 British 10–12-year-old children and their knowledge of text messages, &quot;textisms are essentially forms of phonetic abbreviation&quot; that show that &quot;to produce and read such abbreviations arguably requires a level of phonological awareness (and orthographic awareness) in the child concerned&quot;.

=== Texting while driving ===
Texting while driving leads to increased distraction behind the wheel and can lead to an increased risk of an accident. In 2006, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group conducted a survey with more than 900 teens from over 26 high schools nationwide. The results showed that 87% of students found texting to be &quot;very&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot; distracting. A study by AAA found that 46% of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel due to texting. One example of distraction behind the wheel is the 2008 Chatsworth train collision, which killed 25 passengers. The engineer had sent 45 text messages while operating the train. A 2009 experiment with &quot;Car and Driver&quot; editor Eddie Alterman (that took place at a deserted airfield, for safety reasons) compared texting with drunk driving. The experiment found that texting while driving was more dangerous than being drunk. While being legally drunk added 4 feet to Alterman&#x27;s stopping distance while going , reading an e-mail on a phone added , and sending a text message added .

In 2009, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute released the results of an 18-month study that involved placing cameras inside the cabs of more than 100 long-haul trucks, which recorded the drivers over a combined driving distance of three million miles. The study concluded that when the drivers were texting, their risk of crashing was 23 times greater than when not texting.

=== Texting while walking ===
Due to the proliferation of smart phone applications performed while walking, &quot;texting while walking&quot; or &quot;wexting&quot; is the increasing practice of people being transfixed to their mobile device without looking in any direction but their personal screen while walking. First coined reference in 2015 in New York from Rentrak&#x27;s chief client officer when discussing time spent with media and various media usage metrics. Text messaging among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction and reduced situation awareness, and may lead to increases in unsafe behaviour leading to injury and death. Recent studies conducted on cell phone use while walking showed that cell phone users recall fewer objects when conversing, walk slower, have altered gait and are more unsafe when crossing a street. Additionally, some gait analyses showed that stance phase during overstepping motion, longitudinal and lateral deviation increased during cell phone operation, but step length and clearance did not; a different analysis did find increased step clearance and reduced step length.

It is unclear which processes may be affected by distraction, which types of distraction may affect which cognitive processes, and how individual differences may affect the influence of distraction. Lamberg and Muratori believe that engaging in a dual-task, such as texting while walking, may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors. Their study demonstrated that participants engaged in text messaging were unable to maintain walking speed or retain accurate spatial information, suggesting an inability to adequately divide their attention between two tasks. According to them, the addition of texting while walking with vision occluded increases the demands placed on the working memory system resulting in gait disruptions.

Texting on a phone distracts participants, even when the texting task used is a relatively simple one. Stavrinos &quot;et al.&quot; investigated the effect of other cognitive tasks, such as engaging in conversations or cognitive tasks on a phone, and found that participants actually have reduced visual awareness. This finding was supported by Licence &quot;et al.&quot;, who conducted a similar study. For example, texting pedestrians may fail to notice unusual events in their environment, such as a unicycling clown. These findings suggest that tasks that require the allocation of cognitive resources can affect visual attention even when the task itself does not require the participants to avert their eyes from their environment. The act of texting itself seems to impair pedestrians&#x27; visual awareness. It appears that the distraction produced by texting is a combination of both a cognitive and visual perceptual distraction. A study conducted by Licence &quot;et al.&quot; supported some of these findings, particularly that those who text while walking significantly alter their gait. However, they also found that the gait pattern texters adopted was slower and more &quot;protective&quot;, and consequently did not increase obstacle contact or tripping in a typical pedestrian context.

There have also been technological approaches to increase the safety/awareness of pedestrians that are (unintentionally) blind while using a smartphone, e.g., using a Kinect or an ultrasound phone cover as a virtual white cane, or using the built-in camera to algorithmically analyze single, respectively a stream of pictures for obstacles, with Wang &quot;et al.&quot; proposing to use machine learning to specifically detect incoming vehicles.

=== Sexting ===

Sexting is slang for the act of sending sexually explicit or suggestive content between mobile devices using SMS. It contains either text, images, or video that is intended to be sexually arousing. Sexting was reported as early as 2005 in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph Magazine&quot;, constituting a trend in the creative use of SMS to excite another with alluring messages throughout the day.

Although sexting often takes place consensually between two people, it can also occur against the wishes of a person who is the subject of the content. A number of instances have been reported in which the recipients of sexting have shared the content of the messages with others, with less intimate intentions, such as to impress their friends or embarrass their sender. Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Vanessa Hudgens, and Adrienne Bailon have been victims of such abuses of sexting.

A 2008 survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl.com suggested a trend of sexting and other seductive online content being readily shared between teens. One in five teen girls surveyed (22 per cent)—and 11 per cent of teen girls aged 13–16 years old—say they have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves. One-third (33 per cent) of teen boys and one-quarter (25 per cent) of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images. According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages (text, e-mail, and instant messaging) were even more common than images, with 39 per cent of teens having sent or posted such messages, and half of the teens (50 per cent) having received them.

A 2012 study that has received wide international media attention was conducted at the University of Utah Department of Psychology by Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael Sustaíta and Jordan Rullo. They surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14–18 and found that nearly 20 per cent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 per cent indicated that they had forwarded it to others. In addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. The authors conclude: &quot;These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people.&quot; Sexting becomes a legal issue when teens (under 18) are involved, because any nude photos they may send of themselves would put the recipients in possession of child pornography.

=== In schools ===

Text messaging has affected students academically by creating an easier way to cheat on exams. In December 2002, a dozen students were caught cheating on an accounting exam through the use of text messages on their mobile phones. In December 2002, Hitotsubashi University in Japan failed 26 students for receiving emailed exam answers on their mobile phones. The number of students caught using mobile phones to cheat on exams has increased significantly in recent years. According to Okada (2005), most Japanese mobile phones can send and receive long text messages of between 250 and 3000 characters with graphics, video, audio, and Web links.

In England, 287 school and college students were excluded from exams in 2004 for using mobile phones during exams. Some teachers and professors claim that advanced texting features can lead to students cheating on exams. Students in high school and college classrooms are using their mobile phones to send and receive texts during lectures at high rates. Further, published research has established that students who text during college lectures have impaired memories of the lecture material compared to students who do not. For example, in one study, the number of irrelevant text messages sent and received during a lecture covering the topic of developmental psychology was related to students&#x27; memory of the lecture.

==== Bullying ====

Spreading rumors and gossip by text message, using text messages to bully individuals, or forwarding texts that contain defamatory content is an issue of great concern for parents and schools. Text &quot;bullying&quot; of this sort can cause distress and damage reputations. In some cases, individuals who are bullied online have committed suicide. Harding and Rosenberg (2005) argue that the urge to forward text messages can be difficult to resist, describing text messages as &quot;loaded weapons&quot;.

Apple&#x27;s messaging app, Messages, uses Apple&#x27;s Internet-based messaging service, iMessage, to send messages to other iMessage users, and uses SMS as a fallback when no data connection is present, or when messaging non-iMessage users. It sets the color of messages depending on which technology was used. This has led to instances of iMessage users bullying people without iPhones.

==== Influence on perceptions of the student ====
When a student sends an email that contains phonetic abbreviations and acronyms that are common in text messaging (e.g., &quot;gr8&quot; instead of &quot;great&quot;), it can influence how that student is subsequently evaluated. In a study by Lewandowski and Harrington (2006), participants read a student&#x27;s email sent to a professor that either contained text-messaging abbreviations (gr8, How R U?) or parallel text in standard English (great, How are you?), and then provided impressions of the sender. Students who used abbreviations in their email were perceived as having a less favorable personality and as putting forth less effort on an essay they submitted along with the email. Specifically, abbreviation users were seen as less intelligent, responsible, motivated, studious, dependable, and hard-working. These findings suggest that the nature of a student&#x27;s email communication can influence how others perceive the student and their work.

However, students have become aware of the reality that using these textisms and adaptations can negatively impact their professionalism. Drouin and Davis surveyed American undergraduates in 2009 and found that three quarters of participants believed the use of textisms were not appropriate in formal messaging and writing. A study performed by Grace &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) asked 150 undergraduate students to rate the appropriateness of using textisms in a given scenario on a scale of one to five – five being entirely appropriate and one being not at all. All but eleven of the students rated the use of textisms in exams and typed assignments as &quot;not at all appropriate&quot;, showing that the students are aware of how they must adapt their written language and tone depending on the context. Grace &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) went further, observing hundreds of academic papers from previous undergraduate students&#x27; exams, only to find that out of 533,500 words, a mere 0.02% were textisms. They owe this to the fact that the more accumulated experience a student has, the more they are able to understand when the &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot; times to use such language is.

=== Law and crime ===
Text messaging has been a subject of interest for police forces around the world. One of the issues of concern to law enforcement agencies is the use of encrypted text messages. In 2003, a British company developed a program called Fortress SMS which used 128 bit AES encryption to protect SMS messages. Police have also retrieved deleted text messages to aid them in solving crimes. For example, Swedish police retrieved deleted texts from a cult member who claimed she committed a double murder based on forwarded texts she received. Police in Tilburg, Netherlands, started an SMS alert program, in which they would send a message to ask citizens to be vigilant when a burglar was on the loose or a child was missing in their neighbourhood. Several thieves have been caught and children have been found using the SMS Alerts. The service has been expanding to other cities. A Malaysian–Australian company has released a multi-layer SMS security program. Boston police are now turning to text messaging to help stop crime. The Boston Police Department asks citizens to send texts to make anonymous crime tips.

Under some interpretations of sharia law, husbands can divorce their wives by the pronouncement of talaq. In 2003, a court in Malaysia upheld such a divorce pronouncement which was transmitted via SMS.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2017 that under the state constitution, police require a warrant before obtaining access to text messages without consent.

=== Social unrest ===
Texting has been used on a number of occasions with the result of the gathering of large aggressive crowds. SMS messaging drew a crowd to Cronulla Beach in Sydney resulting in the 2005 Cronulla riots. Not only were text messages circulating in the Sydney area but in other states as well (&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;). The volume of such text messages and e-mails also increased in the wake of the riot. The crowd of 5,000 at stages became violent, attacking certain ethnic groups. Sutherland Shire Mayor directly blamed heavily circulated SMS messages for the unrest. NSW police considered whether people could be charged over the texting. Retaliatory attacks also used SMS.

The Narre Warren Incident, when a group of 500 party goers attended a party at Narre Warren in Melbourne, Australia, and rioted in January 2008, also was a response of communication being spread by SMS and Myspace. Following the incident, the Police Commissioner wrote an open letter asking young people to be aware of the power of SMS and the Internet. In Hong Kong, government officials find that text messaging helps socially because they can send multiple texts to the community. Officials say it is an easy way of contacting the community or individuals for meetings or events. Texting was used to coordinate gatherings during the 2009 Iranian election protests.

Between 2009 and 2012 the U.S. secretly created and funded a Twitter-like service for Cubans called ZunZuneo, initially based on mobile phone text message service and later with an internet interface. The service was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development through its Office of Transition Initiatives, who utilized contractors and front companies in the Cayman Islands, Spain and Ireland. A longer-term objective was to organize &quot;smart mobs&quot; that might &quot;renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.&quot; A database about the subscribers was created, including gender, age, and &quot;political tendencies&quot;. At its peak ZunZuneo had 40,000 Cuban users, but the service closed as financially unsustainable when U.S. funding was stopped.

=== In politics ===


Text messaging has affected the political world. American campaigns find that text messaging is a much easier, cheaper way of getting to the voters than the door-to-door approach. In 2006 Mexico&#x27;s then president-elect Felipe Calderón launched millions of text messages in the days immediately preceding his narrow win over Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In January 2001, Joseph Estrada was forced to resign from the post of president of the Philippines. The popular campaign against him was widely reported to have been coordinated with SMS chain letters. A massive texting campaign was credited with boosting youth turnout in Spain&#x27;s 2004 parliamentary elections. In 2008, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his Chief of Staff at the time became entangled in a sex scandal stemming from the exchange of over 14,000 text messages that eventually led to his forced resignation, the conviction of perjury, and other charges.
Text messaging has been used to turn down other political leaders. During the 2004 U.S. Democratic and Republican National Conventions, protesters used an SMS-based organizing tool called TXTmob to get to opponents. In the last day before the 2004 presidential elections in Romania, a message against Adrian Năstase was largely circulated, thus breaking the laws that prohibited campaigning that day. Text messaging has helped politics by promoting campaigns.

On 20 January 2001, President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines became the first head of state in history to lose power to a smart mob. More than one million Manila residents assembled at the site of the 1986 People Power peaceful demonstrations that have toppled the Marcos regime. These people have organized themselves and coordinated their actions through text messaging. They were able to bring down a government without having to use any weapons or violence. Through text messaging, their plans and ideas were communicated to others and successfully implemented. Also, this move encouraged the military to withdraw their support from the regime, and as a result, the Estrada government fell. People were able to converge and unite with the use of their cell phones. &quot;The rapid assembly of the anti-Estrada crowd was a hallmark of early smart mob technology, and the millions of text messages exchanged by the demonstrators in 2001 was, by all accounts, a key to the crowds esprit de corps.&quot;

=== Use in healthcare ===

Text messaging is a rapidly growing trend in Healthcare. A randomized controlled trial of text messaging intervention for diabetes in Bangladesh was one of the first robust trials to report improvement in diabetes management in a low-and-middle income country. A recent systematic review and individual participants data meta analysis from 3,779 participants reported that mobile phone text messaging could improve blood pressure and body mass index. Another study in people with type 2 diabetes showed that participants were willing to pay a modest amount to receive a diabetes text messaging program in addition to standard care. &quot;One survey found that 73% of physicians text other physicians about work- similar to the overall percentage of the population that texts.&quot; A 2006 study of reminder messages sent to children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus showed favorable changes in adherence to treatment. A risk is that these physicians could be violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Where messages could be saved to a phone indefinitely, patient information could be subject to theft or loss, and could be seen by other unauthorized persons. The HIPAA privacy rule requires that any text message involving a medical decision must be available for the patient to access, meaning that any texts that are not documented in an EMR system could be a HIPAA violation.

=== Medical concerns ===

The excessive use of the thumb for pressing keys on mobile devices has led to a high rate of a form of repetitive strain injury termed &quot;BlackBerry thumb&quot; (although this refers to strain developed on older Blackberry devices, which had a scroll wheel on the side of the phone). An inflammation of the tendons in the thumb caused by constant text-messaging is also called text-messager&#x27;s thumb, or texting tenosynovitis. Texting has also been linked as a secondary source in numerous traffic collisions, in which police investigations of mobile phone records have found that many drivers have lost control of their cars while attempting to send or retrieve a text message. Increasing cases of Internet addiction are now also being linked to text messaging, as mobile phones are now more likely to have e-mail and Web capabilities to complement the ability to text.

=== Etiquette ===
Texting etiquette refers to what is considered appropriate texting behaviour. These expectations may concern different areas, such as the context in which a text was sent and received/read, who each participant was with when the participant sent or received/read a text message or what constitutes impolite text messages. At the website of The Emily Post Institute, the topic of &quot;texting&quot; has spurred several articles with the &quot;do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s&quot; regarding the new form of communication. One example from the site is: &quot;Keep your message brief. No one wants to have an entire conversation with you by texting when you could just call him or her instead.&quot; Another example is: &quot;Don&#x27;t use all Caps. Typing a text message in all capital letters will appear as though you are shouting at the recipient, and should be avoided.&quot;

Expectations for etiquette may differ depending on various factors. For example, expectations for appropriate behaviour have been found to differ markedly between the U.S. and India. Another example is generational differences. In &quot;The M-Factor: How the Millennial Generation Is Rocking the Workplace&quot;, Lynne Lancaster and David Stillman note that younger Americans often do not consider it rude to answer their cell or begin texting in the middle of a face-to-face conversation with someone else, while older people, less used to the behavior and the accompanying lack of eye contact or attention, find this to be disruptive and ill-mannered. With regard to texting in the workplace, Plantronics studied how we communicate at work] and found that 58% of US knowledge workers have increased the use of text messaging for work in the past five years. The same study found that 33% of knowledge workers felt text messaging was critical or very important to success and productivity at work.

=== Typing awareness indicators ===

In some text messaging software products, an ellipsis is displayed while the interlocutor is typing characters. The feature has been referred to as a &quot;typing awareness indicator&quot;, for which patents have been filed since the 1990s.

== Challenges ==
=== Spam ===

In 2002, an increasing trend towards spamming mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular-service carriers to take steps against the practice, before it became a widespread problem. No major spamming incidents involving SMS had been reported , but the existence of mobile phone spam has been noted by industry watchdogs including &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine and the Utility Consumers&#x27; Action Network (UCAN). In 2005, UCAN brought a case against Sprint for spamming its customers and charging $0.10 per text message. The case was settled in 2006 with Sprint agreeing not to send customers Sprint advertisements via SMS. SMS expert Acision (formerly LogicaCMG Telecoms) reported a new type of SMS malice at the end of 2006, noting the first instances of SMiShing (a cousin to e-mail phishing scams). In SMiShing, users receive SMS messages posing to be from a company, enticing users to phone premium-rate numbers or reply with personal information. Similar concerns were reported by PhonepayPlus, a consumer watchdog in the United Kingdom, in 2012.

=== Pricing concerns ===
Concerns have been voiced over the excessive cost of off-plan text messaging in the United States. AT&amp;T Mobility, along with most other service providers, charges texters 20 cents per message if they do not have a messaging plan or if they have exceeded their allotted number of texts. Given that an SMS message is at most 160 bytes in size, this cost scales to a cost of $1,310 per megabyte sent via text message. This is in sharp contrast with the price of unlimited data plans offered by the same carriers, which allow the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of data for monthly prices of about $15 to $45 in addition to a voice plan. As a comparison, a one-minute phone call uses up the same amount of network capacity as 600 text messages, meaning that if the same cost-per-traffic formula were applied to phone calls, cell phone calls would cost $120 per minute. With service providers gaining more customers and expanding their capacity, their overhead costs should be decreasing, not increasing. In 2005, text messaging generated nearly 70 billion dollars in revenue, as reported by Gartner, industry analysts, three times as much as Hollywood box office sales in 2005. World figures showed that over a trillion text messages were sent in 2005.

Although major cellphone providers deny any collusion, fees for out-of-package text messages have increased, doubling from 10 to 20 cents in the United States between 2007 and 2008 alone. On 16 July 2009, Senate hearings were held to look into any breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The same trend is visible in other countries, though increasingly widespread flat-rate plans, for example in Germany, do make text messaging easier, text messages sent abroad still result in higher costs.

=== Increasing competition ===
While text messaging is still a growing market, traditional SMS is becoming increasingly challenged by alternative messaging services which are available on smartphones with data connections. These services are much cheaper and offer more functionality like exchanging multimedia content (e.g. photos, videos or audio notes) and group messaging. Especially in western countries some of these services attract more and more users. Prominent examples of these include Apple&#x27;s iMessage (exclusive to the Apple ecosystem) and the GSMA&#x27;s RCS.

In 2021, 8.4 trillion SMS messages were sent globally, compared to 18.25 trillion for WhatsApp alone.

=== Security concerns ===
Experts have advised business users not to use consumer SMS for confidential communication. The contents of common SMS messages are known to the network operator&#x27;s systems and personnel. Therefore, consumer SMS is not an appropriate technology for secure communications. To address this issue, many companies use an SMS gateway provider based on SS7 connectivity to route the messages. The advantage of this international termination model is the ability to route data directly through SS7, which gives the provider visibility of the complete path of the SMS. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the SMS-C of other mobile operators. This approach reduces the number of mobile operators that handle the message; however, experts have advised not to consider it as an end-to-end secure communication, as the content of the message is exposed to the SMS gateway provider.

An alternative approach is to use end-to-end security software that runs on both the sending and receiving device, where the original text message is transmitted in encrypted form as a consumer SMS. By using key rotation, the encrypted text messages stored under data retention laws at the network operator cannot be decrypted even if one of the devices is compromised. A problem with this approach is that communicating devices needs to run compatible software. Failure rates without backward notification can be high between carriers. International texting can be unreliable depending on the country of origin, destination and respective operators. Differences in the character sets used for coding can cause a text message sent from one country to another to become unreadable.

== In popular culture ==
=== Records and competition ===

The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; has a world record for text messaging, currently held by Sonja Kristiansen of Norway. Kristiansen keyed in the official text message, as established by Guinness, in 37.28 seconds. The message is, &quot;The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality, they seldom attack a human.&quot; In 2005, the record was held by a 24-year-old Scottish man, Craig Crosbie, who completed the same message in 48 seconds, beating the previous time by 19 seconds. &quot;The Book of Alternative Records&quot; lists Chris Young of Salem, Oregon as the world-record holder for the fastest 160-character text message where the contents of the message are not provided ahead of time. His record of 62.3 seconds was set on 23 May 2007.

Elliot Nicholls of Dunedin, New Zealand currently holds the world record for the fastest blindfolded text messaging. A record of a 160-letter text in 45 seconds while blindfolded was set on 17 November 2007, beating the old record of 1-minute 26 seconds set by an Italian in September 2006. Andrew Acklin of Ohio is credited with the world record for most text messages sent or received in a single month, with 200,052. His accomplishments were first in the World Records Academy and later followed up by &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It Or Not 2010: Seeing Is Believing&quot;. He has been acknowledged by The Universal Records Database for the most text messages in a single month; however, this has since been broken twice and as of 2010 was listed as 566607 messages by Fred Lindgren.

In January 2010, LG Electronics sponsored an international competition, the LG Mobile World Cup, to determine the fastest pair of texters. The winners were a team from South Korea, Ha Mok-min and Bae Yeong-ho. On 6 April 2011, SKH Apps released an iPhone app, iTextFast, to allow consumers to test their texting speed and practice the paragraph used by &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. As of 2011, best time listed on Game Center for that paragraph is 34.65 seconds.

=== Morse code ===
A few competitions have been held between expert Morse code operators and expert SMS users. Several mobile phones have Morse code ring tones and alert messages. For example, many Nokia mobile phones have an option to beep &quot;S M S&quot; in Morse code when it receives a short message. Some of these phones could also play the Nokia slogan &quot;Connecting people&quot; in Morse code as a message tone. There are third-party applications available for some mobile phones that allow Morse input for short messages.

== Tattle texting ==
&quot;Tattle texting&quot; can mean either of two different texting trends:

=== Arena security ===
Many sports arenas now offer a number where patrons can text report security concerns, like drunk or unruly fans, or safety issues like spills. These programs have been praised by patrons and security personnel as more effective than traditional methods. For instance, the patron doesn&#x27;t need to leave his seat and miss the event in order to report something important. Also, disruptive fans can be reported with relative anonymity. &quot;Text tattling&quot; also gives security personnel a useful tool to prioritize messages. For instance, a single complaint in one section about an unruly fan can be addressed when convenient, while multiple complaints by several different patrons can be acted upon immediately.

=== Smart cars ===
In this context, &quot;tattle texting&quot; refers to an automatic text sent by the computer in an automobile, because a preset condition was met. The most common use for this is for parents to receive texts from the car their child is driving, alerting them to speeding or other issues. Employers can also use the service to monitor their corporate vehicles. The technology is still new and (currently) only available on a few car models.

Common conditions that can be chosen to send a text are:
* Speeding. With the use of GPS, stored maps, and speed limit information, the onboard computer can determine if the driver is exceeding the current speed limit. The device can store this information and/or send it to another recipient.
* Range. Parents/employers can set a maximum range from a fixed location after which a &quot;tattle text&quot; is sent. Not only can this keep children close to home and keep employees from using corporate vehicles inappropriately, but it can also be a crucial tool for quickly identifying stolen vehicles, car jackings, and kidnappings.

<text>Legio XXII Deiotariana (&quot;Deiotarus&#x27; Twenty-Second Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army, founded ca. 48 BC and disbanded or destroyed during the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136. Its cognomen comes from Deiotarus, a Celtic king of Galatia. Its emblem is unknown.

== Legion history ==
=== Origin of the legion ===
The legion was levied by Deiotarus, king of the Celtic tribe of the Tolistobogii, who lived in Galatia, modern Turkey. Deiotarus became an ally of the Roman Republic&#x27;s general Pompey in 63 BC, who named him king of all the Celtic tribes of Asia Minor, which were collectively known as &quot;Galatians&quot; (hence the name Galatia for the region). Deiotarus levied an army and trained it with Roman help; the army, in 48 BC, was composed of 12,000 infantrymen and 2,000 horsemen. Cicero writes that the army was divided into thirty cohortes, which were roughly equivalent to three Roman legions of the time. This army supported the Romans in their wars against king Mithridates VI of Pontus, and contributed to Roman victory in the Third Mithridatic War.

After a heavy defeat against king Pharnaces II of Pontus near Nicopolis, the surviving soldiers of Deiotarus’s army formed a single legion, which marched besides Julius Caesar during his victorious campaign against Pontus, and fought with him in the Battle of Zela (47 BC).

=== Early history (BC) ===

On the death of Amyntas in 25 BC, Deiotarus&#x27; successor, the Galatian kingdom was absorbed into the Roman Empire. A papyrus recovered from Egypt, dated 8 BC, mentions two soldiers of the legion. Between these two dates, the Galatian army was incorporated as a legion into the Roman army. M.H.D. Parker argues that the date of its incorporation could be narrowed further as between 16 BC and 8 BC; since Caesar Augustus had already 21 legions, the legion received the number XXII.

The Twenty-second was assigned to Nicopolis (next Alexandria, in Aegyptus) together with III &quot;Cyrenaica&quot;. These two legions had the role of garrisoning the Egyptian province from threats both within and without, given the multi-ethnic nature of Alexandria.

In 26 BC, Aelius Gallus, &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; (praefectus of Egypt), led a campaign against the Nubian kingdoms and another to find &quot;Arabia Felix&quot; (Yemen). The campaign came quickly to a halt (25 BC) because of the heavy losses in the troops (Romans, Hebrews and Nabateans), due to hunger and epidemics.

The losses were not recovered, so in 23 BC the Nubians, led by queen Kandake Amanirenas, took the initiative and attacked the Romans moving towards Elephantine. The new praefectus of Egypt, Gaius Petronius, obtained reinforcements, and after blocking the Nubians, marched up the Nile to the Nubian capital of Napata, which was sacked in 22 BC. It is highly probable that XXII fought in these wars.

After these actions, the Nubian front remained calm for a long time, so the legions could be employed otherwise. The legionaries were used not only as soldiers, but also as workers, as some of them were sent to the granite mines of Mons Claudianus. Other legionaries were sent in the deepest south of the Egyptian province and scratched their names on the stones of the Colossi of Memnon.

=== Later history ===
Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign (55–63) against the Parthian Empire, which had invaded the kingdom of Armenia, allied to the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60 and losing it in 62, the Romans sent XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot; from Pannonia to Cn. Domitius Corbulo, &quot;legatus&quot; of Syria. Corbulo, with the legions XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot;, III &quot;Gallica&quot;, V &quot;Macedonica&quot;, X &quot;Fretensis&quot; and XXII, forced Vologases I of Parthia to a compromise peace in 63, whereby his brother Tiridates would become king of Armenia as a Roman client.

In 66, Zealot Jews killed the Roman garrison in Jerusalem. After the ignominious defeat of the legatus of Syria in 66, T. Flavius Vespasianus entered in Iudaea in 67 with the legions V &quot;Macedonica&quot;, X &quot;Fretensis&quot;, XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot;, one vexillatio of 1,000 legionaries of the XXII, and 15,000 soldiers from the Eastern allies, and started the siege of Jerusalem in 69, which would be completed by his son T. Flavius Vespasianus (better known as Titus) in 70. In fact in 69, the &quot;year of the four emperors&quot;, Flavius Vespasianus senior returned to Italy to conquer the imperial throne after Nero&#x27;s death and Galba&#x27;s rebellion. The Twenty-second sided with Flavius Vespasianus, who eventually became emperor.

Under Trajan, the legion was officially known as &quot;Deiotariana&quot;, even if this was its unofficial name since Claudian times.

The last certain record of XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot; is from the year 119. In 145, when a list of all existing legions was made, XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot; was not included. Whether the legion was disbanded on administrative grounds or was destroyed during conflict remains uncertain.

It is generally proposed that XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot; suffered serious losses during the Jewish rebellion of Simon bar Kokhba. According to Peter Schafer&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;The disappearance of the Legio XXII Deiotariana in connection with the Bar Kokhba Revolt is uncertain and not generally accepted as fact.&quot; Evidence from Caesarea Maritima gained support from a number of scholars interpreting the aqueduct reparation inscription made c.133-134 as mentioning Legio XXII Deiotariana. If indeed connected with the legion, the inscription sets the last known location to Judean province during the Bar Kokhba revolt and making the war the most plausible explanation to the legion&#x27;s disappearance. According to Isaac and Roll , the fact the inscription was apparently deliberately erased was an intentional damnatio memoriae because of Legio XXII&#x27;s defeat. However, according to Negev , the inscription may be attributed to either Legio Ferrata or Legio Deiotariana.

<text>Chesley Knight Bonestell Jr. (January 1, 1888 – June 11, 1986) was an American painter, designer, and illustrator. His paintings inspired the American space program, and they have been (and remain) influential in science fiction art and illustration. A pioneering creator of astronomical art, along with the French astronomer-artist Lucien Rudaux, Bonestell has been dubbed the &quot;Father of Modern Space art&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bonestell was born January 1, 1888, in San Francisco, California, to Chesley Knight Bonestell and his wife, Jovita ( Ferrer). Jovita was a daughter of Manuel Y. Ferrer, a Spanish-American musician.

Chesley attended Clement Grammar School, Dickensen&#x27;s Academy, and St. Ignatius College Preparatory, and George Bates University School. After graduating in 1904, he worked for his grandfather, Louis H. Bonestell, at the Bonestell Paper Company. For the next three years, he attended evening classes at the Hopkins Art Institute.

==Career==
His first astronomical painting was done in 1905. After seeing Saturn through the telescope at San Jose&#x27;s Lick Observatory, he rushed home to paint what he had seen. The painting was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 earthquake. Between 1915 and 1918, he exhibited lithographs in the 4th and 7th annual exhibitions of the California Society of Etchers (now the California Society of Printmakers) in San Francisco.

Bonestell enrolled as an undergraduate at Columbia University in New York City in 1907, adopting an architecture major. Dropping out in June 1910, he worked as a renderer and designer for several of the leading architectural firms of the time, including the firm of Willis Polk, &quot;The Man Who Rebuilt San Francisco.&quot;

Bonestell moved to England in 1920, where he rendered architectural subjects for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. He returned to New York in 1926. While with William van Alen, he and Warren Straton designed the art deco façade of the Chrysler Building as well as its distinctive eagles. During this same period, he designed the Plymouth Rock Memorial, the U.S. Supreme Court Building, the New York Central Building, Manhattan office and apartment buildings and several state capitols.

Returning to the West Coast, he prepared illustrations of the chief engineer&#x27;s plans for the Golden Gate Bridge for the benefit of funders. In the late 1930s he moved to Hollywood, where he worked (without screen credit) as a special effects artist, creating matte paintings for films, including &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942).

===Magazines===

Bonestell then realized that he could combine what he had learned about camera angles, miniature modeling, and painting techniques with his lifelong interest in astronomy. The result was a series of paintings of Saturn as seen from several of its moons that was published in &quot;Life&quot; in 1944. Nothing like these had ever been seen before: they looked as though photographers had been sent into space. His painting &quot;Saturn as Seen from Titan&quot; is perhaps the most famous astronomical landscape ever, and is nicknamed &quot;the painting that launched a thousand careers.&quot; It was constructed with a combination of clay models, photographic tricks and various painting techniques (Titan has a thick haze; such a view is probably not possible in reality).

Bonestell followed up the sensation these paintings created by publishing more paintings in many leading national magazines. These and others were eventually collected in the best-selling book &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot; (1949), produced in collaboration with author Willy Ley. Bonestell&#x27;s last work in Hollywood was contributing special effects art and technical advice to the seminal science fiction films produced by George Pal, including &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;, as well as &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot;. Beginning with the October 1947 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, Bonestell painted more than 60 cover illustrations for science fiction magazines, primarily &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, in the 1950s through 1970s. He also illustrated many book covers.

When Wernher von Braun organized a space flight symposium for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, he invited Bonestell to illustrate his concepts for the future of spaceflight. For the first time, spaceflight was shown to be a matter of the near future. Von Braun and Bonestell showed that it could be accomplished with the technology then existing in the mid-1950s, and that the question was that of money and will. Coming as they did at the beginning of the Cold War and just before the sobering shock of the launch of Sputnik, the 1952–1954 &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; series, &quot;Man Will Conquer Space Soon!&quot;, was instrumental in kick-starting America&#x27;s space program.

==Death==
In 1986, Bonestell died in Carmel, California, with an unfinished painting on his easel.

==Legacy==
During his lifetime, Bonestell was honored internationally for the contributions he made to the birth of modern astronautics, from a bronze medal awarded by the British Interplanetary Society to a place in the International Space Hall of Fame to an asteroid named for him. &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot; won the 1951 International Fantasy Award for nonfiction, one of the first two fantasy or science fiction awards anywhere, at the British SF Convention. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Bonestell in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors.

His paintings are prized by collectors and institutions such as the National Air and Space Museum and the National Collection of Fine Arts. One of his classic paintings, an ethereally beautiful image of Saturn seen from its giant moon Titan, has been called &quot;the painting that launched a thousand careers.&quot; Wernher von Braun wrote that he had &quot;learned to respect, nay fear, this wonderful artist&#x27;s obsession with perfection. My file cabinet is filled with sketches of rocket ships I had prepared to help in his artwork—only to have them returned to me with...blistering criticism.&quot;

Additionally, Bonestell Crater on the planet Mars, and the asteroid 3129 Bonestell are named after him.

In 2017, the first ever album of Sun Ra vocal tracks was released, &quot;The Space Age Is Here to Stay&quot;, featuring sleeve art authorized by the Bonestell estate.

<doc id="305866" wikidata="Q2708932" url="?curid=305866" title="Andaman day gecko">
<text>The Andaman day gecko (Phelsuma andamanensis), also known as the Andaman Islands day gecko, is a species of gecko in the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;. It is endemic to the Andaman Islands of India, and has recently been introduced to the Nicobar islands. It is a small, slender lizard, has a bright green colour and feeds on insects. Its range is nearly 5000 km away from the centre of the distribution area of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;, in Mauritius and Madagascar.

== Taxonomy ==
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that &quot;P. andamanensis&quot; is the most basal extant member of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;, having diverged from the clade containing all the Western Indian Ocean &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species during the late Oligocene, about 27 million years ago. In its home range, an immense genetic diversity of mitochondrial haplotypes is seen among individuals, indicating that it had colonized the Andamans entirely naturally and not due to humans somehow transporting it from the Western Indian Ocean islands.

Unlike with the Western Indian Ocean species, there has been no major speciation throughout the Andamans despite &quot;P. andamanensis&quot; having existed and diversified on the Andamans for millions of years. The species can however be divided into two major clades or population clusters: a &#x27;North&#x27; cluster and a &#x27;South&#x27; cluster; both clusters are thought to have diverged before the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, although what exactly caused their divergence is unknown.

== Distribution ==
The Andaman day gecko is found throughout the Andaman Islands of India, with the &#x27;North&#x27; clade being found on North Andaman, Middle Andaman, Interview, Baratang, Shaheed Dweep, and Long Islands, while the &#x27;South&#x27; clade is found on Swaraj Dweep, South Andaman, and Little Andaman Islands. While the species reached the Andaman Islands through natural means, parts of its range within the islands may be a consequence of human-mediated dispersal due to its generalist lifestyle. It has also recently been sighted on the Nicobar Islands for the first time, which is likely also a consequence of human introduction.

== Description ==
The body of this day gecko is bright green with red dots and stripes on the back. Males have a bluish or turquoise coloured tail. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe is extending from the nostrils to the ear. The undersurface of the body is bright yellow or off-white.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Phelsuma andamanensis&quot; inhabits lowlands where is typically found in domestic gardens on coconut palms, screw pines, banana trees and on sisal plants. It also sometimes lives on local huts. This generalist lifestyle has allowed it to have a major population expansion with the growth of cash crops on the Andamans, making it a rare example of an island-endemic reptile that has actually massively benefited from anthropogenic disturbance. However, this new, dense population may make them more susceptible to stressors such as parasites and diseases.

== Behaviour ==
These shy day geckos are extremely aggressive toward other members of its species.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Phelsuma andamanensis&quot; normally lays two eggs in a protected and elevated location. The females can be extraordinarily fertile. It has been observed that during a period of 18 months, 14 pairs of eggs were laid.

<doc id="305869" wikidata="Q399495" url="?curid=305869" title="Standard language">
<text>A standard language (or standard variety, standard dialect, standardized dialect or simply standard) is any language variety that has undergone substantial codification of its grammar, lexicon, writing system, or other features and that stands out among related varieties in a community as the one with the highest status or prestige. Often, it is the prestige language variety of a whole country. 

In linguistics, the process of a variety becoming organized into a standard, for instance by being widely expounded in grammar books or other reference works, and also the process of making people&#x27;s language usage conform to that standard, is called standardization. Typically, the varieties that undergo standardization are those associated with centres of commerce and government, used frequently by educated people and in news broadcasting, and taught widely in schools and to non-native learners of the language. Within a language community, standardization usually begins with a particular variety being selected (often towards a goal of further linguistic uniformity), accepted by influential people, socially and culturally spread, established in opposition to competitor varieties, maintained, increasingly used in diverse contexts, and assigned a high social status as a result of the variety being linked to the most successful people. As a sociological effect of these processes, most users of a standard dialect—and many users of other dialects of the same language—come to believe that the standard is inherently superior to, or consider it the linguistic baseline against which to judge, the other dialects. However, such beliefs are firmly rooted in social perceptions rather than any objective evaluation. Any varieties that do not carry high social status in a community (and thus may be defined in opposition to standard dialects) are called nonstandard or vernacular dialects. 

The standardization of a language is a continual process, because language is always changing and a language-in-use cannot be permanently standardized like the parts of a machine. Standardization may originate from a motivation to make the written form of a language more uniform, as is the case of Standard English. Typically, standardization processes include efforts to stabilize the spelling of the prestige dialect, to codify usages and particular (denotative) meanings through formal grammars and dictionaries, and to encourage public acceptance of the codifications as intrinsically correct. In that vein, a pluricentric language has interacting standard varieties. Examples are English, French, Portuguese, German, Korean, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Armenian and Mandarin Chinese. Monocentric languages, such as Russian and Japanese, have one standardized idiom.

The term &quot;standard language&quot; occasionally refers also to the entirety of a language that includes a standardized form as one of its varieties. In Europe, a standardized written language is sometimes identified with the German word (written language). The term &quot;literary language&quot; is occasionally used as a synonym for &quot;standard language&quot;, a naming convention still prevalent in the linguistic traditions of eastern Europe. In contemporary linguistic usage, the terms &quot;standard dialect&quot; and &quot;standard variety&quot; are neutral synonyms for the term &quot;standard language&quot;, usages which indicate that &quot;the standard&quot; language is one of many dialects and varieties of a language, rather than the totality of the language, whilst minimizing the negative implication of social subordination that the standard is the only form worthy of the label &quot;language&quot;.

== Linguistic standardization ==
The term &quot;standard language&quot; identifies a repertoire of broadly recognizable conventions in spoken and written communications used in a society; the term implies neither a socially ideal idiom nor a culturally superior form of speech. These conventions develop from related dialects, usually by social action (ethnic and cultural unification) that elevate discourse patterns associated with perceived centres of culture, or more rarely, by deliberately defining the norms of standard language with selected linguistic features drawn from the existing dialects, as in the case of Modern Hebrew.

Either course of events typically results in a relatively fixed orthography codified in grammars and normative dictionaries, in which users can also sometimes find illustrative examples drawn from literary, legal, or religious texts. Whether grammars and dictionaries are created by the state or by private citizens (e.g. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;), some users regard such linguistic codifications as authoritative for correcting the spoken and written forms of the language. Effects of such codifications include slowing the pace of diachronic change in the standardized variety and affording a basis for further linguistic development (&quot;Ausbau&quot;). In the practices of broadcasting and of official communications, the standard usually functions as a normalizing reference for speech and writing. In educational contexts, it usually informs the version of the language taught to non-native learners.

In those ways, the standard variety acquires social prestige and greater functional importance than nonstandard dialects, which depend upon or are heteronomous with respect to the standard idiom. Standard usage serves as the linguistic authority, as in the case of specialist terminology; moreover, the standardization of spoken forms is oriented towards the codified standard. Historically, a standard language arises in two ways: (i) in the case of Standard English, linguistic standardization occurs informally and piecemeal, without formal government intervention; (ii) in the cases of the French and Spanish languages, linguistic standardization occurs formally, directed by prescriptive language institutions, such as the and the Royal Spanish Academy, which respectively produce &quot;Le bon français&quot; and &quot;El buen español&quot;.

A standard variety can be conceptualized in two ways: (i) as the sociolect of a given socio-economic stratum or (ii) as the normative codification of a dialect, an idealized abstraction. Hence, the full standardization of a language is impractical, because a standardized dialect cannot fully function as a real entity, but does function as set of linguistic norms observed to varying degrees in the course of &quot;usus&quot; – of how people actually speak and write the language. In practice, the language varieties identified as standard are neither uniform nor fully stabilized, especially in their spoken forms. From that perspective, the linguist Suzanne Romaine says that standard languages can be conceptually compared to the imagined communities of &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;nationalism&quot;, as described by the political scientist Benedict Anderson, which indicates that linguistic standardization is the result of a society&#x27;s history and sociology, and thus is not a universal phenomenon; of the approximately 7,000 contemporary spoken languages, most do not have a codified standard dialect.

Politically, in the formation of a nation-state, identifying and cultivating a standard variety can serve efforts to establish a shared culture among the social and economic groups who compose the new nation-state. Different national standards, derived from a continuum of dialects, might be treated as discrete languages (along with heteronomous vernacular dialects) even if there are mutually intelligible varieties among them, such as the North Germanic languages of Scandinavia (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish). Moreover, in political praxis, either a government or a neighbouring population might deny the cultural status of a standard language. In response to such political interference, linguists develop a standard variety from elements of the different dialects used by a society.

For example, when Norway became independent from Denmark in 1814, the only written language was Danish. Different Norwegian dialects were spoken in rural districts and provincial cities, but people with higher education and upper-class urban people spoke &quot;Danish with a Norwegian pronunciation&quot;. Based upon the bourgeois speech of the capital Oslo (Christiania) and other major cities, several orthographic reforms, notably in 1907 and 1917, resulted in the official standard Riksmål, in 1929 renamed Bokmål (&#x27;book tongue&#x27;). The philologist Ivar Aasen (1813–1896) considered urban and upper-class Dano-Norwegian too similar to Danish, so he developed Landsmål (&#x27;country tongue&#x27;), the standard based upon the dialects of western Norway. In 1885 the Storting (parliament) declared both forms official and equal. In 1929 it was officially renamed Nynorsk (New Norwegian).

Likewise, in Yugoslavia (1945–1992), when the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (1963–1991) developed their national language from the dialect continuum demarcated by Serbia to the north and Bulgaria to the east, their Standard Macedonian was based upon vernaculars from the west of the republic, which were the dialects most linguistically different from standard Bulgarian, the previous linguistic norm used in that region of the Balkan peninsula. Although Macedonian functions as the standard language of the Republic of North Macedonia, nonetheless, for political and cultural reasons, Bulgarians treat Macedonian as a Bulgarian dialect.

==Examples==
===Chinese===
Chinese consists of hundreds of local varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including Mandarin, Wu, Yue, Hakka and Min.
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in Classical Chinese, a style modelled on the classics and far removed from any contemporary speech.
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as &quot;Guānhuà&quot; (literally &quot;speech of officials&quot;).

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on Mandarin dialects.
In the 1930s, Standard Chinese was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.
It is the official spoken language of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (where it is called &quot;Pǔtōnghuà&quot; &quot;common speech&quot;), the de facto official language of the Republic of China governing Taiwan (as &quot;Guóyǔ&quot; &quot;national language&quot;) and one of the official languages of Singapore (as &quot;Huáyǔ&quot; &quot;Chinese language&quot;).
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.

===English in the United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the standard language is British English, which is based upon the language of the medieval court of Chancery of England and Wales. In the late-seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Standard English became established as the linguistic norm of the upper class, composed of the peerage and the gentry. Socially, the accent of the spoken version of the standard language then indicated that the speaker was a man or a woman possessed of a good education, and thus of high social prestige. In England and Wales, Standard English is usually associated with Received Pronunciation, &quot;the standard accent of English as spoken in the south of England.&quot;, but it may also be spoken with other accents, and in other countries still other accents are used (Australian, Canadian, American, Scottish, etc.) 

===Greek===
The standard form of Modern Greek is based on the Southern dialects; these dialects are spoken mainly in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, Attica, Crete and the Cyclades.

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardized registers of the Hindustani language have legal status in India: Standard Hindi (one of 23 co-official national languages) and Urdu (Pakistan&#x27;s official tongue); as a result, Hindustani is often called &quot;Hindi-Urdu&quot;.

===Irish===

 (&#x27;The Official Standard&#x27;), often shortened to , is the official standard of the Irish language. It was first published by the translators in Dáil Éireann in the 1950s. As of September 2013, the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online and in print. Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers, including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.

===Italian===
Standard Italian is derived from the Tuscan dialect, specifically from its Florentine variety—the Florentine influence upon early Italian literature established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of Florentine authors like Dante Alighieri, as well as to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects. It would later become the official language of all the Italian states, and after the Italian unification it became the national language of the Kingdom of Italy. Modern Standard Italian&#x27;s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all regional languages of Italy.

===Latin===
The standard language in the Roman Republic (509 BC – 27 BC) and the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 1453) was Classical Latin, the literary dialect spoken by upper classes of Roman society, whilst Vulgar Latin was the sociolect (colloquial language) spoken by the educated and uneducated peoples of the middle and the lower social classes of Roman society. The Latin language that Roman armies introduced to Gaul, Hispania, and Dacia had a grammar, syntax, and vocabulary different from the Classical Latin spoken and written by the statesman Cicero.

===Portuguese===

==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but &quot;de facto&quot;, spoken standard of Brazilian Portuguese, originally derived from the middle-class dialects of Rio de Janeiro and Brasília, but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. This artificial accent is called &quot;sotaque neutro&quot;. In that standard, represents the phoneme when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents ) and the rhotic consonant spelled is pronounced in the same situation (whereas in São Paulo this is usually an alveolar flap or trill). 

The sociolect of prestige of &quot;mineiro&quot; spoken in the capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, is the accent from Brazilian Portuguese that is the nearest to &quot;sotaque neutro&quot;.

==== Africa and Europe ====
European and African dialects have differing realizations of than Brazilian dialects, with the former using and and the latter using , , or .

===Serbo-Croatian===
Four standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian are spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia. They all have the same dialect basis (Štokavian). These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as different languages. The differences between the variants do not hinder mutual intelligibility and do not undermine the integrity of the system as a whole. Compared to the differences between the variants of English, German, French, Spanish, or Portuguese, the distinctions between the variants of Serbo-Croatian are less significant.Nonetheless, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro have all named the language differently in their constitutions.

===Somali===
In Somalia, Northern Somali (or North-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali, particularly the Mudug dialect of the northern Darod clan. Northern Central Somali has frequently been used by famous Somali poets as well as the political elite, and thus has the most prestige among other Somali dialects.

<text>Metro AG is a German multinational company based in Düsseldorf which operates business membership-only cash and carry stores primarily under the Metro brand. As of September 2024, Metro is operating 624 wholesale stores in 21 countries, including Europe and Pakistan.

The company was established in 1964 by Ernst Schmidt and Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck. In 2010, it was the fourth-largest retailer in the world measured by revenues, after Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco. Until 2020, it was also active in the general retail business through the Real division, which was sold to an investor consortium. Its current incarnation was launched in 2017 as a spun-off of old Metro AG, which continued to be a consumer electronics retailer and renamed itself Ceconomy.

==History==
In 1966, Otto Beisheim met Friedrich Wilhelm Lenz, chairman of the management board of Franz Haniel &amp; Cie. and convinced him to invest in Metro. In the course of the following reorganization Beisheim became a shareholder himself. From this point on, the founding family Schmidt-Ruthenbeck and the shareholders Beisheim and Haniel each held about one third of the shares.

Under the sole leadership of Otto Beisheim, a rapid expansion of the Metro stores into the greater German and European area began in 1967 with the opening of the Metro stores in Godorf near Cologne, Hamburg, Munich and, after a connection with the Dutch company SHV Holdings, the first C&amp;C wholesale store (brand: Makro) in the Netherlands, and in 1968 in Düsseldorf.

In 2005, Metro split off the Praktiker home improvement division, which went public as an independent company.

In July 2006 Metro bought the 85 German stores of Wal-Mart, which gave up its loss-making Germany business. The Wal-Mart stores were largely integrated into the Real sales brand.

In July 2008, the Extra supermarket chain with around 250 locations and sales of around 1.6 billion euro, was sold to the Rewe Group. Metro sold the Adler fashion stores to the associated company BluO in February 2009.

In October 2012, Makro-Habib in Pakistan became Metro-Habib.

In November 2012, Metro sold its 91 Real hypermarkets in Poland, Romania, Russia and Ukraine to Auchan for 1.1 billion euro. In 2014 Metro sold the 12 Real hypermarkets in Turkey. In 2017 Metro sold the last remaining four Real hypermarkets in Romania.

On 15 June 2015, Metro AG agreed to sell Galeria Kaufhof to Canadian retail conglomerate Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for $3.2 billion.

On 30 March 2016, Metro Group announced that it would be splitting into two independent companies: A spin-off of the wholesale and food sector of Metro AG will be responsible for the group divisions into two independent and publicly listed companies. Both will have their own management, supervisory board and independent company profiles. Metro AG was renamed Ceconomy, comprising Media Markt and Saturn electronics stores, while a new company with the name Metro AG was formed, comprising Metro Cash &amp; Carry and Real.

In September 2018, Metro announced that it wanted to sell the Real hypermarket subsidiary in Germany to focus entirely on wholesale business. In February 2020, Real was sold to The SCP Group. The deal was completed in June 2020. With the acquisition of Johbeco AB and its subsidiary Johan i Hallen &amp; Bergfalk, a Swedish specialist supplier of meat, fish and seafood, for around 100 million euros in May 2023, Metro entered the Swedish and Finnish market.

== Controversies ==
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine which began on 24 February, many international, particularly Western companies pulled out of Russia. Unlike most of its Western competitors, Metro AG announced its intention to keep its business in Russia open, drawing criticism. Ukrainian government officials have called for a global boycott of the company. The Ukrainian office of MetroAG has allegedly been threatened by the company&#x27;s headquarters in Germany due to the Ukrainian branch openly calling for sanctions on Metro&#x27;s Russian branch. According to Ukrainian ex-minister Dmytro Dubilet the Ukrainian branch has received warnings to be disconnected from the centralized supply. In February 2023, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine included the company in the list of International Sponsors of War.


=== Metro on Russian market ===
Metro AG is Russia&#x27;s fourth-biggest retailer behind X5 PJPq.L, Magnit MGNTq.L and French chain Auchan. The company entered the market in 2001 with the opening of its first wholesale store in Moscow. Over the years, Metro AG has expanded its presence in the country, opening stores in several other cities, including Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. There are 97 stores in 65 cities across the country. In 2022, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 224 billion rubles.

On 22 March 2022, in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine, Metro AG published an official statement expressing solidarity with Ukraine and condemning the war. 

Currently, Metro AG is developing the integration of new projects in Russia, such as the establishment of the grocery stores chain &quot;Fasol&quot; and the acceptance of payments by &quot;Mir&quot; cards, a project initiated by &quot;Sberbank&quot; in response to sanctions. Furthermore, the investigation by the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) revealed that the key shareholder of Metro Cash &amp; Carry, Daniel Kretynski, controls EP Infrastructure (EPIF), which owns 49% of Eustream, the company that operates a gas transportation system from Russia to Central and Eastern Europe. This fact, combined with the company&#x27;s actions, led to Metro Cash &amp; Carry being added to the NACP&#x27;s list of international sponsors of war.

Metro AG&#x27;s latest quarterly financial results report, which was released on 8 February 2023, indicates a decrease in sales at the chain&#x27;s stores in Russia. The document states that the sales in local currency decreased by 14.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022–2023; adjusted EBITDA in Russia decreased to €60 million from €81 million in Q1 2021/2022.

==Former operations==
Metro sold in 2010, the Makro subsidiary in Morocco.

In 2012, Metro exited the United Kingdom market through the sale of its 30 Makro stores to Booker Group.

In 2014, Metro divested its Greece operations by selling 9 Makro stores to Sklavenitis.

In 2014, Metro exited Vietnam by signing an agreement to sell its local subsidiary, consisting of 19 stores, to the Thai group Berli Jucker for €665 million.

In December 2014, Metro exited the Denmark market. They had pioneered in-store delivery services nationally since opening their first store in 1971.

Egypt had a brief market foray in 2010 with two stores opening, but these were closed between 2013 and 2015.

In April 2020, Metro completed the sale of a majority stake in its Chinese joint venture to Wumei Technology Group for more than €1.5 billion. Metro retained a 20% ownership stake in the venture, which operates 97 wholesale centers across China.

In August 2021, Metro ceased operations in Japan, resulting in the closure of all its 10 stores within the country.

In September 2021, Metro announced it would end its supply business in Myanmar by the end of October 2021.

In 2022, Metro exited from Belgium through the bankruptcy of its local subsidiary, which operated stores under both the Metro and Makro brands. Notably, Belgium was the only country where Metro had stores under both brands, and it was also unique in allowing general access to its Makro network, typically reserved for business customers. Only Metro wholesale network stores that avoided bankruptcy were subsequently sold and reopened under the Sligro-M brand.

In 2023, their operations in India were sold to Reliance Retail.

==Metro name==
In 2012, in the face of an impending brand conflict, Microsoft renamed its Metro user interface of the Microsoft Windows 8 computer operating system (to Microsoft Design Language, or MDL).

<doc id="305890" wikidata="Q1946330" url="?curid=305890" title="Monthly Review">
<text>The Monthly Review is an independent socialist magazine published monthly in New York City. Established in 1949, the publication is the longest continuously published socialist magazine in the United States.

==History==
===Establishment===
Following the failure of the independent 1948 presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace, two former supporters of the Wallace effort met at the farm in New Hampshire where one of them was living. The two men were literary scholar and Christian socialist F.O. &quot;Matty&quot; Matthiessen and Marxist economist Paul Sweezy, who were former colleagues at Harvard University. Matthiessen came into an inheritance after his father died in an automobile accident in California and had no pressing need for the money. Matthiessen made the offer to Sweezy to underwrite &quot;that magazine [Sweezy] and Leo Huberman were always talking about,&quot; committing the sum of $5,000 per year for three years. Matthiessen&#x27;s funds made the launch of &quot;Monthly Review&quot; possible, although the amount of the seed money was reduced to $4,000 per year in the second and third years by the executors of Matthiessen&#x27;s estate following his suicide in 1950.

Although Matthiessen was the financial angel of the new publication, from the outset the editorial task was handled by Sweezy and his co-thinker, the left wing popular writer Leo Huberman. The author of an array of books and pamphlets during the 1930s and early 1940s, the New York University-educated Huberman worked full-time on &quot;Monthly Review&quot; from its establishment until his death of a heart attack in 1968.

Sweezy and Huberman were complementary figures guiding the publication, with Sweezy&#x27;s theoretical bent and writing ability put to use for a majority of the editorial content, while Huberman took charge of the business and administrative aspects of the enterprise. Sweezy remained at home in New Hampshire, traveling down to New York City once a month to read manuscripts, where Huberman conducted the day-to-day operations of the magazine along with his wife, Gerty Huberman, and family friend Sybil Huntington May.

Briefly joining Sweezy and Huberman as a third founding editor of &quot;Monthly Review&quot; — although not listed as such on the publication&#x27;s masthead — was German émigré Otto Nathan (1893–1987). Although his time of editorial association with the magazine was short, Nathan was instrumental in obtaining what would become a seminal essay for the magazine, a lead piece for the debut May 1949 issue by physicist Albert Einstein entitled &quot;Why Socialism?&quot;

Another key contributor during the first 15 years of &quot;Monthly Review&quot; was economist Paul Baran, frequently considered as the third member of an editorial troika including Sweezy and Huberman. A tenured professor at Stanford University, Baran was one of a very few self-identified Marxists to teach economics at American universities during the Cold War period. Baran worked closely with Sweezy on a book regarded as a landmark in Marxist theory entitled &quot;Monopoly Capital,&quot; although he died of a heart attack prior to the work&#x27;s first publication in 1966.

&quot;Monthly Review&quot; launched in 1949 with a circulation of just 450 copies, most of whom were personal acquaintances of either Huberman or Sweezy. The magazine&#x27;s ideology and readership closely paralleled that of the independent socialist weekly newspaper &quot;The National Guardian&quot;, established in 1948. Despite a conservative political climate in the United States, the magazine quickly reached a critical mass of subscribers, with its paid circulation rising to 2,500 in 1950 and to 6,000 in 1954.

===McCarthy period===
During the era of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, editors Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman were targeted for &quot;subversive activities&quot;. Sweezy&#x27;s case, tried by New Hampshire Attorney General, reached the Supreme Court and became a seminal case on freedom of speech when the Court ruled in his favor.

In 1953, the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; added veteran radical Scott Nearing to the magazine&#x27;s ranks. From that date and for nearly 20 years Nearing authored a column descriptively entitled &quot;World Events&quot;. During the Truman and Eisenhower years, many left-wing intellectuals found a space for their work in the magazine, including a number that would gain in stature in the ensuing liberalized decade, such as pacifist activist Staughton Lynd (1952), historian William Appleman Williams (1952), and sociologist C. Wright Mills (1958).

===New Left era and after===
From the middle years of the 1960s, radical political theory saw a resurgence in association with the emergence of a New Left in Europe and North America. &quot;Monthly Review&quot; grew in stature in tandem with this resurgence. While remaining an intellectual journal not oriented towards acquiring a mass readership, circulation of the publication nonetheless grew throughout this era, approaching 9,100 in 1970 before peaking at 11,500 in 1977.

While &quot;Monthly Review&quot; remained essentially a publication with roots in the so-called &quot;Old Left&quot;, it was not unsympathetic to the young radical movement which grew in conjunction with the Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to conscription and the Vietnam War. Among those associated with the 1960s New Left published by the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; were C. Wright Mills, Herbert Marcuse, Todd Gitlin, Carl Oglesby, David Horowitz, and Noam Chomsky.

The &quot;Monthly Review&quot; editorial staff was joined in May 1969 by radical economist Harry Magdoff, replacing Leo Huberman, who had died in 1968. Magdoff, a reader of the publication from its first issue in 1949, bolstered the already well-developed &quot;Third-Worldist&quot; orientation of the publication, based upon revolutionary events in Cuba, China, and Vietnam. Certain Maoist influence made itself felt in the content of the publication in this period.

&quot;Monthly Review&quot; became steadily more critical of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, with editor Paul Sweezy objecting to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the suppression of the Polish trade union &quot;Solidarity&quot; through martial law in 1981. In the latter case, Sweezy declared the incident had proved beyond doubt that &quot;the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc have become the expression and the guardians of a new rigidified hierarchical structure which has nothing in common with the kind of socialist society Marxists have always regarded as the goal of modern working class movements.&quot;

Despite an apparent decline of the American Left in the 1980s, &quot;Monthly Review&quot;″s circulation hovered in the 8,000 range throughout the decade.

Between 1997 and 2000, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; was co-edited by Ellen Meiksins Wood, Magdoff and Sweezy.

===Publication today===
Since 2006, John Bellamy Foster has been the publication&#x27;s editor. Brett Clark is the associate editor, and the magazine also has one assistant editor and an editorial committee.

&quot;Monthly Review&quot; continues to be published as a print magazine with 11 issues per year (one per month with July and August combined into a single, thematic issue). The print magazine primarily publishes original content, including full articles, book reviews, and poetry, with exceptions such as reprises or adaptations of previously published work identified as such. Everything published in the print journal since the launch of the magazine&#x27;s web site is available for free access, while archives going back to the journal&#x27;s inauguration in 1949 are available to subscribers. In addition to these articles, the website also hosts Monthly Review Press and MR Online.

==Political orientation==

From its first issue, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; attacked the premise that capitalism was capable of infinite growth through Keynesian macroeconomic fine-tuning. Instead, the magazine&#x27;s editors and leading writers have remained true to the traditional Marxist perspective that capitalist economies contain internal contradictions which will ultimately lead to their collapse and reconstitution on a new socialist basis. Topics of editorial concern have included poverty, unequal distribution of incomes and wealth.

Although not averse to discussion of esoteric matters of socialist theory, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; was generally characterized by an aversion to doctrinaire citations of Marxist canon in favor of the analysis of real-world economic and historical trends. Readability was emphasized and the use of academic jargon discouraged.

Editors Huberman and Sweezy argued as early as 1952 that massive and expanding military spending was an integral part of the process of capitalist stabilization, driving corporate profits, bolstering levels of employment, and absorbing surplus production. They argued the illusion of an external military threat was required to sustain this system of priorities in government spending; consequently, effort was made by the editors to challenge the dominant Cold War paradigm of &quot;Democracy versus Communism&quot; in the material published in the magazine.

In its editorial line &quot;Monthly Review&quot; offered critical support of the Soviet Union during its early years although over time the magazine became increasingly critical of Soviet dedication to Socialism in one country and peaceful coexistence, seeing that country as playing a more or less conservative role in a world marked by national revolutionary movements. After the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, Sweezy and Huberman soon came to see the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the actual center of the world revolutionary movement.

&quot;Monthly Review&quot; never aligned with any specific revolutionary movement or political organization. Many of its articles have been written by academics, journalists, and freelance public intellectuals, including Albert Einstein, Tariq Ali, Isabel Allende, Samir Amin, Julian Bond, Marilyn Buck, G. D. H. Cole, Bernardine Dohrn, W. E. B. Du Bois, Barbara Ehrenreich, Andre Gunder Frank, Eduardo Galeano, Che Guevara, Lorraine Hansberry, Edward S. Herman, Eric Hobsbawm, Michael Klare, Saul Landau, Michael Parenti, Robert W. McChesney, Ralph Miliband, Marge Piercy, Frances Fox Piven, Adrienne Rich, Jean-Paul Sartre, Daniel Singer, E. P. Thompson, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Raymond Williams.

In 2004, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; editor John Bellamy Foster told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The &quot;Monthly Review&quot;... was and is Marxist, but did not hew to the party line or get into sectarian struggles.&quot;

==MR Online==
From 2005 to 2016, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; published an associated website, &quot;MRzine&quot;. At its closure, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; announced that it would maintain an online archive of the site.

In 2017, MRzine was replaced by MR Online, which is described as &quot;a forum for collaboration and communication between radical activists, writers, and scholars around the world.&quot; The site frequently republishes online articles from other sites identified at the start of the post, and followed by a disclaimer by the editors indicating that &quot;&quot;Monthly Review&quot; does not necessarily adhere to all of the views conveyed in articles republished at MR Online. Our goal is to share a variety of left perspectives that we think our readers will find interesting or useful.&quot;

===Treatment of Uyghurs in China===
In 2020, MR Online republished the outline of a report by the Qiao Collective, a &quot;diaspora Chinese media collective challenging U.S. aggression on China,&quot; that disputed allegations of genocide and slavery in China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and suggested that &quot;the politicization of China’s anti-terrorism policies in Xinjiang is another front of the U.S.-led hybrid war on China&quot;. In response, a leftist organization named Critical China Scholars wrote an open letter to &quot;Monthly Review&quot; lamenting republication of the report on the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; web site. While the authors of the letter acknowledged that the &quot;applicability of terms such as &#x27;genocide&#x27; and &#x27;slavery&#x27; can be debated,&quot; they nonetheless contended that criticizing Western media for &quot;double standards&quot; by pointing out the contrast between harsh condemnation of Chinese human-rights violations in comparative silence or apologies for European and US violations, as well as suggesting that Chinese abuses were less severe than those by Western governments, amount to &quot; agnosticism, let alone denialism, towards what is clearly a shocking infringement on the rights of Xinjiang’s native peoples.&quot; After elaborating on these claims, the authors concluded their letter by expressing hopes that it too would be republished on MR Online, and directing readers to the Critical China Scholars web site. The lead author of the letter was David Brophy, a historian of China at the University of Sydney. Darren Byler, one of the signatories, said he hoped the letter would make it &quot;difficult for leftist &#x27;scholar-activists&#x27; to continue to promote Xinjiang-related disinformation.&quot;

==Monthly Review Press==
Monthly Review Press, an allied endeavor, was launched in 1951 in response to the inability of the maverick left-wing journalist I. F. Stone to otherwise find a publisher for his book &quot;The Hidden History of the Korean War&quot;. Stone&#x27;s work, which argued that the still ongoing Korean War was not a case of simple Communist military aggression but was rather the product of political isolation, South Korean military buildup, and border provocations, became the first title offered by the affiliated publisher in 1952. 

Harry Braverman (author of &quot;Labor and Monopoly Capital&quot;) became director of Monthly Review Press in 1967. The present director of the Press is Michael D. Yates (author of &quot;Naming the System&quot;).

<text> (Latin for &quot;With how great care&quot;) was a papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius IX on 8 December 1864. In it, he decried what he considered significant errors afflicting the modern age. These he listed in an attachment called the Syllabus of Errors, which condemned secularism and religious indifferentism.

==Context==

In August 1863, Count Charles Montalembert, a proponent of Liberal Catholicism gave a series of speeches in Mechelen, Belgium, in which he presented his view of the future of modern society and the Church. His first speech aimed to show the necessity of Christianizing the democracy by accepting modern liberties. His second speech dealt with liberty of conscience, and the conclusion he drew was that the Church could be in perfect harmony with religious liberty and with the modern state founded on that liberty, and that everyone is free to hold that the modern state is to be preferred to those which preceded it, such as Ancien Régime France. He received support from Engelbert Sterckx, Archbishop of Mechelen, and Félix Dupanloup, Bishop of Orléans. But Louis-Édouard-François-Desiré Pie, Bishop of Poitiers, the papal nuncio to Belgium Bishop Mieczysław Halka-Ledóchowski, and the Jesuits who edited the &quot;Civiltà Cattolica&quot; were alarmed at these declarations. At the end of March 1864, he received a letter from Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, Secretary of State, that criticized the Mechelen speeches.

&quot;Quanta cura&quot; was prompted by the September Convention of 1864 between the emerging Kingdom of Italy and the Second French Empire of Napoleon III. French troops had occupied Rome to prevent the Kingdom of Italy from capturing the city, defeating the Papal States, and completing the unification of the Italian Peninsula under its rule. Italians supporting the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; (unification) viewed the French troops as an occupying army, and in the 1864 Convention, France agreed to withdraw its military garrison from Rome to France in anticipation of war with Prussia.

Pius IX closed his encyclical with a plenary indulgence by declaring a Jubilee year for 1865.

==Opposition to unrestrained freedom of conscience==
Pius reaffirms his predecessor&#x27;s condemnation of liberty of conscience. In the 1832 encyclical &quot;Mirari Vos&quot;, Pope Gregory XVI deplored religious indifferentism which&quot;... gives rise to that absurd and erroneous proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must be maintained for everyone. It spreads ruin in sacred and civil affairs, …When all restraints are removed by which men are kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to evil, propels them to ruin... Thence comes transformation of minds, corruption of youths, contempt of sacred things and holy laws — in other words, a pestilence more deadly to the state than any other. Experience shows, even from earliest times, that cities renowned for wealth, dominion, and glory perished as a result of this single evil, namely immoderate freedom of opinion, license of free speech, and desire for novelty.

Pius IX&#x27;s 1864 encyclical specifically condemned the idea that:
==Propositions condemned==
&quot;Quanta cura&quot; also condemns several other propositions, notably:
* That &quot;the people’s will, manifested by what is called public opinion or in some other way, constitutes a supreme law, free from all divine and human control&quot;;
* That &quot;in the political order accomplished facts, from the very circumstance that they are accomplished, have the force of right.&quot;
* That &quot;that permission should be refused to citizens and to the Church, whereby they may openly give alms for the sake of Christian charity”;
* That laws should be abolished which require that “on certain fixed days servile works are prohibited because of God’s worship;”; 
* That &quot;on civil law alone depend all rights of parents over their children, and especially that of providing for education.”
* That “the Church’s laws do not bind in conscience unless when they are promulgated by the civil power;”
* That Religious orders have no legitimate reason for being permitted to exist.”

These propositions were aimed at anticlerical governments in various European countries, which were in the process of secularizing education (sometimes by taking over Catholic schools rather than starting their own competing public schools), and suppressing religious orders while confiscating their property. (Hales 1958)

==Subsequent commentary==
===John Henry Newman===
John Henry Newman comments on this passage in part 5 of his &quot;Letter to the Duke of Norfolk&quot; (1874), entitled &quot;Conscience&quot;, which precedes part 6, &quot;The Encyclical of 1864&quot;:&quot;And now I shall turn aside for a moment to show {251} how it is that the Popes of our century have been misunderstood by the English people, as if they really were speaking against conscience in the true sense of the word, when in fact they were speaking against it in the various false senses, philosophical or popular, which in this day are put upon the word. [...] Both Popes certainly scoff at the so-called &#x27;liberty of conscience,&#x27; but there is no scoffing of any Pope, in formal documents addressed to the faithful at large, at that most serious doctrine, the right and the duty of following that Divine Authority, the voice of conscience, on which in truth the Church herself is built.

So indeed it is; did the Pope speak against Conscience in the true sense of the word, he would commit a suicidal act. He would be cutting the ground from under his feet. His very mission is to proclaim the moral law, and to protect and strengthen that &#x27;Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world.&#x27; On the law of conscience and its sacredness are founded both his authority in theory and his power in fact. Whether this or that particular Pope in this bad world always kept {253} this great truth in view in all he did, it is for history to tell. I am considering here the Papacy in its office and its duties, and in reference to those who acknowledge its claims. They are not bound by the Pope&#x27;s personal character or private acts, but by his formal teaching. [...] The championship of the Moral Law and of conscience is his raison d&#x27;être. The fact of his mission is the answer to the complaints of those who feel the insufficiency of the natural light; and the insufficiency of that light is the justification of his mission. [...]

If, under the plea of his revealed prerogatives, he neglected his mission of preaching truth, justice, mercy, and peace, much more if he trampled on the consciences of his subjects,—if he had done so all along, as Protestants say, then he could not have lasted all these many centuries till now, so as to supply a mark for their reprobation. [...]

I wish to answer this important objection distinctly.

1. First, I am using the word &quot;conscience&quot; in the high sense in which I have already explained it,—not as a fancy or an opinion, but as a dutiful obedience to what claims to be a divine voice, speaking within us; and that this is the view properly to be taken of it, I shall not attempt to prove here, but shall assume it as a first principle. {256}

2. Secondly, I observe that conscience is not a judgment upon any speculative truth, any abstract doctrine, but bears immediately on conduct, on something to be done or not done. &quot;Conscience,&quot; says St. Thomas, &quot;is the practical judgment or dictate of reason, by which we judge what hic et nunc is to be done as being good, or to be avoided as evil.&quot; Hence conscience cannot come into direct collision with the Church&#x27;s or the Pope&#x27;s infallibility; which is engaged in general propositions, and in the condemnation of particular and given errors.&quot;

And on the condemnation of absolute freedom of speech, he wrote, after discussing the restrictions on freedom of speech and worship in English law (ibid, section 6):

&quot;But now let us see, on the other hand, what the proposition really is, the condemnation of which leads Gladstone] to say, that the Pope has unrestrictedly &#x27;condemned those who maintain the liberty of the Press, the liberty of conscience and of worship, and the liberty of speech,&#x27; p. 16,—has &quot;condemned free speech, free writing, and a free press,&quot; p. 42. The condemned proposition speaks as follows:—

&#x27;Liberty of conscience and worship, is the inherent right of all men. 2. It ought to be proclaimed in every rightly constituted society. 3. It is a right to all sorts of liberty (omnimodam libertatem) such, that it ought not to be restrained by any authority, ecclesiastical or civil, as far as public speaking, printing, or any other public manifestation of opinions is concerned.&#x27;

Now, is there any government on earth that could stand the strain of such a doctrine as this? It starts by taking for granted that there are certain Rights of man; Mr. Gladstone so considers, I believe; but other deep thinkers of the day are quite of another opinion; {274} however, if the doctrine of the proposition is true, then the right of conscience, of which it speaks, being inherent in man, is of universal force—that is, all over the world—also, says the proposition, it is a right which must be recognised by all rightly constituted governments. Lastly, what is the right of conscience thus inherent in our nature, thus necessary for all states? The proposition tells us. It is the liberty of every one to give public utterance, in every possible shape, by every possible channel, without any let or hindrance from God or man, to all his notions whatsoever [Note 2].

Which of the two in this matter is peremptory and sweeping in his utterance, the author of this thesis himself, or the Pope who has condemned what the other has uttered? Which of the two is it who would force upon the world a universal? All that the Pope has done is to deny a universal, and what a universal! a universal liberty to all men to say out whatever doctrines they may hold by preaching, or by the press, uncurbed by church or civil power. Does not this bear out what I said in the foregoing section of the sense in which Pope Gregory denied a &quot;liberty of conscience&quot;? It is a liberty of self-will. What if a man&#x27;s conscience embraces the duty of regicide? or infanticide? or free love?&quot;

===William George McCloskey===
Regarding the issues of civil control of education, and the separation of church and state, William George McCloskey first rector of the American College at Rome (and later Bishop of Louisville, Kentucky) observed wryly,It is consoling to think that Our Holy Father has in all his official acts a light of guidance from on High, for according to all the rules of mere human prudence and wisdom [Quanta cura] … would be considered ill-timed. It can hardly be doubted that it places us in a place of apparent antagonism, at least as far as our principles are concerned, to the [American] institutions under which we live -and affords a great pretext to the fanatics who are eager to get up a crusade against us. God knows what is best for His church.

==&quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;==
&quot;Quanta cura&quot; is remembered mostly because alongside it appeared the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, which condemns a number of political, religious, and philosophical ideas including liberalism, modernism, moral relativism, secularization, and religious freedom.

<doc id="305896" wikidata="Q3086917" url="?curid=305896" title="Vicente Lusitano">
<text>Vicente Lusitano () was a Portuguese composer and music theorist of the late Renaissance. Some of his works on musical theory and a small number of compositions survive. Lusitano was for a time a Catholic priest and taught in several Italian cities, but later converted to Protestantism.

He is believed to have been of mixed race. Since the 1980s, he has been described as the first published black composer.

==Life and career==
Lusitano, a Portuguese-language term for &quot;Portuguese&quot;, appears to be a descriptive nickname rather than a family name. Little is known of his life. He was born in Olivença, likely around 1520. Lusitano is described as &quot;pardo&quot;, a Portuguese term indicating he was of mixed European and non-European heritage. It has been suggested that his mother may have been of African descent. According to a manuscript by the 17th-century Portuguese critic Joao Franco Barreto, Lusitano came from Olivença, became a Catholic priest, and was employed as a teacher at Padua, Viterbo and Rome. His books and manuscripts of his musical compositions survive and are dated. Lusitano was in Rome by 1551. From the dedication of one of his first works, it has been suggested that Lusitano was a tutor to the Portuguese Lencastre family, who also arrived in Rome in 1551 as ambassador to the Papal court. By 1561 he had married, converted to Calvinist Protestantism, and traveled to Germany. There is no record of him after 1561.

In the 16th century, composers were usually employed by the Church, but there is no evidence that he held such a salaried post.

When he last appears in the historical record he was living in the Duchy of Württemberg.

==Music==
As a composer, Lusitano is known for his vocal works, including Latin motets and a madrigal. In several works he references Josquin des Prez, who had died 30 years earlier. For example, he reworked des Prez&#x27; motet &quot;Inviolata, integra&quot; for more voices.

His compositions, composed in (or about) the contrapuntal Renaissance style of his time and place, include:
* &quot;Heu me domine&quot;, a motet included in &quot;Tratado de canto de organo&quot; (ca. 1551; see below) 
* &quot;Liber primus epigramatum que vulgo motetta dicuntur&quot;, containing 23 motets for 5, 6, or 8 voices (Rome: Valerio &amp; Luigi Dorico, 1551)
* &quot;All’hor ch’ignuda d’herb’et fior la terra&quot;, a madrigal published in the anthology &quot;Il primo libro delle muse&quot; (Venice: Scotto, 1562)
* &quot; Beati omnes qui timent Dominum&quot;, a motet in a collective manuscript of motets and other sacred songs, compiled for the Stuttgart ducal court in 1562

Lusitano also wrote treatises. These are:
* An anonymous manuscript on the art of singing (ca. 1551), attributed to Lusitano on stylistic grounds, and published as &quot;Un tratado de canto de órgano (siglo XVI)&quot; in 1913.
* &quot;Introdvttione facilissima, et novissima, di Canto Fermo, Figvrato, Contrapon to semplice, et in concerto. Con Regole Generali per far fvghe differenti sopra il Canto Fermo, a ii, iii &amp; iiii. voci, &amp; compositioni, proportioni, generi. S. Diatonico, Cromotico, Enarmonico&quot; (Rome: Antonio Blado, 1553; Venice: Francesco Marcolini, 1558; Venice: Francesco Rampazetto, 1561). All three editions dedicated to Marc&#x27; Antonio Colonna, Duke of Marsi.This treatise was reportedly also translated into Portuguese by Bernardo da Fonseca (Lisbon, 1603).

Lusitano was notable during his lifetime for his work as a theorist. In a 1551 debate in Rome, he espoused traditional views on the role of the three genera in music (diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic) over more radical ones put forward by Nicola Vicentino. Lusitano was deemed to have won the debate and Vicentino was fined. In 1555 Vicentino published an account of the debate that was recognised as misleading. This went on to influence later composers and may be a factor in omission of Lusitano from subsequent works on early European composers. 

Lusitano&#x27;s &quot;Introduttione facilissima, et novissima, di canto fermo, figurato, contraponto semplice, et inconcerto&quot; (Rome, 1553, plus reprints), contains an introduction to music, his views on the three genera, and uniquely, a systematic section on creating improvised counterpoint by setting new parts above or below a cantus firmus). Musicologist Philippe Canguilhem stated that &quot;the significance of Lusitano’s writings is that they show how central improvised counterpoint was to everyday musical life during the Renaissance&quot;.

Lusitano&#x27;s music has been revived in recent years, for example by the Australian Chamber Choir in 2019 the Marian Consort in 2021 and Chineke! Voices in 2022. His motet &quot;Heu me Domine&quot; and 1562 madrigal &quot;All’hor ch’ignuda&quot; have been recorded.

== Reception ==
Up until the late 19th century, Lusitano was overlooked in English-language histories of music: sometimes omitted altogether, more often covered minimally. However, he has been studied by Portuguese musicologists like Maria Augusta Barbosa, who wrote a dissertation about him in 1977, originally in German and present until this day in Portuguese musicological investigation of the 16th century. Since the summer of 2020, when the Black Lives Matter movement re-ignited discussions about race in the United States, there has been a flurry of interest in Lusitano and his work. 

His works have been edited in modern editions by several Portuguese musicologists since at least 1952, when Manuel Joaquim first published Lusitano&#x27;s madrigal &quot;All&#x27;hor ch&#x27;ignuda d&#x27;herb et fior&quot; at Portuguese Journal &quot;Gazeta Musical&quot;, and has continued until our days with the modern publishing of motets like Regina coeli and Heu me Domine in 2012 by mpmp. In 2022, the music historian Joseph McHardy also made Lusitano&#x27;s scores accessible in modern editions on the Internet, which allowed dozens of non-Portuguese-speaking choirs to perform and record his music. Previous recordings includes the anthology &quot;Cançoes, Vilancicos, e Motettes Portugueses Séculos XVI-XVII&quot;, by Huelgas Ensemble, Sony Classics, 1994.

<text>George Lawrence Mikan Jr. (; June 18, 1924 – June 1, 2005), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot;, was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the , Mikan was one of the pioneers of professional basketball. Through his size and play, he redefined basketball as a game dominated in his day by &quot;big men&quot;. His prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and ability to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot all helped to change the game. He also used the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot.

Mikan had a highly successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships in nine seasons, an NBA All-Star Game MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He played in the first four NBA All-Star games and was a member of the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he prompted several significant rule changes in the NBA, including the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane—known as the &quot;Mikan Rule&quot;—and the creation of the shot clock.

After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league. He was instrumental in forming the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves expansion team. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA to increase the meager pensions of players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died of complications from chronic diabetes.

For his accomplishments, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959. He was also named to the 25th, 35th, 50th and 75th NBA anniversary teams.

==Early life==
Mikan was born on June 18, 1924, in Joliet, Illinois, to a Croatian father, Joseph, and a Lithuanian mother, Minnie, along with brothers Joe and Ed and sister Marie. His grandfather, Juraj (George) Mikan was born in Vivodina, Croatia, then part of Austria-Hungary, in or about 1874. Juraj emigrated to Braddock, Pennsylvania, in 1891, where he married another Croatian immigrant, Marija, in 1906 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. On October 17, 1907, Mikan&#x27;s father Joseph was born, and soon thereafter the family moved to Joliet, where they opened Mikan&#x27;s Tavern at the corner of Elsie Avenue and North Broadway.

As a boy, Mikan shattered one of his knees so badly that he was kept in bed for a year and a half. In 1938, Mikan attended the Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago and originally wanted to be a Catholic priest but later moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic. Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete. When Mikan entered Chicago&#x27;s DePaul University in 1942, he stood , weighed , moved awkwardly because of his frame, and wore thick glasses for his nearsightedness.

==College career==
While in high school, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer. Meyer saw potential in Mikan, who was bright and intelligent but was also clumsy and shy. Meyer&#x27;s thoughts were revolutionary for the time, when it was still believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. His workout routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.
Mikan dominated his peers from the start of his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) career at DePaul. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength and was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot. Mikan established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls. In addition, Mikan surprised the basketball world with his ability to goaltend, swatting balls in flight before they could reach the hoop. &quot;We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket,&quot; Mikan later recalled. &quot;When the other team took a shot, I&#x27;d just go up and tap it out.&quot; As a consequence, the NCAA (and later the NBA) outlawed touching a ball either after it had reached its apex in flight or after it had touched the backboard and had a chance of going in the hoop. Bob Kurland, a tall center for Oklahoma A&amp;M, was one of the few opposing NCAA centers to have any success against Mikan.

Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College Player of the Year in 1944 and 1945 and was an All-American basketball player three times. In 1945, he led DePaul to the NIT title, which at that time was more prestigious than the NCAA title. Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23.9 points per game in 1944–45 and 23.1 points per game in 1945–46. When DePaul won the 1945 NIT, Mikan was named Most Valuable Player for scoring 120 points in three games, including 53 points in a 97–53 win over Rhode Island.

==Professional career==
===Chicago American Gears (1946–1947)===

After the end of the 1945–46 college season, Mikan signed with the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League, a predecessor of the modern NBA. He played with the Gears for 25 games at the end of the 1946–47 NBL season, scoring 16.5 points per game as a rookie. Mikan led the Gears to a third-place finish at the 1946 World Professional Basketball Tournament, where he was named Most Valuable Player after scoring 100 points in five games. Mikan was also chosen for the All-NBL Team.

Before the start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Gears owner Maurice White pulled the team out of the league. White attempted to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America in which he owned all the teams. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White&#x27;s teams were distributed among the remaining NBL franchises via dispersal draft. The new Minneapolis Lakers were the successor franchise to the Detroit Gems, which had the NBL&#x27;s worst record at 4–40 and thus had the first pick in the dispersal draft, using the pick on Mikan. After several days of negotiations — Mikan was attending law school at DePaul and wanted to remain in Chicago — Mikan agreed to a contract with the Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.

===Minneapolis Lakers (1947–1954, 1956)===
In his first season with the Lakers, Mikan led the league in scoring with 1,195 points, becoming the only NBL player to score more than 1,000 points in an NBL season. Following the regular season, he was named the league&#x27;s MVP and the Lakers won the NBL title. In April 1948, he led the Lakers to victory in the World Professional Basketball Tournament, where he was named MVP after scoring a tournament-record 40 points against the New York Renaissance in the title-clinching game.

The following year, the Lakers and three other NBL franchises jumped to the fledgling Basketball Association of America. Mikan led the new league in scoring, and again set a single-season scoring record. The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitols in the 1949 BAA Finals.

In 1949, the BAA and NBL merged to form the NBA. The new league started the inaugural 1949–50 NBA season, featuring 17 teams, with the Lakers in the Central Division. Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title; After posting an impressive 51–17 record and storming through the playoffs, Mikan&#x27;s team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison made a 40-foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.
In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was dominant again, scoring a career-best 28.4 points per game in the regular season. He won another scoring crown and averaged 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was second only to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated in one of the most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them to shoot, the score remained 19–18 until the game&#x27;s end. The game is the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers&#x27; 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team&#x27;s points and setting an NBA all-time record. In the postseason, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.

In the 1951–52 NBA season, the NBA decided to widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet. As players could stay in the lane for only three seconds at a time, the widened lane forced big men like Mikan to position themselves further from the basket on offense. A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick, who regarded Mikan as his nemesis; the rule was dubbed &quot;The Mikan Rule&quot;. While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game, this output was less than his 27.4 points per game the previous season. Also, his field goal percentage sank from .428 to .385. He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game and logged 3.0 assists per game. Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season. On January 20, 1952, he scored a personal-best 61 points in a 91-81 double-overtime victory against the Rochester Royals. At the time, it was the second-best scoring performance in league history behind Joe Fulks&#x27; 63-point game in 1949. Mikan&#x27;s output more than doubled that of his teammates, who combined for 30 points. He also grabbed 36 rebounds, a record at the time. Later that season, the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks. This qualified as one of the strangest Finals series in NBA history, as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games. The Lakers&#x27; Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked, and the Knicks&#x27; Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Instead, the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp, dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory. Perpetually double-teamed by Knicks&#x27; Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin, Mikan was unable to assert himself, and the two teams split the first six games. In the only true home game, Game 7 in the Auditorium, the Lakers won 82–65 and edged the Knicks 4–3, winning the NBA title and earning themselves $7,500 to split amongst the team members.

During the 1952–53 NBA season, Mikan averaged 20.6 points per game, a career-high 14.4 rebounds per game, and 2.9 assists per game. His rebounding average was the highest in the league. In the 1953 NBA All-Star Game, Mikan had 22 points and 16 rebounds and won that game&#x27;s MVP Award. The Lakers made the 1953 NBA Finals and again defeated the Knicks 4–1.

In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, averaging 18.1 points, 14.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA title, giving the team its third-straight championship and fifth in six years. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69.

At the end of the 1953–54 season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: &quot;I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. I felt it was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball.&quot; Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career and often played through these injuries. Without Mikan, the Lakers made the playoffs, but were unable to reach the 1955 NBA Finals. In the middle of the 1955–56 NBA season, Mikan returned to the Lakers lineup. He played in 37 games, but his long absence had affected his play. He averaged only 10.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists, and the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs. At the end of the season, Mikan retired for good. His 10,156 points were a record at the time; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career. He was inducted into the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1959 and was declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press.

====Playoffs====
==Post-playing career==

In 1956, Mikan was the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Minnesota&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan&#x27;s 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash in on his life insurance.

Problems also arose in Mikan&#x27;s professional sports career. In the 1957–58 NBA season, Lakers coach John Kundla became general manager and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers. However, this was a failure, as the Lakers endured a 9–30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla. In one of the worst seasons in the team&#x27;s history, the Lakers finished the season with a 19–53 record. After this failure, Mikan successfully specialized in corporate and real estate law. He also purchased and renovated buildings in Minneapolis.

In 1967, Mikan returned to professional basketball by becoming the first commissioner of the upstart American Basketball Association, a rival league to the NBA. In order to lure basketball fans to his league, Mikan invented the league&#x27;s characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball, which he thought more patriotic, better suited for television, and more crowd-pleasing than the brown NBA ball. He also instituted a three-point line. Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969, but the league continued to operate until 1976.

In the mid-1980s, nearly 25 years after the Lakers had moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and after the ABA&#x27;s Minnesota Muskies and Minnesota Pipers had departed, Mikan headed a task force with the goal of returning professional basketball to Minneapolis. This bid was successful, leading to the inception of the new Minnesota Timberwolves franchise in the 1989–90 NBA season.

In 1994, Mikan became the part-owner and chairman of the board of the Chicago Cheetahs, a professional roller hockey team based in Chicago that played in Roller Hockey International. The franchise folded after its second season.

==Personal life, health, and death==
In 1947, Mikan married his wife, Patricia, and they remained together for 58 years until his death. The Mikans had six children: sons Larry, Terry, Patrick and Michael and daughters Trisha and Maureen. All his life, Mikan was universally seen as the prototypical &quot;gentle giant&quot;—tough and relentless on the court, but friendly and amicable in private life. He was also the older brother of Ed Mikan, who played basketball for DePaul, played in the BAA, and played for the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA.

In his later years, Mikan developed diabetes and failing kidneys. Eventually, his right leg was amputated below the knee due to his illness. When his medical insurance was cut off, Mikan found himself in severe financial difficulties. He fought a protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players&#x27; Union, protesting the $1,700/month pensions for players who had retired before 1965 (the start of the so-called &quot;big money era&quot;). According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union, this battle kept him going because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new collective bargaining agreement would finally vindicate his generation. In 2005, however, his condition worsened. Mikan died in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 1, 2005, of complications from diabetes and other ailments. His son Terry reported that his father had undergone dialysis three times a week for four hours at a time during the last five years of his life.

==Legacy==
Mikan&#x27;s death was widely mourned by the basketball world. His plight also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many felt that the players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in labor negotiations. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal paid for Mikan&#x27;s funeral, saying: &quot;Without number 99 [Mikan], there is no me.&quot; Before Game Five of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular.

Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of the modern age of basketball. He scored 11,764 points (an average of 22.6 per game) and averaged 13.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 520 NBL, BAA and NBA games. As a testament to his fierce playing style, he also led the league three times in personal fouls. Mikan retired as the NBA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer. He won seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an All-Star MVP trophy, and three scoring titles, and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press, Mikan was on the Helms Athletic Foundation all-time All-American team, chosen in a 1952 poll. He also made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was chosen as one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996. Mikan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in its inaugural 1959 class. Mikan&#x27;s impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill, which has become a staple exercise of &quot;big men&quot; in basketball. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA&#x27;s future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.
When superstar center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, Mikan appeared on a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover in November 1996 with O&#x27;Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The article called Abdul-Jabbar and Mikan the &quot;Lakers legends&quot; to whom O&#x27;Neal was compared. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot has graced the entrance to the Minnesota Timberwolves&#x27; Target Center. In addition, a banner in the Staples Center commemorates Mikan and his fellow Minneapolis Lakers. He is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in his hometown of Joliet, Illinois.

Mikan&#x27;s 1948 Bowman trading card was at one point the most expensive basketball card ever sold.

In October 2022, Mikan was inaugurated into the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame.

On October 30, 2022, the Lakers retired Mikan&#x27;s No. 99 jersey.

===Rule changes===
Mikan became so dominant that the NBA changed its rules of play in order to reduce his influence. The league widened the lane from six to twelve feet (&quot;The Mikan Rule&quot;). He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock. In the NCAA, his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending.

As an official, Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three-point line which was later adopted by the NBA; the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves; and the multi-colored ABA ball, which still lives on as the &quot;money ball&quot; in the NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest.

It collected a total of 80 propositions that the Pope considered to be current errors or heresies, pairing the briefest headings with references to the various documents where the actual teachings are found.

The documents referenced by the &quot;Syllabus&quot; were intended to be a rebuttal of liberalism, modernism, moral relativism, secularization, and the political emancipation of Europe from the tradition of Catholic monarchies but some relate to specific nations.

== Summary ==
A cover letter by Cardinal Antonelli notes that Pope Pius IX had ordered the creation of the list, in case some Bishops had not read all his recent allocutions, speeches or encyclicals.

The Syllabus is made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, presenting a list of &quot;condemned propositions&quot;. The Syllabus does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but cites the earlier document considering each subject.

The Syllabus is divided into ten sections on the following topics:
#pantheism, naturalism, and absolute rationalism, #1–7
#moderate rationalism, #8–14
#indifferentism and latitudinarianism, #15–18
#socialism, communism, secret societies, Bible societies, and liberal clerical societies, a general condemnation, unnumbered
#the Catholic Church and its rights, #19–38 (defending temporal power in the Papal States, overthrown six years later)
#civil society and its relationship to the Catholic Church, #39–55
#natural and Christian ethics, #56–64
#Christian marriage, #65–74
#the civil power of the pope in the Papal States, #75–76
#liberalism in every political form, #77–80.

=== Sources cited ===
The &quot;Syllabus&quot; cites a number of previous documents that had been written during Pius&#x27;s papacy. These include: &quot;Qui pluribus&quot;, &quot;Maxima quidem&quot;, &quot;Singulari quadam&quot;, &quot;Tuas libenter&quot;, &quot;Multiplices inter&quot;, &quot;Quanto conficiamur&quot;, &quot;Noscitis&quot;, &quot;Nostis et nobiscum&quot;, &quot;Meminit unusquisque&quot;, &quot;Ad Apostolicae&quot;, &quot;Nunquam fore&quot;, &quot;Incredibili&quot;, &quot;Acerbissimum&quot;, &quot;Singularis nobisque&quot;, &quot;Multis gravibusque&quot;, &quot;Quibus quantisque&quot;, &quot;Quibus luctuosissimis&quot;, &quot;In consistoriali&quot;, &quot;Cum non sine&quot;, &quot;Cum saepe&quot;, &quot;Quanto conficiamur&quot;, &quot;Jamdudum cernimus&quot;, &quot;Novos et ante&quot;, &quot;Quibusque vestrum&quot; and &quot;Cum catholica&quot;.

==Reactions==

===Non-Catholics===
In 1874, the British Leader of the Opposition William Gladstone published a tract entitled &quot;The Vatican Decrees in their bearing on Civil Allegiance: A Political Expostulation&quot;, in which he said that after the &quot;Syllabus&quot;

===Catholics===
Catholic apologists such as Félix Dupanloup and John Henry Newman said that the &quot;Syllabus&quot; was widely misinterpreted by readers who did not have access to, or did not bother to check, the original documents of which it was a summary. The propositions listed had been condemned as erroneous opinions &quot;in the sense and context in which they originally occurred&quot;; without the original context, the document appeared to condemn a larger range of ideas than it actually did. Thus, it was asserted that no critical response to the &quot;Syllabus&quot; could be valid, if it did not take into account the cited documents and their context. Newman wrote:

The Syllabus then has no dogmatic force; it addresses us, not in its separate portions, but as a whole, and is to be received from the Pope by an act of obedience, not of faith, that obedience being shown by having recourse to the original and authoritative documents, (Allocutions and the like,) to which the Syllabus pointedly refers. Moreover, when we turn to those documents, which are authoritative, we find the Syllabus cannot even be called an echo of the Apostolic Voice; for, in matters in which wording is so important, it is not an exact transcript of the words of the Pope, in its account of the errors condemned, just as would be natural in what is an index for reference.

As the English Catholic historian E. E. Y. Hales explained, concerning item #77: &quot;[T]he Pope is not concerned with a universal principle, but with the position in a particular state at a particular date. He is expressing his &#x27;wonder and distress&#x27; (no more) that in a Catholic country (Spain) it should be proposed to disestablish the Church and to place any and every religion upon a precisely equal footing. [...] Disestablishment and toleration were far from the normal practice of the day, whether in Protestant or in Catholic states.&quot; Newman points out that this item refers to the 26 July 1855 allocution &quot;Nemo vestrum&quot;. At this time, Spain had been in violation of its Concordat of 1851 with the Holy See (implemented 1855).

==Subsequent history==
In the 21 November 1873 encyclical, &quot;Etsi multa&quot; (&quot;On the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland&quot;), which is often appended to the Syllabus, Pius expresses further thoughts in the same vein. The Pope particularly condemned the recent rise of Spanish-style liberalism and anti-clericalism in South America, which shares the same tradition of hostility to granting religious toleration and allowing Classical Christian education rooted in the Trivium with mainstream Republicanism in France, for unleashing &quot;a ferocious war on the Church&quot;.

In 1907, &quot;Lamentabili sane exitu&quot; was promulgated, a &quot;Syllabus condemning the errors of the Modernists&quot;, being a list of errors made by Progressive scholars of biblical criticism.

<doc id="305909" wikidata="Q220192" url="?curid=305909" title="Zoolander">
<text>Zoolander is a 2001 American comedy film directed by and starring Ben Stiller. The film contains elements from a pair of short films directed by Russell Bates and written by Drake Sather and Stiller for the &quot;VH1 Fashion Awards&quot; television specials in 1996 and 1997. It is the last film from Paramount Pictures with the involvement of Village Roadshow Pictures.

A satire on the fashion industry, the film follows fashion model Derek Zoolander (Stiller) who is tricked by fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu (Ferrell) into assassinating the Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose progressive laws on the fashion industry would harm his businesses. The film received generally positive reviews and was a box-office success. A sequel, &quot;Zoolander 2&quot;, was released in February 2016. An animated film, &quot;&quot;, was released on Netflix in the UK in August 2016.

== Plot ==

In New York City, male model Derek Zoolander is at a low point; he is ousted as the top male fashion model by rising star Hansel McDonald, his roommates and colleagues are killed in a &quot;freak gasoline-fight accident&quot;, and an attempt to reconnect with his southern New Jersey working-class relatives ends with the family rejecting him. Meanwhile, fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu and Derek&#x27;s agent Maury Ballstein are charged by the fashion industry with finding a model who can be brainwashed into assassinating the new progressive-leaning Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose policies will prohibit them from retaining cheap child labor in the country. Mugatu hires Derek, whom he had never worked with, to star in the next runway show for his brainwashing plan. It involves Derek being conditioned to attempt the assassination when the song &quot;Relax&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood is played.

Journalist Matilda Jeffries, feeling responsible for Derek&#x27;s downfall as she wrote a scathing &quot;Time&quot; article about him, becomes suspicious of Mugatu&#x27;s offer. She tells her concerns to Derek, but he ignores her. After receiving info through calls from former hand model J.P. Prewett, Matilda and Derek meet him in a cemetery. Prewett reveals that the fashion industry has been behind several of history&#x27;s political assassinations, including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, and the brainwashed models are soon killed after they have completed their task. Mugatu&#x27;s cronies attack the group, forcing Derek and Matilda to flee. They go to Hansel&#x27;s home, the last place they believe Mugatu will think to look. Derek, Hansel and Matilda bond, the two male models resolving their differences while partaking of Hansel&#x27;s collection of narcotics and participating in group sex with Matilda and others. Derek and Hansel break into Maury&#x27;s office to find evidence of the assassination plot, but they cannot operate his computer to find them.

Derek goes to the runway and Mugatu&#x27;s DJ plays a remix version of &quot;Relax&quot;. This activates Derek&#x27;s mental programming, only for it to stop after Hansel breaks into the DJ booth and shuts off the turntable. After Hansel smashes the computer on the floor (since he took Matilda saying the incriminating files were &quot;in the computer&quot; literally), a guilt-ridden Maury admits to the conspiracy. Mugatu then attempts to kill the Prime Minister himself by throwing a shuriken at him, but Derek stops it by unleashing his ultimate model look, &quot;Magnum&quot;. In Derek&#x27;s rural hometown, his father Larry watches the event on television and proudly acknowledges Derek as his son while Mugatu is arrested. A few years later, Derek, Hansel and Maury start &quot;The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can&#x27;t Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too&quot;. Derek and Matilda have a son named Derek Zoolander Jr., who has already developed his first modeling look.

== Cast ==
David Bowie and Billy Zane made prominent cameos as themselves, with Bowie acting as judge for a &quot;walk-off&quot; and Zane appearing as a friend of Derek. Comedian Godfrey and Taj Crown appear as janitor disguises for Derek and Hansel, respectively. Also making cameos were Lance Bass, Tyson Beckford, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Stephen Dorff, Shavo Odadjian, Fred Durst, Tom Ford, Cuba Gooding Jr., Fabio Lanzoni, Theo Kogan, Lukas Haas, Tommy Hilfiger, Paris Hilton, Carmen Kass, Heidi Klum, Lenny Kravitz, Karl Lagerfeld, Lil&#x27; Kim, James Marsden, Anne Meara, Natalie Portman, Frankie Rayder, Mark Ronson, Gavin Rossdale, Winona Ryder, Garry Shandling, Christian Slater, Gwen Stefani, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Donatella Versace, Sandra Bernhard, Amanda Lepore, Peter Dinklage and Veronica Webb.

== Production ==
===Development===
Ben Stiller first created the character for a skit at the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards. The name &quot;Derek Zoolander&quot; was invented by Bates while he was editing the first short film and was inspired by the names of two male models who both worked for Calvin Klein: the Dutchman Mark Vanderloo and the American Johnny Zander.

===Casting===
Owen Wilson was Stiller&#x27;s first choice for the role of Hansel but it was uncertain if he would be available and auditions were held. Jake Gyllenhaal auditioned for the role. Andy Dick was going to play Mugatu, but was unavailable due to a previous commitment to the TV show &quot;Go Fish&quot;. Stiller had originally intended to play Derek&#x27;s agent Maury as well, but was already set to play the lead role and direct the film, leading him to cast his father Jerry Stiller as Maury instead.

David Bowie appeared as himself as the judge of the walk-off scene, filming his cameo in September 2000. He later stated, &quot;It was just too funny a script to walk past. An absolute hoot!&quot; With his entrance accompanied by a freeze-frame and a snippet of his song &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983), biographer Nicholas Pegg describes Bowie&#x27;s appearance as &quot;willingly sending up the media&#x27;s image of him as the ultimate arbiter of cool.&quot;

=== Filming ===
The opening scenes were filmed at the real life 2000 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards during commercial breaks.

&quot;Derelicte&quot; is the name given to the fashion line designed by Mugatu and is a parody of a real fashion line created by John Galliano in 2000. It is described by Mugatu in the film as &quot;a fashion, a way of life inspired by the very homeless, the vagrants, the crack whores that make this wonderful city so unique.&quot; The fashion line in the film consists of clothing made from everyday objects that could be found on the streets of New York. Galliano used clothing worn by the destitute as an inspiration for a real-life fashion line in 2000.

During the scene in which David Duchovny, as J.P. Prewett, explains the conspiracy to Derek, he finishes answering Derek&#x27;s original question &quot;Why male models?&quot; only for Stiller, in character, to ask again, &quot;But why male models?&quot; Stiller improvised this line because he had forgotten what he was actually supposed to say, but Duchovny allowed it, replying in character, &quot;You serious? I just... I just told you that a moment ago.&quot;

The original ending to the film would have entailed Derek getting fatally struck by a train and ascending to heaven, but the idea was scrapped as the producers feared they could not fit it into the film&#x27;s original budget.

=== Censorship ===
&quot;Zoolander&quot; was never shown in Malaysia, as the film depicts an attempted assassination of the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysia&#x27;s censorship board deemed it &quot;definitely unsuitable&quot;. The film was also banned in neighboring Singapore due to &quot;controversial elements&quot; according to the country&#x27;s Board of Film Censors. It was subsequently made available in Singapore in 2006, with an NC-16 rating. In the United States, the film was originally rated R for its sexual content, profanity and drug references, but was later re-rated PG-13 on appeal.

In the Asian release, all references to the country of Malaysia were changed to Micronesia, the subregion which Hansel mistook for Malaysia at one point in the western version.

In the United States, since the film was released on September 28, 2001 (about two weeks after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center), Stiller made the executive decision to digitally remove any backgrounds that originally contained the Twin Towers in the background skyline. Stiller defended his decision to erase images of New York&#x27;s World Trade Center Towers from the film, saying he did what he thought was appropriate at the time. The Twin Towers were later restored for the 2016 Blu-ray release.

=== Accusations of plagiarism ===
&quot;Glamorama&quot;, a 1998 satirical novel by Bret Easton Ellis, tells the story of a vacuous male model who becomes involved in a plot concocted by international terrorists who recruit from within the fashion industry. In 2005, Ellis stated that he was aware of the similarities between &quot;Zoolander&quot; and &quot;Glamorama&quot; and said that he attempted to take legal action. Ellis was later asked about the similarities in a 2009 BBC interview but said that he is unable to discuss the topic due to an out-of-court settlement.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Zoolander&quot; earned $15.5 million during its opening weekend, ranking in second place behind &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot;. It grossed $45.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and $15.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $60.8 million against a budget of $28 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A wacky satire on the fashion industry, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is one of those deliberately dumb comedies that can deliver genuine laughs.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Reviews appreciated &quot;Zoolander&quot; as an escapist, upbeat satire on New York fashion. BBC film critic Nev Pierce labeled it &quot;sharply observed&quot;, specifically with its parody magazine covers and dialogue.

Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt the film mostly achieved the difficult goal of being &quot;silly and smart&quot; at the same time. Its humor, however, was generally considered hit-and-miss. Honeycutt wrote it had both predictable &quot;low-grade gags&quot; and &quot;weirdly hip and even witty ones&quot;. Pierce thought &quot;the frenetic buffoonery does score several big laughs&quot; but could take time for some viewers to adapt to, such as in the first hour, &quot;where several jokes fail to click and Ferrell&#x27;s camp villainy simply grates&quot;.

Some reviews criticized the incorporation of child labor law themes; Roger Ebert criticized the portrayal as insensitive. McCarthy, while finding the assassin subplot clever, also found it too serious for the comical vibe.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the performances and highlighted its many cameos. He called Stiller&#x27;s performance &quot;constantly amusing&quot; if overplaying his &quot;look&quot; a little, but stated &quot;the character&#x27;s intentional superficiality wears a little thin at feature length&quot;. The journalist exclaimed Wilson &quot;gets far more comic mileage than one could have imagined possible overlaying ruthless careerism with an affably vacant grunge/Eastern veneer&quot;. Pierce wrote how the actors contributed to the film&#x27;s style; he argued that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;impeccable timing in the climax elevates the sometimes bizarre material to moments that border comedy genius&quot; and that the use of cameos &quot;lends an air of authenticity to the idiocy&quot;.

Although praising the production design, costumes and choice of pop songs, Todd McCarthy felt the film did not have &quot;truly confident visual stylization&quot; to make comic book-esque villains like Mugatu enjoyable, and that long conversations were not fluidly written and edited. He also went after the removal of the Twin Towers as &quot;disruptive&quot; and offending the audience&#x27;s intelligence.

Roger Ebert added that &quot;to some degree, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is a victim of bad timing&quot;, referencing the film&#x27;s release two weeks after September 11, 2001 and the presidential assassination plot point which he found to be in bad taste. He found some parts of the film funny and gave it a rating of one star out of four. According to Stiller, years later in private, Ebert admitted that he had changed his mind and now thought that the film was funny and apologized to him for going &quot;overboard&quot;.

The film received votes from two critics at the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;&#x27;s poll of the greatest films of all time.

Fashion journalist Hadley Freeman categorized &quot;Zoolander&quot; as unique to other mainstream fashion films such as &quot;Designing Woman&quot; (1957), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006); whereas these films usually employ the same critiques of unintelligent models, silly clothing and insipid business practices, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is much more surreal in how it puts these cliches together, as shown in its premise of male models being hypnotized to kill a prime minister.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack to &quot;Zoolander&quot; was released on September 25, 2001.

The Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister remix of David Holmes&#x27; song &quot;Gone&quot; is in the movie when Zoolander is in the day spa, shortly before his brainwashing.

== Sequel ==

In December 2008, Stiller confirmed that he intended to make a sequel to &quot;Zoolander&quot;, and by January 2011, a script had been completed. Filming commenced at Cinecittà studios in Rome in early 2015, and on March 10, Stiller and Wilson appeared at the Paris Fashion Week in character as Derek Zoolander and Hansel McDonald. &quot;Zoolander 2&quot; was released on February 12, 2016. Unlike its predecessor, it received generally negative reviews.

An animated film, &quot;&quot;, was released on Netflix UK in August 2016.

== Legacy ==
In late 2022, the film went viral on the short-form video hosting service, TikTok. The trend used clips of scenes featuring Stiller and Wilson, creating a renewed interest in the movie.

<text>Eduardo Hughes Galeano (; 3 September 1940 – 13 April 2015) was a Uruguayan journalist, writer and novelist considered, among other things, &quot;a literary giant of the Latin American left&quot; and &quot;global soccer&#x27;s pre-eminent man of letters&quot;.

Galeano&#x27;s best-known works are &quot;Las venas abiertas de América Latina&quot; (&quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot;, 1971) and &quot;Memoria del fuego&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 19826). &quot;I&#x27;m a writer,&quot; the author once said of himself, &quot;obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia.&quot;

Author Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano&#x27;s book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called &quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot; &quot;a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.&quot;

==Life==
Eduardo Germán María Hughes Galeano was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 3 September 1940. His two family names were inherited from Welsh and Italian (from Genoa) great-grandfathers; the other two were from Germany and Spain. Galeano wrote under his maternal family name; as a young man, he briefly wrote for a Uruguayan socialist publication, &quot;El Sol&quot;, signing articles as &quot;Gius,&quot; &quot;a pseudonym approximating the pronunciation in Spanish of his paternal surname Hughes.&quot; Galeano&#x27;s family belonged to the fallen Uruguayan aristocracy.

After completing two years of secondary school, Galeano went to work at age fourteen in various jobs, including messenger and fare collector. He eventually landed at El Sol. The Uruguayan socialist weekly first published the teenager&#x27;s comics prior to his writing. Galeano&#x27;s passion for drawing continued throughout his life; his vignettes can be seen in many of his later books while his signature was often accompanied by a small hand-drawn pig. As a journalist throughout the 1960s Galeano rose in prominence among leftist publications, and became editor of &quot;Marcha&quot;, an influential weekly with contributors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Mario Benedetti, Manuel Maldonado Denis and Roberto Fernández Retamar. For two years he edited the daily &quot;Época&quot; and worked as editor-in-chief of the University Press. In 1959 he married his first wife, Silvia Brando, and in 1962, having divorced, he remarried to Graciela Berro.

In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay; Galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee, going into exile in Argentina where he founded the magazine &quot;Crisis&quot;. His 1971 book &quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot; was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina. In 1976 he married for the third time to Helena Villagra; however, in the same year, the Videla regime took power in Argentina in a bloody military coup and his name was added to the list of those condemned by the death squads. He fled again, this time to Spain, where he wrote his famous trilogy, &quot;Memoria del fuego&quot; (&quot;Memory of Fire&quot;), described as &quot;the most powerful literary indictment of colonialism in the Americas.&quot;
At the beginning of 1985 Galeano returned to Montevideo when democratization occurred. Following the victory of Tabaré Vázquez and the Broad Front alliance in the 2004 Uruguayan elections marking the first left-wing government in Uruguayan history Galeano wrote a piece for &quot;The Progressive&quot; titled &quot;Where the People Voted Against Fear&quot; in which Galeano showed support for the new government and concluded that the Uruguayan populace used &quot;common sense&quot; and were &quot;tired of being cheated&quot; by the traditional Colorado and Blanco parties. Following the creation of TeleSUR, a Latin American television station based in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2005 Galeano along with other left-wing intellectuals such as Tariq Ali and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel joined the network&#x27;s 36 member advisory committee.

On 10 February 2007, Galeano underwent a successful operation to treat lung cancer. During an interview with journalist Amy Goodman following Barack Obama&#x27;s election as President of the United States in November 2008, Galeano said: &quot;The White House will be Barack Obama&#x27;s house in the time coming, but this White House was built by black slaves. And I&#x27;d like, I hope, that he never, never forgets this.&quot; At the 17 April 2009 opening session of the 5th Summit of the Americas held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez gave a Spanish-language copy of Galeano&#x27;s &quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot; to U.S. President Barack Obama, who was making his first diplomatic visit to the region.

In a May 2009 interview he spoke about his past and recent works, some of which deal with the relationships between freedom and slavery, and democracies and dictatorships: &quot;not only the United States, also some European countries, have spread military dictatorships all over the world. And they feel as if they are able to teach democracy&quot;. He also talked about how and why he has changed his writing style, and his recent rise in popularity.

In April 2014 Galeano gave an interview at the &quot;II Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura&quot; in which he regretted some aspects of the writing style in &quot;Las Venas Abiertas de América Latina&quot;, saying &quot;Time has passed, I&#x27;ve begun to try other things, to bring myself closer to human reality in general and to political economy specifically. &#x27;The Open Veins&#x27; tried to be a political economy book, but I simply didn&#x27;t have the necessary education. I do not regret writing it, but it is a stage that I have since passed.&quot; This interview was picked up by many critics of Galeano&#x27;s work in which they used the statement to reinforce their own criticisms. However, in an interview with Jorge Majfud he said, &quot;The book, written ages ago, is still alive and kicking. I am simply honest enough to admit that at this point in my life the old writing style seems rather stodgy, and that it&#x27;s hard for me to recognize myself in it since I now prefer to be increasingly brief and untrammeled. [The] voices that have been raised against me and against &quot;The Open Veins of Latin America&quot; are seriously ill with bad faith.&quot;

==Works==

* 

&quot;Las venas abiertas de América Latina&quot; (&quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot;), a history of the region from the time of Columbus from the perspective of the subjugated people, is considered one of Galeano&#x27;s best-known works. An English-language translation by Cedric Belfrage gained some popularity in the English-speaking world after Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez gave it as a gift to U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009. Decades after its first publication, Galeano disavowed certain aspects of the book while still upholding many ideas embodied in it.

Galeano was also an avid fan of football, writing most notably about it in &quot;Football in Sun and Shadow&quot; (&quot;El fútbol a sol y sombra&quot;). In a retrospective for SB Nation after Galeano&#x27;s death, football writer Andi Thomas described the work—a history of the sport, as well as an outlet for the author&#x27;s own experiences with the sport and his political polemics—as &quot;one of the greatest books about football ever written&quot;.

==Death==
Galeano died on 13 April 2015 in Montevideo from lung cancer at the age of 74, survived by third wife Helena Villagra and three children.

<text>Charles Welles Rosen (May 5, 1927December 9, 2012) was an American pianist and writer on music. He is remembered for his career as a concert pianist, for his recordings, and for his many writings, notable among them the book &quot;The Classical Style&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== Youth and education ===
Charles Rosen was born in New York City on May 5, 1927, to a Russian-Jewish immigrant couple, Irwin Rosen, an architect, and Anita Rosen ( Gerber), a semiprofessional actress and amateur pianist.

Charles began his musical studies at age 4 and at age 6 enrolled in the Juilliard School. At age 11 he left Juilliard to study piano with Moriz Rosenthal, and with Rosenthal&#x27;s wife, Hedwig Kanner. Rosenthal, born in 1862, had been a student of Franz Liszt. Rosenthal&#x27;s memories of the 19th century in classical music were communicated to his pupil and appear frequently in Rosen&#x27;s later writings. (For instance, in &quot;Critical Entertainments&quot;, Rosen offers a memory from Rosenthal concerning how Brahms performed on the piano; specifically that he &quot;rolled&quot; chords upward, starting with the bass note.) Every year from the ages of three to twelve, Rosen heard Josef Hofmann play, and he later suggested that Hofmann had a greater influence on him than Rosenthal.

Rosen&#x27;s family background was not a wealthy one. &quot;The Guardian&quot; editor Nicholas Wroe interviewed Rosen in his old age, and reported:
His father had lost his job during the depression and &quot;things were pretty tough for a while&quot;. The family moved from Washington Heights to a ho[me] in the then less fashionable Upper West Side, where Rosen still lives. Because money was so short Rosen&#x27;s parents arranged a contract with the Rosenthals not to pay them for Charles&#x27;s tuition, but instead to give them 15% of his earnings as a pianist until the age of 21. &quot;As I didn&#x27;t make my debut in New York until I was 23, it was not a very satisfactory deal. But when I made my first recording I took some money to Hedwig [Kanner] Rosenthal, who was very surprised because she had been teaching me for 13 or 14 years at that stage.&quot;
At age 17, Rosen enrolled at Princeton University, where he studied French, and also took courses in mathematics and philosophy. When he graduated in 1947, he was offered a fellowship of $2,000 to continue at Princeton in the French graduate program. He completed a PhD in 1951 with a dissertation on the poetry of Jean de La Fontaine under E.B.O. Borgerhoff. While in graduate school he roomed with his fellow student Michael Steinberg, who also went on to become a classical-music critic and renowned scholar in his own right. On a Fulbright fellowship, Rosen then went to Paris to continue to examine the relationship between poetry and music in sixteenth-century France.

Rosen attained his status as a musical scholar with very little classroom training. Although the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; refers to him as a student of the musicologist Oliver Strunk, Rosen never formally studied musicology with Strunk or anyone else. Rosen&#x27;s extensive knowledge of music appears to have arisen partly from a culturally rich family background, and partly from reading. As Wroe reported:

Through the Rosenthals, Rosen was connected to the New York musical scene. ... [He] says that by the time he went to Princeton, he knew all the music department socially. &quot;So that made me too proud to take a degree in music, which I thought would be too easy. I sound like a snotty bastard, which I might have been, but I really did know more music as an undergraduate than the postgraduate students.&quot;

Ivan Hewett suggests that a major temptation of Rosen&#x27;s 1947 fellowship offer was that it offered him time to practice and to read extensively in the Princeton library.

=== Launching his musical career ===
The year 1951 was a busy one for Rosen: he completed his French Literature Ph.D., gave his first piano recital, and made his first recordings, of works by Martinu and Haydn. His career as a pianist made progress only slowly at first, and he traveled to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship to study the relationship between poetry and music in 16th-century France. In 1953 he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach French. He described this period to Nicholas Wroe:
I suppose I could have stayed on as an academic, but I never intended to do anything but play the piano. The only time I taught was when my playing would only support me for half a year, but I could only get a full-time job. So I taught French at MIT Monday to Wednesday, but Thursday through Sunday I was a pianist. In 1955, after two years there, I got an offer from Columbia Artists Management and so I resigned.

The Columbia offer initiated his successful career as a concert pianist: Rosen appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral engagements around the world. Musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed his pianism as follows:
As a pianist, Rosen is intense, severe and intellectual. His playing of Brahms and Schumann has been criticized for lack of expressive warmth; in music earlier and later he has won consistent praise. His performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; is remarkable for its clarity, its vitality and its structural grasp; he has also recorded &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; in performances of exceptional lucidity of texture. His Beethoven playing (he specializes in the late sonatas, particularly the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;) is notable for its powerful rhythms and its unremitting intellectual force. In Debussy his attention is focussed rather on structural detail than on sensuous beauty. He is a distinguished interpreter of Schoenberg and Webern.

Rosen made a large number of recordings, including recording various 20th century works at the invitation of their composers:

* Igor Stravinsky: Movements for Piano and Orchestra
* Elliott Carter: Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras
* Pierre Boulez: complete works for piano

In 1955, he recorded six Scarlatti&#x27;s sonatas and Mozart&#x27;s sonata K. 333 on the historical Siena Piano.

His recordings include earlier literature such as Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Études&quot; (1958), Schumann&#x27;s works for solo piano, Beethoven&#x27;s late sonatas and &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; and &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

=== Career as a writer and teacher ===
Rosen&#x27;s career as an author and scholar began only when he had passed the age of 40. Nicholas Wroe narrates how he started writing:
Rosen released his first Chopin recording in 1960. It included one of the late nocturnes, opus 62 no 1 ... Rosen says he wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with the recording, but he was even more disappointed with the sleeve note, which described the nocturne as &quot;staggering drunken with the odour of flowers&quot;. &quot;I had many thoughts about the piece,&quot; he says. &quot;That was not one of them. So I started writing the sleeve notes myself. People liked them and after a while a publisher took me to lunch. Before he even offered me a drink he said he would publish whatever I&#x27;d like to write. Eventually it led to many books and articles. But to begin with I wrote just to keep nonsense off my record sleeves.&quot;

In 1970 Rosen wrote his first column for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;—a scathing review of the then-current edition of the &quot;Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot;. His association with the magazine continued for the rest of his life. A number of his books collect essays and reviews he wrote for the &quot;Review&quot;.

In 1971, Rosen published his first and most famous book, &quot;The Classical Style&quot;. This work was highly successful, winning a National Book Award; and initiated a long series of books.

At various points in his career Rosen took positions as a university professor. His early stint teaching French at MIT is mentioned above. His later teaching was in music, in part-time or visiting positions offered to Rosen after he had achieved fame in his scholarly work. At Harvard University he held the Charles Eliot Norton Chair of Poetics in 1980/1981; the public lectures he gave there served as the basis of &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot;. He taught one academic quarter per year at the University of Chicago from 1985 to 1996. He taught at Stony Brook University starting 1971, the University of Oxford (1988) and the Royal Northern College of Music.

Even after the scholarly phase of his career had set in, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life.

He gave his last lecture on April 18, 2012 in the series Music in 21st-Century Society, at the Barry S. Brook Center for Music Research and Documentation of the CUNY Graduate Center.

Rosen died of cancer on December 9, 2012, in New York City, aged 85. His collection of scores and manuscripts was donated to the Music Department of the Graduate Center, City University of New York.

== Books and other writings ==
Rosen was the author of many acclaimed books about music, among them:

* &quot;The Classical Style&quot; (1971), his most famous work, which analyzes the nature and evolution of the style of the Classical period as it was developed by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Rosen revised the work in 1997, leaving most of the text intact but adding a second chapter on Beethoven and a preface addressing comments on the first edition.
* &quot;Sonata Forms&quot; (1980), which is in some ways a follow-up to &quot;The Classical Style&quot;, is an intensive analysis of the primary musical form used in the classical era. Rosen wrote the work when his intended contribution to the New Grove on sonata form was rejected by the editors; he enlarged the article he had written into book form.
* &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot; (1995), which is centered on the early generation of Romantic composers, including Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Berlioz.
* &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonatas: A Short Companion&quot; (2001), which gives general background on these famous works as well as sonata-by-sonata advice for performers.
* &quot;Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New&quot; (2001), a compilation of essays originally published in magazines and scholarly journals, mostly &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. It covers a variety of topics, including Oliver Strunk; the work of various composers; the status of contemporary music, and the &quot;New Musicology&quot;.
* &quot;Piano Notes: The World of the Pianist&quot; (2002), an account of the concert pianist&#x27;s world, addressed to the general reader. It covers piano technique, the instrument itself, the culture of piano performance, and the repertoire for the instrument.
* &quot;Schubert&#x27;s inflections of Classical form&quot;, a chapter of the &quot;Cambridge Companion to Schubert.&quot;

Rosen also published in other areas of the humanities: &quot;Romanticism and Realism: The Mythology of Nineteenth-Century Art&quot;, and &quot;Romantic Poets, Critics, and Other Madmen&quot;.

=== Aspects of Rosen&#x27;s writing ===
In the introduction to &quot;Critical Entertainments&quot;, Rosen stated that his main goal in writing about music was &quot;to increase the listener&#x27;s engagement with the music&quot;. Alluding to the unhappy sleeve note for Chopin&#x27;s nocturne opus 62 no 1 mentioned above, he wrote:
A Chopin recording I made ... had some notes that quoted James Huneker on one of the late nocturnes, which claimed that it &quot;staggered drunken with the odor of flowers.&quot; This was not my view of the work ... Huneker&#x27;s style is an invitation to the listener to dream, to dissipate attention into reverie. The writing about music that I prefer – and the performances of it, as well – fix and intensify the listener&#x27;s attention. When I hear music, I prefer to lose myself in it, not drift outside in my own personal world with the music as a decorative and distant background.

In pursuing this goal, Rosen often appealed to technical aspects of musical description, including the theories of harmony and musical form. In a &quot;New Yorker&quot; blog post, Jeremy Denk rhapsodically describes this aspect of Rosen&#x27;s work:
My favorite, life-changing parts of &quot;The Classical Style&quot; are the blow-by-blow accounts of great passages of music in the wonkiest of terms. He delves into the exposition of Mozart&#x27;s piano concerto in E-flat, K. 271, showing how each new idea fulfills various needs raised by the last, while leaving others still open: a continuous game of symmetry and asymmetry, expectation and fulfillment, hiding beneath the innocent surface. ... Charles insists on addressing the notes; but he shows us how behind the notes are felt needs, requirements, laws of how things ought to be—a whole system of judgment, of taste, of meaning. ... The book ... occasionally feels like a page-turner, a thriller: these three geniuses—Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven—building on each other&#x27;s discoveries, like scientists almost, creating unprecedented inventions, invoking a golden era of form meeting content.

Another goal of the work is to set each composer&#x27;s work in its historical and cultural background, describing the forms of composition that served as a musical background for a composer in his formative years and then illuminating his contributions. For example, Rosen largely sees Beethoven in the context of the Classical-period tradition from which he emerged, rather than anachronistically as a forerunner of the later Romantic movement. Indeed, Rosen makes a strong case that the Romantic movement in music emerged from a &quot;rejection&quot; of the principles on which Beethoven composed; and that the veneration the Romantics held for Beethoven was in some ways an impediment to their best work.

Rosen was unafraid to make strong generalizations about the music he studied; i.e. he frequently pointed out aspects of the music claimed to be invariably or almost invariably present. Here are examples.
The first section of a sonata exposition always has an increasingly animated texture. (&quot;Sonata Forms&quot;, p. 238)

The opening of a work by Mozart is always solidly based [i.e., in the tonic key], no matter how ambiguous and disturbing its expressive significance, while the most unassuming first measures of a quartet by Haydn are far more unstable, more immediately charged with a dynamic movement away from the tonic. (&quot;The Classical Style&quot;, 186)

In this respect Chopin is one of the least pianistic of composers: a change of harmony [= a passage repeated later in a piece in a different key] that makes the original figuration exceedingly awkward does not lead him to change the figuration, and he always refuses to adapt his musical thought to the convenience of the hand. (&quot;The Romantic Generation&quot;, p. 364)

From time to time Rosen wielded his pen as a rapier, skewering other authors. He generally expressed his criticisms with a dose of wit, mixing damnation with faint praise, as in the following discussion of a contribution by Richard Taruskin to a volume on historically informed performance:
Taruskin writes brilliantly and at the top of his voice, and his most crushing arguments are often reserved for opinions that no one really holds. He asserts: &quot;To presume that the use of historical instruments guarantees a historical result is simply preposterous.&quot; No doubt. Still, Taruskin beats his dead horses with infectious enthusiasm, and some of them have occasional twitches of life.

Such passages were balanced by a fair amount of praise and appreciation (if not systematic citation) of others&#x27; work.

Rosen&#x27;s prodigious memory for facts occasionally failed him, letting elementary factual errors creep into his work. Sometimes he would apologize for the errors in reprinted editions, retaining them in the text as a sort of self-reprimand. Thus chapter 7 of &quot;Critical Entertainments&quot;, a reprinted essay, begins with an appended comment:
At the opening of the following essay, the mistake of calling Joseph II the emperor Franz Joseph is so egregious that I have let it stand in the text in the hope that the public humiliation will make me more careful in the future. Several readers wrote to signal other mistakes…

=== Critical assessment ===
The musicologist Mark DeVoto has written of Rosen:
Charles Rosen was a comprehensive musician, an outstanding pianist and one of the best writers on music ever. The scope of his knowledge was immense, and its depth showed on every page of his many and various books and articles, from &quot;The Classical Style&quot; to &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot; to &quot;Sonata Forms&quot;, and even to books on Schoenberg and Elliott Carter. Today&#x27;s students and knowledgeable music lovers return to Rosen&#x27;s writings again and again, not only to read about the great composers and their works, but to comprehend them historically and as components of the literary and dramatic traditions, which Rosen knew thoroughly.

<text>The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is an American professional wrestling promotion and governing body owned by Billy Corgan and operated by its parent company Lightning One, Inc.

Founded in 1948, the NWA began as the governing body for a group of regional promotions, the heads of which made up the board of directors. The group operated a territory system which sanctioned their own company championships while recognizing a singular world champion who defended his title across all the territories, participated in talent exchanges, and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for professional wrestling in the United States. It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) national expansion.

In September 1993, the largest remaining member promotion, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), left the NWA. The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions, with NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA:TNA) given exclusivity over its World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships from June 2002 to May 2007.

In August 2012, the NWA discontinued its memberships and started licensing its brand to wrestling promotions. In 2017, it was purchased by Billy Corgan through his Lightning One, Inc. company. By late 2019–2023, the NWA had transitioned into a stand-alone, singular promotion.

In October 2023, the NWA re-established its territory system, with Michael Hutter&#x27;s NWA Exodus Pro Midwest being the first promotion sanctioned.

==History==
===Formation===

In 1948, Paul &quot;Pinkie&quot; George, a professional wrestling promoter from the U.S. Midwest, founded the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of six other promoters: Al Haft, Tony Stecher, Harry Light, Orville Brown, Don Owen, and Sam Muchnick. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of professional wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide. The newly formed NWA Board of Directors decided that Brown would become the first ever NWA World Heavyweight Champion.

===Governing body===
====1950s–1970s====
In 1950, Sam Muchnick, one of the original promoters of the NWA and Lou Thesz&#x27;s booker, was named the governing body&#x27;s President, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected and held until 1960, making him one of the longest-tenured presidents in the organization&#x27;s history. Following the advent of television, professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during this time, reaching a larger audience than ever before. Rising demand and national expansion made wrestling a much more lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This era would go on to be known as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of professional wrestling. From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the DuMont Television Network.

In 1956, allegations were made that the NWA was an illegal monopoly blocking competition. An investigation led by the US Department of Justice resulted in the NWA Consent Decree of 1956 (&quot;United States v. National Wrestling Alliance&quot;). Several promoters would leave the organization during this time, with some managing to find niches in the United States. In 1957, Montreal promoter Eddie Quinn walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis, having fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named Édouard Carpentier was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as world champion after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957.

As the 1950s came to a close, professional wrestling was losing television ratings, and soon TV stations dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups. The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local syndicated shows, which aired as late-night filler programming. Promoters started using localized television by purchasing airtime from rival territories, at the consequence of putting some of them out of business.
On January 24, 1963, at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated Buddy Rogers in a one-fall match and was declared NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third and final time. However, after the event, Vincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt of the Capital Wrestling Corporation (CWC) refused to recognize the title change since Thesz was not a strong draw in their Northeastern territory. They then withdrew the CWC from the NWA. As a result, McMahon and Mondt formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, later to be known as WWE) with Rogers as its first world champion in April 1963. Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions during this time.
Wrestling&#x27;s popularity continued to decline in the 1970s. They changed their name from the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. At some point during the decade, Muchnick reportedly declared Atlanta, Georgia as the &quot;leading wrestling city&quot; for its &quot;drawing capacity and near-capacity crowds at the City Auditorium or the Omni every Friday.&quot; While the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF) both faltered during the 1970s, the NWA once again took over as the top promotion and gained huge dominance with their program, Georgia Championship Wrestling, which would become the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television through then-superstation TBS in 1979. They brought in Gordon Solie, dubbed &quot;The Walter Cronkite of Professional Wrestling,&quot; from former NWA President Eddie Graham&#x27;s Championship Wrestling from Florida territory to be lead commentator and host.

====1980s–1993====
Videotape trading and cable television paved the way for the decline of the NWA&#x27;s inter-regional business model, as viewers could now see plot holes and inconsistencies between each territories&#x27; storylines. The presence of stars like Ric Flair on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw.

The WWF left the NWA for good in 1983, as Vincent K. McMahon, who bought the WWF from his father in 1982, worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. That same year, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) and the NWA created its primary supercard, Starrcade, the first to be broadcast via closed-circuit networks and was regarded as their flagship event.
On Saturday, July 14, 1984, in what would become known as Black Saturday, McMahon bought NWA member Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and merged it into the WWF. The WWF would take over GCW&#x27;s TV slot on TBS, which had been home to GCW&#x27;s &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; program for 12 years. This move proved disastrous as ratings would plummet, and the WWF would end up losing money on the deal. Then-NWA President Jim Crockett, Jr., the owner of JCP, would buy the &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; program from McMahon for $1 million and returned NWA programming to TBS. By 1985, JCP would become the flagship territory of the NWA by acquiring more time slots on TBS and merging with other NWA territories in an attempt to compete with the WWF.

With the success of WrestleMania III in 1987, the WWF would schedule another pay-per-view, Survivor Series, on Thanksgiving night to compete directly with NWA&#x27;s Starrcade event, and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. As a result, Starrcade was moved to December the following year, with the show now held around Christmas Day beginning in 1988. The WWF then scheduled their first Royal Rumble event in January 1988 to counterprogram against the NWA&#x27;s Bunkhouse Stampede. The NWA responded by creating Clash of the Champions on TBS to counterprogram WrestleMania IV.

By 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was facing bankruptcy. On October 11, under the direction of owner Ted Turner, TBS bought the assets of JCP and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after the TV show of the same name. Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would retain the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of &quot;NWA World Championship Wrestling&quot; that very same date in WCW&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta. By September 1993, WCW would withdraw completely from the NWA.

====1993–2012====
On August 27, 1994, NWA: Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) held a World Title tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Unbeknownst to any one, the event was staged for ECW&#x27;s public withdrawal from the NWA, with tournament winner Shane Douglas throwing down the NWA title belt and instead picking up the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt, proclaiming himself to be the ECW World Heavyweight Champion. ECW founder Tod Gordon would subsequently announce ECW&#x27;s secession from the NWA, rechristening the promotion as Extreme Championship Wrestling.

In 1998, the World Wrestling Federation reached an agreement to use the likeness of the NWA titles, branding, and its history, to create a storyline. It would be later claimed that WWE still owned the rights. Despite the NWA receiving international television publicity during the angle, it was considered a failure due to low viewer interests.

In June 2002, Jeff and Jerry Jarrett launched a new promotion called NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA:TNA). NWA:TNA was given creative control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships through an agreement with the NWA. This would last until March 2007, when the NWA terminated its agreement with TNA. TNA would lose control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships by the morning of the 2007 Sacrifice pay-per-view event on May 13.

On September 17, 2010, KDOC-TV Los Angeles premiered &quot;NWA: Championship Wrestling from Hollywood&quot;.

=== R. Bruce Tharpe and International Wrestling Corp. (2012–2017) ===
In August 2012, International Wrestling Corp., a holding company run by Houston, Texas-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe, sued Trobich, Baucom, the NWA, and its then-parent company, Trobich&#x27;s Pro Wrestling Organization LLC, claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA&#x27;s liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA name and trademarks from Trobich&#x27;s company to Tharpe&#x27;s.

The new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model and significantly reduced the amount of territory some of the members held, which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA. On September 9, 2012, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) announced it had left the NWA. CWFH was the unofficial home promotion of both the then-current NWA champion (Adam Pearce) and the most recent previous champion (Colt Cabana), both of whom publicly left the NWA, with Pearce vacating the NWA World Title while exiting. Other major NWA territories like NWA Pro/NWA Pro West, NWA Georgia, NWA Pro East, NWA Southwest and NWA Midwest folded.

In 2013, the NWA re-established a relationship with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where Bruce Tharpe became an on-screen character, portraying a villainous manager of wrestlers representing the NWA. Over the next two years, the NWA World Heavyweight, World Tag Team and World Junior Heavyweight Championships all changed hands at NJPW events.

In September 2016, NWA signed a deal with the new Japanese Diamond Stars Wrestling (DSW) promotion to promote shows in not only Japan, but also other parts of Asia. As part of the deal, DSW chairman Hideo Shimada was appointed the NWA Vice President of the Asian Pacific region while Jimmy Suzuki was appointed senior NWA consultant.

===Billy Corgan and Lightning One, Inc. (2017–present)===
====2017–2019: Acquisition and relaunch====
On May 1, 2017, it was reported that Billy Corgan, lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins, had agreed to purchase the NWA, including its name, rights, trademarks and championship belts. The report was confirmed by Tharpe that same day. Over the following weeks, the NWA trademarks were moved from Tharpe&#x27;s International Wrestling Corp. over to Corgan&#x27;s Lightning One, Inc. production company. According to multiple sources, as part of his acquisition of the NWA, Corgan would also purchase Tharpe&#x27;s stake in the NWA&#x27;s &quot;On Demand&quot; VOD service and licensing of the Paul Boesch wrestling library. Corgan&#x27;s ownership of the NWA took effect on October 1, 2017. All licenses granted by Tharpe to use the NWA branding expired the previous day, putting Corgan in complete control of both the brand and its championships.
On September 23, 2017, Nick Aldis made his debut for Championship Wrestling from Hollywood and challenged Tim Storm for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match took place on November 12 and saw Storm retain the title. This was the first title match under the new NWA regime headed by Corgan. On December 9, Aldis defeated Storm in a rematch at Cage of Death 19 to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion, making him the second British-born champion after Gary Steele.

In 2018, the NWA briefly allied with Impact Wrestling, the former NWA:TNA, to hold an Empty Arena match at Universal Orlando in Orlando, Florida. It was contested by Tim Storm and Jocephus and served as a qualifier to challenge then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Nick Aldis. The match was recorded on January 14, 2018, and uploaded to YouTube the next day.

Starting in 2018, NWA allied with Ring of Honor (ROH). NWA wrestlers such as Aldis, James Storm, and Eli Drake appeared at several ROH events, with ROH-contracted talent even winning NWA titles. On September 1, 2018, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was featured at All In, with Cody defeating Aldis for the title, becoming the first second-generation NWA World heavyweight champion. After All In, the NWA would return to hosting its own events. The NWA 70th Anniversary Show, which took place on October 21, 2018, was the first to be produced directly under Lightning One, and was co-produced with Global Force Entertainment; the event was streamed live on FITE TV. The main event saw Aldis defeat Cody to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and Willie Mack winning a tournament for the vacant NWA National Championship, which became the main secondary title.

The Fourth Crockett Cup, an eight-team, single-elimination tournament that was revived to crown new NWA World Tag Team Champions, took place on April 27, 2019, as another collaboration between the NWA and ROH. This would be the last event to be co-promoted with ROH; on July 24, 2019, the NWA announced that had ended their partnership. Subsequently, it was announced the following month that the NWA would host tapings in Atlanta on September 30 and October 1 for a new television series, later revealed to be titled &quot;NWA Powerrr&quot;.

====2020–2023: COVID-19, restructuring, and departures====
In January 2020, Marty Scurll, and other Ring of Honor characters, began to appear at NWA events once again as part of an inter-promotional angle. In addition to re-signing with ROH, Scurll would join the company&#x27;s booking team, enabling him to appear for both the NWA and ROH. However, in the fallout of the Speaking Out Movement, Scurll was accused of having intercourse with a 16-year-old female who was inebriated. After an investigation, Scurll would be removed from his position as booker, and by the following January in 2021, would be no longer under contract.

Nick Aldis was scheduled to face PCO at Supercard of Honor XIV on April 4, 2020, before the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 18, 2020, Dave Lagana resigned as Vice President of the NWA after allegations of sexual assault were made public. The promotion would go into hiatus as a result of this and the pandemic. During this time, several wrestlers would also leave the NWA, including former Tag Team Champions James Storm, Eli Drake, Marti Belle, and Royce Isaacs, former Women&#x27;s Champion Allysin Kay, former Television Champion Ricky Starks, former Television Champion Zicky Dice.

NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion Thunder Rosa would make appearances for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) while under contract with the NWA. On September 5, 2020, Rosa unsuccessfully challenged AEW Women&#x27;s World Championship Hikaru Shida at All Out. On October 27, 2020, Serena Deeb defeated Rosa during the United Wrestling Network&#x27;s Primetime Live event to become the new NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion.

On March 2, 2021, the NWA announced their return to promoting events, with the Back For The Attack and new &quot;Powerrr&quot; episodes as part of a new distribution agreement with FITE TV. As part of this agreement, the NWA would remove content from their YouTube channel.

On January 5, 2022, the NWA announced the launch of the NWA All Access subscription package on FITE TV, including past and upcoming pay-per-view events (PPV), new episodes of &quot;Powerrr&quot; on Tuesdays, and the newly announced &quot;NWA USA&quot; weekly series. In addition, it was announced that &quot;Powerrr&quot; would return to YouTube, airing on Fridays after the FITE premiere, and that &quot;NWA USA&quot; would air on Saturdays on the platform before moving to Sundays on FITE. Finally, it was announced that the NWA would expand their PPV schedule to six events per year, as part of a new deal with FITE TV. Though the partnership ended in 2023, with NWA&#x27;s programming returning to YouTube, FITE still carries NWA PPV events.

====2023–present: Return of the territories; The CW partnership====
On October 9, 2023, the NWA reestablished itself as a governing body, with EC3&#x27;s NWA Exodus Pro Midwest being the first territory to be sanctioned. On December 4, NWA welcomed Joe Cazana Promotions (JCP) to their territory system.

On October 18, it was reported by news blog Haus of Wrestling that NWA had signed a deal with The CW to air &quot;Powerrr&quot; and a reality show documenting behind the scenes footage. However, a controversial segment from that month&#x27;s Samhain PPV event, in which Father James Mitchell along with several women and wrestlers were seen consuming cocaine, drew negative reactions online. The following month, The CW signed a deal with WWE for its weekly &quot;NXT&quot; program. Though it was rumored to be in-response to the Samhain segment, Corgan later revealed in a 2024 interview with Fightful that the CW executives didn&#x27;t have a problem with the spot, and that &quot;it was a completely invented story by either a troll inside the company, a leaker or something.”

Following Samhain, episodes of &quot;Powerrr&quot; were later added to The CW&#x27;s app in November. In January 2024, NWA announced that new episodes of &quot;Powerrr&quot; would be available on The CW app from February 6. The same year, NWA included new territories: NWA Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, Kross Fire Wrestling (KFW) in Sevierville, Tennessee, World League Wrestling in Missouri as NWA&#x27;s developmental system, and NWA Texas.
