<text>The Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra (YBh, Sanskrit; &quot;Treatise on the Stage of Yoga Practice&quot;) is a large and influential doctrinal compendium, associated with Sanskritic Mahāyāna Buddhism (particularly Yogācāra). According to Ulrich Timme Kragh, it is &quot;a massive treatise that brings together a wealth of material stemming from Mainstream as well as Mahāyāna Buddhism.&quot;

==History==
The &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot; is generally associated with the Indian Yogācāra school because it contains certain unique Yogācāra doctrines, like the eight consciousnesses and the &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot; (storehouse or foundational consciousness)&quot;.&quot; According to Ulrich Timme Kragh, &quot;its overall objective seems to be to present a coherent structure of Buddhist yoga practice with the Mahāyāna path of the bodhisattva placed at the pinnacle of the system&quot;, but substantial parts also deal with non-Mahāyāna &quot;mainstream&quot; practices. The text also shows strong affinity to the Abhidharma works of the Mainstream Buddhist Sarvāstivāda school, adopting many of its technical terminology and classifications of phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;).

While it likely contains earlier materials, the YBh is thought to have reached its final redaction in the fourth century CE. Traditional sources name either the Indian thinker Asaṅga (ca. 300–350) or the bodhisattva Maitreya as author, but most modern scholars hold that it is a composite text with different chronological textual layers and various authors, though this does not rule out the possibility that Asaṅga was among them.

According to scholars such as Changhwan Park and Robert Kritzer the YBh may have subtly influenced other North Indian Buddhist works such as the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; and the works of the Sautrāntika school. The YBh also exherted a strong influence on the later works of the Yogācāra-Vijñānavāda school, such as the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra&quot;, the &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;. Finally, the YBh also exherted a clear influence on the tantric tradition of Indian Buddhism of the sixth to fourteenth centuries (and the works of exegetes like Ratnākaraśānti), and the YBh is itself aware of the use of mantras and subjugation rituals that would become common to the tantric tradition.

The YBh was studied and transmitted in East Asian Buddhist and Tibetan Buddhist translations. In China, it was the work of Xuánzàng (玄奘, 602?-664) that introduced the YBh in full. It caused many debates, particularly around the notion that certain beings did not have the &quot;gotra&quot;, or spiritual disposition, to attain awakening. By the end of the Sui dynasty (589–618), Buddhism within China had developed many distinct schools and traditions. In the words of Dan Lusthaus:

The YBh was translated into Tibetan in the ninth century at Samye by Ye shes sde and Cog ro Klu&#x27;i rgyal mtshan working with the Indian paṇḍitas Prajñāvarman, Surendrabodhi, and Jinamitra. The YBh remained influential in these traditions (for example, it is a major source of meditation instruction for Tsongkhapa&#x27;s &quot;Lamrimchenmo&quot;), however, perhaps because of size and complexity, it was eventually abandoned in monastic seminaries.

Besides the Chinese and Tibetan translations which survive in full, at least 50% of the text survives in nine extant Sanskrit fragments. A translation project is currently underway to translate the entirety of Xuánzàng&#x27;s version into English. It is being carried out by the Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai society and the Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research. The &quot;Bodhisattva-bhūmi&quot;, a subsection of the work which is also treated as a stand-alone text, has been translated into English by Artemus Engle and is part of the Tsadra series published by Shambhala Publications.

== Overview of the Main Section ==
The complete YBh is often divided into the Basic Section and the Supplementary Section. The first section, which is the largest (49.9% of the work), is the &quot;main stages division&quot; or &quot;the basic section&quot; (Skt. &quot;*Maulyo Bhūmayaḥ,&quot; Ch. 本地分 &quot;Běn dì fēn,&quot; Tib. &quot;Sa&#x27;i dngos gzhi&quot;) and contains fourteen books that describe the successive seventeen levels (&quot;bhūmi&quot;), which cover the entire range of mental and spiritual stages of practice for the Mahāyāna bodhisattva.

However, according to Ulrich Timme Kragh, &quot;in the present context, the word bhūmi appears in many cases to imply a &#x27;foundation&#x27; in the sense of a field of knowledge that the Yogācāra acolyte ought to master in order to be successful in his or her yoga practice.&quot; Most of the Basic Section which includes such seminal works as the &quot;Bodhisattva-bhūmi&quot; and the &quot;Śrāvaka-bhūmi&quot; survives in Sanskrit, but little survives from the other parts. The following list is based on the Chinese arrangement, which seems to be closer to the original order.

The fourteen books of this section are:

=== 1 - &quot;Pañcavijñānakāyasamprayuktā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on the Fivefold Group of Empirical Consciousness&quot; provides a phenomenological analysis of the five sensory consciousnesses (the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile forms of consciousness), in terms of five points, their bases (&quot;āśraya&quot;), nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;), foci (&quot;alambana&quot;), accompanying mental states (&quot;sahaya&quot;) and functioning (&quot;karman&quot;). Sense perception is said to have both material basis (the physical sense faculty) and a mental basis (the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;). The mental basis is the latent consciousness which is &quot;the holder of all the seeds [for the mind and mental states]&quot; (&quot;sarva-bījaka&quot;), &quot;the appropriator of the [corporeal] basis (i.e., the body)&quot; (&quot;āśrayopādātṛ&quot;), and &quot;belonging to the [category of] karmic maturation&quot; (&quot;vipāka-saṃgṛhīta&quot;), which refers to the fact that it is morally neutral.

=== 2 - &quot;Manobhūmi&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on Cognition&quot; discusses &quot;thought-consciousness or reflexive consciousness [&quot;manas&quot;] that arises subsequent to the five sensory perceptions&quot;, in terms of the same five points outlined above. It also explains &quot;citta, manas&quot;, &quot;vijñāna&quot;, the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; and the afflictive cognition &quot;(kliṣṭaṃ manaḥ),&quot; using the schema of the eight consciousness. This book also explains the 51 mental factors &quot;(caittasikā dharmāḥ),&quot; &quot;agreeing with the arrangement that is also seen in the first chapter of Asaṅga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot;.&quot;&quot;&quot;

An explanation of the functioning or operation (&quot;karman&quot;) of cognition is also given which includes an extensive overview of death and rebirth, as well as an exposition of Buddhist cosmology and 24 typologies which discuss many modes of existence. The rest of the book discusses various classifications of dharmas (phenomena), the first of which divides phenomena into physical (&quot;rūpasamudāya&quot;), mental (&quot;cittacaitasikakalāpa&quot;) and unconditioned (&quot;asaṃskṛta&quot;). This exposition rejects the Abhidharma theory of atoms (&quot;paramāṇu&quot;) and instead posits that the seeds (&quot;bīja&quot;, causal potential) for physical matter are in the mind stream, which suggests that matter emerges from the mental.

The second group of classifications relates to causality and explains time (&quot;adhvan&quot;), arising (&quot;jāti&quot;), elapsing (&quot;jarā&quot;), enduring (&quot;sthiti&quot;), impermanence (&quot;anityatā&quot;) and four types of causal conditions (pratyaya). The third group is an ethical classification of phenomena as being either beneficial (&quot;kuśala&quot;) or not (&quot;akuśala&quot;) or indeterminate (&quot;avyākṛta&quot;). The fourth classification includes the twelve constituents of perception (&quot;dhātu&quot;).

=== 3 - &quot;Savitarkasavicārādibhūmi&quot; ===
This book discusses three different foundations having to do with &quot;vitarka&quot; (discernment) and &quot;vicara&quot; (discursiveness): (1) the foundation which includes both, (2) the foundation with only discursiveness and (3) the foundation that has neither of these.

According to Ulrich Timme Kragh &quot;discernment is said to be the cognitive operation that is responsible for ascertaining what is perceived by the senses by initially labeling it with a name, while discursiveness is explained as being the subsequent conceptual operation of deciding whether the perceived sense-object is desirable and what course of action one might want to take in relation to it.&quot; Because these two cognitive factors play a crucial role in samsaric bondage and in meditative concentration (&quot;samādhi&quot;, which is the pacification of these two factors), they are the focus of an extensive analysis in this book. This analysis is divided into five sections:

* A description of the three realms in saṃsāra: the desire realm (&quot;kāmadhātu&quot;), the form realm (rūpadhātu) and the realm of incorporeality (&quot;ārūpyadhātu&quot;).
* A description of the various defining characteristics (&quot;lakṣaṇa&quot;) of discernment and discursiveness.
* A description of the associated correct observation (&quot;yoniśomanaskāra&quot;), which is &quot;a mental outlook inclined to practice generosity and uphold a good moral.&quot;
* A description of the associated incorrect observation (&quot;ayoniśomanaskāra&quot;), which consist of &quot;sixteen types of mistaken views and beliefs,&quot; such as eternalism, materialism, belief in a Creator God, belief in the caste superiority of brahmins, and belief in animal sacrifice.
* A description of the defilements (&quot;saṃkleśa&quot;), which are &quot;the emotive and rational states through which sentient beings misperceive reality, e.g., desire, hatred, and ignorance.&quot; These are presented as subdivided into different categories, a total of 128 types of defilement are outlined. This section also explains defilement in terms of karma and in terms of the defilement of rebirth and dependent origination (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;).

=== 4 - &quot;Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
This book is titled &quot;The Foundation on Meditative Immersion&quot; and attempts to provide a coherent and exhaustive presentation of meditation. Large parts of this book make use of the canonical sutras of &quot;conservative Buddhism&quot; (i.e. non-Mahayana). The first section of this book gives a general overview of meditation using four terms: meditation (&quot;dhyāna&quot;), liberation (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;), meditative attainment (&quot;samāpatti&quot;), and &quot;samādhi&quot;.

The second section of this book provides an extensive presentation of meditation (&quot;dhyāna&quot;). First, five positive states to be cultivated and five negative states to be abandoned are explained. Then the five hindrances (&quot;nivaraṇa&quot;) are explained in detail. This is followed by a thorough explanation of each aspect (&quot;aṅga&quot;) of the four absorptions (&quot;catvāri dhyānāni&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Also, various related terms from the scriptures are discussed.

The third section provides a classification of the various types of meditation, these types are either divided into different forms of &#x27;observation&#x27; (&quot;manasikāra&quot;) or classified according to the various foci (&quot;ālambana&quot;) on which one concentrates, which are called the &#x27;images&#x27; (&quot;nimitta&quot;). Forty types of meditative observation are listed and explained in detail in this section.

Meditative images are presented in terms of four aspects: (1) the image as the meditative focus (&quot;ālambananimitta&quot;), (2) the image as the basis for meditation (&quot;nidānanimitta&quot;), (3) the images that are to be abandoned (&quot;parivarjanīyaṃ nimittaṃ&quot;), and (4) the images that are to be relied upon (&quot;pratiniṣevaṇīyaṃ nimittaṃ&quot;). The images to be abandoned are: dimness (&quot;laya&quot;), restlessness (&quot;auddhatya&quot;), distraction (&quot;vikṣepa)&quot;, and attachment (&quot;saṅga&quot;). A further 32 meditative images are also enumerated in this section, as well as how to enter the four meditative absorptions.

The fourth section is a summary of how meditation is explained in the sutras. The topics of the meditative liberations (&quot;vimokṣa&quot;) and the various types of &quot;samādhi&quot; are outlined, such as the emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), wishlessness (&quot;apraṇihita&quot;), and imagelessness (&quot;ānimitta&quot;), as well as &quot;samādhi&quot; with and without &quot;vitarka-vicara&quot;.

=== 5 - &quot;Asamāhitā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
This book, &quot;The Foundation on Being Without Meditative Absorption&quot;, lists 12 states that remain devoid of meditative absorption, such as a mind that is engaged in the realm of sensual desire (&quot;kāmāvacara&quot;) or the mind of a beginner meditator that suffers from distraction (&quot;vikṣepa&quot;).

=== 6 - &quot;Sacittikā Acittikā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
This book, &quot;The Foundation on Having Mentation and Being Without Mentation&quot;, examines the notion of &#x27;mind&#x27; or &#x27;mentation&#x27; (&quot;citta&quot;) in relation to meditation and other doctrines&quot; and discusses different states that are with or without &quot;citta&quot;. States without citta include the meditative attainment of cessation (&quot;nirodhasamāpatti&quot;) and &quot;nirvāṇa,&quot; which is a state in which all mentation ceases, even the latent consciousness (&quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;).

=== 7 - &quot;Śrutamayī Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on What is Derived from Listening&quot; focuses on various issues dealing with learning, listening to, and memorizing Buddhist spiritual knowledge (&quot;adhyātmavidyā&quot;). &quot;Listening&quot; is related to processes of &quot;listening to religious discourses, memorizing and reciting scriptures, and recollecting various points of doctrine, all of which result in knowledge of the Buddhist teachings.&quot;

The book contains an outline of various basic Buddhist concepts in different sets or groupings similar to Abhidharma lists. This book also contains outlines of other forms of knowledge, such as the arts of healing (&quot;cikitsā&quot;), logical reasoning (&quot;hetuvidyā&quot;), and linguistic knowledge (&quot;śabdavidyā&quot;).

=== 8 - &quot;Cintāmayī Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on What is Derived from Understanding&quot; deals with understanding (&quot;cintā&quot;) which refers to when &quot;the practitioner based on his or her studies of the teachings arrives at a singular &#x27;view&#x27; or philosophical outlook of reality along with knowing the religious path that leads to the eradication of misconceptions of reality and the inner realization of this view.&quot;

This presentation is divided into three sections. The first section explains how one internalizes what one has heard or studied. The practitioner is supposed to contemplate and analyze the meaning of what they have learned in solitude. The second section provides an analysis of what is to be known (&quot;jñeyapravicaya&quot;), which is divided into what exists and what does not exist. What exists is analyzed by various categories, such as their specific characteristics (&quot;svalakṣaṇa&quot;), general characteristics (&quot;sāmānyalakṣaṇa&quot;), and causal characteristics (&quot;hetulakṣaṇa&quot;).

The book also presents a second analysis of &quot;fivefold existence&quot; (&quot;astitā&quot;) and fivefold non-existence which is more closely connected with the Yogācāra-Vijñānavāda doctrine of the three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;) and the three absences of intrinsic nature (&quot;triniḥsvabhāvatā&quot;). The fivefold existences are:

# being existent in the sense of the perfectly accomplished character (&quot;pariniṣpannalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# being existent in the sense of the dependent character (&quot;paratantralakṣaṇa&quot;),
# being existent in the sense of the imagined character (&quot;parikalpitalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# being existent in the sense of a specific character (&quot;viṣeśalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# being existent as something having an inexpressible character (&quot;avaktavyalakṣaṇa&quot;).

The corresponding non-existences are:

# lacking the character of highest reality (&quot;paramārthalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# lacking the character of being independent (&quot;svatantralakṣaṇa&quot;),
# entirely lacking any character of its own (&quot;sarveṇa sarvaṃ svalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# lacking a specific character (&quot;aviśeṣalakṣaṇa&quot;),
# lacking an expressible character (&quot;vaktavyalakṣaṇa&quot;).
The third section of this book, the analysis of the teachings (&quot;dharmapravicaya&quot;), &quot;consists of three passages of selected canonical and paracanonical verses accompanied by a prose commentary.&quot; Among the key topics discussed here are the latent consciousness (&quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;), and the three kinds of religious training (&quot;śikṣā&quot;). Many passages from the &quot;Udānavarga&quot; are quoted, which, according to Schmithausen, shows that the canon used by the compilers of this text belongs to the Mūlasarvāstivāda sect.

=== 9 - &quot;Bhāvanāmayī Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on What is Derived from Meditative Cultivation&quot; discusses meditative cultivation (&quot;bhāvanā&quot;), in terms of its basis, conditions, the practice of yoga and its results. First, the right circumstances needed to encounter the teachings and practice them are explained, which include being reborn as a suitable sentient being, being born in the right place and so on. Then an explanation of how to listen to the true teaching is given, mainly, one must listen without disdain, distraction or faintheartedness. This leads the practitioner to trust that nirvāṇa is a real and worthy goal and thus they turn their mind towards this as their ultimate aim.

The book then discusses the conditions needed for achieving meditative insight (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;) and tranquility (&quot;śamatha&quot;). The initial necessary circumstance leading to insight is said to be reliance on a spiritual friend (&quot;sanmitra&quot;) while tranquility is said to require the perfection of discipline (&quot;śīlasampatti&quot;). The process towards spiritual realization is said to progress through the practice of ethical discipline and associating with a spiritual mentor, these two reinforce each other and lead to the study and internalization of the teachings, which give rise to a sense of renunciation of everything worldly and a yearning for realization. The spiritual seeker then applies all the remedies against the afflictions and achieves complete mental purity.

After the inner and outer causes for spiritual development have been explained, this section then discusses the actual practice of meditative cultivation. This is explained through a list of ten types of remedies or antidotes (&quot;pratipakṣa&quot;) applied to counter the numerous afflictions and adverse inclinations (&quot;vipakṣa&quot;) that are also explained here. The ten meditative antidotes are:

# contemplating (of the notion) of unattractiveness (&quot;aśubhasaṃjnā&quot;),
# contemplating impermanence (&quot;anityasaṃjnā&quot;),
# contemplating the suffering found in what is impermanent (&quot;anitye duḥkhasaṃjñā&quot;),
# contemplating selflessness with regard to what entails suffering (&quot;duḥkhe &#x27;anātmasaṃjñā&quot;),
# fostering an attitude of indifference to food (&quot;āhāre pratikūlasaṃjñā&quot;),
# fostering an attitude of disinterest in anything worldly (&quot;sarvaloke anabhiratisaṃjñā&quot;),
# meditating on images of light (&quot;ālokasaṃjñā&quot;),
# fostering an attitude of detachment (&quot;virāgasaṃjñā&quot;),
# contemplating cessation (&quot;nirodhasaṃjñā&quot;),
# contemplating death (&quot;maraṇasaṃjñā&quot;).
Following this presentation, the book discusses practical advice related to the attainment of meditative immersion (&quot;samādhilābha&quot;), covering topics such as living with others, finding and learning from a teacher, material affairs, one&#x27;s environment, sleep and eating patterns, practicing asceticism, etc.

Then, the fulfillment of meditative immersion (&quot;samādhiparipūri&quot;) is discussed, which refers to the process in which a meditator goes deeper into samadhi and achieves mastery of meditation, experiencing five stages of fruition.

=== 10 - &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi&quot; ===
&quot;The Foundation on the Hearer&quot;. This book focuses on practices associated with &quot;hearers&quot; or &quot;disciples&quot; (&quot;śrāvaka&quot;). Lambert Schmithausen, Noritoshi Aramaki, Florin Deleanu and Alex Wayman all hold that this is the oldest layer of the YBh.

The &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi&quot; is divided into four sections called &quot;yogasthānas&quot; (yogic foundations or topics) and is the second largest book of the YBh.

==== Yogasthāna 1 ====
The first subdivision of the first yogasthāna is called the &quot;Gotrabhūmi&quot;, and it discusses, in depth, how different practitioners have different spiritual dispositions (&quot;gotra&quot;), which is explained as a mental potential or capacity, which is like a seed (bīja-dharma) for spiritual achievement, found in the person since beginningless time. This predisposition is at first hidden, but if a person encounters the right causes and conditions, they will reach nirvāṇa. This section also discusses the qualities of persons that are &quot;not predisposed&quot; for awakening, which are persons that lack the qualities needed to attain nirvāṇa. The different types of predisposed persons are also discussed.

The second subdivision is called the &quot;Avatārabhūmi&quot; and it focuses on how different types of persons enter (&quot;avatāra&quot;) into the path as well as the characteristics of these different types of persons that have entered the path (&quot;avatīrṇāḥ pudgalāḥ&quot;).

The third foundation of the first yogasthāna is &quot;The Foundation of Going Forth&quot; (&quot;naiṣkramyabhūmi&quot;). Going forth is a term which implies the abandonment of the household life and becoming a monastic but can also generally refer to entering the spiritual life. This foundation could technically be seen as covering the rest of the entire &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi&quot; and covers the entire path of practice. The path is divided into two branches, the mundane (&quot;laukikaḥ mārgaḥ&quot;) and supramundane (&quot;lokottaraḥ mārgaḥ)&quot;.

In following the mundane path, practitioners realize that the realm of sense desire is brutish and coarse and see that the absorption and rapture of the first dhyāna is superior and serene. In practicing this dhyāna, they achieve detachment from sense desire. They then realize that this meditation is also coarse, and progress to the second dhyāna, and so on until they reach the fourth dhyāna and beyond into the four immaterial attainments. The supramundane path meanwhile entails finding a genuine teacher, gaining knowledge of Dharma and realizing the four noble truths for oneself through vipaśyanā meditation they completely transcend saṃsāra.

The rest of this text discusses the 13 requisites (&quot;sambhāra&quot;) needed for journeying along these paths:

# The first requisite is a human rebirth in a place and condition that is opportune for practicing the Dharma, 
# The second is the fact that a Buddha has appeared in the world, has taught the Dharma, and that this has been successfully transmitted down to the present
# The third is to have a beneficial aspiration for [practicing] the Dharma (&quot;kuśalo dharmacchanda&quot;). 
# The fourth requisite is the restraint of discipline (&quot;śīlasaṃvara&quot;), which refers to keeping the ethical &quot;prātimokṣa&quot; rules.
# The fifth requisite is sense restraint (&quot;indriya-saṃvara&quot;) which means to &quot;keep the doors of the senses guarded, maintaining a protective awareness (&quot;ārakṣitasmṛti&quot;)&quot; and &quot;a constantly watchful awareness (&quot;nipakasmṛti&quot;).&quot; This practice requires that one carefully observes the process of sense perception to avoid adopting confused or harmful thinking that leads to the defilements, such as thinking that what is unattractive is attractive.
# The sixth requisite is the right amount of food intake (&quot;bhojane mātra-jñatā&quot;). It is eating with careful consideration, only for the sake of a healthy body, not pleasure, company or bodily beauty. 
# The seventh requisite is to practice staying awake (&quot;jāgarikāyoga&quot;) in the evening (first part of the night after sunset) and in the early morning (last part of the night before sunrise). This is accomplished by taking a walk and through the visualization of a mass of light. 
# The eighth requisite is to move about attentively (&quot;saṃprajānadvihāritā&quot;) during all of one&#x27;s daily activities and in all postures. 
# The ninth requisite is to find a proper spiritual teacher (&quot;kalyāṇamitra&quot;), the right qualities of a good teacher are then outlined, including pure discipline, knowing much, being compassionate, etc. 
# The tenth requisite &quot;is to listen to the true Dharma and understand it (&quot;saddharmaśravaṇacintanā&quot;)&quot;. This section explains the twelve branches of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma and the threefold division of Sutra, Vinaya and Abhidharma.
# The eleventh requisite is to be free from obstacles (&quot;anantarāya&quot;). This section outlines the many different kinds of obstacles that block one&#x27;s practice.
# The twelfth requisite is &#x27;relinquishment&#x27; (&quot;tyāga&quot;), defined as &quot;giving items that are beyond reproach as gifts.&quot; 
# The thirteenth requisite is to possess &quot;the ornaments of a renunciant&quot; (&quot;śramaṇālaṃkāra&quot;), which is a list of seventeen qualities including: faith (&quot;śrāddha&quot;), honesty (&quot;aśatha&quot;), intelligence (&quot;prājña&quot;), asceticism, and patience (&quot;kṣama&quot;).

==== Yogasthāna 2 ====
The second section discusses 28 different personality types and also various ways of classifying spiritual practitioners. An example of one such classification is that of persons of different temperaments (&quot;caritaprabheda&quot;). These are: the temperament of desire and attachment (&quot;rāgacaritaḥ&quot;), the temperament of dislike and hatred (&quot;dveṣacaritaḥ&quot;), the temperament of deludedness and stupidity (&quot;mohacaritaḥ&quot;), the temperament of pride and self-conceit (&quot;mānacarita&quot;), the temperament of intellectuality (&quot;vitarkacarita&quot;), and the temperament with equal amounts [of each afflictive state] (&quot;samabhāgacarita&quot;).

Following this exposition, the various meditative foci (&quot;ālambana&quot;) are explained. It is in this section that concrete meditation techniques appear in this treatise. These meditations are divided into four kinds: (I) general [types of] foci, (II) foci purifying the practitioner&#x27;s temperament, (III) foci [for developing] expertise, and (IV) foci purifying the afflictions.

There are four types of general foci (&quot;vyāpyālambanam&quot;):

# The conceptual image (&quot;savikalpaṃ pratibimbam&quot;), used in insight meditation (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;). A meditator chooses a doctrinal topic such as the four noble truths, dependent arising, or the aggregrates and analyzes it conceptually while resting in meditation until a realization emerges.
# The non-conceptual image (&quot;nirvikalpaṃ pratibimbam&quot;) used in tranquility meditation (&quot;śamatha&quot;). The mind is brought to rest on the object without analysis in nine steps called &quot;the nine aspects of resting the mind&quot; (&quot;navākārā cittasthitiḥ&quot;).
# The entirety of things (&quot;vastuparyantatā&quot;). This is to concentrate on the five aggregates (&quot;skandha&quot;), the eighteen constituents of perception (&quot;dhātu&quot;), or the twelve perceptual domains (&quot;āyatana&quot;) concerning their causality, function, or characteristics.
# The fourth type of general foci is the perfection of the aim [of meditation] (&quot;kāryapariniṣpatti&quot;), where the meditative image is transcended, one reaches the dhyanas and attains the vision of non-conceptual, direct knowledge (&quot;nirvikalpam pratyakṣaṃ jñāna-darśanam&quot;).
Regarding the non-conceptual image&quot;, śamatha&quot; practice is said to progress through nine &quot;mental abidings&quot; (S. &quot;navākārā cittasthiti&quot;, Tib. &quot;sems gnas dgu&quot;), leading to the state of śamatha proper, and from there to a state of meditative concentration called the first &quot;dhyāna&quot; (Pāli: &quot;jhāna&quot;; Tib. &quot;bsam gtan&quot;) which is often said to be a state of tranquillity or bliss. The Nine Mental Abidings are:

# Placement of the mind (S. &quot;cittasthāpana&quot;, Tib. འཇོག་པ - &quot;sems ’jog-pa&quot;) occurs when the practitioner is able to place their attention on the object of meditation, but is unable to maintain that attention for very long. Distractions, dullness of mind and other hindrances are common.
# Continuous placement (S. &quot;samsthāpana&quot;, Tib. རྒྱུན་དུ་འཇོག་པ - &quot;rgyun-du ‘jog-pa&quot;) occurs when the practitioner experiences moments of continuous attention on the object before becoming distracted. According to B. Alan Wallace, this is when you can maintain your attention on the meditation object for about a minute.
# Repeated placement (S. &quot;avasthāpana&quot;, Tib. བླན་ཏེ་འཇོག་པ - &quot;slan-te ’jog-pa&quot;) is when the practitioner&#x27;s attention is fixed on the object for most of the practice session and she or he is able to immediately realize when she or he has lost their mental hold on the object and is able to restore that attention quickly. Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche suggests that being able to maintain attention for 108 breaths is a good benchmark for when we have reached this stage.
# Close placement (S. &quot;upasthāpana&quot;, Tib. ཉེ་བར་འཇོག་པ - &quot;nye-bar ’jog-pa&quot;) occurs when the practitioner is able to maintain attention throughout the entire meditation session (an hour or more) without losing their mental hold on the meditation object at all. In this stage the practitioner achieves the power of mindfulness. Nevertheless, this stage still contains subtle forms of excitation and dullness or laxity.
# Taming (S. &quot;damana&quot;, Tib. དུལ་བར་བྱེད་པ - &quot;dul-bar byed-pa&quot;), by this stage the practitioner achieves deep tranquility of mind, but must be watchful for subtle forms of laxity or dullness, peaceful states of mind which can be confused for calm abiding. By focusing on the future benefits of gaining Shamatha, the practitioner can uplift (gzengs-bstod) their mind and become more focused and clear.
# Pacifying (S. &quot;śamana&quot;,Tib. ཞི་བར་བྱེད་པ་ - &quot;zhi-bar byed-pa&quot;) is the stage during which subtle mental dullness or laxity is no longer a great difficulty, but now the practitioner is prone to subtle excitements which arise at the periphery of meditative attention. According to B. Alan Wallace this stage is achieved only after thousands of hours of rigorous training.
# Fully pacifying (S. &quot;vyupaśamana&quot;,Tib. རྣམ་པར་ཞི་བར་བྱེད་པ་ - &quot;nye-bar zhi-bar byed-pa&quot;), although the practitioner may still experience subtle excitement or dullness, they are rare and the practitioner can easily recognize and pacify them.
# Single-pointing (S. &quot;ekotīkarana&quot;,Tib. རྩེ་གཅིག་ཏུ་བྱེད་པ་ - &quot;rtse-gcig-tu byed-pa&quot;) in this stage the practitioner can reach high levels of concentration with only a slight effort and without being interrupted even by subtle laxity or excitement during the entire meditation session.
# Balanced placement (S. &quot;samādhāna&quot;,Tib. མཉམ་པར་འཇོག་པ་བྱེད་པ་ - &quot;mnyam-par ’jog-pa&quot;) the meditator now effortlessly reaches absorbed concentration (ting-nge-‘dzin, S. samadhi.) and can maintain it for about four hours without any single interruption.
# Śamatha, Tib. ཞི་གནས་, shyiné - the culmination, is sometimes listed as a tenth stage.

The foci for purifying the practitioner&#x27;s temperament (&quot;caritaviśodhanam ālambanam&quot;) contains extensive explanations of five contemplative objects:

* The person with a temperament of desire is assigned various meditations on unattractiveness (&quot;aśubhā&quot;) and charnel ground contemplation (&quot;maraṇasati&quot;). This section also teaches meditation on the unattractiveness of the mental afflictions and on the unattractiveness of the impermanence of the five aggregates.
* The person with a temperament of dislike and hatred is assigned the meditation on friendliness (&quot;maitrī&quot;). The meditation consists of wishing happiness for one&#x27;s friends, enemies and neutral persons until one is able to rest in an expansive and unlimited absorption state that wishes well for all. This method is then applies to meditation on compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) and sympathetic rejoicing (&quot;muditā&quot;).
* The person with a temperament of deludedness and stupidity is assigned the meditation on causality and dependent arising (&quot;idaṃpratyayatāpratītya-samutpāda&quot;). 
* The person with a temperament of pride and conceit is assigned the meditation on the division of the constituents (&quot;dhātuprabheda&quot;), i.e. the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. 
* The person with an intellectual temperament is assigned the various meditations on breathing mindfulness (&quot;ānāpānasmṛti&quot;). Five different techniques are presented: (1) counting the breath, (2) observing how each of the five aggregates is involved in the breathing process, (3) observing dependent arising through the breath, (4) observing the four noble truths, (5) the exercise of the sixteen aspects (&quot;ṣoḍaśākāra-paricaya&quot;) of &quot;ānāpānasmṛti.&quot;

The third type of foci, which are also termed the foci [for developing] expertise (&quot;kauśalyālambana&quot;), refers to the following:

* Expertise in the aggregates (&quot;skandhakauśalya&quot;), is cultivated by contemplating the distinct nature of each aggregate and understanding none of them as a permanent, unchanging phenomenon. 
* Expertise in the constituents [of perception] (&quot;dhātukauśalya&quot;), is cultivated by observing how each &quot;dhātu&quot; &quot;arises, unfolds, and becomes cognizant.&quot; 
* Expertise in the domains [of perception] (&quot;āyatana-kauśalya&quot;), is cultivated by contemplating how the different conditions in each domain give rise to each type of consciousness. 
* Expertise in dependent arising (&quot;pratītyasamutpādakauśalya&quot;) is cultivated as follows: &quot;the meditator first analyzes how each link serves as a condition for the subsequent link to arise and then understands that the causality involved in this process requires each phenomenon to be impermanent. Since they are impermanent, they also involve suffering and are without any self.&quot;
* Expertise in what constitutes a basis and what does not constitute a basis [for beneficial action and desirable karmic results] (&quot;sthānāsthānakauśalya&quot;) is cultivated by meditating on how negative and beneficial actions have different kinds of karmic results.

The fourth meditative object is the foci purifying the afflictions (&quot;kleśaviśodhanaṃ ālambanam&quot;). This is related to the mundane and supramundane paths. In the mundane path, meditation focuses on seeing the realm of existence one is currently on (e.g. realm of desire) as coarse, while the realm which is immediately above (i.e. first dhyana) is seen as peaceful. Then once one has attained the higher realm in meditation, one continues this process (i.e. one sees the first dhyana as coarse and the second dhyana as peaceful and so on). On the supramundane path, the foci for meditation are the four noble truths.

After these presentations, there follows an exposition on how to give instructions to a student, and another section on the three trainings (superior discipline, superior meditative mind and superior insight). Then there follows a segment which outlines &quot;ten factors that go along with the training (&quot;śikṣānulomikā dharmāḥ&quot;), which are remedies to ten factors that go against the dharma. These are:

# the contemplation of unattractiveness (&quot;aśubhasaṃjñā&quot;) counters sexual attachment,
# the contemplation of impermanence (&quot;anityasaṃjñā&quot;) remedies belief in a self,
# the contemplation of suffering with regard to what is impermanent (&quot;anitye duḥkhasaṃjñā&quot;) overcomes laziness and apathy,
# the contemplation of no-self in suffering (&quot;duḥkhe &#x27;nātmasaṃjñā&quot;) opposes belief in a self,
# the contemplation of the un-attractiveness of food (&quot;āhāre pratikūlasaṃjñā&quot;) counters desire for eating,
# the contemplation of the lack of real happiness anywhere in the world (&quot;sarvaloke &#x27;nabhiratisaṃjñā&quot;) works against craving for listening to chatter about the world,
# the visualization of light (&quot;ālokasaṃjñā&quot;) remedies states that cloud or confuse the mind, such as doubt, unclarity, tiredness, sleepiness, and so forth,
# the contemplation of non-attachment (&quot;virāgasaṃjñā&quot;) works against attachment to the bliss experienced in higher states of meditation,
# the contemplation of cessation (&quot;nirodhasaṃjñā&quot;) overcomes desire for the meditative absorption,
# the contemplation of death (&quot;maraṇasaṃjñā&quot;) remedies the misery that arises from wishing and hoping for life.

The second &quot;Yogasthāna&quot; also gives a general definition of yoga as &quot;spiritual practice&quot;, which is said to have four aspects, (1) faith (&quot;śraddhā&quot;), (2) aspiration (&quot;chandas&quot;), (3) perseverance (&quot;vīrya&quot;), and (4) spiritual methods (&quot;upāya&quot;).

Another segment of the second &quot;Yogasthāna&quot; explains four levels of mental observation, engagement or attention (&quot;manaskāra&quot;) as it relates to the strength and constancy of one&#x27;s mental focus on the object of meditation. These four levels are:

# forceful application [of the mind towards the meditative object] (&quot;balavāhana&quot;),
# interrupted application (&quot;sacchidravāhana&quot;),
# uninterrupted application (&quot;niśchidravāhana&quot;),
# effortless application (&quot;anābhogavāhana&quot;).

Other topics are also outlined in the second &quot;Yogasthāna&quot;, including the nine types of ascertainment (&quot;adhimokṣa&quot;) of the meditative focus, the four aims of yoga (&quot;yoga-karaṇīya&quot;), the different kinds of yoga practitioners (&quot;yogācāra&quot;), the cultivation of notions (&quot;saṃjñā-bhāvanā&quot;), the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (&quot;saptatriṃśad bodhipakṣyā dharmāḥ&quot;) and the four stages of contemplative fruition (&quot;bhāvanāphala&quot;).

==== Yogasthāna 3 ====
The third section discusses various practical issues on the path, how one approaches a teacher and how a teacher assesses a student&#x27;s abilities and predispositions. Then five topics which a teacher instructions their student are discussed:

# How to guard and accumulate the requisites needed for meditation (&quot;samādhisaṃbhārarakṣopacaya&quot;).
# How to practice in solitary retreat (&quot;prāvivekya&quot;). The best location is in the wilderness, but it should also be safe and it should be easy to obtain provisions. The ideal retreat is done in solitude. 
# How to achieve one-pointedness of mind (&quot;cittai-kāgratā&quot;). Samadhi is defined in this section as &quot;a stream of mind characterized by continuous irreproachable bliss whose focus is an appropriate object of constant mindfulness.&quot; This section also discusses the practice of tranquility (&quot;śamatha&quot;) and meditative insight (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;). Tranquility is discussed through &quot;the nine aspects of resting the mind&quot; (&quot;navākārā cittasthitiḥ&quot;) and the four levels of mental observation. &quot;Vipaśyanā&quot; is explained through &quot;four supports&quot; for insight and &quot;three gates&quot;.
# How to purify the hindrances (&quot;āvaraṇaviśuddhi&quot;). This is done by (1) recognizing the nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;) of the hindrances, (2) knowing the circumstances (&quot;nidāna&quot;) under which they arise, (3) realizing the drawbacks (&quot;ādīnava&quot;) that they cause, and (4) employing the right remedies (&quot;pratipakṣa&quot;).
# How to cultivate meditative observation (&quot;manaskārabhāvanā&quot;), four progressive stages are outlined. The first is &quot;the observation that toughens the mind&quot;, which leads to disenchantment with saṃsāra. Then one practices &quot;the observation that moistens the mind&quot; through recollecting the qualities of the three jewels. Thirdly, one practices the observation that produces inner comfort, relaxation, and ease (&quot;praśrabdhi-janako&quot;) through resting in śamatha and vipaśyanā meditation. Finally, one reaches &quot;the observation that perfects knowledge and the view...by first perfecting the practice of śamatha and thereupon repeatedly penetrating into the nature of phenomena with the insight of vipaśyanā.&quot; The goal of this is a mind that &quot;has become one-pointed, gentle, and peaceful, and the various types of negative temperaments no longer arise in the circumstances where they typically would be felt.&quot;

==== Yogasthāna 4 ====
The fourth section discusses the mundane and supramundane paths in detail. The mundane path deals with abandoning the sensual realm and practicing the meditative absorptions (&quot;dhyānas&quot;), which lead to rebirth in higher realms (but does not lead to awakening). The various meditative observations that lead to the practice of the &quot;dhyānas&quot; is taught in this section, and the characteristics of the eight &quot;dhyānas&quot; are analyzed in detail.

Other meditative attainments are also discussed, such as the meditative attainment of non-ideation (&quot;asaṃjñisamāpatti&quot;) and the meditative attainment of cessation (&quot;nirodhasamāpatti&quot;). The results of these practices are also presented, including the five types of extrasensory knowledge (&quot;pañcābhijñā&quot;), and rebirth in the realm of non-sensual corporeality (&quot;rūpadhātu&quot;) and the realm of incorporeality (&quot;ārūpyadhātu&quot;).

Turning to the supramundane path (&quot;lokottaraḥ mārgaḥ&quot;), practicing this path requires fully understanding the four noble truths and its sixteen characteristics through meditative observation. These sixteen characteristics are explained in detail, they are:

* The four characteristics of the truth of suffering are impermanence (&quot;anityākāra&quot;), suffering (&quot;duḥkhākāra&quot;), emptiness (&quot;*śūnyākāra&quot;), and selflessness (&quot;anātmākāra&quot;).
* The four characteristics of the origin of suffering are cause (&quot;hetu&quot;), origination (&quot;samudaya&quot;), production (&quot;prabhava&quot;), and condition (&quot;pratyaya&quot;).
* The characteristics the end of suffering are cessation (&quot;nirodha&quot;), peace (&quot;śānta&quot;), excellence (&quot;praṇīta&quot;), and escape (&quot;niḥsaraṇa&quot;).
* The characteristics of the path to the end of suffering are being the path (&quot;mārga&quot;), the method (&quot;nyāya&quot;), the practice (&quot;pratipatti&quot;), and what leads out [of suffering] (&quot;nairyāṇika&quot;).

This path leads to nirvana as an arhat, through the ultimate meditation that gains insight into the four noble truths, called the vajra-like meditation (&quot;vajropamaḥ samādhi&quot;).

=== 11 - &quot;Pratyekabuddhabhūmi&quot; ===
This short section titled &quot;The Foundation on the Solitary Buddha&quot; outlines the disposition, path and practices of the &quot;pratyekabuddha&quot;. Kragh notes that &quot;the pratyekabuddha avoids crowds and takes pleasure in solitude, exhibits little compassion and is not inclined to teach others, and is of mediocre aptitude and has a temperament of pride.&quot;

=== 12 - &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; ===
The Foundation on the Mahāyāna Bodhisattva, which is the longest book in the basic section, is divided into three &quot;yogasthānas&quot; and ten topics:

# the basis for being a bodhisattva (&quot;ādhāra&quot;)
# the characteristics of a bodhisattva (&quot;liṅga&quot;)
# the classes of bodhisattvas (&quot;pakṣa&quot;)
# the bodhisattva&#x27;s exalted conviction (&quot;adhyāśaya&quot;)
# the dwellings of a bodhisattva&#x27;s practice (&quot;vihāra&quot;)
# the bodhisattva&#x27;s rebirths (&quot;upapatti&quot;)
# how bodhisattvas lead sentient beings to perfection (&quot;parigraha&quot;)
# the spiritual levels (&quot;bhūmi&quot;)
# the bodhisattva&#x27;s practices (&quot;caryā&quot;)
# the ascension to Buddhahood (&quot;pratiṣṭhā&quot;)

==== Yogasthāna 1 ====
Yogasthāna one is titled the section on the basis (&quot;ādhārayogasthāna&quot;) because it deals with the basis (&quot;ādhāra&quot;) for becoming a bodhisattva (topic 1). There are three main aspects of the basis of a bodhisattva. The first is an inborn unique predisposition (&quot;svagotra&quot;) for the bodhisattva path, those who lack this are said to be unable to reach Buddhahood. The second is &quot;the basis of initially engendering the resolve to reach Buddhahood (&quot;prathamaś cittotpādaḥ&quot;), which refers to arousing &quot;bodhicitta&quot;, practicing the perfections for the benefit of oneself and others, and so forth. The third is &quot;the basis of practicing all the factors leading to Awakening&quot; (&quot;sarve bodhipakṣyā dharmāḥ&quot;).

Those who will become Buddhas are said to have a particular &#x27;original nature&#x27; (&quot;prakṛti&quot;), which is like a &#x27;seed&#x27; (&quot;bīja&quot;) that predisposes them to this path. This nature is accomplished through the cultivation of good qualities. These persons are seen as &quot;vastly superior to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and all ordinary sentient beings&quot; because they have the ability to remove cognitive hindrances (&quot;jñeyāvaraṇa&quot;) and afflictive hindrances (&quot;kleśāvaraṇa&quot;), while other beings are only able to remove afflictive hindrance. Also, bodhisattvas practice for the good and well-being of all sentient beings, while practitioners of other paths only practice for their own good. These persons are generally caring, compassionate, harmless, helpful, love solitude and have a natural capacity for understanding the Buddhadharma.

The bodhisattva&#x27;s resolve to attain Buddhahood is described in detail. Its conditions, causes, aspects, qualities and so forth are outlined. The book explains how a bodhisattva engenders this wish and how they must practice, which is divided into seven undertakings.

# Training for their own benefit 
# Training for the benefit of others, which must be balanced with the first undertaking.
# Training in realizing the nature of reality (&quot;tattvārtha&quot;), which in an ultimate sense refers to the insubstantiality of phenomena (&quot;dharmanairātmya&quot;) and that all phenomena are without the duality (&quot;advaya&quot;) of existence (&quot;bhāva&quot;) and non-existence (&quot;abhāva&quot;).
# Developing five types of spiritual power (&quot;prabhāva&quot;) such as different forms of clairvoyance (&quot;abhijñāprabhāva&quot;), and the power of the six perfections.
# Developing sentient beings, which depends on their innate dispositions for different paths and so on.
# Developing the qualities of a Buddha in themselves
# Highest and complete Awakening (&quot;anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhiḥ&quot;), which is only achieved through the removal of the afflictive hindrances and the cognitive hindrances.
Yogasthāna one also expounds on the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā) at length, they are:

* The perfection of generosity (&quot;dānapāramitā&quot;). &quot;Dāna&quot;&#x27;s nature is that &quot;the bodhisattva gives to others whatever they need&quot; without attachment, self-interest or partiality. This includes material things and the bodhisattva&#x27;s own body as well as teaching Dharma, but not weapons or things that cause harm.
* The perfection of discipline (&quot;śīlapāramitā&quot;). One practices ethical discipline (&quot;śīla&quot;) by receiving, keeping and restoring ethical vows (saṃvara) properly. This includes both vows for householders and monastics. It also includes doing all kinds of beneficial actions such as studying the Dharma, teaching others, caring for the sick, giving material goods, praising the good qualities of others, protecting others from danger, and leading others away from negative actions. The procedure for taking the bodhisattva vow is explained as well as the various transgressions of this vow. The four &quot;major&quot; transgressions are: (1) to belittle others and exalt oneself in hope of gain, (2) to refuse to help suffering beings by not giving alms or not sharing the Dharma (to those who ask for it), (3) to harm others and hold a grudge against others, (4) to disparage the bodhisattva teachings.
* The perfection of endurance (&quot;kṣāntipāramitā&quot;)&quot;. Kṣānti&quot; refers to patience, endurance and forbearance. Kragh states that this &quot;must be done with an attitude free from any hope of reward, must be purely motivated by compassion, and must fully forgive the wrongdoing in its entirety.&quot; There are three main modes of endurance: (1) patiently bearing wrongdoings inflicted by others, (2) accepting suffering (hardships and distress), and (3) the endurance of resolving to comprehend the Dharma through patient perseverance. A bodhisattva does this through different means, such as reflecting that suffering is caused by past karma, contemplating how people who harm us now may have been our relatives in a past life, and he contemplation of impermanence.
* The perfection of drive or enthusiasm (&quot;vīryapāramitā&quot;). &quot;Vīrya&quot; is a strong mental energy or force which aims at gathering good qualities and doing good activities. There are three types: (1) the armor-like drive (which willingly accepts working to help others for eons on end), (2) the drive for gathering good qualities (i.e. practicing the paramitas), and (3) the drive devoted to acting for the benefit of sentient beings (by performing beneficial actions).
* The perfection of meditation (&quot;dhyānapāramitā&quot;). &quot;Dhyāna&quot; refers to resting the mind (&quot;cittasthiti&quot;) so there is one-pointedness of mind (&quot;cittaikāgrya&quot;). This may refer to śamatha or vipaśyanā, or to a union of the two. It may be done for the sake of happiness in this life, for the sake of gaining the bodhisattva qualities (special samādhis unknown to other paths) and for the sake of helping other sentient beings.
* The perfection of wisdom (&quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot;). This refers to mastering the five fields of knowledge, which include mundane knowledge as well as ultimate spiritual knowledge (of both the śrāvaka and bodhisattva baskets) such as the four noble truths, cause and effect, etc. 
Following the exposition of the perfections, further sections teach various topics such as how to gather students (through giving, affectionate speech, meaningful activity and having a common aim), how to revere the three jewels (through various forms of &quot;puja&quot;), how to serve and rely on a qualified spiritual teacher (&quot;kalyāṇamitra&quot;, &quot;good friend&quot;) and how to cultivate the four immeasurables (&quot;apramāṇa&quot;).

Important qualities of a spiritual teacher include: being disciplined and pure in conduct, intelligent and well-educated in the doctrine, experienced and realized in meditation, compassionate, patient and caring, being without attachments and having few wants and needs, skilled at giving clear teachings, and being impartial in teaching others.

Regarding practicing the four immeasurables (&quot;apramāṇa&quot;), this section states that this can be done in three main ways: by focusing on sentient beings, by focusing on the phenomena (&quot;dharmās&quot;) which make up sentient beings or completely without focus or reference (&quot;anālambanāni&quot;). This section also discusses the special kind of compassion that a bodhisattva cultivates, namely great compassion (&quot;mahākaruṇā&quot;). This kind of compassion is directed towards the suffering of all beings and is cultivated for hundreds of thousands of aeons. A bodhisattva with great compassion would do anything to help sentient beings, such as give up their life in hundreds of rebirths, and endure any torment. The cultivation of the four immeasurables &quot;is said to lead to instant happiness in this life, vast accumulation of merit, development of a firm wish to reach Awakening, and ability to carry the sufferings of others.&quot;

The following chapters contain an exposition of all the factors leading to Awakening, the third main aspect of the basis for becoming a bodhisattva. This covers sixteen elements of a bodhisattvas training:

# To have conscience and a sense of embarrassment (&quot;hrīvyapatrāpya&quot;), an inner sense of right and wrong.
# To develop a firm strength (&quot;dhṛtibalādhānatā&quot;), a steadiness on the path which can control the deluded mind. It is developed by enduring suffering, recognizing negative behaviors and study.
# To develop tirelessness (&quot;akhedatā&quot;) in all beneficial undertakings through training in insight and compassion.
# To gain knowledge in the various fields of learning 
# To know the world (&quot;lokajñatā&quot;), which is to see how saṃsāra is an endless and insecure cycle of birth and death, and constantly changing circumstances.
# To lean on the four reliances (&quot;catvāri pratisaraṇāni&quot;). These are (1) to rely on the meaning and not on the words, (2) to rely on logic and not on the person giving the teaching, (3) to rely on scriptures of definitive meaning and not on scriptures of provisional meaning (4) when in doubt to rely on the essential understanding one has achieved oneself and not merely on knowledge one has heard from others.
# Mastering the four analytical knowledges (of the Dharma, meaning, derivative analysis, rhetoric).
# Gathering the requisites for Awakening (&quot;bodhisaṃbhāra&quot;), the requisite of merit (&quot;puṇyasaṃbhāra&quot;) and the requisite of knowledge (&quot;jñānasaṃbhāra&quot;).
# To practice the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (&quot;saptatriṃśad bodhipakṣyā dharmāḥ&quot;), but not to actualize them (&quot;na caināṃ sākṣātkaroti&quot;).
# To practice calming meditation (&quot;śamatha&quot;). According to Timme Kragh, &quot;the practice is essentially the same as that taught in the śrāvaka path but the bodhisattvaengages in these in a special way bringing in a Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā understanding.&quot;
# The bodhisattva&#x27;s practice of insight meditation (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;), which is focused on the ultimate level of the thirty-seven factors of Awakening and is preceded by calming meditation.
# The bodhisattva&#x27;s expertise in the methods (&quot;upāyakau-śalya&quot;).
# The bodhisattva&#x27;s mastery of retentiveness (&quot;dhāraṇī&quot;), which refers to the power of memory/remembering teachings as well as the power of mantras and formulas.
# To engender bodhisattva-aspirations (&quot;bodhisattva-praṇidhāna&quot;).
# To accomplish three meditative absorptions (&quot;samādhi&quot;): emptiness (&quot;śūnyatāsamādhi&quot;), wishlessness (&quot;apraṇihitaḥ samādhiḥ&quot;), and imagelessness (&quot;ānimittaḥ samādhiḥ&quot;).
# The teaching of the four summary statements (&quot;catvārimāni dharmoddānāni&quot;): (1) everything conditioned is impermanent (&quot;anityāḥ sarvasaṃskārāḥ&quot;), (2) everything conditioned is suffering (&quot;duḥkhāḥ sarvasaṃskārāḥ&quot;), (3) all phenomena are without a [permanent] self (&quot;anātmānaḥ sarvadharmāḥ&quot;), and (4) nirvāṇa is peace (&quot;śāṃtaṃ nirvāṇam&quot;).
The last section of Yogasthāna one contains four lists of qualities that advanced bodhisattvas have.

==== Yogasthāna 2 ====
Yogasthāna two (titled &quot;the section on the subsidiary factors ensuing from the basis&quot; &quot;ādhārānudharmayogasthāna&quot;) explains the characteristics (&quot;liṅga&quot;) of bodhisattvas (mainly: compassion, affectionate speech, courage, openhandedness, and the ability to unravel deep underlying meanings).

Furthermore, the classes (&quot;pakṣa&quot;) of bodhisattvas are explained (lay and monastic) along with their four main Dharmas or practices: good deeds, skillfulness and expertise (&quot;kauśalya&quot;), caring for others (&quot;parānugrāha&quot;) and dedicatory transfer of merit (&quot;pariṇāmanā&quot;). The monastic bodhisattvas are said to be superior.

The exalted conviction (&quot;adhyāśaya&quot;) of a bodhisattva is then explained, which refers to their pure motivation and mindset. A bodhisattva is said to have tenderness towards sentient beings, they are also said to have conviction in the Buddha&#x27;s teachings derived from faith and analysis. Different forms of conviction are then outlined.

Yogasthāna two also sets out thirteen levels or dwellings (&quot;vihāra&quot;) of accomplishment in the practice of a bodhisattva. This framework of the bodhisattva&#x27;s path to awakening is as follows:

# The abode of the predisposition (&quot;gotravihāra&quot;). This refers to someone with the predisposition for being a bodhisattva who has not given rise to the resolve for awakening.
# The abode of practicing with ascertainment (&quot;adhimukticaryā-vihāra&quot;). This is when a bodhisattva has given rise to the resolve for Awakening and begins to practice, but they have an impure conviction and unstable meditation.
# The abode of joy (&quot;pramuditavihāra&quot;). This is when a bodhisattva has pure conviction due to having their first glimpse of direct realization. Their meditation is now vast, uninterrupted, and certain.
# The abode higher discipline (&quot;adhiśīlavihāra&quot;) is when discipline is cultivated on the basis of pure conviction.
# The abode of higher mind (&quot;adhicittavihāra&quot;) is when one practices all stages of mundane meditation on the basis of higher discipline.
# The abode of higher insight associated with the factors of Awakening (&quot;bodhipakṣyapratisaṃyukto &#x27;dhiprajñavihāra&quot;) is the level of analyzing the thirty-seven factors of Awakening in order to realize the truths, beginning with the four foundations of mindfulness.
# The abode of higher insight associated with the truths (&quot;satyapratisaṃyukto &#x27;dhiprajñavihāra&quot;) is the level of fully realizing the truths as they are on the basis of having analyzed the factors of Awakening.
# The abode of higher insight associated with the arising and ceasing of dependent arising (&quot;pratītyasamutpādapravṛttinivṛttipratisaṃyukto &#x27;dhiprajñavihāra&quot;) is the level wherein the practitioner after having mastered the truths sees how suffering arises when the existential facts are not understood and how suffering comes to an end when the existential facts are understood (through the process of dependent origination).
# The abode free from conceptual characteristics where the path is steadily followed intentionally and with effort (&quot;sābhisaṃskāraḥ sābhogo niśchidra-mārgavāhano nirnimitto vihāraḥ&quot;). One constantly cultivates non-conceptual insight into the reality of all phenomena, while applying intention and effort.
# The abode free from conceptual characteristics where the path is automatically followed spontaneously and effortlessly (&quot;anabhisaṃskāro &#x27;anābhoga-mārgavāhano nirnimitta eva vihāraḥ&quot;). On this level, the bodhisattva is able to walk the path spontaneously and effortlessly.
# The abode of analytical knowledge (&quot;pratisaṃvidvihāra)&quot; is when the bodhisattva uses their mastery of insight and meditation to teach the Dharma to others using all terms, their meanings, their derivative analyses, and subdivisions.
# The highest and perfected bodhisattva abode (&quot;paramaḥ pariniṣ-panno bodhisattvavihāraḥ&quot;) is the culmination of the path, where the highest and complete Awakening is achieved. This life is their final rebirth or their penultimate rebirth before entering nirvāṇa.
# The abode of a Tathāgata (&quot;tathāgato vihāraḥ&quot;) is when a bodhisattva becomes a buddha, and performs all the various deeds of a buddha.

==== Yogasthāna 3 ====
Yogasthāna three (&quot;the section on the culmination of the basis&quot;, &quot;ādhāraniṣṭhāyogasthāna&quot;) explains general topics six through ten.

Topic six, is the five kinds of rebirths (&quot;upapatti&quot;) a bodhisattva undergoes during their journey, which are:

# Rebirth pacifying harm (&quot;itiśaṃśamanī upapattiḥ&quot;). A bodhisattva is reborn in a difficult time (famine, plague, etc.) in order to help others during this time.
# Rebirth assuming a corresponding form (&quot;tat-sabhāgānuvartinī upapatti&quot;). A bodhisattva is reborn among beings who harm others, such as animals, gods, demons, or heretics, and leads them to a good path.
# Rebirth into greatness (&quot;mahattvopapatti&quot;). A bodhisattva is born into excellent circumstances and becomes a great person who spiritually benefits others.
# Rebirth with authority (&quot;ādhipatyopapatti&quot;). A bodhisattva is born into a position of rulership over the world or the gods.
# The bodhisattva&#x27;s final rebirth in which they become a Buddha.

Topic seven outlines six ways that bodhisattvas lead (&quot;parigraha&quot;) sentient beings to perfection:

# Leading all sentient beings simultaneously (&quot;sakṛtsarvasattva-parigraha&quot;). Bodhisattvas regard all sentient beings as their partner.
# Leading through authority (&quot;ādhipatyaparigraha&quot;), through a position such as head of a household or a king.
# Leading an assembly (&quot;upādānaparigraha&quot;), which refers to residing over a perfect congregation.
# Guiding for a long time (&quot;dīrghakālikam upādānam&quot;), is when a bodhisattva must care and guides certain beings slowly and for a long time.
# Guiding for a short time (&quot;adīrghakālikam upādānam&quot;), is when they guide beings only for a short time.
# Final guiding (&quot;caramam upādānam&quot;) refers to caring for individuals who are very advanced.

Topic eight explains the seven bodhisattva levels (&quot;bhūmis&quot;) and how they related to the thirteen vihāras.

Topic nine sums up all the bodhisattva practices (&quot;caryā&quot;) into four main groups:

* The practice of the perfections (&quot;pāramitācaryā&quot;), the six perfections are outlined and four more perfections are also explained.
* The practice of the factors of Awakening (&quot;bodhipakṣyacaryā&quot;) which refers to the thirty-seven factors of Awakening, the four investigations, and the four complete knowledges of things as they really are.
* The practice of six clairvoyances (&quot;abhijñācaryā&quot;)
* The practice of developing sentient beings (&quot;sattva-paripākacaryā&quot;)

Finally, general topic number ten explains the bodhisattva&#x27;s ascension (&quot;pratiṣṭhā&quot;) to Buddhahood along with all the Buddha qualities which are manifested in them (140 exceptional buddha-qualities are outlined. including the 32 marks and the ten powers of a Tathāgata).

=== 13 - &quot;Sopadhikā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
The &quot;Foundation on Having an Existential Substratum&quot; discusses the state of the living arhat, as well as &quot;what it is that forms the remaining layer or basis for continued saṃsāric existence, namely the notion of there being an existential substratum (&quot;upadhi&quot;)&quot;, such as the five aggregates and so forth.

=== 14 - &quot;Nirupadhikā Bhūmiḥ&quot; ===
The last book, the &quot;Foundation on Being Without an Existential Substratum&quot; explains the state of an arhat who has died and entered &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; (final nirvana)&quot;,&quot; and thus is without a substratum for continued existence. This book discusses &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; which is said to be complete and eternal extinction and completion (&quot;nirvṛti&quot;).

== Supplementary Section ==
This part is made up of four &#x27;collections&#x27; or &#x27;compendia&#x27; (&quot;saṃgrahaṇī&quot;, &quot;shè&quot; 攝, &quot;bsdu ba&quot;), which supplement the Basic Section:

* Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī (Compendium of Ascertainment). This compendium discusses and provides a clarification (&quot;viniścaya&quot;) on aspects of the seventeen &quot;bhumis&quot; from the Basic Section. This section also contains a &quot;detailed treatment of &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; and at the same time quoting and making use of the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra&quot;.&quot; Thus it is considered a later strata by Schmithausen.
* Vyākhyāsaṃgrahaṇī (Compendium of Exegesis). This is a manual of hermeneutical and exegetical techniques, as well as on rhetorical and logical argument (&quot;hetuvidyā&quot;).
* Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī (Compendium of Related Terms). This text defines many of the various strings of quasi-synonymical expressions found in the Āgamas.
* Vastusaṃgrahaṇī (Compendium of [Selected] Themes). Lambert Schmithausen, Florin Delenau and Noritoshi Aramaki all hold that this is part of the oldest textual layer. It includes: 
** The &quot;Sūtravastusaṃgrahaṇī&quot; which summarizes and explains key topics of each sūtra contained in the &quot;Samyukta-āgama.&quot; 
** &#x27;The Compendium of the Vinaya&#x27; (&quot;Vinayavastusaṃgrahaṇī&quot;) 
** &#x27;The compendium of Abhidharma lists&#x27; (&quot;Mātṛkavastusaṃgrahaṇī&quot;).

The Chinese version also contains a Compendium of Abhidharma, missing from the Tibetan translation.

An Indian commentary was also written on the YBh, called the &quot;Yogācārabhūmivyākhyā.&quot;

<text>Dundee Football Club is a professional football club based in the city of Dundee, Scotland, founded in 1893. The team are nicknamed &quot;The Dark Blues&quot; or &quot;The Dee&quot;. The club plays its home matches at Dens Park.

The club was formed after a merger between clubs Dundee East End and Dundee Our Boys in order to apply for the SFL. Within a decade they had become a major force in Scottish football, finishing as league runners-up three times in the 1900s, and finished the decade as Scottish Cup winners in 1910. They remained a major side in Scottish football before a decline in the 1930s. After the return to football in the aftermath of the Second World War, the club experienced a revival in the late 1940s and 1950s under George Anderson with another runners-up finish and consecutive Scottish League Cup wins in 1952 and 1953.

The club&#x27;s most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of Bob Shankly, Dundee won the Scottish Football League title in 1962, before reaching the semi-finals of the 1962–63 European Cup the following season. The club again won the League Cup in the 1973–1974 season, but since that time has won no further major honour. Since the late 1980s the club has experienced issues with frequent relegations and financial issues, though has found stability in the latter as of late.

The club has a long-standing rivalry with fellow Dundee side Dundee United, which is situated on the same street. It is the most local football derby in Great Britain. Matches between the two are called the Dundee derby, and games are fiercely contested and are often considered one of the most exciting fixtures in Scottish football. Despite this, the rivalry is much friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the Old Firm, with families often split down the middle in terms of support.

==History==
===Late 19th and early 20th century===
Dundee F.C. was formed in 1893 by the merger of two local clubs, East End and Our Boys, with the intention of gaining election to the Scottish Football League (SFL). Their application was successful and they played their first League game on 12 August 1893 at West Craigie Park, securing a 3–3 draw against Rangers. Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was fifth which they achieved in seasons 1895–96 and 1896–97. They also reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in 1894–95 and 1897–98, losing to Renton and Kilmarnock respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a club record score of 0–11 to Celtic in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated Newton Heath (the future Manchester United) 2–1 at their then Carolina Port ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on 21 March 1896 when Scotland defeated Wales 4–0. Dundee&#x27;s goalkeeper Frank Barrett, midfielder Sandy Keillor and inside-forward Bill Thomson were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club&#x27;s history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of Dens Park. In season 1902–1903 they finished runners-up in the league championship to Hibernian. (In season 1902–1903 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.)

Dundee were also league runners-up in 1906–1907 and 1908–1909 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in 1908–1909 by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902 to 1903 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season 1909–1910. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club achieved success in the Scottish Cup. In season 1909–1910 Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the Scottish Cup Final. (Dundee took three games to beat Hibernian in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat Clyde.) The winning goal in the second replay was scored by John &#x27;Sailor&#x27; Hunter. In season 1910–1911 Dundee defeated Rangers 2–1 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to Hamilton in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in 1917 Dundee and Aberdeen were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished fourth in seasons 1919–1920, 1920–1921 and 1921–1922, and were unbeaten at home during season 1921–1922. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.

Dave Halliday had played on the left wing for his previous clubs – St Mirren and his hometown side Queen of the South. He went to Dundee in 1921, where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to centre forward with spectacular results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the 1923–1924 season with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time league goalscoring record for a single season. (Later, Halliday top-scored in England&#x27;s top division in 1928–29, to become the most recent of only two players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England). With Halliday, Dundee reached the 1924–25 Scottish Cup final, en route eliminating the holders, the Airdrieonians side of Hughie Gallacher. Dundee led Celtic 1–0 at half time in the final before losing out to a last-minute Jimmy McGrory winner. Halliday top-scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end-of-season tours with Dundee, he scored doubles against each of Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid CF, Valencia CF and FC Barcelona. He scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved south to set scoring records in England, where other teams profited from Dundee&#x27;s decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.

===Mid-20th century===

The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.

Back-to-back &#x27;B&#x27; Division titles earned George Anderson&#x27;s Dundee promotion in 1947, and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming champions of Scotland. Silverware was not far away; after spending a world record transfer fee of £23,500 on Billy Steel (much to the chagrin of some supporters of the club – who resented the aspect of finance in football, and instead wished for &#x27;homegrown&#x27; talent), they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.

Twelve months later the team were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup, and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included players such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.

In the 1958–59 Scottish Cup Dundee suffered a shock 1–0 defeat to Highland League side Fraserburgh. This is widely regarded as Dundee&#x27;s most embarrassing defeat in their history.

===1960s – Dundee&#x27;s golden age===
Bob Shankly (brother of Bill Shankly) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee became champions of Scotland when they won the Division One league title in the 1961–1962 season. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney, Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Bobby Seith, Gordon Smith and Ian Ure they clinched the title with a win against St Johnstone, which in turn relegated St Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three clubs (Hibs, Hearts and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant Old Firm.

The following season, 1962–1963, Dundee reached the semi-finals of the European Cup beating 1. FC Köln, Sporting CP and R.S.C. Anderlecht. Dundee lost to AC Milan on aggregate in the semi-finals, though they won (and kept a clean sheet) against Milan in the home leg at Dens Park.

The Dee reached the Scottish Cup final again in the 1963–1964 competition. Shankly left Dundee in February 1965.

The next manager after Shankly was former player Bobby Ancell from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967–68 League Cup final against the previous season&#x27;s European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell&#x27;s team scored three times at Hampden Park in Glasgow but still lost 5–3.

In the predecessor to the UEFA Cup and Europa League, Dundee reached the semi-finals of the 1967–68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Dundee eliminated opposition from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet Leeds United in the semi-final. After a 1–1 draw at Dens, a 1–0 second leg win took Leeds through.

===Late 20th century===
In 1973, under the management of David White and captaincy of Tommy Gemmell, the Scottish League Cup returned to Dens following a 1–0 win against Celtic.

In 1986, Dundee secured a 2–0 victory over Hearts at Dens Park on the final day of the season to deny the Edinburgh club their first league title in 26 years. Hearts had managed to stay unbeaten in the league since 28 September 1985, and simply had to continue this run for one more game to finish top of the table ahead of their closest challengers Celtic; however, two late goals from substitute Albert Kidd, coupled with Celtic&#x27;s 5–0 victory at St Mirren, ensured that the league championship went to Glasgow.

===21st century===
In 2000 the club hit the headlines when it signed Argentine international Claudio Caniggia, who later signed for Rangers. Caniggia was only one of many foreign signings in the Dundee side in the early 2000s, which also included former Newcastle United player Temur Ketsbaia. The signing of such high-profile players, along with many others, led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved firstly under the managership of Ivano Bonetti (who also made a short but notable playing contribution, linking up well with Caniggia) and then under Jim Duffy. Attendances were still short of the hoped-for numbers, and with spending significantly outweighing income, Dundee was soon forced into administration.

Before Dundee entered financial trouble, the team knocked out Glasgow side Partick Thistle 2–0 away from home in the third round of the Scottish Cup in 2003. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out Aberdeen 2–0 at Dens Park. Dundee continued their march towards Hampden Park with a 1–1 draw away and a 4–1 extra time victory over Falkirk at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing Inverness CT at Hampden Park. A goal by Georgi Nemsadze secured a 1–0 victory and a place in the Final against Rangers. In the final Barry Smith hit the post for Dundee but Lorenzo Amoruso scored to bring Dundee&#x27;s cup run to an end.

That year, due to the club&#x27;s failure to sell on players as anticipated, insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a £23m debt which meant they were forced to go into administration with many players such as Fabian Caballero, Craig Burley and Georgian captain Georgi Nemsadze leaving in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, financial restructuring saw the club become debt-free.

In 2007, James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as chairman and Chief Executive respectively, when their company P&amp;J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and Dave MacKinnon took the Marrs&#x27; place.

In 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager Alex Rae was sacked, with former manager Jocky Scott taking over for his third stint with the club.

In the 2009–10 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals Dundee United £500,000 for ex-Dundee midfielder Scott Robertson. Dundee won the Challenge Cup Final when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3–2.

In March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3–0 defeat by Airdrie United. He was replaced by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.

In September 2010, Dundee were again on the brink of going into administration due to a £365,000 unpaid tax bill. During negotiations with HM Revenue and Customs, the club&#x27;s offer to pay £100,000 immediately was rejected. On 14 September, the club went into administration. As punishment for entering administration the Scottish Football League docked Dundee 25 points on 1 November 2010. At the time the punishment was imposed, this left Dundee bottom of the First Division table with −11 points, 20 points behind the second-bottom team. On 10 December 2010 the Dark Blues Business Trust was set up by former Dundee owner Peter Marr and former director Steve Martin to help the club recover from their financial situation. On 17 December 2010 Dundee&#x27;s appeal against the points deduction was rejected. Dundee went on a record 23 match undefeated streak in the first division.

On 12 May 2011, Dundee FC exited administration. The club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; trust, Dundee FC Supporters&#x27; Society Ltd., became the majority shareholder, and Steve Martin of the DFC Business Trust joined the board of directors along with five of the Society Fans board.

On 6 November 2011, Harry MacLean resigned from his position as Chief Executive. MacLean, who had played a key role in saving the club during administration, accepted an invitation to re-join the club in a non-executive role before departing his position as Chief Executive. His resignation was followed just eleven days later by Stuart Murphy&#x27;s decision to step down as club chairman and director of the club which was effective immediately. On 27 December 2011, Harry MacLean resigned from his non-executive role causing questions to arise about the stability of the boardroom. Shortly after the gap left by MacLean was filled by Scot Gardiner.

On 16 July 2012, Dundee were invited to join the Scottish Premier League to replace Rangers after their financial crisis and subsequent admittance to the fourth tier of Scottish football.

Since the second period of administration, Dundee, along with their Supporters&#x27; Society, implemented regular KPI targets. These targets were set to ensure, in some part, that the failures that led to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil could not be repeated. Dundee were left after the second administration with only footballing debt and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focused on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. The debt post-admin was unexpectedly still over £200,000 which had to be quickly worked into the board&#x27;s already stretched budgets.

After an unsuccessful season in the Premier League, Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after John Brown replaced Barry Smith as manager toward the end of the season. The following season (2013–14), Dundee took part in the Scottish Championship (formerly the First Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish League system.

=== FPS ownership ===
Throughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013–14 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to £650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor Tim Keyes of Keyes Capital, Austin, Texas, appointed John Nelms to look after his interests. The 2013–14 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2–1 win over Dumbarton. After a heavy defeat to Falkirk and a draw against Alloa, manager John Brown was replaced by Paul Hartley. A 3–0 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4–1 loss to Dumbarton for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. Dens Park was sold out for the game against Dumbarton when Christian Nadé headed in the opening goal. Soon after, Peter MacDonald scored the second goal. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and Hamilton Academical managed to close the goal difference with a 10–2 victory over Greenock Morton. But Dundee got the three points, and clinched promotion to the Scottish Premiership.

Paul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed Greg Stewart on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and Philip Roberts who joined before the end of May. Released Hibernian players James McPake and Kevin Thomson were next to join, along with Alloa goalkeeper Scott Bain. Thomson was made captain after signing. Simon Ferry, released from Portsmouth, then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. Paul McGowan and Paul McGinn arrived from St Mirren and Dumbarton, then attacking midfielder Gary Harkins signed for his third spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from St Mirren. A number of first team players departed, namely Christian Nadé and Ryan Conroy, who both went on to join Raith Rovers, Gavin Rae who retired from playing and player-coach Matt Lockwood.

On the opening day of the 2014–2015 season, Dundee recorded a 1–1 draw against Kilmarnock at home, Gary Harkins put Dundee ahead from the spot after Kilmarnock conceded a penalty, with Craig Slater equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the 2014–2015 season on 23 August with a 1–0 win over St Mirren away from home, a 79th-minute goal from Peter MacDonald securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4–0 wins on the bounce over Peterhead and Raith Rovers.

Dundee managed to gain a top six place by mid-April thus securing their position in the Premiership for 2015–16 campaign. They secured the place for definite after Kilmarnock were defeated 2–1 by Aberdeen on 12 April and a derby victory on 8 April in a 3–1 win at home to Dundee United.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, in June, Dundee chairman Bill Colvin stepped down as chairman and sold his share in Dundee to then director Tim Keyes who became the new chairman of the club.

Dundee finished eighth in the 2015–16 Scottish Premiership, notably relegating rivals Dundee United at Dens Park.

Dundee were relegated to the Scottish Championship at the end of the 2018–2019 season. Manager Jim McIntyre and assistant manager Jimmy Boyle were sacked on 12 May. After playing the role of interim manager in Dundee&#x27;s final home game, former player James McPake was hired as manager on a permanent basis, with Jimmy Nicholl, then current assistant manager of Northern Ireland, brought in as assistant manager. The club finished the season (prematurely ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic) in third place, and the following season finished as runners-up. In the Premiership play-offs, Dundee defeated Raith Rovers and Premiership side Kilmarnock to earn promotion back into the top flight after two seasons. After an underwhelming return to the Premiership which again resulted in relegation, Dundee finished the 2022–23 Scottish Championship as champions under one-season manager Gary Bowyer. In January 2024, Dundee announced a strategic partnership with ALK Capital, the majority owners of English club Burnley with the focus of a pathway for players to develop for both sides. In November of the same year, Dundee struck up another strategic partnership with Mexican club Monterrey.

==Stadium==
Since 1899, Dundee have played their home matches at Dens Park which has a capacity of 11,775. Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as Tannadice Park, which is the home of city rivals Dundee United.

In 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland&#x27;s joint bid to host the 2008 European Football Championship. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively. However, when Austria and Switzerland were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.

In May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, had rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.

In October 2014, Dundee Supporter&#x27;s Society announced they had put forward plans to then club chairman, Bill Colvin, which would allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed this was not a plan to enable the Supporter&#x27;s Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, and that they will &quot;simply administer the scheme&quot;.

In April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings.

In August 2016, club owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area of Dundee, next to the city&#x27;s Ice Arena. It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being &quot;early doors&quot; in a video interview published on the club&#x27;s website.

In May 2018, the stadium was renamed Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for sponsorship reasons for the next two seasons. In October 2020, the club announced that Kilmac had extended its sponsorship for another year, again renaming the stadium to Kilmac Stadium. At the start of the 2023–24 season, the stadium sponsor changed to The Scot Foam Stadium.

In October 2023, Keyes and Nelms announced that their company, Dark Blue Property Holdings, had completed the purchase of Dens Park from John Bennett as part of the process of moving the club from Dens to the proposed new stadium at Camperdown.

In February 2024, Dark Blue Property Holdings Ltd announced that planning permission in principle documentation had been submitted to the council.

== Rivalries ==
Dundee&#x27;s traditional rivals are Dundee United, with whom they compete in the Dundee derby. The rivalry is unique, as the two teams&#x27; stadiums are located within 100 yards of each other, making them the two closest League grounds in Britain. The close proximity of the two teams also fuels the intensity of the rivalry. This intensity makes it one of the most exciting and notable derbies in Scotland. While it is far friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the Old Firm, both sets of fans regard the fixture to be of high importance, with derby results throughout the season being defining points in each teams&#x27; seasons.

Dundee traditionally dominated the fixture in its first few decades, but the momentum shifted in the 1970s, with United taking a foothold in the fixture. The history of late has been defined by the inability of both teams to consistently stay in the same division, with Dundee a division below United for quite a few seasons while dealing with the after-effects of multiple administrations. Dundee eventually returned to the Scottish Premiership in 2014, and in 2016 it was a Dundee derby victory over United that confirmed the latter&#x27;s own relegation. After a few years of Dundee being a league above United, the two were eventually reunited again in the Scottish Championship in 2019 following Dundee&#x27;s relegation.

Dundee and United also share a mutual rivalry with St Johnstone, due to the close proximity between Dundee and Perth, known as the Tayside derby. Dundee fans however treat the tie far less seriously than the Dundee derby and in comparison to their Perth counterparts, though the fixture took prominence after United&#x27;s relegation in 2016. The most notable fixture between the two occurred in 1962, where Dundee defeated St Johnstone 0–3 at the latter&#x27;s former ground, Muirton Park. This result both confirmed Dundee as league champions for the first and to date only time in their history, and confirmed St Johnstone&#x27;s relegation from the First Division.

<doc id="306516" wikidata="Q7310002" url="?curid=306516" title="Reid technique">
<text>The Reid technique is a method of interrogation after investigation and behavior analysis. The system was developed in the United States by John E. Reid in the 1950s. Reid was a polygraph expert and former Chicago police officer. The technique is known for creating a high pressure environment for the interviewee, followed by sympathy and offers of understanding and help, but only if a confession is forthcoming. Since its spread in the 1970s, it has been widely utilized by police departments in the United States.

Proponents of the Reid technique say it is useful in extracting information from otherwise unwilling suspects. Critics say the technique results in an unacceptably high rate of false confessions, especially from juveniles and people with mental impairments. Criticism has also been leveled in the opposite case—that against strong-willed interviewees, the technique causes them to stop talking and give no information whatsoever, rather than elicit lies that can be checked against for the guilty or exonerating details for the innocent.

==Background==
In 1931, the Wickersham Commission report, &quot;Lawlessness in Law Enforcement&quot;, showed that violent forms of interrogation (known as the &quot;third degree&quot; after investigation and interview) were widespread but actually reduced crime-solving by causing false confessions. Involuntary alleged confessions had already been inadmissible in federal criminal trials since 1897 &quot;Bram v. United States&quot;. From 1936, interrogations causing obvious physical harm were ruled inadmissible by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot;. 

A number of manuals were developed based on deception rather than assault, such as by W. R. Kidd in 1940, Clarence D. Lee in 1953 and Arther and Caputo in 1959. The most influential was from the writings of Fred E. Inbau from 1942, entitled &quot;Lie Detection and Criminal Interrogation&quot;. For the third edition in 1953, Inbau invited John Reid as co-author, for a new section on so-called lie detector techniques, such as the &quot;control question&quot;. 

Fred E. Inbau, a Northwestern University lawyer and criminologist, and John E. Reid, a law graduate who had worked in the Chicago Police Department, would publish other manuals together. Inbau had worked at the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory (SCDL), which was set up in 1929 to better combat crime after the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. Inbau become the director when it was sold by Northwestern to the Chicago police in 1938, and he trained police officers and prosecutors. Both Leonard Keeler, inventor of polygraph technology, and John Reid set up polygraph training clinics in Chicago after working at the SCDL. 

In 1955 in Lincoln, Nebraska, John E. Reid had helped gain a confession from a suspect, Darrel Parker, for Parker&#x27;s wife&#x27;s murder. This case established Reid&#x27;s reputation and popularized his technique. Parker recanted his confession the next day, but it was admitted to evidence at his trial. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison. He was later determined to be innocent, after another man confessed and was found to have been the perpetrator. Parker sued the state for wrongful conviction; it paid him $500,000 in compensation.

In spite of Parker&#x27;s false confession, Reid co-authored a text explaining his interrogation techniques. The first edition of the &quot;Reid Manual&quot; (&quot;Criminal Interrogation and Confessions&quot;) in 1962, was heavily criticized by the US Supreme Court. Its famous &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; warnings were made in large part in response to the psychological subjugation and risks of the Reid techniques. Inbau and Reid gained public notability themselves, due also to appearing in a 1964 inquiry into the federal government&#x27;s use of &quot;lie detectors&quot;. 

A second edition of the manual, in 1967, incorporated advice on how to use Miranda warnings. A third edition, in 1986, marked the start of what has been called &quot;the new Reid method&quot;.

Reid died in 1982, and Joseph Buckley became president of Reid Inc. By 2013, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the company trained &quot;more interrogators than any other company in the world&quot;, and Reid&#x27;s technique had been adopted by law enforcement agencies of many different types, with it being especially influential in North America.

== Process ==

The Reid technique consists of a three-phase process beginning with fact analysis, followed by the behavior analysis interview (a non-accusatory interview designed to develop investigative and behavioral information), followed, when appropriate, by the Reid nine steps of interrogation. According to process guidelines, individuals should be interrogated only when the information developed from the interview and investigation indicate that the subject is involved in the commission of the crime.

In the Reid technique, interrogation is an accusatory process, in which the investigator tells the suspect that the results of the investigation clearly indicate that they did commit the crime in question. The interrogation is in the form of a monologue presented by the investigator rather than a question and answer format. The demeanor of the investigator during the course of an interrogation is ideally understanding, patient, and non-demeaning. The Reid technique user&#x27;s goal is to make the suspect gradually more comfortable with telling the truth. This is accomplished by the investigator&#x27;s first imagining and then offering the suspect various psychological constructs as justification for their behavior.

For example, an admission of guilt might be prompted by the question, &quot;Did you plan this out or did it just happen on the spur of the moment?&quot; This is called an alternative question, which is based on an implicit assumption of guilt. Critics regard this strategy as hazardous, arguing that it is subject to confirmation bias (likely to reinforce inaccurate beliefs or assumptions) and may lead to prematurely narrowing an investigation.

=== Nine steps of interrogation ===
The Reid technique&#x27;s nine steps of interrogation are:

# Positive confrontation. Advise the suspect that the evidence has led the police to the individual as a suspect. Offer the person an early opportunity to explain why the offense took place.
# Try to shift the blame away from the suspect to some other person or set of circumstances that prompted the suspect to commit the crime. That is, develop themes containing reasons that will psychologically justify or excuse the crime. Themes may be developed or changed to find one to which the accused is most responsive.
# Try to minimize the frequency of suspect denials.
# At this point, the accused will often give a reason why he or she or they did not or could not commit the crime. Try to use this to move towards the acknowledgement of what they did.
# Reinforce sincerity to ensure that the suspect is receptive.
# The suspect will become quieter and listen. Move the theme of the discussion toward offering alternatives. If the suspect cries at this point, infer guilt.
# Pose the &quot;alternative question&quot;, giving two choices for what happened; one more socially acceptable than the other. The suspect is expected to choose the easier option but whichever alternative the suspect chooses, guilt is admitted. There is always a third option which is to maintain that they did not commit the crime.
# Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt in front of witnesses and develop corroborating information to establish the validity of the confession.
# Document the suspect&#x27;s admission or confession and have him or her prepare a recorded statement (audio, video or written).

== Validity ==
Critics claim the technique too easily produces false confessions, especially with juveniles, with second-language speakers in their non-native language, and with people whose communication/language abilities are affected by mental disabilities, including reduced intellectual capacity. While this criticism acknowledges that the technique can be &quot;effective&quot; in producing confessions, it is not accurate at getting guilty parties to confess, instead sweeping up people pushed to their mental limits by stress. Critics also dislike how police often apply the technique on subjects of unclear guilt, when simply gathering more information in non-stressful interrogations can be more useful both for convicting guilty suspects and exonerating innocent suspects.

Of 311 people exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing, more than a quarter had given false confessions—including those convicted in such notorious cases as the Central Park Five.

Some of the more minor details Reid propounded have since been called into question as well. For example, Reid believed that &quot;tells&quot; such as fidgeting was a sign of lying, and more generally believed that trained police interrogators could intuitively check lies merely by how they were delivered. Later studies have shown no useful correlation between any sort of body movements such as breaking eye contact or fidgeting and truth-telling. While police can be effective at cracking lies, it is via gathering contradicting evidence; police officers have been shown in studies to be no better than average people at detecting lies merely from their delivery.

Several European countries prohibit some interrogation techniques that are currently allowed in the United States, such as a law enforcement officer lying to a suspect about evidence, due to the perceived risk of false confessions and wrongful convictions that might result, particularly with juveniles. For example, §136a of the German (StPO, &quot;code of criminal procedure&quot;) bans the use of deception and intimidation in interrogations; the Reid method also conflicts with the German police&#x27;s obligation to adequately inform the suspect of their right to silence.

In Canada, provincial court judge Mike Dinkel ruled in 2012 that &quot;stripped to its bare essentials, the Reid technique is a guilt-presumptive, confrontational, psychologically manipulative procedure whose purpose is to extract a confession&quot;.

In December 2013, an unredacted copy of a secret FBI interrogation manual was discovered in the Library of Congress, available for public view. The manual confirmed American Civil Liberties Union concerns that FBI agents used the Reid technique in interrogations.

Abuses of interrogation methods include officers treating accused suspects aggressively and telling them lies about the amount of evidence proving their guilt. Such exaggerated claims of evidence, such as video or genetics, have the potential, when combined with such coercive tactics as threats of harm or promises of leniency, to cause innocent suspects to become psychologically overwhelmed.

In 2015, eight organizations, including John E. Reid &amp; Associates, settled with Juan Rivera, who was wrongfully convicted of the 1992 rape and murder of 11-year-old Holly Staker. A number of pieces of evidence excluded Rivera, including DNA from the PERK (Physical Evidence Recovery Kit) and the report from the electronic ankle monitor he was wearing at the time, as he awaited trial for a non-violent burglary, but he falsely confessed to the Staker crimes after being interrogated by the police several days after taking two polygraph examinations at Reid &amp; Associates. After his exoneration, Rivera filed a suit for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The case was settled out of court with John E. Reid &amp; Associates paying $2 million.

===Alternative models===
The PEACE (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure and Evaluate) model developed in Britain &quot;encourages more of a dialogue between investigator and suspect&quot;.

In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police adopted a new standard influenced by the PEACE model. Sergeant Darren Carr, who trains police with the new approach, described it as &quot;less Kojak and more Dr. Phil&quot;. This approach eschews the use of deceptive information to overwhelm suspects. It emphasizes information gathering over eliciting confessions and discourages investigators from presuming a suspect&#x27;s guilt.

<doc id="306519" wikidata="Q6075" url="?curid=306519" title="Wittenberg (district)">
<text>Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Roßlau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fläming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in Saxony. The capital and largest city is Wittenberg, famous for its association with the influential religious reformer Martin Luther and containing a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==
In 1994, the district was merged with the district of Jessen and a small part of the district of Gräfenhainichen. In 2007, 27 municipalities from the former district Anhalt-Zerbst were added to the district of Wittenberg.

== Geography ==
The area of the district is . The main rivers in the district are the Elbe and its tributary, the Schwarze Elster.
== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms shows two swords, which is the symbol of a field marshal in the Holy Roman Empire. This title was bestowed upon the counts of Saxony, who therefore added the symbol to their coat of arms. The center of the principality of Saxony was located in the area now covered by the district.

== Towns and municipalities ==
The district of Wittenberg consists of the following towns:

* Annaburg
* Bad Schmiedeberg 
* Coswig
* Gräfenhainichen
* Jessen (Elster) 
* Kemberg 
* Oranienbaum-Wörlitz
* Wittenberg 
* Zahna-Elster

After the resolution of 6 October 2005, as part of municipal reform, the (then) 27 towns and municipalities of the former Verwaltungsgemeinschaften of Coswig and Wörlitzer Winkel, formerly in the Anhalt-Zerbst district, were assigned to Wittenberg district on 1 July 2007.

<doc id="306520" wikidata="Q1452355" url="?curid=306520" title="Fred Hampton">
<text>Fredrick Allen Hampton Sr. (August 30, 1948 – December 4, 1969) was an American activist and revolutionary socialist. He came to prominence in his late teens and early 20s in Chicago as deputy chairman of the national Black Panther Party and chair of the Illinois chapter. He founded the anti-racist, anti-classist Rainbow Coalition, a prominent multicultural political organization that initially included the Black Panthers, Young Patriots (which organized poor whites), and the Young Lords (which organized Puerto Ricans), and an alliance among major Chicago street gangs to help them end infighting and work for social change. As a Marxist-Leninist, Hampton considered fascism the greatest threat, saying &quot;nothing is more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.&quot;

In 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Hampton as a radical threat. It tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among black progressive groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers organization. In December 1969, Hampton was drugged, then shot and killed in his bed during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by a tactical unit of the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office, who received aid from the Chicago Police Department and the FBI leading up to the attack. Law enforcement sprayed more than 100 gunshots throughout the apartment; the occupants fired once. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed and several others were seriously wounded. In January 1970, the Cook County Coroner held an inquest; the coroner&#x27;s jury concluded that Hampton&#x27;s and Clark&#x27;s deaths were justifiable homicides.

A civil lawsuit for wrongful death was later filed on behalf of the survivors and the relatives of Hampton and Clark. It was resolved in 1982 by a settlement of $1.85 million (equivalent to $ million in ); the U.S. federal government, Cook County, and the City of Chicago each paid one-third to a group of nine plaintiffs. Given revelations about the illegal COINTELPRO program and documents associated with the killings, many scholars now consider Hampton&#x27;s death, at age 21, a deliberate assassination at the FBI&#x27;s initiative.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and youth ===

Fredrick Allen Hampton Sr. was born on August 30, 1948, in present-day Summit Argo, Illinois (generally shortened to Summit), and moved with his parents to another Chicago suburb, Maywood, at age 10. His parents had come from Louisiana as part of the Great Migration of African Americans in the early 20th century out of the South. They both worked at the Argo Starch Company, a corn starch processor. As a youth, Hampton was gifted both in the classroom and athletically, and hoped to play center field for the New York Yankees. At 10 years old, he started hosting weekend breakfasts for other children from the neighborhood, cooking the meals himself in what could be described as a precursor to the Panthers&#x27; free breakfast program. In high school, he led walkouts protesting black students&#x27; exclusion from the competition for homecoming queen and calling on officials to hire more black teachers and administrators. Hampton graduated from Proviso East High School with honors and varsity letters, and a Junior Achievement Award, in 1966.

In 1966, Fred Hampton turned 18. At that time, he started identifying with the Third World socialist struggles, as well as reading communist revolutionaries Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Zedong. Shortly after, Hampton urged not only peace in the Vietnam War, but also North Vietnam&#x27;s victory.

Hampton became active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and assumed leadership of its West Suburban Branch&#x27;s Youth Council. In his capacity as an NAACP youth organizer, he demonstrated natural leadership abilities: from a community of 27,000, he was able to muster a youth group of 500 members strong. He worked to get more and better recreational facilities established in the neighborhoods and to improve educational resources for Maywood&#x27;s impoverished black community.

=== Activity in Chicago ===

In 1968, Hampton was accused of assaulting an ice cream truck driver, stealing $71 worth of ice cream bars, and giving them to kids in the street. He was convicted in May 1969 and served time in prison. In a memoir, Frank B. Wilderson III places this incident in the context of COINTELPRO efforts to disrupt the Black Panthers of Chicago by the &quot;leveling of trumped-up charges&quot;.

In 1969, Hampton, now deputy chairman of the BPP Illinois chapter, conducted a meeting condemning sexism. After 1969, the party considered sexism counter-revolutionary. In 1970, about 40–70% of party members were women.

Over the next year, Hampton and his friends and associates achieved many successes in Chicago. Perhaps the most important was a nonaggression pact among Chicago&#x27;s most powerful street gangs. Emphasizing that racial and ethnic conflict among gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty, Hampton strove to forge an anti-racist, class-conscious, multiracial alliance among the BPP, the Young Patriots Organization, and the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, leading to the Rainbow Coalition.

Hampton met the Young Lords in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood the day after they were in the news for occupying a police community workshop at the Chicago 18th District Police Station. He was arrested twice with Jimenez at the Wicker Park Welfare Office, and both were charged with &quot;mob action&quot; at a peaceful picket of the office. Later, the Rainbow Coalition was joined nationwide by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Brown Berets, AIM, and the Red Guard Party. In May 1969, Hampton called a press conference to announce that the coalition had formed. What the coalition groups would do was based on common action. Some of their joint issues were poverty, anti-racism, corruption, police brutality, and substandard housing. If there was a protest or a demonstration, the groups would attend the event and support each other.

Jeffrey Haas, who was Hampton&#x27;s lawyer, has praised some of Hampton&#x27;s politics and his success in unifying movements. But Haas criticizes the way Hampton and the BPP organized in a pyramidal/vertical structure, contrasting this with the horizontal structure of Black Lives Matter: &quot;They may also have picked up on the vulnerability of a hierarchical movement where you have one leader, which makes the movement very vulnerable if that leader is imprisoned, killed, or otherwise compromised. I think the fact that Black Lives Matter says &#x27;We&#x27;re leaderfull, not leaderless&#x27; perhaps makes them less vulnerable to this kind of government assault.&quot;
Hampton rose quickly in the Black Panthers based on his organizing skills, oratorical gifts, and charisma. Once he became leader of the Chicago chapter, he organized weekly rallies, participated in strikes, worked closely with the BPP&#x27;s local People&#x27;s Clinic, taught political education classes every morning at 6 am, and launched a project for community supervision of the police. Hampton was also instrumental in the BPP&#x27;s Free Breakfast Program. When Bob Brown left the party with Kwame Ture, in the FBI-fomented SNCC/Panther split, Hampton assumed chairmanship of the Illinois state BPP. This automatically made him a national BPP deputy chairman. As the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO began to decimate the nationwide Panther leadership, Hampton&#x27;s prominence in the national hierarchy increased rapidly and dramatically. Eventually, he was in line to be appointed to the party&#x27;s Central Committee Chief of Staff. He would have achieved this position had he not been killed.

===FBI investigation===
The FBI believed that Hampton&#x27;s leadership and talent for communication made him a major threat among Black Panther leaders. It began keeping close tabs on his activities. Investigations have shown that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was determined to prevent the formation of a cohesive Black movement in the United States. Hoover believed the Panthers, Young Patriots, Young Lords, and similar radical coalitions that Hampton forged in Chicago were a stepping stone to the rise of a revolution that could cause a radical change in the U.S. government.

The FBI opened a file on Hampton in 1967. It tapped Hampton&#x27;s mother&#x27;s phone in February 1968 and by May placed Hampton on the bureau&#x27;s &quot;Agitator Index&quot; as a &quot;key militant leader.&quot; In late 1968, the Racial Matters squad of the FBI&#x27;s Chicago field office recruited William O&#x27;Neal to work with it; he had recently been arrested twice for interstate car theft and impersonating a federal officer. In exchange for having his felony charges dropped and receiving a monthly stipend, O&#x27;Neal agreed to infiltrate the BPP as a counterintelligence operative.

O&#x27;Neal joined the party and quickly rose in the organization, becoming Director of Chapter Security and Hampton&#x27;s bodyguard. In 1969, the FBI Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in San Francisco wrote Hoover that the agent&#x27;s investigation had found that, in his city at least, the Panthers were primarily feeding breakfast to children. Hoover responded with a memo implying that the agent&#x27;s career prospects depended on his supplying evidence to support Hoover&#x27;s view that the BPP was &quot;a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means&quot;.

Using anonymous letters, the FBI sowed distrust and eventually instigated a split between the Panthers and the Blackstone Rangers. O&#x27;Neal instigated an armed clash between them on April 2, 1969. The Panthers became effectively isolated from their power base in the Chicago ghetto, so the FBI worked to undermine its ties with other radical organizations. O&#x27;Neal was instructed to &quot;create a rift&quot; between the party and Students for a Democratic Society, whose Chicago headquarters was near that of the Panthers.

The FBI released a batch of racist cartoons in the Panthers&#x27; name, aimed at alienating white activists. It also launched a disinformation program to forestall the formation of the Rainbow Coalition, but the BPP did make an alliance with the Young Patriots and Young Lords. In repeated directives, Hoover demanded that COINTELPRO personnel investigate the Rainbow Coalition, &quot;destroy what the [BPP] stands for&quot;, and &quot;eradicate its &#x27;serve the people&#x27; programs&quot;.

Documents secured by Senate investigators in the early 1970s revealed that the FBI actively encouraged violence between the Panthers and other radical groups; this provoked multiple murders in cities throughout the country. On July 16, 1969, an armed confrontation between party members and the Chicago Police Department resulted in one BPP member being mortally wounded, and six others arrested on serious charges.

In early October, Hampton and his girlfriend Deborah Johnson (now known as Akua Njeri), who was pregnant with their child (Fred Hampton Jr.), rented a four-and-a-half-room apartment at 2337 West Monroe Street to be closer to BPP headquarters. O&#x27;Neal reported to his superiors that much of the Panthers&#x27; &quot;provocative&quot; arms stockpile was stored there. He drew them a map of the apartment. In early November, Hampton traveled to California on a speaking engagement with the UCLA Law Students Association. He met with the remaining BPP national hierarchy, who appointed him to the party&#x27;s central committee. He was soon to take the position of chief of staff and major spokesman.
==Assassination==

=== Prelude ===
On the night of November 13, 1969, while Hampton was in California, Chicago police officers John J. Gilhooly and Frank G. Rappaport were killed in a gun battle with Panthers; one died the next day. A total of nine police officers were shot. Spurgeon Winter Jr, a 19-year-old Panther, was killed by police. Another Panther, Lawrence S. Bell, was charged with murder. In an unsigned editorial headlined &quot;No Quarter for Wild Beasts,&quot; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; urged that Chicago police officers approaching suspected Panthers &quot;should be ordered to be ready to shoot.&quot;

As part of the larger COINTELPRO operation, the FBI was determined to prevent any improvement in the effectiveness of the BPP leadership. The FBI orchestrated an armed raid with the Chicago police and Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney on Hampton&#x27;s Chicago apartment. They had obtained detailed information about the apartment, including a layout of furniture, from O&#x27;Neal. An augmented, 14-man team of the SAO (state Special Prosecutions Unit) was organized for a predawn raid; they were armed with a search warrant for illegal weapons.

On the evening of December 3, Hampton taught a political education course at a local church, which was attended by most Panther members. Afterward, as was typical, he was accompanied to his Monroe Street apartment by Johnson and several Panthers: Blair Anderson, James Grady, Ronald &quot;Doc&quot; Satchell, Harold Bell, Verlina Brewer, Louis Truelock, Brenda Harris and Mark Clark. O&#x27;Neal was already there, having prepared a late dinner, which the group ate around midnight. O&#x27;Neal had slipped the secobarbital into a drink that Hampton consumed during the dinner to sedate Hampton so he would not awaken during the subsequent raid. O&#x27;Neal left after dinner. At about 1:30 am, December 4, Hampton fell asleep mid-sentence while talking to his mother on the telephone.

Although Hampton was not known to take drugs, Cook County chemist Eleanor Berman later reported that she had run two tests, each showing evidence of barbiturates in Hampton&#x27;s blood. An FBI chemist failed to find similar traces, but Berman stood by her findings.

=== Raid ===

The office of Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney Edward Hanrahan organized the raid, using officers attached to his office. Hampton had recently strongly criticized Hanrahan, saying that Hanrahan&#x27;s talk about a &quot;war on gangs&quot; was really rhetoric used to enable him to carry out a &quot;war on black youth.&quot;

At 4 a.m., the heavily armed police team arrived at the site, divided into two teams, eight for the front of the building and six for the rear. At 4:45 a.m., they stormed the apartment. Mark Clark (22), sitting in the front room of the apartment with a shotgun in his lap, was on security duty. The police shot him in the chest, killing him instantly. An alternative account said that Clark answered the door and police immediately shot him. Either way, Clark&#x27;s gun discharged once into the ceiling. This single round was fired when he suffered a reflexive death-convulsion after being shot. This was the only shot fired by the Panthers.

Fred Hampton, drugged by barbiturates, was sleeping on a mattress in the bedroom with Deborah Johnson (18) who was eight and a half months pregnant with their child. Police officers removed her from the room while Hampton lay unconscious in bed. Then the raiding team fired at the head of the south bedroom. Hampton was wounded in the shoulder by the shooting. According to the National Archives and Records Administration, &quot;upon that discovery, an officer shot him twice in his head and killed him.&quot;

Fellow Black Panther Harold Bell said that he heard the following exchange:
&quot;That&#x27;s Fred Hampton.&quot;

&quot;Is he dead?... Bring him out.&quot;

&quot;He&#x27;s barely alive.&quot;

&quot;He&#x27;ll make it.&quot;

The injured Panthers said they heard two shots. According to Hampton&#x27;s supporters, the shots were fired point-blank at Hampton&#x27;s head. According to Johnson, an officer then said: &quot;He&#x27;s good and dead now.&quot;
Hampton&#x27;s body was dragged into the bedroom doorway and left in a pool of blood. The officers directed their gunfire at the remaining Panthers who had been sleeping in the north bedroom. This included Ronald &quot;Doc&quot; Satchel (18), Blair Anderson (18), Verlina Brewer (17), and Brenda Harris (19). Brewer, Satchel, Anderson, and Harris were seriously wounded, then beaten and dragged into the street. They were arrested on charges of aggravated assault and attempted murder of the officers. They were each held on $100,000 bail.

In the early 1990s, Jose &quot;Cha Cha&quot; Jimenez, founder of the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican separatist street gang, who had developed close ties to Hampton and the Chicago Black Panther Party during the late 1960s, interviewed Johnson about the raid. She said:
:I believe Fred Hampton was drugged. The reason why is because when he woke up when the person [Truelock] said, &quot;Chairman, chairman,&quot; he was shaking Fred&#x27;s arm, you know, Fred&#x27;s arm was folded across the head of the bed. And Fred—he just raised his head up real slow. It was like watching a slow motion. He raised. His eyes were open. He raised his head up real slow, you know, with his eyes toward the entranceway, toward the bedroom and laid his head back down. That was the only movement he made [...]

The seven Panthers who survived the raid were indicted by a grand jury on charges of attempted murder, armed violence, and other weapons charges. These charges were subsequently dropped. During the trial, the Chicago Police Department claimed that the Panthers were the first to fire shots, but a later investigation found that the Chicago police fired between 90 and 99 shots, while the only Panthers shot was from Clark&#x27;s dropped shotgun.

After the raid, the apartment was left unguarded. The Panthers sent some members to investigate, accompanied by videographer Mike Gray and stills photographer Norris McNamara to document the scene. This footage was instrumental in proving the raid was an assassination. The footage was later released as part of the 1971 documentary &quot;The Murder of Fred Hampton&quot;. After a break-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, the existence of COINTELPRO, an illegal counter-intelligence program, was revealed and reported. With this program revealed, many activists and others began to suspect that the police raid and Hampton&#x27;s killing were conducted under this program. One of the documents released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton&#x27;s apartment. Another document outlined a deal that the FBI brokered with US deputy attorney general Richard Kleindienst to conceal the FBI&#x27;s role in Hampton&#x27;s death and the existence of COINTELPRO.

==Aftermath==
At a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the &quot;violent&quot; and &quot;extremely vicious&quot; Panthers and defended themselves accordingly. In a second press conference on December 8, the police leadership praised the assault team for their &quot;remarkable restraint,&quot; &quot;bravery,&quot; and &quot;professional discipline&quot; in not killing all the Panthers present. Photographic evidence was presented of &quot;bullet holes&quot; allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but reporters soon challenged this claim. An internal investigation was undertaken, and the police claimed that their colleagues on the assault team were exonerated of any wrongdoing, concluding that they &quot;used lawful means to overcome the assault.&quot;

Five thousand people attended Hampton&#x27;s funeral. He was eulogized by black leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Ralph Abernathy, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s successor as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In his eulogy, Jackson said that &quot;when Fred was shot in Chicago, black people in particular, and decent people in general, bled everywhere.&quot; On December 6, members of the Weather Underground destroyed numerous police vehicles in a retaliatory bombing spree at 3600 N. Halsted Street, Chicago.

The police called their raid on Hampton&#x27;s apartment a &quot;shootout.&quot; The Black Panthers called it a &quot;shoot-in,&quot; because so many shots were fired by police.

On December 11 and 12, the two competing daily newspapers, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, published vivid accounts of the events but drew different conclusions. The &quot;Tribune&quot; has long been considered the politically conservative newspaper, and the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; the liberal paper. On December 11, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published a page 1 article titled, &quot;Exclusive – Hanrahan, Police Tell Panther Story.&quot; The article included photographs supplied by Hanrahan&#x27;s office that depicted bullet holes in a thin white curtain and door jamb as evidence that the Panthers fired multiple bullets at the police.

Jack Challem, editor of the &quot;Wright College News&quot;, the student newspaper at Wright Junior College in Chicago, had visited the apartment on December 6, when it was still unsecured. He took numerous photographs of the crime scenes. A member of the Black Panthers was allowing visitors to tour the apartment. Challem&#x27;s photographs did not show the bullet holes reported by the &quot;Tribune&quot;. On the morning of December 12, after the &quot;Tribune&quot; article had appeared with the Hanrahan-supplied photos, Challem contacted a reporter at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, showed him his own photographs, and encouraged the other reporter to visit the apartment. That evening, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; published a page 1 article with the headline: &quot;Those &#x27;bullet holes&#x27; aren&#x27;t.&quot; According to the article, the alleged bullet holes (supposedly the result of the Panthers shooting in the direction of the police) were nail heads.

Four weeks after witnessing Hampton&#x27;s death at the hands of the police, Johnson gave birth to their son, Fred Hampton Jr.

Civil rights activists Roy Wilkins and Ramsey Clark, styled as &quot;The Commission of Inquiry into the Black Panthers and the Police&quot;, alleged that the Chicago police had killed Hampton without justification or provocation and had violated the Panthers&#x27; constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. &quot;The Commission&quot; further alleged that the Chicago Police Department had imposed a summary punishment on the Panthers.

A federal grand jury did not return any indictment against any of the individuals involved with the planning or execution of the raid, including the officers involved in killing Hampton. O&#x27;Neal, who had given the FBI the floor plan of the apartment and drugged Hampton, later admitted his involvement in setting up the raid. He committed suicide on January 15, 1990.

=== Inquest ===
Shortly after the raid, Cook County Coroner Andrew Toman began forming a special six-member coroner&#x27;s jury to hold an inquest into the deaths of Hampton and Clark. On December 23, Toman announced four additions to the jury, who included two African-American men: physician Theodore K. Lawless and attorney Julian B. Wilkins, the son of J. Ernest Wilkins Sr. He said the four were selected from a group of candidates submitted to his office by groups and individuals representing both Chicago&#x27;s black and white communities. Civil rights leaders and spokesmen for the black community were reportedly disappointed with the selection.

An official with the Chicago Urban League said, &quot;I would have had more confidence in the jury if one of them had been a black man who has a rapport with the young and the grass roots in the community.&quot; Gus Savage said that such a man to whom the community could relate need not be black. The jury eventually included a third black man, who had been a member of the first coroner&#x27;s jury sworn in on December 4.

The blue-ribbon panel convened for the inquest on January 6, 1970. On January 21, they ruled the deaths of Hampton and Clark to be justifiable homicides. The jury qualified their verdict on Hampton&#x27;s death as &quot;based solely and exclusively on the evidence presented to this inquisition&quot;; police and expert witnesses provided the only testimony during the inquest.

Jury foreman James T. Hicks stated that they could not consider the charges made by surviving Black Panthers who had been in the apartment; they had told reporters that the police had entered the apartment shooting. The survivors were reported to have refused to testify during the inquest because they faced criminal charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault during the raid. Attorneys for the Hampton and Clark families did not introduce any witnesses during the proceedings but called the inquest &quot;a well-rehearsed theatrical performance designed to vindicate the police officers&quot;. Hanrahan said the verdict was recognition &quot;of the truthfulness of our police officers&#x27; account of the events&quot;.

=== Federal grand jury ===
Released on May 15, 1970, the reports of a federal grand jury criticized the actions of the police, the surviving Black Panthers, and the Chicago news media. The grand jury called the police department&#x27;s raid &quot;ill conceived&quot; and said many errors were committed during the post-raid investigation and reconstruction of the events. It said that the surviving Black Panthers&#x27; refusal to cooperate hampered the investigation, and that the press &quot;improperly and grossly exaggerated stories&quot;.

=== 1970 civil rights lawsuit ===
In 1970, the survivors and relatives of Hampton and Clark filed a civil suit, stating that the civil rights of the Black Panther members were violated by the joint police/FBI raid and seeking $47.7 million in damages. Twenty-eight defendants were named, including Hanrahan as well as the City of Chicago, Cook County, and federal governments. It took years for the case to get to trial, which lasted 18 months. It was reported to have been the longest federal trial up to that time. After its conclusion in 1977, Judge Joseph Sam Perry of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the suit against 21 of the defendants before jury deliberations. After jurors deadlocked on a verdict, Perry dismissed the suit against the remaining defendants.

The plaintiffs appealed. In 1979, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago found that the government had withheld relevant documents, thereby obstructing the judicial process. Reinstating the case against 24 of the defendants, the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial. The Supreme Court of the United States heard an appeal by defendants but voted 5–3 in 1980 to remand the case to the District Court for a new trial.

In 1982, the City of Chicago, Cook County, and the federal government agreed to a settlement in which each would pay $616,333 (equivalent to $ million per payee in ) to a group of nine plaintiffs, including the mothers of Hampton and Clark. The $1.85 million settlement (equivalent to $ million in ) was believed to be the largest ever in a civil rights case. G. Flint Taylor, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, said, &quot;The settlement is an admission of the conspiracy that existed between the FBI and Hanrahan&#x27;s men to murder Fred Hampton.&quot; Assistant United States Attorney Robert Gruenberg said the settlement was intended to avoid another costly trial and was not an admission of guilt or responsibility by any of the defendants.

=== Controversy ===
Ten days after Hampton was slain, Bobby Rush, the then deputy minister of defense for the Illinois Black Panther Party, called the raiding party an &quot;execution squad.&quot; As is typical in settlements, the three government defendants did not acknowledge claims of responsibility for plaintiffs&#x27; allegations.

Michael Newton is among the writers who have concluded that Hampton was assassinated. In his 2016 book &quot;Unsolved Civil Rights Murder Cases, 1934–1970&quot;, Newton writes that Hampton &quot;was murdered in his sleep by Chicago police with FBI collusion.&quot; This view is also presented in Jakobi Williams&#x27;s book &quot;From the Bullet to the Ballot: The Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party and Racial Coalition Politics in Chicago&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Hampton was very close with Chicago Black Catholic priest George Clements, who served as his mentor and as a chaplain for the local Panther chapter. Hampton and the Panthers also used Clements&#x27;s parish, Holy Angels Catholic Church in Chicago (now the parish of Our Lady of Africa), as a refuge in times of particular surveillance or pursuit from the police. They also provided security for several of Clements&#x27;s &quot;Black Unity Masses&quot;, part of his revolutionary activities during the Black Catholic Movement. Clements spoke at Hampton&#x27;s funeral, and also said a Requiem Mass for him at Holy Angels.

==Legacy==
===Legal and political effects===
According to a 2007 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; report, &quot;The raid ended the promising political career of Cook County State&#x27;s Atty. Edward V. Hanrahan, who was indicted but cleared with 13 other law-enforcement agents on charges of obstructing justice. Bernard Carey, a Republican, defeated him in the next election, in part because of the support of outraged black voters.&quot; The families of Hampton and Clark filed a $47.7 million civil suit against the city, state, and federal governments. The case went to trial before Federal Judge J. Sam Perry. After more than 18 months of testimony and at the close of the plaintiff&#x27;s case, Perry dismissed the case. The plaintiffs appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ordering the case to be retried. More than a decade after the case had been filed, the suit was finally settled for $1.85 million. The two families each shared in the settlement.

Jeffrey Haas, with his law partners G. Flint Taylor and Dennis Cunningham and attorney James D. Montgomery, were the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the federal suit &quot;Hampton v. Hanrahan&quot;, conducted additional research and wrote a book about these events. It was published in 2009. He said that Chicago was worse off without Hampton:
In 1990, the Chicago City Council unanimously passed a resolution, introduced by then-Alderman Madeline Haithcock, commemorating December 4, 2004, as Fred Hampton Day in Chicago. The resolution read in part:
&quot;Fred Hampton, who was only 21 years old, made his mark in Chicago history not so much by his death as by the heroic efforts of his life and by his goals of empowering the most oppressed sector of Chicago&#x27;s Black community, bringing people into political life through participation in their own freedom fighting organization.&quot;

===Monuments and streets===
* A public pool was named in his honor in his hometown of Maywood, Illinois.
* On September 7, 2007, a bust of Hampton by sculptor Preston Jackson was erected outside the Fred Hampton Family Aquatic Center in Maywood.
* In March 2006, supporters of Hampton&#x27;s charity work proposed the naming of a Chicago street in his honor. Chicago&#x27;s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police opposed this effort.
* On April 19, 2022 the Village Board of Maywood designated Hampton&#x27;s childhood home as a historical landmark.

===Weather Underground reaction===
Two days after the killings of Hampton and Clark, on December 6, 1969, members of the Weathermen destroyed numerous police vehicles in a retaliatory bombing spree at 3600 N. Halsted Street in Chicago. After that, the group became more radical. On May 21, 1970, the group issued a &quot;Declaration of War&quot; against the U.S. government and, for the first time, used its new name, the &quot;Weather Underground Organization&quot;. They adopted fake identities and decided to pursue covert activities only. These initially included preparations to bomb a U.S. military non-commissioned officers&#x27; dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in what Brian Flanagan later said was intended to be &quot;the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory&quot;.&quot;We&#x27;ve known that our job is to lead white kids into armed revolution... Kids know the lines are drawn: revolution is touching all of our lives. Tens of thousands have learned that protest and marches don&#x27;t do it. Revolutionary violence is the only way.&quot;

—Bernardine Dohrn

===Media and popular culture===
====In film====
A 27-minute documentary, &quot;Death of a Black Panther: The Fred Hampton Story&quot;, was used as evidence in the civil suit. The 2002 documentary &quot;The Weather Underground&quot; shows in detail how that group was deeply influenced by Hampton and his death—as well as showing that Hampton kept his distance from them for being what he called &quot;adventuristic, masochistic and Custeristic&quot;.

Much of the first half of &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; episode 12, &quot;A Nation of Law?&quot;, chronicles Hampton&#x27;s leadership and extrajudicial killing. The events of his rise to prominence, Hoover&#x27;s targeting of him, and Hampton&#x27;s subsequent death are also recounted with footage in the 2015 documentary &quot;The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution&quot;.

&quot;The Murder of Fred Hampton&quot; is a documentary shot from within the movement, released in 1971. It has no narration, relying solely on footage shot from within the Black Panther organization and portraying Hampton and his colleagues on their own terms.

In the 1999 TV miniseries &quot;The 60s&quot;, Hampton appears serving free breakfast with the BPP. David Alan Grier plays Hampton.

&quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; (2020) features Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Hampton, in which he advises Bobby Seale as he was denied counsel, with the Chicago Seven.

&quot;Judas and the Black Messiah&quot; is a 2021 film about O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s betrayal of Hampton. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton and was directed by Shaka King. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2021. For his performance, Kaluuya won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

====In literature====
* Jeffrey Haas wrote an account of Hampton&#x27;s death, &quot;The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther&quot; (2009).
* Stephen King refers to Hampton in the novel &quot;11/22/63&quot; (2012), in which a character discusses the ripple effect of traveling back in time to prevent John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. He postulates that other events would follow that could have prevented Hampton&#x27;s assassination as well.

====In music====
* In his song &quot;Murder to Excellence&quot;, American rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z referred to being born on the same day Hampton was murdered. Hampton&#x27;s son condemned Jay-Z for doing so.
* American rock band Rage Against the Machine referenced Hampton in its 1996 song Down Rodeo, saying, &quot;They ain&#x27;t gonna send us campin&#x27; like they did my man Fred Hampton.&quot;
* Kendrick Lamar refers to Hampton in his song HiiiPoWeR, which also contains references to black civil rights activists Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Huey Newton.
* Artists SEIITH and Kiko King referenced Hampton in their 2020 song &quot;Ghost of Fred Hampton&quot;.
* Killer Mike references Hampton&#x27;s murder in &quot;Don&#x27;t Die&quot; on his 2012 album R.A.P. Music.

<doc id="306521" wikidata="Q796988" url="?curid=306521" title="Guys and Dolls">
<text>Guys and Dolls is a musical with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. It is based on &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot; (1933) and &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;, which are two short stories by Damon Runyon, and also borrows characters and plot elements from other Runyon stories, such as &quot;Pick the Winner&quot;.

The show premiered on Broadway on November 24, 1950, where it ran for 1,200 performances and won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a 1955 film adaptation starring Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, and Vivian Blaine, who reprised her role of Adelaide from Broadway.

&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; is considered one of the greatest Broadway musicals. In 1998, Vivian Blaine, Sam Levene, Robert Alda and Isabel Bigley, along with the original Broadway cast of the 1950 Decca cast album, were 
inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; was conceived by producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of Damon Runyon&#x27;s short stories. These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique comic dialect he employed in his stories; mixing highly formal language, without contractions, and colorful slang. Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show&#x27;s book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.

Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book. Burrows later recalled:

Frank Loesser&#x27;s fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as &#x27;integrated&#x27;. The word &quot;integration&quot; usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.

Abe Burrows specifically crafted the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; for Lauren Bacall. In “Honest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?”, Burrows recalls &quot;I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real&quot;. Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon&#x27;s favorite actors. Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene&#x27;s limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn&#x27;t act. Levene&#x27;s lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet &quot;Sue Me&quot;.

Composer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote &quot;Sue Me&quot; for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: &quot;Alright, already, I&#x27;m just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it&#x27;s true, so nu? So sue me.&quot; Frank Loesser felt &quot;Nathan Detroit should be played as a brassy Broadway tough guy who sang with more grits than gravy. Sam Levene sang “Sue Me” with such a wonderful Runyonesque flavor that his singing had been easy to forgive, in fact it had been quite charming in its ineptitude.&quot; &quot;Musically, Sam Levene may have been tone-deaf, but he inhabited Frank Loesser&#x27;s world as a character more than a caricature&quot;, says Larry Stempel, a music professor at Fordham University and the author of &quot;Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theater&quot;.

The character of Miss Adelaide was created specifically to fit Vivian Blaine into the musical, after Loesser decided she was ill-suited to play the conservative Sarah. When Loesser suggested reprising some songs in the second act, Kaufman warned: &quot;If you reprise the songs, we&#x27;ll reprise the jokes.&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
A pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City (&quot;Runyonland&quot;). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race (&quot;Fugue for Tinhorns&quot;). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to &quot;Follow the Fold&quot; and repent. Nicely and Benny&#x27;s employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating craps game. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan&#x27;s strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the &quot;Biltmore garage.&quot; Its owner, Joey Biltmore requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke (&quot;The Oldest Established&quot;). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan&#x27;s choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown.

At the mission, Sky attempts to make a deal with Sarah; offering her &quot;one dozen genuine sinners&quot; in exchange for the date in Havana. Sarah refuses, and they argue over whom they will fall in love with (&quot;I&#x27;ll Know&quot;). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fiancée of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act (&quot;A Bushel and a Peck&quot;). After her show, she asks him to marry her once again, telling him that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She finds out that Nathan is still running the craps game. After kicking him out, she reads a medical book telling her that her long-running cold may be due to Nathan&#x27;s refusal to marry her (&quot;Adelaide&#x27;s Lament&quot;).

The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide&#x27;s favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love (&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General &quot;one dozen genuine sinners&quot;, implicitly accepting Sky&#x27;s deal. Brannigan discovers a group of gamblers waiting for Nathan&#x27;s craps game, and to convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan&#x27;s &quot;surprise bachelor party&quot;. This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.

In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a &quot;Cuban milkshake&quot; for himself and Sarah. She doesn&#x27;t realize that the drink contains Bacardi rum, and she gets drunk and kisses Sky (&quot;If I Were a Bell&quot;). Sky realizes that he genuinely cares for Sarah, and he takes her back to New York. They return at around 4:00 a.m., and Sky tells Sarah how much he loves the early morning (&quot;My Time of Day&quot;). They both spontaneously admit that they&#x27;re in love (&quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been in Love Before&quot;). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the craps game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana so Nathan could run the game in the mission, and she walks out on him.

===Act II===
The next evening, Adelaide performs her act (&quot;Take Back Your Mink&quot;). Nathan doesn&#x27;t show up for the elopement because he&#x27;s still running the craps game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again (&quot;Adelaide&#x27;s Second Lament&quot;).

Sarah admits to Arvide, her uncle and fellow mission worker, that she does love Sky, but she will not see him again. Arvide expresses his faith in Sky&#x27;s inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart (&quot;More I Cannot Wish You&quot;). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn&#x27;t believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him.

Nicely shows Sky to the crap game; now in the sewers (&quot;Crapshooters Dance&quot;). Big Jule, a gambler, has lost a large sum of money and refuses to end the game until he earns it back. Sky arrives and fails to convince the crapshooters to come to the mission. He gives Nathan $1,000 and claims that he lost the bet to protect Sarah. Sky makes a last-minute bet to get the sinners; if he loses, everyone gets $1,000, but if he wins, they go to the mission (&quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot;). He wins the bet. Nathan runs into Adelaide on his way there. She tries to get him to elope, but when he can&#x27;t, she walks out on him. Nathan professes his love for her (&quot;Sue Me&quot;), then leaves.

Sarah is shocked to see that Sky carried through on his promise. The General asks the gamblers to confess their sins, and while some do, one of them admits the real reason they are even there. The General is thrilled that good can come from evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor (&quot;Sit Down, You&#x27;re Rockin&#x27; the Boat&quot;). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the craps game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the craps game in the mission. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah&#x27;s shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her.

Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later (&quot;Marry the Man Today&quot;). A few weeks later, Nathan owns a newsstand and has officially closed the craps game. Sky, who is now married to Sarah, works at the mission band and has also stopped gambling. The characters celebrate as Nathan and Adelaide are married (&quot;Guys and Dolls (Finale/Reprise)&quot;).

The show had its pre-Broadway try-out at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia, opening Saturday, October 14, 1950. The musical premiered on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre (now Richard Rodgers Theatre) on November 24, 1950. It was directed by George S. Kaufman, with dances and musical numbers by Michael Kidd, scenic and lighting design by Jo Mielziner, costumes by Alvin Colt, and orchestrations by George Bassman and Ted Royal, with vocal arrangements by Herbert Greene. It starred Robert Alda (Sky Masterson), Sam Levene (Nathan Detroit), Isabel Bigley (Sarah) and Vivian Blaine (Miss Adelaide). Iva Withers was a replacement as Miss Adelaide. The musical ran for 1,200 performances, winning five 1951 Tony Awards, including the award for Best Musical. Decca Records issued the original cast recording on 78 rpm records, which was later expanded and re-issued on LP, and then transferred to CD in the 1980s.

===1953: First UK production===

The premiere West End production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; opened at the London Coliseum on May 28, 1953, a few days before the 1953 Coronation and ran for 555 performances, including a Royal Command Variety Performance for Queen Elizabeth on November 2, 1953. Credited with above-the-title-billing the London cast co-starred Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide and Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit, each reprising their original Broadway performances; Jerry Wayne performed the role of Sky Masterson since Robert Alda did not reprise his Broadway role in the first UK production which co-starred Lizbeth Webb as Sarah Brown. Before opening at the Coliseum, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; had an eight performance run at the Bristol Hippodrome, where the show opened on May 19, 1953, and closed on May 25, 1953. Lizbeth Webb was the only major principal who was British and was chosen to play the part of Sarah Brown by Frank Loesser. The show has had numerous revivals and tours and has become a popular choice for school and community theatre productions.

===1955 First Las Vegas production===

Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide, Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit and Robert Alda as Sky Masterson recreated their original Broadway performances twice daily in a slightly reduced version of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; when the first Las Vegas production opened a six-month run at the Royal Nevada, September 7, 1955, the first time a Broadway musical was performed on the Las Vegas Strip.

===New York City Center 1955, 1965 and 1966 revivals===
New York City Center mounted short runs of the musical in 1955, 1965 and 1966. A production starring Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit, Helen Gallagher as Adelaide, Ray Shaw as Sky and Leila Martin as Sarah had 31 performances, running from April 20 to May 1, and May 31 to June 12, 1955.

Another presentation at City Center, with Alan King as Nathan Detroit, Sheila MacRae as Adelaide, Jerry Orbach as Sky and Anita Gillette as Sarah, ran for 15 performances from April 28 to May 9, 1965. A 1966 production, starring Jan Murray as Nathan Detroit, Vivian Blaine reprising her role as Adelaide, Hugh O&#x27;Brian as Sky, and Barbara Meister as Sarah, ran for 23 performances, from June 8 to June 26, 1966.

===1976 Broadway revival===
An all-black cast staged the first Broadway revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; opened on July 10, 1976, in previews, officially on July 21, at The Broadway Theatre. It starred Robert Guillaume as Nathan Detroit, Norma Donaldson as Miss Adelaide, Jimmy Randolph as Sky, Ernestine Jackson as Sarah Brown, and Ken Page as Nicely-Nicely Johnson. Guillaume and Jackson were nominated for Tony and Drama Desk Awards, and Page won a Theatre World Award.

This production featured Motown-style musical arrangements by Danny Holgate and Horace Ott, and it was directed and choreographed by Billy Wilson. The entire production was under the supervision of Abe Burrows, and musical direction and choral arrangements were by Howard Roberts.

The show closed on February 13, 1977, after 12 previews and 239 performances. A cast recording was released subsequent to the show&#x27;s opening.

===1982 London revival===
Laurence Olivier wanted to play Nathan Detroit, and began rehearsals for a planned 1971 London revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; for the National Theatre Company then based at the Old Vic. However, due to poor health he had to stop, and his revival never happened.

In 1982, Richard Eyre directed a major revival at London&#x27;s National Theatre. Eyre called it a &quot;re-thinking&quot; of the musical, and his production featured an award-winning neon-lit set design inspired by Rudi Stern&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Let There Be Neon&quot;, and brassier orchestrations with vintage yet innovative harmonies. The show&#x27;s choreography by David Toguri included a large-scale tap dance number of the &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; finale, performed by the principals and entire cast. The revival opened March 9, 1982, and was an overnight sensation, running for nearly four years and breaking all box office records. The original cast featured Bob Hoskins as Nathan Detroit, Julia McKenzie as Adelaide, Ian Charleson as Sky and Julie Covington as Sarah. The production won five Olivier Awards, including for McKenzie and Eyre and for Best Musical. Eyre also won an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award, and Hoskins won the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award.

In October 1982, Hoskins was replaced by Trevor Peacock, Charleson by Paul Jones, and Covington by Belinda Sinclair; in the spring of 1983, McKenzie was replaced by Imelda Staunton and Fiona Hendley replaced Sinclair. This production closed in late 1983 to make way for a Broadway try-out of the ill-fated musical &quot;Jean Seberg&quot;, which following critical failure closed after four months. Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; returned to the National from April through September 1984, this time starring Lulu, Norman Rossington, Clarke Peters and Betsy Brantley. After a nationwide tour, this production transferred to the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran from June 1985 to April 1986.

Following Ian Charleson&#x27;s death from AIDS at the age of 40, in November 1990 two reunion performances of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, with almost all of the original 1982 cast and musicians, were given at the National Theatre as a tribute to Charleson. The tickets sold out immediately, and the dress rehearsal was also packed. The proceeds from the performances were donated to the new Ian Charleson Day Centre HIV clinic at the Royal Free Hospital, and to scholarships in Charleson&#x27;s name at LAMDA.

===1992 Broadway revival===

The 1992 Broadway revival was the most successful American remounting of the show since the original Broadway production which ran for 1,200 performances. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it starred Nathan Lane as Nathan Detroit (from whom Lane had taken his stage name), Peter Gallagher as Sky, Faith Prince as Adelaide and Josie de Guzman as Sarah. This production played at the Martin Beck Theatre from April 14, 1992, to January 8, 1995, with 1,143 performances.

The production received a rave review from Frank Rich in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating &quot;It&#x27;s hard to know which genius, and I do mean genius, to celebrate first while cheering the entertainment at the Martin Beck.&quot; It received eight Tony Award nominations, and won four, including Best Revival, and the show also won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. This revival featured various revisions to the show&#x27;s score, including brand new music for the &quot;Runyonland&quot;, &quot;A Bushel and a Peck&quot;, &quot;Take Back Your Mink&quot; and &quot;Havana&quot;. The orchestrations were redesigned by Michael Starobin, and there were new dance arrangements added to &quot;A Bushel and a Peck&quot; and &quot;Take Back Your Mink&quot;.

A one-hour documentary film captured the recording sessions of the production&#x27;s original cast album. Titled &quot;Guys and Dolls: Off the Record&quot;, the film aired on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series in December 1992, and was released on DVD in 2007. Complete takes of most of the show&#x27;s songs are featured, as well as coaching from director Zaks, and commentary sessions by stars Gallagher, de Guzman, Lane and Prince on the production and their characters.

Lorna Luft auditioned for the role of Adelaide in this production. Faith Prince ultimately played the role, and Luft later played the role in the 1992 National Tour.

===1996 London revival===
Richard Eyre repeated his 1982 success with another National Theatre revival of the show, this time in a limited run. It starred Henry Goodman as Nathan Detroit, Imelda Staunton returning as Adelaide, Clarke Peters returning as Sky and Joanna Riding as Sarah. Clive Rowe played Nicely-Nicely Johnson, and David Toguri returned as choreographer. The production ran from December 17, 1996, through March 29, 1997 and from July 2, 1997, to November 22, 1997. It received three Olivier Award nominations, winning one: Best Supporting Performance in a Musical went to Clive Rowe. Richard Eyre won the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Director, and the production won Best Musical.

===2005 West End revival===
The 2005 West End revival opened at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre in June 2005 and closed in April 2007. This revival, directed by Michael Grandage, starred Ewan McGregor as Sky, Jenna Russell as Sarah, Jane Krakowski as Adelaide, and Douglas Hodge as Nathan Detroit. During the run, Nigel Harman, Adam Cooper, Norman Bowman and Ben Richards took over as Sky; Kelly Price, Amy Nuttall and Lisa Stokke took over as Sarah; Sarah Lancashire, Sally Ann Triplett, Claire Sweeney, Lynsey Britton and Samantha Janus took over as Adelaide; and Nigel Lindsay, Neil Morrissey, Patrick Swayze, Alex Ferns and Don Johnson took over as Nathan Detroit. This production added the song &quot;Adelaide&quot; that Frank Loesser wrote for the 1955 film adaptation. According to a September 2007 article in &quot;Playbill&quot;, this West End production was scheduled to begin previews for a transfer to Broadway in February 2008, but this plan was dropped.

===2009 Broadway revival===
A Broadway revival of the show opened on March 1, 2009, at the Nederlander Theatre. The cast included Oliver Platt as Nathan Detroit, Lauren Graham, in her Broadway debut, as Adelaide, Craig Bierko as Sky and Kate Jennings Grant as Sarah. Des McAnuff was the director, and the choreographer was Sergio Trujillo. This version of the show moved the setting from the 1950s to the 1940s and added Damon Runyon himself as a non-speaking character. The show opened to generally negative reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;static&quot; and &quot;uninspired&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot; said, &quot;How can something so zippy be so tedious?&quot; and &quot;Time Out New York&quot; wrote, &quot;Few things are more enervating than watching good material deflate.&quot; However, the show received a highly favorable review from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and the producers decided to keep the show open in hopes of positive audience response. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on March 4 that producer Howard Panter &quot;[said] he&#x27;ll give &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at least seven weeks to find an audience&quot;. The revival closed on June 14, 2009, after 28 previews and 113 performances.

===2015 London revival===
A new production directed by Gordon Greenberg was originally presented at Chichester Festival Theatre in Summer 2014 before moving the Savoy Theatre on December 10, 2015, for previews with a full opening on January 6, 2016, running until March 12, 2016 (following preview runs at the Palace Theatre, Manchester and Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham in November 2015). The production starred David Haig as Nathan, Sophie Thompson as Adelaide, Jamie Parker as Sky, Siubhan Harrison as Sarah and Gavin Spokes as Nicely. The production then transferred to the Phoenix Theatre, with Oliver Tompsett as Sky, Samantha Spiro as Adelaide, Billy Boyle as Arvide, and Richard Kind as Nathan. On June 28, 2016, the role of Miss Adelaide was taken over by Rebel Wilson, and Nathan Detroit was played by Simon Lipkin. The production also toured around UK cities and Dublin starring Maxwell Caulfield as Nathan, Louise Dearman as Miss Adelaide, Richard Fleeshman as Sky and Anna O&#x27;Byrne as Sarah.

===2017 UK all-black production===
Talawa Theatre Company and Manchester&#x27;s Royal Exchange Theatre produced the UK&#x27;s first all-black &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in 2017. The production opened on December 2, 2017, and following an extension ran to February 27, 2018, at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. The cast included Ray Fearon as Nathan Detroit, Ashley Zhangazha as Sky Masterson, Abiona Omonua as Sarah Brown, and Lucy Vandi as Miss Adelaide.

In this production, the musical was relocated to Harlem, 1939, with the music referencing jazz, and gospel. Director Michael Buffong said, &quot;Pre-war Harlem was all about the hustle. The creativity of that era was born from a unique collision of talent and circumstance as people escaped the agricultural and oppressive south via the &#x27;underground railroad&#x27; into the highly urbanised and industrialised north. Much of our popular culture, from dance to music, has its roots in that period. Our &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; brings all of this to the fore.&quot;

Reviews particularly praised the music, relocation to Harlem, and sense of spectacle. Lyn Gardner in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;the gamblers ... are a bunch of sharp-suited peacocks clad in rainbow hues.&quot; Ann Treneman in &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Whoever had the idea of moving this classic musical from one part of New York to another bit, just up the road, needs to be congratulated. This version of Frank Loesser&#x27;s musical, which swirls around the lives of the petty gangsters and their &#x27;dolls&#x27; who inhabit New York&#x27;s underbelly, moves the action to Harlem at its prewar height in 1939. It is a Talawa production with an all-black cast and it is terrific from the get-go.&quot; Clare Brennan in &quot;The Observer&quot; stated, &quot;Relocated to Harlem, this fine new production of Frank Loesser&#x27;s classic musical retains a threat of violence under a cartoon-bright exterior.&quot;

=== 2023 London revival ===
A new revival directed by Nicholas Hytner, choreographed by Arlene Phillips and James Cousins and designed by Bunny Christie began previews at the Bridge Theatre in London on March 3, 2023, with an opening night on March 14. Similar to Hytner&#x27;s productions of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Bridge, the production has an immersive in-the-round staging where audience members in the pit stand and the stage platforms rise around them involving audience participation. The cast included Daniel Mays as Nathan Detroit, Celinde Schoenmaker as Sarah Brown, Marisha Wallace as Miss Adelaide, Andrew Richardson as Sky Masterson and Cedric Neal as Nicely Nicely Johnson.

A new cast recording was released digitally on September 29, 2023, and was physically released on October 27, 2023, by Broadway Records. This album features several bonus tracks including a pop remix of &quot;Luck Be A Lady&quot;, sung by Marisha Wallace, which is played after the curtain call and the Hi-Hi Boys&#x27; (Cedric Neal with Simon Anthony, Jordan Castle, Ryan Pidgen) versions of &quot;I&#x27;ll Know&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been in Love Before&quot; and &quot;If I Were A Bell&quot; which is performed during the interval.

Owain Arthur took over from Mays as Nathan Detroit from July 17 to October 14 while Mays undertook filming commitments before returning to the role on October 16 with George Ioannides replacing Richardson as Sky Masterson. From February 28, 2024, a new cast took over including Arthur returning as Nathan Detroit, Timmika Ramsay as Miss Adelaide, Jonathan Andrew Hume as Nicely Nicely Johnson with Schoenmaker and Ioannides remaining as Sarah Brown and Sky Masterson. Gina Beck took over from Schoenmaker as Sarah Brown from 2 September 2024. Following numerous extensions due to popular demand, the production closed at the Bridge Theatre on January 4, 2025.

==Reception==
The original Broadway production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; opened to unanimously positive reviews. This was a relief to the cast as they had a 41-performance pre-Broadway tryout in Philadelphia where each performance was different. Critics praised the musical&#x27;s faithfulness to Damon Runyon&#x27;s style and characterizations. Richard Watts of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; is just what it should be to celebrate the Runyon spirit...filled with the salty characters and richly original language sacred to the memory of the late Master&quot;. William Hawkins of the &quot;New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot; stated &quot;It recaptures what [Runyon] knew about Broadway, that its wickedness is tinhorn, but its gallantry is as pure and young as Little Eva&quot;. Robert Coleman of the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; wrote &quot;We think Damon would have relished it as much as we did&quot;.

The book and score were greatly praised as well; John Chapman, then Chief Theatre Critic, of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote &quot;The book is a work of easy and delightful humor. Its music and lyrics, by Frank Loesser, are so right for the show and so completely lacking in banality, that they amount to an artistic triumph&quot;. Coleman stated &quot;Frank Loesser has written a score that will get a big play on the juke boxes, over the radio, and in bistros throughout the land. His lyrics are especially notable in that they help Burrows&#x27;s topical gags to further the plot&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson wrote &quot;Mr. Loesser&#x27;s lyrics and songs have the same affectionate appreciation of the material as the book, which is funny without being self-conscious or mechanical&quot;.

Multiple critics asserted that the work was of great significance to musical theatre. John McClain of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; proclaimed &quot;it is the best and most exciting thing of its kind since &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. It is a triumph and a delight.&quot; Atkinson stated, &quot;we might as well admit that &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; is a work of art. It is spontaneous and has form, style, and spirit.&quot; Chapman asserted, &quot;In all departments, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; is a perfect musical comedy&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
===1955 film===

On November 3, 1955, the film version of the musical was released, starring Marlon Brando as Sky, Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit, and Jean Simmons as Sarah, with Vivian Blaine reprising her role as Adelaide. The film was written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by Samuel Goldwyn.

Levene lost the film role of Nathan Detroit to Sinatra even though Mankiewicz wanted Levene. &quot;You can&#x27;t have a Jew playing a Jew, it wouldn&#x27;t work on screen,&quot; Goldwyn argued. Frank Loesser felt Sinatra played the part like a &quot;dapper Italian swinger.&quot; Mankiewicz said &quot;if there could be one person in the world more miscast as Nathan Detroit than Frank Sinatra that would be Laurence Olivier and I am one of his greatest fans; the role had been written for Sam Levene who was divine in it.&quot; Sinatra did his best to give Nathan Detroit a few stereotyped Jewish gestures and inflections, but Frank Loesser hated &quot;how Sinatra turned the rumpled Nathan Detroit into a smoothie. Sam Levene&#x27;s husky untrained voice added to the song&#x27;s charm, not to mention its believability.&quot; Loesser died in 1969, still refusing to watch the film.

Around the time of the film&#x27;s release, American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim wrote film reviews for &quot;Films in Review&quot;. Sondheim (then aged 25) reviewed the film version of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and observed: &quot;Sinatra ambles through his role as Nathan Detroit as though he were about to laugh at the jokes in the script. He has none of the sob in the voice, and the incipient ulcer in the stomach, that the part requires and Sam Levene supplied so hilariously on the stage. Sinatra sings on pitch, but colorlessly; Levene sang off pitch, but acted while he sang. Sinatra&#x27;s lackadaisical performance, his careless and left handed attempt at characterization not only harm the picture immeasurably but indicate an alarming lack of professionality.&quot;

Three new songs written by Loesser were added to the film: &quot;Pet Me Poppa&quot;; &quot;A Woman in Love&quot;; and &quot;Adelaide&quot;, which was written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs from the stage musical were omitted from the movie: &quot;A Bushel and a Peck,&quot; &quot;My Time of Day,&quot; I&#x27;ve Never Been In Love Before,&quot; &quot;More I Cannot Wish You&quot; and &quot;Marry the Man Today.&quot; &quot;A Bushel and a Peck&quot; was later restored to the video release version.

===Planned new adaptation===
20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to the musical in early 2013, and was said to be planning a remake. In March 2019, TriStar Pictures acquired the remake rights, with Bill Condon hired as director two years later. In September 2024, Rob Marshall replaced Condon as the new director and co-wrote a new screenplay with his partner John DeLuca, along with John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. Serving as producers are Marshall, DeLuca, John Goldwyn, Marc Toberoff and Marc Platt.

<text>Operation Bernhard was an exercise by Nazi Germany to forge British bank notes. The initial plan was to drop the notes over Britain to bring about a collapse of the British economy during the Second World War. The first phase was run from early 1940 by the (SD) under the title (Operation Andreas). The unit successfully duplicated the rag paper used by the British, produced near-identical engraving blocks and deduced the algorithm used to create the alpha-numeric serial code on each note. The unit closed in early 1942 after its head, Alfred Naujocks, fell out of favour with his superior officer, Reinhard Heydrich.

The operation was revived later in the year; the aim was changed to forging money to finance German intelligence operations. Instead of a specialist unit within the SD, prisoners from Nazi concentration camps were selected and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp to work under SS Major Bernhard Krüger. The unit produced British notes until mid-1945; estimates vary of the number and value of notes printed, from £132.6 million up to £300 million. By the time the unit ceased production, they had perfected the artwork for US dollars, although the paper and serial numbers were still being analysed. The counterfeit money was laundered in exchange for money and other assets. Counterfeit notes from the operation were used to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining British secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara, and £100,000 from Operation Bernhard was used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader Benito Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid in September 1943.

In early 1945 the unit was moved to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, then to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels and finally to Ebensee concentration camp. Because of an overly precise interpretation of a German order, the prisoners were not executed on their arrival; they were liberated shortly afterwards by the American Army. Much of the output of the unit was dumped into the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes at the end of the war, but enough went into general circulation that the Bank of England stopped releasing new notes and issued a new design after the war. The operation has been dramatised in a comedy-drama miniseries &quot;Private Schulz&quot; by the BBC and in a 2007 film, &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; ().

==Background==

===British paper currency===

The designs used on British paper currency at the beginning of the Second World War were introduced in 1855 and had been altered only slightly over the intervening years. The notes were made from white rag paper with black printing on one side and showed an engraving of Britannia by Daniel Maclise of the Royal Academy of Arts in the top left-hand corner. The £5, also known as the White Fiver, measured , while the £10, £20 and £50 notes measured .

The notes had 150 minor marks that acted as security measures to identify forgeries. These were often assumed to be printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior to the release of any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.

A watermark appeared across the middle of every note; it differed depending on the value of the currency and the alphanumeric serial designation used. According to John Keyworth, the curator of the Bank of England Museum, as the paper currency had never been successfully counterfeited, the Bank of England &quot;was a little complacent about the design of its notes and the production of them&quot;; he described the notes as &quot;technologically ... very simple&quot;.

===Origins of the plan===
At a meeting on 18 September 1939 Arthur Nebe, the head of the —the central criminal investigation department of Nazi Germany—put forward a proposal to use known counterfeiters to forge British paper currency. The forged notes—amounting to £30 billion—would then be dropped over Britain, causing a financial collapse and the loss of its world currency status. Nebe&#x27;s superior officer, Reinhard Heydrich, liked the plan, but was unsure of using the police files to find the available individuals. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, described it as &quot;&quot;, &quot;a grotesque plan&quot;, although he saw it had potential. The main objection to the plan came from Walther Funk, the Reich Minister for Economic Affairs, who said it would breach international law. Adolf Hitler, the German Chancellor, gave the final approval for the operation to proceed.

Although the discussion was supposed to be secret, in November 1939 Michael Palairet, Britain&#x27;s ambassador to Greece, met a Russian émigré who gave him full details of the plan discussed at the 18 September meeting; according to the émigré&#x27;s report, the plan was titled &quot;Offensive against Sterling and Destruction of its Position as World Currency&quot;. Palairet reported the information to London, who alerted the US Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England. Although the Bank considered the existing security measures were sufficient, in 1940 it released a blue emergency £1 note which had a metal security thread running through the paper. It also banned the import of pound notes for the duration of the war in 1943, stopped producing new £5 notes and warned the public about the danger of counterfeit currency.

===Operation Andreas===

On receipt of Hitler&#x27;s go-ahead, Heydrich opened a counterfeiting unit under the operational title (Operation Andreas). Heydrich&#x27;s order to set up the unit stated that

This is not to be a forgery or counterfeiting in the usual sense, but authorised facsimile production. The notes must be such a perfect copy of the original that even the most experienced bank-note experts cannot tell the difference.

In early 1940 the forgery unit was set up in Berlin within the technical department of the (SD), headed by Alfred Naujocks, a major in the paramilitary Schutzstaffel (SS). Daily operational control fell under the auspices of Naujocks&#x27;s technical director, Albert Langer, a mathematician and code-breaker. The pair broke the task down into three stages: producing identical paper, preparing identical printing plates to the British notes, and duplicating the British serial numbering system.

The Germans decided to concentrate on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised it was because of the chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.

To break the coded arrangement of the alphanumeric serial designation, Langer worked with banking experts, examining records of currency from the previous 20 years in order to replicate the correct order. No records were kept by Operation Andreas and how the Germans identified the correct sequences is not known; the paper historian Peter Bower states that it is possible that techniques adapted from those used in cryptanalysis were used to break the sequences. The German engravers working on the engraving plates struggled to reproduce the vignette of Britannia, which they nicknamed &quot;Bloody Britannia&quot; because it was so difficult. After seven months the forgers finished what they thought was a perfect copy, although Kenworthy states that the figure&#x27;s eyes are incorrect.

By late 1940 Naujocks had been removed from his position after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.

==Revival under Krüger==

In July 1942, following changes in the aim of the plan, Heinrich Himmler revived the operation. Whereas the original plan was to bring about the collapse of the British economy through dropping the notes over the UK, Himmler&#x27;s new intention was to use the counterfeit money to finance German intelligence operations. The security services under Himmler&#x27;s control were poorly funded, and the counterfeit funds were used to cover the financial shortfalls in revenue from the .

SS Major Bernhard Krüger replaced Naujocks; searching through the offices used daily by Operation Andreas, he found the copper engraving plates and the machinery, although some of the wire gauzes used to make the watermarks were bent. He was ordered to use the Jewish prisoners incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camps, and set up his unit in blocks 18 and 19 at Sachsenhausen. The blocks were isolated from the rest of the camp by additional barbed wire fences, and a unit was assigned as guards.

Krüger visited several other concentration camps to assemble the people he needed, primarily selecting those with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, he called them in the formal and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that Krüger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a ping pong table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.
The printing equipment was delivered in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from Hahnemühle; it was large enough for four notes to be printed on each sheet. Production of counterfeit notes started in January 1943; it took a year for production to return to the levels achieved in Operation Andreas.

Each section of the process was overseen by one of the prisoners, and the day-to-day operations were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.

To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners stood in two columns and passed the notes among them to accumulate dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark the value of a bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.

The Nazi authorities were so pleased with the results of the operation that twelve prisoners, three of whom were Jewish, were awarded the War Merit Medal while six of the guards received the War Merit Cross, 2nd class.
In May 1944 Ernst Kaltenbrunner, an SS (General of the branch) in the (Reich Security Main Office; RSHA), ordered that the counterfeiting unit begin to produce forged US dollars. The artwork on the notes was more complex than that of the British currency and caused problems for the forgers. Additional challenges they faced included the paper, which contained minute silk threads, and the intaglio printing process, which added small ridges to the paper.

The prisoners realised that if they managed to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives would no longer be safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.

In late 1944 the prisoners had counterfeited the reverse of the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose algorithm was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.

===Laundering and use of the forged notes===
The counterfeit money was transported from Sachsenhausen to Schloss Labers, an SS-run facility in the South Tyrol. It was put through a money laundering operation run by Friedrich Schwend, who had been running an illegal currency and smuggling business since the 1930s. He negotiated a deal in which he would be paid 33.3% of the money he laundered; 25% was given to his agents undertaking the work—as payment to them and their sub-agents, and for expenses—leaving him with 8.3%. He recruited what he called &quot;salesmen&quot; in various territories, and built a network of 50 agents and sub agents; some of these were Jewish, deliberately selected because there was less chance that the authorities would consider them to be working for the Nazis. He informed his agents that the money had been seized from the banks of occupied countries.

Schwend was given two objectives: to exchange the counterfeit money for genuine Swiss francs or US dollars, and to assist with the funding of special operations, including buying black market arms from the Yugoslav Partisans then selling them to pro-Nazi groups in Southeast Europe. He also arranged for the counterfeit notes to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara. Counterfeit notes with a face value of £100,000 were used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader Benito Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid in September 1943.

==Final stages of the war==

Between late February and early March 1945, with the advance of the Allied armies, all production of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.

At the start of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee concentration camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips to and from the camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned what had happened to the first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.

Estimates of the number and value of notes printed during Operation Bernhard vary from a total of £132,610,945 (of which £10,368,445 were sent to the RSHA central office), up to £300 million (of which £125 million were usable notes).

==Aftermath and legacy==
Krüger hid at his home until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the British authorities. Forging an enemy&#x27;s currency was not a war crime; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was handed over to the French. They attempted to persuade him to forge passports for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a denazification process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company. In 1965 the East German writer Julius Mader published , an attack on the West German government for harbouring Krüger.

Schwend amassed a fortune from Operation Bernhard. He was captured by American forces in June 1945, who tried to use him to assist in setting up a counterintelligence network in Germany, the Gehlen Organization. After he was caught trying to defraud the network, he fled to Peru. Although he periodically acted as an informant for Peruvian intelligence, he was arrested for currency smuggling and selling state secrets. After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a suspended sentence for manslaughter.
Lake Toplitz has been the site of several large-scale searches. In 1958 an expedition located several cases of the counterfeit money from Operation Bernhard and a book that detailed the Bank of England&#x27;s numbering system. Following the death of a diver in the lake in 1963—his two companions on the lake included &quot;a former Nazi secret agent and ... a German business man mentioned in connection with counterfeit gold coins&quot;—the Austrian government undertook a month-long search of the lake, during which they recovered more boxes of notes. The zoologist Hans Fricke from the Max Planck Institute searched the lake bottom for several years for rare aquatic life; in 1989 he took Krüger in a mini-submarine on one of his exploratory trips. In 2000 the submersible that was used to search the wreck of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; was used to survey the lake floor, and several boxes of notes were recovered, witnessed by Adolf Burger, a former prisoner involved in the counterfeiting operation.

On seeing the quality of the notes, one bank official described them as &quot;the most dangerous ever seen&quot;; the watermark was the most reliable source for detecting the forgeries. Counterfeit notes worth £15–20 million were in general circulation at the end of the war. With such a volume in general circulation, in April 1943 the Bank of England stopped releasing all notes of £10 and above. In February 1957 a new £5 banknote was issued; the blue note was printed on both sides and &quot;relied on subtle colour changes and detailed machine engraving&quot; for security. Other denominations were also reintroduced: the £10 in February 1964, the £20 in July 1970 and the £50 note in March 1981.

The &quot;Tilhas Tizig Gesheften&quot;, a small group formed from the British Army&#x27;s Jewish Brigade, obtained a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend&#x27;s money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to Palestine, in defiance of the British blockade of the territory.

Several memoirs have been published by former prisoners, which include the 1949 Norwegian account by , and &quot;Des Teufels Werkstatt&quot;, the 1983 German-language account by Adolf Burger. Both works have been translated into English; several histories about the operation have also been published.

In 1981 &quot;Private Schulz&quot;, a fictional version of Operation Bernhard, was broadcast on the BBC as a comedy-drama. The television serial starred Michael Elphick and Ian Richardson. In 2007 Burger&#x27;s memoirs were used as the basis for a film adaption, &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; (), which tells the story of Salomon Sorowitsch, a character loosely based on the lives of Smolianoff and Burger. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 80th Academy Awards.

It is the policy of the Bank of England to redeem all withdrawn notes for current currency at the face value shown on the note, except for counterfeit currency. Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher face value than the original £5. There are also examples of the notes in the museum of the National Bank of Belgium and the Bank of England Museum. The International Spy Museum holds an example of an Operation Bernhard printing plate.

<text>Empire of the Sun is a 1984 novel by English writer J. G. Ballard; it was awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Like Ballard&#x27;s earlier short story &quot;The Dead Time&quot; (published in the anthology &quot;Myths of the Near Future&quot;), it is essentially fiction but draws extensively on Ballard&#x27;s experiences in World War II. The name of the novel is derived from the etymology of the name for Japan.

Ballard later wrote of his experiences in China as a boy and the making of the film of the same name in his autobiography &quot;Miracles of Life&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel recounts the story of a young English boy, Jamie (&quot;Jim&quot;) Graham (named after Ballard&#x27;s two first names, &quot;James Graham&quot;), who lives with his parents in Shanghai. After the Pearl Harbor attack, Japan occupies the Shanghai International Settlement, and in the following chaos Jim becomes separated from his parents.

He spends some time in abandoned mansions, living on remnants of packaged food. Having exhausted the food supplies, he decides to try to surrender to the Imperial Japanese Army. After many attempts, he finally succeeds and is interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre.

Although the Japanese are &quot;officially&quot; the enemies, Jim identifies partly with them, both because he adores the pilots with their splendid machines and because he feels that Lunghua is still a comparatively safer place for him.

Towards the end of the war, with the Japanese army collapsing, the food supply runs short. Jim barely survives, with people around him starving to death. The camp prisoners are forced upon a march to Nantao, with many dying along the route. Jim then leaves the march and is saved from starvation by air drops from American bombers. Jim returns to Lunghua camp, soon returning to his pre-war residence with his parents.

==Film adaptation==

The book was adapted by Tom Stoppard in 1987. The screenplay was filmed by Steven Spielberg, to critical acclaim, being nominated for six Oscars and winning three BAFTA awards (for cinematography, music and sound). It starred a then 13-year-old Christian Bale, as well as John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson;

<text>Ebla (Sumerian: &quot;eb₂-la&quot;, , modern: , Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the and in the first half of the Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age. The first Eblaite kingdom has been described as the first recorded world power.

Starting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age ( ), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king in  .

Ebla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city&#x27;s palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite, and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status, and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated from 1964 and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to 2500 –2350 . Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid-3rd millennium &#x27;s Levant.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Ebla&quot; means &quot;white rock&quot; and may refer to the limestone outcrop on which the city was built.

==History==
===Chalcolithic===
In the central mound, finds from the Late Ubaid and Late Chalcolithic has been found.

===Early Bronze===
Ebla was first settled around 3500 ; its growth was supported by many satellite agricultural settlements. The city benefited from its role as an entrepôt of growing international trade, which probably began with an increased demand for wool in Sumer. Archaeologists designate this early habitation period &quot;Mardikh I&quot;; it ended around 3000 .

Mardikh I is followed by the first and second kingdoms era between about 3000 and 2000 , designated &quot;Mardikh II&quot;. I. J. Gelb considered Ebla as part of the Kish civilization, which was a cultural entity of East Semitic-speaking populations that stretched from the center of Mesopotamia to the western Levant.

====First kingdom====
During the first kingdom period between about 3000 and 2300 , Ebla was the most prominent kingdom among the Syrian states, especially during the second half of the 3rd millennium , which is known as &quot;the age of the archives&quot; after the Ebla tablets.

Mardiikh IIA: The early period between 3000 and 2400  is designated &quot;Mardikh IIA&quot;. General knowledge about the city&#x27;s history prior to the written archives is obtained through excavations. The first stages of Mardikh IIA is identified with building &quot;CC&quot;, and structures that form a part of building &quot;G2&quot;, which was apparently a royal palace built  . Toward the end of this period, a hundred years&#x27; war with Mari started. Mari gained the upper hand through the actions of its king Saʿumu, who conquered many of Ebla&#x27;s cities. In the mid-25th century , king Kun-Damu defeated Mari, but the state&#x27;s power declined following his reign.
Mardikh IIB1: The archive period, which is designated &quot;Mardikh IIB1&quot;, lasted from   until  . The end of the period is known as the &quot;first destruction&quot;, mainly referring to the destruction of the royal palace (called palace &quot;G&quot; and built over the earlier &quot;G2&quot;), and much of the acropolis. During the archive period, Ebla had political and military dominance over the other Syrian city-states of northern and eastern Syria, which are mentioned in the archives. Most of the tablets, which date from that period, are about economic matters but also include royal letters and diplomatic documents.

The written archives do not date from before Igrish-Halam&#x27;s reign, which saw Ebla paying tribute to Mari, and an extensive invasion of Eblaite cities in the middle Euphrates region led by the Mariote king Iblul-Il. Ebla recovered under King Irkab-Damu in about 2340 ; becoming prosperous and launching a successful counter-offensive against Mari. Irkab-Damu concluded a peace and trading treaty with Abarsal. This Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal is one of the earliest-recorded treaties in history.

===== Geography =====
At its greatest extent, Ebla controlled an area roughly half the size of modern Syria, from Ursa&#x27;um in the north, to the area around Damascus in the south, and from Phoenicia and the coastal mountains in the west, to Haddu in the east. Large parts of the kingdom were under the direct control of the king and were administered by governors; the rest consisted of vassal kingdoms. One of the most important of these vassals was Armi, which is the city most often mentioned in the Ebla tablets. Ebla had more than sixty vassal kingdoms and city-states, including Hazuwan, Burman, Emar, Halabitu and Salbatu.

According to Archi, these are &quot;the twelve Syrian cities long allied with Ebla that (presumably) assisted in some way during the expedition against Mari: NIrar, Ra’ak, Burman, Dub, Emar, Garmu, Lumnan, Ibubu, Ursaum, Utik, Kakmium, and Iritum (Irridu).&quot; Furthermore, the following cities were under Ebla’s hegemony at that time, and annually delivered tribute: Dub, Dulu, Harran, Ibubu, Iritum, Kablul, Sanapzugum, Ursaum, and Utik.

The vizier was the king&#x27;s chief official. The holder of the office possessed great authority; the most powerful vizier was Ibrium, who campaigned against Abarsal during the term of his predecessor Arrukum. Ibrium held office for 18 years with warfare occurring in all but one year. During the reign of Isar-Damu, Ebla continued the war against Mari, which defeated Ebla&#x27;s ally Nagar, blocking trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Ebla conducted regular military campaigns against rebellious vassals, including several attacks on Armi, and a campaign against the southern region of Ib&#x27;al – close to Qatna. In order to settle the war with Mari, Isar-Damu allied with Nagar and Kish. Some scholars have suggested that the Kish in question was not the Mesopotamian city but rather a town near Nagar in the Khabur area. The campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. The alliance also attacked Armi and occupied it, leaving Ibbi-Sipish&#x27;s son Enzi-Malik as governor. Ebla suffered its first destruction a few years after the campaign, probably following Isar-Damu&#x27;s death.

====First destruction of Ebla====
The first destruction occurred  ; palace &quot;G&quot; was burned, baking the clay tablets of the royal archives and preserving them. Many theories about the cause and the perpetrator have been posited:
* High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato supports an early dating for Ebla that would put the destruction at around 2500 . Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 , later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 . The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400  by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash – who boasted of taking tribute from Mari – or Lugalzagesi of Umma, who claimed to have reached the Mediterranean.
* Akkadian hypothesis: Both kings Sargon of Akkad and his grandson Naram-Sin claimed to have destroyed a town called Ibla, The discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, considers Sargon a more likely culprit; his view is supported by Trevor Bryce, but rejected by Michael Astour. The conquest of Armanum and Ebla on the Mediterranean coast by Naram-Sin is mentioned in several of his inscriptions:

* Mari&#x27;s revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the destruction happened approximately three or four years after the battle of Terqa. Archi and Biga say the destruction was caused by Mari in retaliation for its humiliating defeat at Terqa. This view is supported by Mario Liverani. Archi says the Mariote king Isqi-Mari destroyed Ebla before ascending the throne of his city.
* Natural catastrophe: Astour says a natural catastrophe caused the blaze which ended the archive period. He says the destruction was limited to the area of the royal palace and there is no convincing evidence of looting. He dates the fire to   (Middle Chronology).

====Second kingdom====
The second kingdom&#x27;s period is designated &quot;Mardikh IIB2&quot;, and spans the period between 2300 and 2000 . The second kingdom lasted until Ebla&#x27;s second destruction, which occurred anytime between 2050 and 1950 , with the 2000  dating being a mere formal date. The Akkadians under Sargon of Akkad and his descendant Naram-Sin invaded the northern borders of Ebla aiming for the forests of the Amanus Mountain; the intrusions were separated by roughly 90 years and the areas attacked were not attached to Akkad. Archi accept that the Ibla mentioned in the annals of Sargon and Naram-Sin is the Syrian Ebla but do not consider them responsible for the destruction which ended the Archive period. By the time of Naram-Sin, Armi was the hegemonic city in northern Syria and was destroyed by the Akkadian king.

A new local dynasty ruled the second kingdom of Ebla, but there was continuity with its first kingdom heritage. Ebla maintained its earliest features, including its architectural style and the sanctity of the first kingdom&#x27;s religious sites. A new royal palace was built in the lower town, and the transition from the archive period is marked only by the destruction of palace &quot;G&quot;. Little is known about the second kingdom because no written material have been discovered aside from one inscription dating to the end of the period.

The second kingdom was attested to in contemporaneous sources; in an inscription, Gudea of Lagash asked for cedars to be brought from Urshu in the mountains of Ebla, indicating Ebla&#x27;s territory included Urshu north of Carchemish in modern-day Turkey. Texts that dates to the seventh year of Amar-Sin ( ), a ruler of the Ur III empire, mention a messenger of the Ensí (&quot;Megum&quot;) of Ebla. The second kingdom was considered a vassal by the Ur III government, but the nature of the relation is unknown and it included the payment of tribute. A formal recognition of Ur&#x27;s overlordship appears to be a condition for the right of trade with that empire.

The second kingdom disintegrated toward the end of the and ended with the destruction of the city by fire, although evidence for the event has only been found outside of the so-called &quot;Temple of the Rock&quot;, and in the area around palace &quot;E&quot; on the acropolis. The reason for the destruction is not known; according to Astour, it could have been the result of a Hurrian invasion  , led by the former Eblaite vassal city of Ikinkalis. The destruction of Ebla is mentioned in the fragmentary Hurro-Hittite legendary epic &quot;Song of Release&quot; discovered in 1983, which Astour considers as describing the destruction of the second kingdom. In the epic, an Eblaite assembly led by a man called &quot;Zazalla&quot; prevents king Meki from showing mercy to prisoners from Ebla&#x27;s former vassal Ikinkalis, provoking the wrath of the Hurrian storm god Teshub and causing him to destroy the city.

===Middle Bronze===
====Third kingdom====
The third kingdom is designated &quot;Mardikh III&quot;; it is divided into periods &quot;A&quot; ( ) and &quot;B&quot; ( ). In period &quot;A&quot;, Ebla was quickly rebuilt as a planned city. The foundations covered the remains of Mardikh II; new palaces and temples were built, and new fortifications were built in two circles – one for the low city and one for the acropolis. The city was laid out on regular lines and large public buildings were built. Further construction took place in period &quot;B&quot;.

The first known king of the third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who described himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim&#x27;s inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite in the view of Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.

By the beginning of the Ebla had become a vassal of Yamhad, an Amorite kingdom centered in Aleppo. Written records are not available for this period, but the city was still a vassal during Yarim-Lim III of Yamhad&#x27;s reign. One of the known rulers of Ebla during this period was Immeya, who received gifts from the Egyptian Pharaoh Hotepibre, indicating the continuing wide connections and importance of Ebla. The city was mentioned in tablets from the Yamhadite vassal city of Alalakh in modern-day Turkey; an Eblaite princess married a son of King Ammitaqum of Alalakh, who belonged to a branch of the royal Yamhadite dynasty.

Ebla was destroyed by the Hittite King in about 1600 . Indilimma was probably the last king of Ebla; a seal of his crown prince Maratewari was discovered in the western palace &quot;Q&quot;. Alternatively, Maratewari could well be the last king according to Archi, who also argued that the &quot;Song of Release&quot; epic describes the destruction of the third kingdom and preserves older elements.

===Later periods===
Ebla never recovered from its third destruction. It was a small village in the phase designated &quot;Mardikh IV&quot; (1600–1200 ), and was mentioned in the records of Alalakh as a vassal to the Idrimi dynasty. &quot;Mardikh V&quot; (1200–535 ) was a rural, Early Iron Age settlement that grew in size during later periods. Further development occurred during &quot;Mardikh VI&quot;, which lasted until  . &quot;Mardikh VII&quot; began in the and lasted until the 7th century, after which the site was abandoned.

==Site==

===City layout===

Ebla consisted of a lower town and a raised acropolis in the center. During the first kingdom, the city had an area of 56 hectares and was protected by mud-brick fortifications. Ebla was divided into four districts – each with its own gate in the outer wall. The acropolis included the king&#x27;s palace &quot;G&quot;, and one of two temples in city dedicated to Kura (called the &quot;Red Temple&quot;). The lower city included the second temple of Kura in the southeast called &quot;Temple of the Rock&quot;. During the second kingdom, a royal palace (Archaic palace &quot;P5&quot;) was built in the lower town northwest of the acropolis, in addition to temple &quot;D&quot; built over the destroyed &quot;Red Temple&quot;.

During the third kingdom, Ebla was a large city nearly 60 hectares in size, and was protected by a fortified rampart, with double chambered gates. The acropolis was fortified and separated from the lower town. New royal palace &quot;E&quot; was built on the acropolis (during Mardikh IIIB), and a temple of Ishtar was constructed over the former &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;D&quot; temples (in area &quot;D&quot;). The lower town was also divided into four districts; palace &quot;P5&quot; was used during Mardikh IIIA, and replaced during Mardikh IIIB by the &quot;Intermediate Palace&quot;.

Other third kingdom buildings included the vizier palace, the western palace (in area &quot;Q&quot;), the temple of Shamash (temple &quot;N&quot;), the temple of Rasap (temple &quot;B1&quot;) and the northern palace (built over the &quot;Intermediate Palace&quot;). In the north of the lower town, a second temple for Ishtar was built, while the former &quot;Temple of the Rock&quot; was replaced by a temple of Hadad.

===Royal burials===

The kings of the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal mausoleum located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum &quot;G4&quot;). This first kingdom tomb was probably built during the reign of the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.

The third kingdom royal necropolis was discovered beneath palace &quot;Q&quot; (the western palace); it contains many hypogea but only three were excavated. Those tombs were natural caves in the bedrock of the palace&#x27;s foundation; they all date to the 19th and and had a similar plan consisting of an entrance shaft, burial chambers and a dromos connecting the shaft to the chamber.

====Hypogeum G4====
The royal tomb found in the royal palace &quot;G&quot; is designated hypogeum &quot;G4&quot;; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.

Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it is located underneath the western sector of the palace at a depth of almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other&#x27;s with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west–east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west–east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.

====Western palace tombs====

The tombs were found under the floor of Building Q, which was built in the Isin-Larsa period.
* The tomb of the princess: dating to  , it is the oldest and smallest of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained the remains of a young woman, hence the naming. The dromos has steps, partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved with stones, leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.
* The tomb of the cisterns: this tomb is the most damaged in the necropolis. It consists of a double room burial; the earliest, (Q79A), was built at the same period of the tomb of the princess, and was badly damaged when the tomb was reused, and a dromos was built in the place of Q79A toward the end of the (leading to the founding of burial Q79B). This was probably the resting place of a king; a club (a symbol of royal power) was discovered in Q79A.
* The tomb of the lord of the goats: it is the largest in the necropolis; it includes two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The occupier of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called the lord of the goats by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.

==Government==

The first kingdom&#x27;s government consisted of the king (styled &quot;Malikum&quot;) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (&quot;Abbu&quot;) and the administration. The second kingdom was also a monarchy, but little is known about it because of a lack of written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.

===Administration of the first kingdom===

The queen shared the running of affairs of state with the king. The crown prince was involved in internal matters and the second prince was involved in foreign affairs. Most duties, including military ones, were handled by the vizier and the administration, which consisted of 13 court dignitaries – each of whom controlled between 400 and 800 men forming a bureaucracy with 11,700 people. Each of the four quarters of the lower city was governed by a chief inspector and many deputies. To oversee royal interest, the king employed agents (mashkim), collectors (&quot;ur&quot;) and messengers (&quot;kas&quot;).

====Administrative divisions====
Many client kingdoms owed allegiance to Ebla and each was ruled by its own king (En); those vassal kings were highly autonomous, paying tribute and supplying military assistance to Ebla. The administrative center in the capital was named the &quot;SA.ZA&quot;; it included the royal palaces, storerooms and some temples. Regions beyond the walls of the capital were collectively named in Eblaite texts &quot;uru-bar&quot; (literally meaning outside of the city). The villages and towns under the central authority were either ruled directly from the capital, or had appointed officials. The titles of the civil servants do not clearly define the bearer&#x27;s responsibilities and authority as each town had its own political traditions.

*Lugal: while in Mesopotamia a designated a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was directly under the authority of the capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each was under the authority of the grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities directly under the authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla&#x27;s storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.
*Ugula: the title is translated as superintendent; some were independent rulers and some represented the highest authority of a tribal group. Many cities had an appointed as their head of administration such as the city of Darum.

====The chora====
The regions under the direct control of the king that were economically vital for the capital are called the &quot;chora&quot; by archaeologists. Regions under direct control of the king extended beyond the chora and it is difficult to determine the exact size of the kingdom and the chora due to the constant military expansion of Ebla which added new territories; some of those were ruled directly while others were allowed to retain their own rulers as vassals.

Generally, the chora is the core region of Ebla that includes the economic hinterland supporting the capital. It includes the cities and villages where the king or his vizier had palaces, towns that included important sanctuaries of gods related to the royal institution, towns visited by the monarch during the different rituals he participated in (such as the renewal of royalty ritual), and other cities such as the ones where textiles were delivered. The chora spans around 3000 km2; from west to east it includes the plains east of Jabal Zawiya, the Maṭkh swamp, al-Hass mountain and mount Shabīth. Areas directly on the borders of the chora such as al-Ghab, al-Rouge plain and al-Jabbul have close cultural affinity with the chora.

==People, language, and culture==
===The first and second kingdoms===

Mardikh II&#x27;s periods shared the same culture. the population of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 (2400–2300 BC) is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semite-speakers close to their Northwestern Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, one of the oldest attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others said it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East Semitic language which exhibits both West and East Semitic features.

Ebla held several religious and social festivals, including rituals for the succession of a new king, which normally lasted for several weeks. The Eblaite calendars were based on a solar year divided into twelve months. Two calendars were discovered; the &quot;old calendar&quot; used during the reign of Igrish-Halam, and a &quot;new calendar&quot; introduced by vizier Ibbi-Sipish. Many months were named in honor of deities; in the new calendar, &quot;Itu be-li&quot; was the first month of the year, and meant &quot;the month of the lord&quot;. Each year was given a name instead of a number.

Women received salaries equal to those of men and could accede to important positions and head government agencies. The Eblaites imported Kungas from Nagar, and used them to draw the carriages of royalty and high officials, as well as diplomatic gifts for allied cities. Society was less centered around the palace and the temple than in Mesopotamian kingdoms. The Eblaite palace was designed around the courtyard, which was open toward the city, thus making the administration approachable. This contrasts with Mesopotamian palaces, which resembled citadels with narrow entrances and limited access to the external courtyard. Music played an important part in the society and musicians were both locals, or hired from other cities such as Mari. Ebla also hired acrobats from Nagar, but later reduced their number and kept some to train local Eblaite acrobats.

===The third kingdom===
The Mardikh III population was predominately Semitic Amorite. The Amorites were mentioned in the first kingdom&#x27;s tablets as neighbors and as rural subjects, and they came to dominate Ebla after the destruction of the second kingdom. The city witnessed a great increase in construction, and many palaces, temples and fortifications were built. The Amorite-speaking Eblaites worshiped many of the same deities as the Paleo-Syrian-speaking Eblaites of earlier periods, and maintained the sanctity of the acropolis in the center of the city. The third kingdom&#x27;s iconography and royal ideology were under the influence of Yamhad&#x27;s culture; kingship was received from the Yamhadite deities instead of Ishtar of Ebla, which is evident by the Eblaite seals of Indilimma&#x27;s period.

==Economy==
During the first kingdom period, the palace controlled the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; the palace distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It is estimated that around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed in the hands of villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city&#x27;s inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.

Ebla derived its prosperity from trade; its wealth was equal to that of the most important Sumerian cities, and its main commercial rival was Mari. Ebla&#x27;s main articles of trade were probably timber from the nearby mountains, and textiles. Handicrafts also appear to have been a major export, evidenced by the quantity of artifacts recovered from the palaces of the city. Ebla possessed a wide commercial network reaching as far as modern-day Afghanistan. It shipped textiles to Cyprus, possibly through the port of Ugarit, but most of its trade seems to have been directed by river-boat towards Mesopotamia – chiefly Kish. The main palace &quot;G&quot; was found to contain artifacts dating from Ancient Egypt bearing the names of the pharaohs Khafre and Pepi I.

Ebla continued to be a center of trade during the second kingdom, evidenced by the surrounding cities that appeared during its period and were destroyed along with the city. Trade continued to be Ebla&#x27;s main economic activity during the third kingdom; archaeological finds show there was an extensive exchange with Egypt and coastal Syrian cities such as Byblos.

==Religion==
Ebla was a polytheistic state. During the first kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon of the first Ebla included pairs of deities and they can be separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Hadabal (dNI-&quot;da&quot;-KUL), who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu (&quot;his wife&quot;); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.

The first Eblaites worshiped many other deities, such as the Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family. Ishtar was also worshiped but was mentioned only five times in one of the monthly offering lists, while Ishara was far more important, appearing 40 times. Other deities included Damu; the Mesopotamian god Utu; Ashtapi; Dagan; Hadad (&quot;Hadda&quot;) and his consort Halabatu (&quot;she of Halab&quot;); and Shipish, the goddess of the sun who had a temple dedicated to her cult. The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.

During the third kingdom, Amorites worshiped common northern Semitic gods; the unique Eblaite deities disappeared. Hadad was the most important god, while Ishtar took Ishara&#x27;s place and became the city&#x27;s most important deity apart from Hadad.

===Biblical connection theories===
At the beginning of the process of deciphering the tablets, Giovanni Pettinato made claims about possible connections between Ebla and the Bible, citing alleged references in the tablets to the existence of Yahweh, the Patriarchs, Sodom and Gomorrah and other Biblical references. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely discredited and the academic consensus is that Ebla &quot;has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the Biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;. In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible; Ebla is now studied as a civilization in its own right. The claims led to a bitter personal and academic conflict between the scholars involved, as well as what some described as political interference by the Syrian authorities.

== Genetics ==
Ancient DNA analysis on 10 human remains dating to the Early and Middle Bronze Age from Ebla found that Eblaites were a mixture of Copper age Levantines and Mesopotamians, and were genetically similar to contemporaneous Levantines.

Haplogroup-wise, one Early Bronze Age (2700-2500 BC) individual carried haplogroup E1b1b1b2a-M123, a lineage likely linked to the diffusion of Afroasiatic languages. Another Early Bronze Age (2572-2470 cal BCE) individual belonged to J1a2a1a2-P58, while four Middle Bronze Age (2000-1800 BC) individuals carried haplogroups J1a2a1a2-P58 (x2), G2a and the West Asian T1a1-L162 which was present since the middle PPNB Levant.

==Excavations==
In 1964, Italian archaeologists from the University of Rome La Sapienza under the direction of Paolo Matthiae began excavating at Tell Mardikh. In 1968, they recovered a statue dedicated to the goddess Ishtar bearing the name of Ibbit-Lim, mentioning him as king of Ebla. That identified the city, long known from Lagashite and Akkadian inscriptions. In the next decade, the team discovered a palace (palace G) dating from  . Finds in the palaces include a small sculpture made out of precious materials, Lapis lazuli, black stones and gold.

Thirteen full and fragmentary lenticular cuneiform tablets were found in the palace throne room, thought to have been there versus the archive because of the city&#x27;s fall. In a storeroom off the throne room, the nearly complete standard of the queen and fragments believed to come from the standard of the king were found. Other artifacts included wood furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl and composite statues created from colored stones. A silver bowl bearing king Immeya&#x27;s name was recovered from the &quot;Tomb of the Lord of the Goats&quot;, together with Egyptian jewels and an Egyptian ceremonial mace presented by pharaoh Hotepibre.

About 17,000 cuneiform tablet fragments were discovered; when put together, they constitute 2,500 complete tablets, making the archive of Ebla one of the biggest from the About 80% of the tablets are written using the usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs, while the others exhibited an innovative, purely phonetic representation using Sumerian cuneiform of a previously unknown Semitic language, which was called &quot;Eblaite&quot;. Bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the tablets, allowing them to be translated. The tablets provide many important insights into the cultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the middle of the They also provide insight into the everyday lives of the inhabitants, and contain information about state revenues, Sumerian-Eblaite dictionaries, diplomatic exchanges with foreign rulers, school texts, hymns and myths.

===Library===
The over 4000-year-old tablets constitute the oldest library ever found. At Ebla, &quot;the archives or library constituted an orderly collection of records at least 500 years older than any other that had been found anywhere before.&quot; There is evidence of their arrangement and classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of the fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves. They found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.

These features were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, which may be far older than was assumed to be the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served – at least partially – as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.

While the absolute chronology of the archive is not yet certain a relative chronology for the 50-year period has been established. Because Ebla did not use Mesopotamian style year names or year numbers and the name of rulers was rarely mentioned in the texts scholars used script changes, grammar changes, and most importantly a prosopography of the members of the court, especially the wives and daughters of the king. The most relevant tablets for this effort were a series of yearly metal accounts and monthly linen accounts.

Most of the recovered tablets and tablet fragments were stored at the Idlib Regional Museum in Syria. Their current condition is unknown.

===Legacy===
Ebla&#x27;s first kingdom is an example of early Syrian centralized states, and is considered one of the earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, who consider it the first-recorded world power. Ebla&#x27;s discovery changed the former view of Syria&#x27;s history as a bridge between Mesopotamia and Egypt; it proved the region was a center of civilization in its own right.

==Syrian Civil War==
As a result of the Syrian Civil War, excavations of Ebla stopped in March 2011. By 2013, it was under control of an opposition armed group called Arrows of the Right, who took advantage of its elevated location to use it as an observation point to watch for incoming government air attacks, as well as attempting to protect the site from looting. Many tunnels were dug and a crypt full of human remains was discovered; the remains were scattered and discarded by the robbers, who hoped to find jewelry and other precious artifacts. Besides excavations by rebels, nearby villagers also began digging at the site with the aim of finding and looting artifacts; some villagers removed carloads of soil suitable for making ceramic liners for bread-baking ovens from the tunnels.

The site was captured by the Syrian Armed Forces on 30 January 2020 during the 5th Northwestern Syria offensive, along with surrounding villages.

<text>Lassi () is a yogurt–based beverage with a smoothie-like consistency. It has been called &quot;the most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink&quot; in India. It has also been described as the form in which yogurt &quot;is most cherished and unbeatably popular in [...] Punjab&quot;, its &quot;best-loved summer drink&quot;, and &quot;the air conditioner of the Punjab&quot;.

&quot;Lassi&quot; originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. The word &quot;lassi&quot; means yogurt mixed with water in Punjabi and Hindi-Urdu.

Lassi is prepared by blending yogurt, water, and spices. In Punjab, the yogurt is traditionally made from water buffalo milk. However, variations of lassi can be prepared in different ways. Cumin and cardamom are the most common spices added to lassi. Lassi is traditionally served in a clay cup known as &quot;kulhar&quot;.

<text>Platanistidae is a family of river dolphins containing the extant Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin (both in the genus &quot;Platanista&quot;) but also extinct relatives from freshwater and marine deposits in the Neogene.

The Amazon river dolphin, baiji, and La Plata dolphin were once thought to belong to Platanistidae (e.g. Simpson, 1945), but cladistic and DNA studies beginning in the 1990s showed that the former three taxa are more closely related to Delphinoidea than to the South Asian river dolphin. The extinct odontocete families Allodelphinidae and Squalodelphinidae are closely related to Platanistidae. Fossils from this clade have been found in deposits in North and South America, Europe, and Central Asia.

<text>Structural analysis is a branch of solid mechanics which uses simplified models for solids like bars, beams and shells for engineering decision making. Its main objective is to determine the effect of loads on physical structures and their components. In contrast to theory of elasticity, the models used in structural analysis are often differential equations in one spatial variable. Structures subject to this type of analysis include all that must withstand loads, such as buildings, bridges, aircraft and ships. Structural analysis uses ideas from applied mechanics, materials science and applied mathematics to compute a structure&#x27;s deformations, internal forces, stresses, support reactions, velocity, accelerations, and stability. The results of the analysis are used to verify a structure&#x27;s fitness for use, often precluding physical tests. Structural analysis is thus a key part of the engineering design of structures.

==Structures and loads==
In the context to structural analysis, a structure refers to a body or system of connected parts used to support a load. Important examples related to Civil Engineering include buildings, bridges, and towers; and in other branches of engineering, ship and aircraft frames, tanks, pressure vessels, mechanical systems, and electrical supporting structures are important. To design a structure, an engineer must account for its safety, aesthetics, and serviceability, while considering economic and environmental constraints. Other branches of engineering work on a wide variety of non-building structures.

===Classification of structures===
A &quot;structural system&quot; is the combination of structural elements and their materials. It is important for a structural engineer to be able to classify a structure by either its form or its function, by recognizing the various elements composing that structure. 
The structural elements guiding the systemic forces through the materials are not only such as a connecting rod, a truss, a beam, or a column, but also a cable, an arch, a cavity or channel, and even an angle, a surface structure, or a frame.

===Loads===

Once the dimensional requirement for a structure have been defined, it becomes necessary to determine the loads the structure must support. Structural design, therefore begins with specifying loads that act on the structure. The design loading for a structure is often specified in building codes. There are two types of codes: general building codes and design codes, engineers must satisfy all of the code&#x27;s requirements in order for the structure to remain reliable.

There are two types of loads that structure engineering must encounter in the design. The first type of loads are dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. The second type of loads are live loads which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live loads like building loads, highway bridge loads, railroad bridge loads, impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.

==Analytical methods==
To perform an accurate analysis a structural engineer must determine information such as structural loads, geometry, support conditions, and material properties. The results of such an analysis typically include support reactions, stresses and displacements. This information is then compared to criteria that indicate the conditions of failure. Advanced structural analysis may examine dynamic response, stability and non-linear behavior.
There are three approaches to the analysis: the mechanics of materials approach (also known as strength of materials), the elasticity theory approach (which is actually a special case of the more general field of continuum mechanics), and the finite element approach. The first two make use of analytical formulations which apply mostly simple linear elastic models, leading to closed-form solutions, and can often be solved by hand. The finite element approach is actually a numerical method for solving differential equations generated by theories of mechanics such as elasticity theory and strength of materials. However, the finite-element method depends heavily on the processing power of computers and is more applicable to structures of arbitrary size and complexity.

Regardless of approach, the formulation is based on the same three fundamental relations: equilibrium, constitutive, and compatibility. The solutions are approximate when any of these relations are only approximately satisfied, or only an approximation of reality.

===Limitations===
Each method has noteworthy limitations. The method of mechanics of materials is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the solution of structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The solution of elasticity problems also requires the solution of a system of partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the solution of mechanics of materials problems, which require at most the solution of an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method is perhaps the most restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.

==Strength of materials methods (classical methods)==
The simplest of the three methods here discussed, the mechanics of materials method is available for simple structural members subject to specific loadings such as axially loaded bars, prismatic beams in a state of pure bending, and circular shafts subject to torsion. The solutions can under certain conditions be superimposed using the superposition principle to analyze a member undergoing combined loading. Solutions for special cases exist for common structures such as thin-walled pressure vessels.

For the analysis of entire systems, this approach can be used in conjunction with statics, giving rise to the &quot;method of sections&quot; and &quot;method of joints&quot; for truss analysis, moment distribution method for small rigid frames, and &quot;portal frame&quot; and &quot;cantilever method&quot; for large rigid frames. Except for moment distribution, which came into use in the 1930s, these methods were developed in their current forms in the second half of the nineteenth century. They are still used for small structures and for preliminary design of large structures.

The solutions are based on linear isotropic infinitesimal elasticity and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In other words, they contain the assumptions (among others) that the materials in question are elastic, that stress is related linearly to strain, that the material (but not the structure) behaves identically regardless of direction of the applied load, that all deformations are small, and that beams are long relative to their depth. As with any simplifying assumption in engineering, the more the model strays from reality, the less useful (and more dangerous) the result.

===Example===
There are 2 commonly used methods to find the truss element forces, namely the method of joints and the method of sections. Below is an example that is solved using both of these methods. The first diagram below is the presented problem for which the truss element forces have to be found. The second diagram is the loading diagram and contains the reaction forces from the joints.
Since there is a pin joint at A, it will have 2 reaction forces. One in the x direction and the other in the y direction. At point B, there is a roller joint and hence only 1 reaction force in the y direction. Assuming these forces to be in their respective positive directions (if they are not in the positive directions, the value will be negative).
Since the system is in static equilibrium, the sum of forces in any direction is zero and the sum of moments about any point is zero.
Therefore, the magnitude and direction of the reaction forces can be calculated.

====Method of joints====
This type of method uses the force balance in the x and y directions at each of the joints in the truss structure. 

At A,

At C,

Although the forces in each of the truss elements are found, it is a good practice to verify the results by completing the remaining force balances.

At B,
:formula_10
:formula_11

====Method of sections====
This method can be used when the truss element forces of only a few members are to be found. This method is used by introducing a single straight line cutting through the member whose force has to be calculated. However this method has a limit in that the cutting line can pass through a maximum of only 3 members of the truss structure. This restriction is because this method uses the force balances in the x and y direction and the moment balance, which gives a maximum of 3 equations to find a maximum of 3 unknown truss element forces through which this cut is made. Find the forces FAB, FBD and FCD in the above example

=====Method 1: Ignore the right side=====
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14

=====Method 2: Ignore the left side=====
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

The truss elements forces in the remaining members can be found by using the above method with a section passing through the remaining members.

==Elasticity methods==
Elasticity methods are available generally for an elastic solid of any shape. Individual members such as beams, columns, shafts, plates and shells may be modeled. The solutions are derived from the equations of linear elasticity. The equations of elasticity are a system of 15 partial differential equations. Due to the nature of the mathematics involved, analytical solutions may only be produced for relatively simple geometries. For complex geometries, a numerical solution method such as the finite element method is necessary.

==Methods using numerical approximation==
It is common practice to use approximate solutions of differential equations as the basis for structural analysis. This is usually done using numerical approximation techniques. The most commonly used numerical approximation in structural analysis is the Finite Element Method.

The finite element method approximates a structure as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them and each element of which has an associated stiffness. Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with a finite number of elements interconnected at finite number of nodes and the overall stiffness is the result of the addition of the stiffness of the various elements. The behaviour of individual elements is characterized by the element&#x27;s stiffness (or flexibility) relation. The assemblage of the various stiffness&#x27;s into a master stiffness matrix that represents the entire structure leads to the system&#x27;s stiffness or flexibility relation. To establish the stiffness (or flexibility) of a particular element, we can use the &quot;mechanics of materials&quot; approach for simple one-dimensional bar elements, and the &quot;elasticity approach&quot; for more complex two- and three-dimensional elements. The analytical and computational development are best effected throughout by means of matrix algebra, solving partial differential equations.

Early applications of matrix methods were applied to articulated frameworks with truss, beam and column elements; later and more advanced matrix methods, referred to as &quot;finite element analysis&quot;, model an entire structure with one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements and can be used for articulated systems together with continuous systems such as a pressure vessel, plates, shells, and three-dimensional solids. Commercial computer software for structural analysis typically uses matrix finite-element analysis, which can be further classified into two main approaches: the displacement or stiffness method and the force or flexibility method. The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications. The finite-element technology is now sophisticated enough to handle just about any system as long as sufficient computing power is available. Its applicability includes, but is not limited to, linear and non-linear analysis, solid and fluid interactions, materials that are isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic, and external effects that are static, dynamic, and environmental factors. This, however, does not imply that the computed solution will automatically be reliable because much depends on the model and the reliability of the data input.

<text>Return of the Living Dead is a zombie comedy film series that consists of five films beginning with the 1985 film &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;.

== Overview ==

The series came about as a dispute between John A. Russo and George A. Romero over how to handle sequels to their 1968 film, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. The two reached a settlement wherein Romero&#x27;s sequels would be referred to as the &quot;Dead&quot; movies, and Russo&#x27;s sequels would bear the suffix &quot;Living Dead&quot;. Thus, each man was able to do what he pleased with the series, while still having one another&#x27;s work distinct and be considered canon. Following this decision, Russo wrote a horror novel, &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot;, which he planned on adapting into a film script. Although the film rights were initially sold in 1979, they were passed along by several different studios and directors before finally being obtained by Tobe Hooper, for whom Russo wrote a script. Hooper dropped out of the project, though, and the script never came to fruition.

Following Hooper&#x27;s departure from the project, Russo, along with his new partner, Dan O&#x27;Bannon, wrote a new script (with Russo adapting it into an accompanying novel), also titled &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;. This project alleviated confusion by including a scene in which a character acknowledges the George Romero films and explains that while they are based on true events, the events of the &quot;Return&quot; series are the &quot;true story&quot;. In addition to this separation of the storylines, the films in the &quot;Return&quot; series are markedly more comedic than Romero&#x27;s films, with slapstick humor.

Although Russo and O&#x27;Bannon were only directly involved with the first film in the series, the rest of the films, to varying degrees, stick to their outline and &quot;rules&quot; established in the first film.

The fourth and fifth films in the series were filmed simultaneously near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant station in Ukraine. Despite being intended for a theatrical release, edited versions of both films made their debut on the SciFi Channel on October 15, 2005, and were later released on DVD.

=== &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; (1985) ===

Medical supply warehouse foreman Frank (James Karen) informs his new protege, Freddy (Thom Mathews) that &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was a true story, based on events that occurred when a gas (2-4-5 Trioxin) was released into the morgue in the basement of a VA hospital. The warehouse was the inadvertent recipient of several canisters, one of them containing a corpse – dubbed &quot;Tarman&quot; (Allan Trautman) due to his rotten appearance in thick black tar – sealed inside. Due to the canister&#x27;s less than stellar durability, a light tap causes it to burst open, releasing Trioxin. The gas leaks out of control, which poisons Frank and Freddy and releases &quot;Tarman&quot; from his imprisonment but he goes into hiding, and remains unseen until halfway through the movie. Frank and Freddy awaken to discover that various body parts (and bodies) in the warehouse are now alive, as well as the cadaver locked in the freezer and even a split dissected dog. Unaware that they are slowly turning into zombies due to the effects of the gas, Frank and Freddy enlist the help of the warehouse owner, Burt (Clu Gulager), and his mortician friend, Ernie (Don Calfa), to cremate the cadaver&#x27;s body parts (they had tried to chop it up to kill it). Unfortunately, the resulting smoke carries the evaporated Trioxin with it, which then mixes with an overhead raincloud. It rains on a nearby cemetery, resulting in the reanimation of the buried corpses.

The zombies differ in this movie, in that they are as fast, strong and intelligent as they were in their previous lives, and can form words even when they are merely very degraded bodies. Instead of hunting humans for their flesh, they hunt for the humans&#x27; brains, stating that brains can ease the pain of their decomposition. It appears that injuries to their brains do not have any effect, and the only way to fully destroy them is to cremate their bodies, although the ensuing smoke also spreads the contagious gas. It also seems that their bites are not infectious, as Suicide, who was killed by Tarman, never reanimated while Trash, killed by several zombies in the graveyard later, did reanimate, probably due to the contaminated rain falling on her corpse.

=== &quot;Return of the Living Dead Part II&quot; (1988) ===

The second film was written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn. The plot follows seven people as they attempt to escape their town after a mass of undead are awoken due to a barrel full of Trioxin gas that was left over from the first film. In this film, it is revealed that powerful electric discharges are the only secure way of destroying the zombies without the risk of reanimating more corpses (it seems the electric energy completely annihilates the re-animative effect of the Trioxin).

The film was released on January 15, 1988, and made $9m at the box office in the U.S.

=== &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot; (1993) ===

The third film was produced and directed by Brian Yuzna, who produced the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film series. This film switches gears from the first two films&#x27; comedy/horror formula, instead being a romantic drama/teen romance/horror film. The story involves Curt, whose father, a Colonel in the US Army, is overseeing experiments being performed with Trioxin. After Curt&#x27;s girlfriend, Julie, is killed in a motorcycle accident, he exposes her corpse to the gas, bringing her back to life as a zombie. Throughout the film, Julie, now one of the living dead, grows hungrier and hungrier for human brains. She discovers, though, that by causing herself pain via a series of more and more extreme body piercings with springs, nails, glass, basically whatever sharp objects she can find, that she can stave off, although only temporarily, the ghastly hunger growing within her. The two begin a trek to escape the US Army that ends in the city sewers when Curt, after witnessing Julie kill and eat Riverman, a friendly homeless man who gives them shelter, steps aside to let his father finally put Julie down. The film ends with Curt rescuing Julie from a fate worse than living death as a biomechanical killer for the military. In the end, after himself being bitten by a zombie, Curt and Julie step into an incinerator and embrace in a final kiss as the flames engulf them.

This film is currently available in its unedited form on Blu-ray in the U.S. and on the U.K. Region 2 DVD.

The film received a limited theatrical release on October 29, 1993, where it was a financial failure, making back only $54,000 of its $2,000,000 budget at the box office in the U.S.

=== &quot;Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis&quot; (2005) ===

&quot;Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis&quot;, the fourth film in the series, was filmed in Romania and Ukraine. The film stars Peter Coyote and Aimee Lynn Chadwick. The plot revolves around a group of teenagers attempting to rescue their friend from an evil corporation. In doing so, they wind up releasing a horde of bloodthirsty zombies. An edited version of the film aired on the SciFi Channel on October 15, 2005. The R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on April 18, 2006. The film was originally advertised as &quot;Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis&quot; but once it was finally released, the number 4 was removed from the title.

=== &quot;Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave&quot; (2005) ===

&quot;Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave&quot; was filmed immediately after &quot;Necropolis&quot; using the same locations of Romania and Ukraine. Cory Hardrict, 
John Keefe, Peter Coyote and Aimee Lynn Chadwick returned from the previous installment. The film takes place one year after &quot;Necropolis&quot; and the returning teenage characters, from the previous film, are now college freshmen. They discover that Trioxin-5 can be used as a recreational drug named &#x27;Z&#x27;, but the drug will eventually turn the user into a zombie. The speed of &quot;zombification&quot; depends on the dose of Trioxin consumed. An edited version of the film aired along with &quot;Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis&quot; on the SciFi Channel on October 15, 2005. As was the case with &quot;Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis&quot; switching to &quot;Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis&quot;, &quot;Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave&quot; was advertised as &quot;Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave&quot; before removing the number 5 from the title. The R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on March 20, 2007, by Lionsgate.

The film also features a humorous cameo appearance by Tarman from the original movie and its first sequel. However, as opposed to being a major threat like he initially was, the character is mostly used for comedy, though when he first appears in the film, he tries to attack the protagonists, but later gives up and desperately tries to hitchhike a ride to the party, but to no avail. After scaring away a woman who almost gave him a ride, he has no choice but to walk to the party, yelling his trademark &quot;Brains!&quot; as he goes.

===&quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; (2025)===
In July 2023, a reboot of the franchise was announced. On December 13, 2024, WithAnO Productions and Living Dead Media LLC debuted a teaser trailer for &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; promising to be set in the winter of 1985, eighteen months after the events in the original film. Written and directed by Steve Wolsh, the film is planned for a December 2025 release.

=== &quot;Trash&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (TBA) ===
Another separate Return of the Living Dead sequel was announced the same month coming from the other rights owner of the franchise ROTLD Originals LLC, a crowdfunding page for the film launched on CineBacker in December 2024. The film will star Linnea Quigley who played Trash in the original film, Thom Mathews, Eric Roberts and will include unnamed actors from the original film whose characters will be brought back using Computer-generated imagery.

==Documentary film==
A documentary titled &quot;More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead&quot;, was released in 2011. The film is an account of the tongue-in-cheek, stylish and apocalyptic zombie movie, and features contributions from all the main cast as well as clips, photographs, storyboards, conceptual art, publicity materials, archival documents and behind-the-scenes footage.

The documentary includes interviews with over 30 cast and crew members from the first three &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; films, including Thom Mathews, Beverly Randolph, Jewel Shepard, John Philbin, Brian Peck, Linnea Quigley, Miguel A. Nunez, Jr., James Karen, Clu Gulager, Don Calfa, Allan Trautman, Stacey Q, William Stout, Suzanne Snyder, Michael Kenworthy, J. Trevor Edmond, Brian Yuzna and more.

<text>Orange România is a broadband Internet service provider and mobile provider in Romania. It is Romania&#x27;s largest GSM network operator which is majority owned by Orange S.A. that also uses some of the Telekom Romania infrastructure, the biggest initial investor, who gradually increased its ownership.

Between 1997 and April 2002, the company was named Mobil Rom, operated under two brand names Dialog (for monthly subscription plans, in Romanian means &quot;dialogue&quot;) and Alo (for prepay services). In April 2002, after France Télécom gained a majority stake it was re-branded to comply with the group&#x27;s global strategy. As of December 2012, Orange Romania has 10.3 million mobile subscribers.

Orange is in head-to-head competition with Vodafone Romania for one of the most dynamic mobile telephony markets in south eastern Europe. Currently the mobile penetration is at about 115% (active users only). Orange edged ahead of Vodafone (formerly Connex) in terms of number of subscribers in September 2004. They are the main mobile telephony operators, with Orange having a market share of almost 38% of the total market (active and inactive users).

Orange România also controls 4% of the Moldovan operator Orange Moldova.

<doc id="306554" wikidata="Q3633405" url="?curid=306554" title="Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them">
<text>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them is a satirical book on American politics by Al Franken, a comedian, political commentator, and politician. It was published in 2003 by Dutton Penguin. Franken had a study group of 14 Harvard graduate students known as &quot;TeamFranken&quot; to help him with the research. The book&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot;, is a parody of Fox News&#x27; tagline &quot;Fair and Balanced.&quot; Fox sued Franken over the use of the phrase in a short-lived and unsuccessful lawsuit, which has been credited with increasing the sales of the book, an example of the Streisand effect.

&quot;Lies&quot; is one of several books published in 2003 written by American liberals challenging the viewpoints of conservatives such as Bernard Goldberg, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. These books by Franken and fellow authors such as Joe Conason, Michael Moore and Jim Hightower were described by columnist Molly Ivins as the &quot;great liberal backlash of 2003.&quot;

==Summary==
&quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; largely targets prominent Republicans and conservatives, highlighting what Franken asserts are documentable lies in their claims. A significant portion of the book is devoted to comparisons between then-sitting President George W. Bush and former president Bill Clinton regarding their economic, environmental, and military policies. Franken also criticizes several pundits, especially those he believes to be the most dishonest, including O&#x27;Reilly, Hannity, and Coulter. The book includes two comics, &quot;The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus&quot;, a cartoon by Don Simpson, which parodies the seemingly un-Christian policies of Republicans who frequently invoke Christianity (like the Republican Jesus meme), and &quot;Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One&quot;, which features Vietnam veterans (and prominent Democrats) John Kerry and Al Gore leading a group of popular neoconservatives—none of whom actually served in the Vietnam War—into battle, only to get fragged by the cowardly &quot;chickenhawk&quot; neocons.

==Publicity==

Fox News sought damages from Franken, claiming in its lawsuit that the book&#x27;s subtitle violated its trademark of the slogan &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;. The lawsuit was dismissed, and backfired on Fox News by providing Franken with free publicity just as the book was launched. &quot;The book was originally scheduled to be released Sept. 22 but will be made available Aug. 21,&quot; according to its publisher. &quot;We sped up the release because of tremendous demand for the book, generated by recent events.&quot;

In the lawsuit, Fox described Franken as &quot;intoxicated or deranged&quot; as well as &quot;shrill and unstable.&quot; In response, Franken joked that he had trademarked the word &quot;funny&quot;, and that Fox had infringed his intellectual property rights by characterizing him as &quot;unfunny.&quot; The publicity resulting from the lawsuit propelled Franken&#x27;s yet-to-be-released book to #1 on Amazon.com.

On August 22, 2003, U.S. District Judge Denny Chin denied Fox&#x27;s request for an injunction to block the publication of Franken&#x27;s book, characterizing the network&#x27;s claim as &quot;wholly without merit, both factually and legally.&quot; During the judge&#x27;s questioning, spectators in the court&#x27;s gallery frequently laughed at Fox&#x27;s case. Franken later joked, &quot;Usually when you say someone was literally laughed out of court, you mean they were figuratively laughed out of court, but Fox was literally laughed out of court.&quot; Three days later, Fox filed to dismiss its lawsuit.

Franken describes the legal battle in a paperback-only chapter of &quot;Lies&quot; entitled &quot;I Win&quot;.

==Reception==

In a largely favorable review of Franken&#x27;s book in the Washington newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot;, reviewer Mary Lynn F. Jones wrote: &quot;Franken&#x27;s tendency to mix fact with fiction [also] left me wondering sometimes what was true and what wasn&#x27;t.&quot; As an example, she cited a passage in Franken&#x27;s book in which he wrote that former Bush foreign policy advisor Richard Armitage &quot;bolted&quot; from a Senate hearing and &quot;[knocked] over veteran reporter Helen Thomas, breaking her hip and jaw&quot;. The paperback version has a footnote saying, &quot;The Helen Thomas thing is a joke.&quot;

===Recognition===
The audiobook version was awarded the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

<doc id="306555" wikidata="Q17002558" url="?curid=306555" title="Ethics in the Bible">
<text>Ethics in the Bible refers to the system(s) or theory(ies) produced by the study, interpretation, and evaluation of biblical morals (including the moral code, standards, principles, behaviors, conscience, values, rules of conduct, or beliefs concerned with good and evil and right and wrong), that are found in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles. It comprises a narrow part of the larger fields of Jewish and Christian ethics, which are themselves parts of the larger field of philosophical ethics. Ethics in the Bible is unlike other western ethical theories in that it is seldom overtly philosophical. It presents neither a systematic nor a formal deductive ethical argument. Instead, the Bible provides patterns of moral reasoning that focus on conduct and character in what is sometimes referred to as virtue ethics. This moral reasoning is part of a broad, normative covenantal tradition where duty and virtue are inextricably tied together in a mutually reinforcing manner.

Some critics have viewed certain biblical teachings to be morally problematic and accused it of advocating for slavery, genocide, supersessionism, the death penalty, violence, patriarchy, sexual intolerance and colonialism. The problem of evil, an argument that is used to argue against the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, is an example of criticism of ethics in the Bible. 

Conversely, it has been seen as a cornerstone of both Western culture, and many other cultures across the globe. Concepts such as justice for the widow, orphan and stranger provided inspiration for movements ranging from abolitionism in the 18th and 19th century, to the civil rights movement, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and liberation theology in Latin America.

==Overview==
===The Bible===
According to traditional Jewish enumeration, the Hebrew Bible is composed of 24 books which came into being over a span of almost a millennium. The Bible&#x27;s earliest texts reflect a Late Bronze Age civilization of the Ancient Near East, while its last text, usually thought to be the Book of Daniel, comes from a second century BCE Hellenistic period. This historical development has to be taken into consideration in any account of ethics in the Bible. Ethicist Eryl W. Davies writes that many scholars question whether the biblical account can be regarded as an accurate account of &quot;how it really happened.&quot; The Bible has an &quot;air of appearing to know things we are actually very unsure about, and it has tended to state as fact what was merely speculation... There is a growing recognition it reflects the ethical values and norms of the educated class in ancient Israel, and that very little can be known about the moral beliefs of the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Israelites.&quot; As a result, many scholars believe the Bible is unsuitable for &quot;doing philosophy.&quot; Philosopher Jaco Gericke quotes philosopher Robert P. Carroll saying the Bible is &quot;too untidy, too sprawling, and too boisterous to be tamed by neat systems of thought.&quot;

At the same time, ethicist John Barton says most scholars recognize the Bible is &quot;more than just a jumble of isolated precepts with no underlying rationale.&quot; The biblical narratives, laws, wisdom sayings, parables, and unique genrés of the Bible are the sources of its ethical concepts. However, Barton also says there are problematic texts and the author&#x27;s intent is not always easy to decipher. Much of biblical narrative refrains from direct comment, and there are problems in turning to the narratives for ethical insight. &quot;First... the narratives are often far from morally edifying... Second, though Old Testament stories are about what we might call &#x27;moral issues&#x27;, it is often not easy to decide what is being commended and what deplored. Third there is a general problem about describing the moral world of biblical narrative... are we talking about the real world...or the imagined world?&quot; Barton concludes, the Bible&#x27;s moral &quot;philosophy is more complicated than it might appear.&quot;

Jewish philosophers Shalom Carmy and David Schatz explain one of many difficulties doing philosophy in the Bible is that philosophers dislike contradicting themselves whereas the Bible, by contrast, &quot;often juxtaposes contradictory ideas, without explanation or apology&quot;. Gericke says using a descriptive, rather than an analytical philosophical approach, means the pluralism of the Bible need not be a problem. Descriptive philosophy is aimed purely at clarifying meaning and therefore, it has no difficulty &quot;simply stating the nature of the diachronic variation and synchronic variability found in the biblical texts.&quot; Carmy and Schatz say the Bible does philosophical activity when it &quot;depicts the character of God, presents an account of creation, posits a metaphysics of divine providence and divine intervention, suggests a basis for morality, discusses many features of human nature, and frequently poses the notorious conundrum of how God can allow evil.&quot;

===Ethics===
Philosopher Alan Mittleman says ethics in the Bible is not like western ethical theories in that it is seldom overtly &quot;philosophical.&quot; It presents neither a systematic nor a deductive formal ethical argument, nor does it address traditional Western philosophical questions and arguments. The absence of Western approaches is not evidence there is an absence of ethics in the Bible however. Textual scholar Jaco Gericke writes, &quot;The tendency to deny the Hebrew Bible anything philosophical when its rhetoric does not conform to Western varieties of philosophical systems actually involves a colonialist ethnocentric hermeneutical fallacy.&quot; 

While there is no Western-style ethical system in the Bible, there are &quot;folk philosophical presuppositions&quot; in it; &quot;in other words, the biblical texts contain metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical assumptions about the nature of reality, existence, life, knowledge, truth, belief, good and evil, value and so on&quot; of the ancient folk who recorded it. Considering ethics in the Bible, therefore, means not using philosophical terms such as &quot;deontological&quot;, &quot;casuistic&quot;, &quot;apodictic&quot;, and &quot;theodicy&quot;, while still recognizing that, if a piece of literature contains ethical assumptions, it contains metaphysical and epistemological assumptions as well. It is &quot;impossible to understand the Bible&#x27;s fundamental structures of meaning without attending to the text&#x27;s basic assumptions regarding reality, knowledge and value.&quot; These assumptions fall into the four basic philosophical categories.

====Philosophical core====
=====Metaphysics=====
First, Gericke says, metaphysics is found anywhere the Bible has something to say about &quot;the nature of existence, reality, being, substance, mereology, time and space, causality, identity and change, objecthood and relations (e.g. subject and object), essence and accident, properties and functions, necessity and possibility (modality), order, mind and matter, freewill and determinism, and so on.&quot; Rolf Knierim says the Bible&#x27;s metaphysic is &quot;dynamistic ontology&quot; which says reality is a dynamic process. 

Ancient texts do not use ontological language of &quot;being.&quot; Instead, philosopher Mark Smith explains that in the Bible, a fundamental ontology is embodied in language about power where the world and its beings derive their reality (their being, their power to exist, and to act), from the power of God (Being itself). The messenger divinities, the angels, derive their power from the One God, as do human kings. In metaphysical language, the power of lesser beings participates in Power itself, identified as God.

=====Epistemology=====
Secondly, there is epistemology in the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible contains assumptions about the nature of knowledge, belief, truth, interpretation, understanding and cognitive processes. Pluralism is the norm, so that no unified epistemology can be reconstructed, however, an &quot;ethnoepistemology&quot; can be found. Ethnoepistemology examines the &quot;entire gamut of human epistemological practices from ordinary folk to diviners, shamans, priests&quot;, and the authors themselves. 

Ethicist Michael V. Fox has written that the primary axiom in Proverbs says &quot;the exercise of the human mind is the necessary and sufficient condition of right and successful behavior in all reaches of life: practical, ethical and religious&quot; revealing a &quot;folk presupposition&quot; of epistemology: that virtue is knowledge, and knowledge is virtue.

=====Ethical assumptions=====
Third there is ethics, and the Bible&#x27;s &quot;meta-ethical&quot; assumptions: &quot;the meaning of good and evil, the nature of right and wrong, criteria for moral discernment, valid sources of morality, the origin and acquisition of moral beliefs, the ontological status of moral norms, moral authority, cultural pluralism, axiological and aesthetic assumptions about the nature of value and beauty. These are all implicit in the texts.&quot; 

Fox writes that ancient Hebrew wisdom literature dwells on wisdom in a manner that separates it from wisdom literature of other ancient Near Eastern cultures. &quot;This focus is closely bound to its ethics.&quot; 

Mittleman explains that ethics in the Bible are provided by patterns of moral reasoning that focus on conduct and character. This moral reasoning is part of a broad normative covenantal tradition where duty and virtue are inextricably tied together in a mutually reinforcing manner. 

Sociologist Stephen Mott says ethics in the Bible is a corporate, community based ethic. It is not simply individual.

=====Logic=====
Fourth there is logic. The Bible&#x27;s discourse contains assumptions about what constitutes valid arguments, the nature of language and its relation to reality. The philosophy of the Bible is a religious philosophy, and that is implicit in its texts on &quot;the nature of reasoning in religious thought, the warranting of beliefs, the justification of religious experience, strategies in polemical arguments, the nature of rational thinking, and the logic of belief revision.&quot;

==Ethical paradigms==
Ethicist John Barton says there are three basic models, patterns or paradigms that form the basis of all ethics in the Bible: (1) obedience to God&#x27;s will; (2) natural law; and (3) the imitation of God. Barton goes on to say the first is probably the strongest model. Obedience as a basis for ethics is found in Law and in the wisdom literature and in the Prophets. Eryl Davies says it is easy to overemphasize obedience as a paradigm since there is also a strong goal–oriented character to the moral teaching in the Bible. Asking where a course of action would lead was normal for the culture portrayed in biblical texts, and even laws have &quot;motive clauses&quot; oriented toward the future prosperity of the person being asked to obey.

&quot;Natural law&quot; as Barton uses it is &quot;a vague phrase meant to be suggestive rather than defining.&quot; Eryl Davies says it is a term that should be used with some reservation since this is not the highly developed &quot;natural law&quot; found in Western thought. Nevertheless, the loosely defined paradigm is suggested by the ordering of the book of Genesis, where the creation story and the natural order were made a focal point as the book was assembled and edited. Natural law is in the Wisdom literature, the Prophets, Romans 1, and Acts 17. Natural law can be found in the book of Amos, where nations other than Israel are held accountable for their ethical decisions (Amos 1:3–2:5) even though they don&#x27;t know the Hebrew god.

Davies says the clearest expression of the imitation of God as a basis for ethics is in Leviticus 19:2 where Yahweh instructs Moses to tell the people to be holy because Yahweh is holy. This idea is also in Leviticus 11:44; 20:7,26; 21:8. The prophets also asserted that God had moral qualities the Israelites should emulate. The Psalmists also frequently reflect on God&#x27;s character forming the basis of the ethical life of those who worship Yahweh. Psalm 111, and 112 set out the attributes of God that must be reflected in the life of a &#x27;true follower&#x27;. The ethic has limits; Barton points out that in 1 Samuel 26:19 David argues that if his own persecution is ordered by God that is one thing, but if it is the work of people, those people should be cursed.

==Applied ethics==
===Political ethics===
Political theorist Michael Walzer (2012) stated: &quot;The Bible is, above all, a religious book, but it is also a political book.&quot; There is no real political theory, as such, in the Bible, however, based on &quot;legal codes, rules for war and peace, ideas about justice and obligation, social criticism, visions of the good society, and accounts of exile and dispossession&quot; the Bible does contain folk presuppositions of comparative political views. 

First, the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) advocates monarchy in Jerusalem, and also supports notions of theocracy; the speech of Abijah of Judah in Chronicles 2 13:4–12 is taken as one of the purest expressions of this idea; Yahweh ordained only David and his progeny to rule in Jerusalem and only Aaron and his progeny to serve in the Temple, and any other claims to political or religious power or authority are against the will of God. The Deuteronomist redaction of the Hebrew Bible especially emphasizes these ideas about the unity of politics and religion in a political state.

Biblical descriptions of divinely ordained monarchy directly underlie the understanding of Jesus as the &quot;son of David&quot; and the messiah (the anointed king) who at some point will govern the world.

Walzer says politics in the Bible is also similar to modern &quot;consent theory&quot; which requires agreement between the governed and the authority based on full knowledge and the possibility of refusal. Politics in the Bible also models &quot;social contract theory&quot; which says a person&#x27;s moral obligations to form the society in which they live are dependent on that agreement. This implies a moral respect for God and his laws which is not a result of law, but pre-exists law. Walzer asserts this is what makes it possible for someone like Amos, &quot;an herdsman and gatherer of sycamore fruit&quot;, to confront priests and kings, and remind them of their obligations. Moral law is, therefore, politically democratized in the Bible.

Walzer finds political ethics expressed in the Hebrew Bible in covenant, law, and prophecy, and he says they constitute an early form of &quot;almost&quot; democratic political ethics. First, God&#x27;s covenant requires that everyone adhere equally to the agreement they made, as in later &quot;general will&quot; theories of democracy. &quot;In the biblical texts, poor people, women, and even strangers, are recognized as moral agents in their own right whatever the extent of that agency might be.&quot; Second, Walker finds the idea that everyone was subject to God&#x27;s law—that kings were not involved in making or interpreting the law, but were as subject to it, in principle, as every other Israelite. Third, Walzer finds in the Bible, prophets speak as the interpreters of divine law in public places to ordinary people. They came from every social strata and denounced the most powerful men in society—and everyone else too. Walzer wrote: &quot;Their public and uninhibited criticism is an important signifier of religious democracy.&quot;

Political science scholar Amy E. Black says Jesus&#x27; command to pay taxes (Matthew 22:21), was not simply an endorsement of government, but was also a refusal to participate in the fierce political debate of his day over the Poll tax. Black quotes Old Testament scholar Gordon Wenham as saying, Jesus&#x27; response &quot;implied loyalty to a pagan government was not incompatible with loyalty to God.&quot;

====War and peace====
Warfare as a political act of nationhood, is a topic the Bible addresses ethically, both directly and indirectly, in four ways: there are verses that support pacifism, and verses that support non-resistance; 4th century theologian Augustine identified aspects of just war in the Bible, and preventive war which is sometimes called crusade has also been supported using Bible texts. Near Eastern scholar Susan Niditch says &quot;To understand attitudes toward war in the Bible is thus to gain a handle on war in general&quot;.

Pacifism is not in the Hebrew Bible, but an ethic of peace can be found there. The term peace is mentioned 429 times in the Bible—and more than 2500 times in classical Jewish sources. Many of those refer to peace as a central part of God&#x27;s purpose for mankind. Political activist David Cortright writes that &quot;shalom&quot; (peace in Hebrew) is a complex word with levels of meaning that embody the conditions and values necessary to prevent war: &quot;social justice, self-determination, economic well-being, human rights, and the use of non-violent means to resolve conflict.&quot; 

Most texts used to support pacifism are in the New Testament, such as Matthew 5:38–48 and Luke 6:27–36, but not all. Passages of peace from the Hebrew Bible, such as Micah 4:3: &quot;They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks&quot;, are also often cited. According to theologian Myron S. Augsberger, pacifism opposes war for any reason. The ethic is founded in separation from the world and the world&#x27;s ways of doing things, obeying God first rather than the state, and belief that God&#x27;s kingdom is beyond this world. Bible scholar Herman A. Hoyt says Christians are obligated to follow Christ&#x27;s example, which was an example of non-resistance. This obligation is to individual believers, not corporate bodies, or &quot;unregenerate worldly governments.&quot;

Near Eastern scholar Yigal Levin, along with archaeologist Amnon Shapira, write that the ethic of war in the Bible is based on the concept of self-defense. Self-defense, or defense of others, is necessary for a war to be understood as a just war. Levin and Shapira say forbidding war for the purpose of expansion (Deuteronomy 2:2-6,9,17-19), the call to talk peace before war (Deuteronomy 20:10), the expectation of moral disobedience to a corrupt leader (Genesis 18:23-33; Exodus 1:17, 2:11-14, 32:32; 1 Samuel 22:17), as well as a series of verses governing treatment of prisoners (Deuteronomy 21:10–14; 2 Chronicles 28:10–15; Joshua 8:29, 10:26–27), respect for the land (Deuteronomy 20:19), and general &quot;purity in the camp&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:10–15) are aspects of the principles of just war in the Bible.

In Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and both books of Kings, warfare includes narratives describing a variety of conflicts with Amalekites, Canaanites, and Moabites. God commands the Israelites to conquer the Promised Land, placing city after city &quot;under the ban&quot;, the &quot;herem&quot; of total war. This has been interpreted to mean every man, woman and child was to be killed. This leads many contemporary scholars to characterize &quot;herem&quot; as a command to commit genocide. Michael Walzer writes that &quot;herem&quot; was the common approach to war among the nations surrounding Israel of the bronze age, and Hebrew scholar Baruch A. Levine indicates Israel imported the concept from them. Walzer points out that verses 15 to 18 of Deuteronomy 20 are very old, suggesting &quot;the addition of &quot;herem&quot; to an older siege law.&quot; 

He goes on to say the earliest biblical sources show there are two ethics of conquest in the Bible with laws supporting each. Beginning at Deuteronomy 20:10–14 there is a limited war/(just war) doctrine consistent with Amos and First and Second Kings. From Deuteronomy 20 on, both war doctrines are joined without one superseding the other. However, starting in Joshua 9, after the conquest of Ai, Israel&#x27;s battles are described as &quot;self-defense&quot;, and the priestly authors of Leviticus, and the Deuteronomists, are careful to give God moral reasons for his commandment. Scholars such as Paul Copan and Nicholas Wolterstorff have argued that the perceived order to commit genocide and descriptions of genocide were an example of &quot;hagiographic hyperbole&quot;.

Holy war imagery is contained in the final book of the New Testament, Revelation, where John reconfigures traditional Jewish eschatology by substituting &quot;faithful witness to the point of martyrdom for armed violence as the means of victory. Because the Lamb has won the decisive victory over evil by this means, his followers can participate in his victory only by following his path of suffering witness. Thus, Revelation repudiates apocalyptic militarism, but promotes the active participation of Christians in the divine conflict with evil&quot;.

====Criminal justice====

Legal scholar Jonathan Burnside says biblical law is not fully codified, but it is possible to discern its key ethical elements. Key elements in biblical criminal justice begin with the belief in God as the source of justice and the judge of all, including those administering justice on earth. Criminal justice scholar Sam S. Souryal says the Bible emphasizes that ethical knowledge and moral character, of those within a justice system, are central to the administration of justice. He adds that foremost among the biblical ethical principles that ensure criminal justice are those prohibiting &quot;lying and deception, racial prejudice and racial discrimination, egoism and the abuse of authority.&quot; In the Bible, human judges are thought capable of mediating even divine decisions if they have sufficient moral capacity and wisdom. 

Biblical ethicist Christopher Marshall says there are about 20 offenses that carry the death penalty under Mosaic Law. Within the historical and ethical context of covenant, it was believed the covenant community suffered ritual pollution from certain sins, therefore capital punishment protected the community from the possible consequences of such pollution, as well as punished those who had broken covenant. &quot;Evans explains that contemporary standards tend to view these laws of capital punishment as cavalier toward human life&quot;, however, within the framework of the ancient covenant, it suggests an ethic concerning the value of life was as much a communal value as an individual one.

Marshall goes on to say there are features of covenant law that have been adopted and adapted to contemporary human rights law: due process, fairness in criminal procedures, and equity in the application of the law. Within this ethic, judges are told not to accept bribes (Deuteronomy 16:19), were required to be impartial to native and stranger alike (Leviticus 24:22; Deuteronomy 27:19), to the needy and the powerful alike (Leviticus 19:15), and to rich and poor alike (Deuteronomy 1:16,17; Exodus 23:2–6). The right to a fair trial, and fair punishment, are also required (Deuteronomy 19:15; Exodus 21:23–25). Those most vulnerable in a patriarchal society—children, women, and strangers—were singled out for special protection (Psalm 72:2,4).

===Relationships===
====Women, sex, marriage and family====
====In the Hebrew Bible====

Almost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000–1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE), including Israel and Judah, were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE. The patriarchal model of ancient Israel became an accepted aspect of biblical interpretation through anthropology of the nineteenth century. Feminist biblical scholars of second-wave feminism later appropriated it. In the early twenty first century there is substantial agreement among a wide variety of scholars that the Hebrew Bible is a predominantly patriarchal document from a patriarchal age. However, others assert there are also evidences of a kind of metaphysical &quot;gender blindness&quot; in the Hebrew Bible. Third wave feminists began raising concerns about the accuracy of a claim of overarching patriarchy for ancient Hebrew culture. Meyers concludes &quot;male dominance was real, but it was fragmentary, not hegemonic&quot;. 

Hebrew Bible scholar Tykva Frymer-Kensky says the role of women in the Bible is generally one that is subordinate to men, however, unlike other ancient literature, the Hebrew Bible does not explain or justify cultural subordination by portraying women as deserving of less because of their naturally evil or innately inferior natures. Discussions of the nature of women, such as those found in some Ancient and Classical Greek and Roman writings which describe women as an innately inferior race separate from the race of men, are conspicuously absent from the Hebrew Bible. The biblical depiction of early Bronze Age culture up through the Axial Age, depicts the &quot;essence&quot; (that is the Bible&#x27;s metaphysical view of being and nature) of both male and female as &quot;created in the image of God&quot; with neither inherently inferior in nature. Old Testament scholar Jerome Creach says the placement of the Genesis (1:1–2:4a) story at the beginning of the entire Bible shows it was normative for those who gave the Hebrew Bible canon its present shape.

Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. These and other gender differences found in the Torah suggest that, within those texts, women are subordinate to men. Adultery was defined differently for men than for women: a woman was an adulteress if she had sexual relations outside her marriage, but if a man had sexual relations outside his marriage with an unmarried woman, a concubine or a prostitute, it was not considered adultery on his part. Non-conforming sex – homosexuality, bestiality, cross dressing and masturbation – are described as being punishable. Stringent protection of the marital bond and loyalty to kin is portrayed as very strong.

The &quot;zonah&quot; of the Hebrew Bible is a woman who is not under the authority of a man; she may be a paid prostitute, but not necessarily. In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a &quot;zonah&quot; was a grave insult to her and her family. The &quot;zonah&quot; is shown as lacking protection, making each &quot;zonah&quot; vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren&#x27;t. According to David Blumenthal, the Bible depicts the &quot;zonah&quot; as &quot;dangerous, fearsome and threatening by her freedom, and yet appealing and attractive at the same time.&quot; Her freedom is recognized by biblical law and her sexual activity is not punishable. She is the source of extra-institutional sex. Therefore she is seen as a threat to patriarchy and the family structure it supports. Over time, the term &quot;zonah&quot; came to applied to a married woman who committed adultery, and that sense of the term was used as a metaphor for people being unfaithful to Yahweh, especially in the Book of Hosea and the Book of Ezekiel; the descriptions of sexual acts and punishments of the metaphorical &quot;zonah&quot; in those books are brutal and pornographic.

The Hebrew Bible contains strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. Near Eastern scholar Eve Levavi Feinstein writes &quot;The concepts of pollution and sexuality seem inextricably linked&quot;, yet the views in the Bible vary more than is generally recognized. Pollution terminology is used for illegal sexual contact such as rape and adultery, and it is also used for legal and licit sexual intercourse, menstruation, and for some perhaps unavoidable diseases. This makes the Bible&#x27;s view of the relationship between temporary ritual pollution and more serious moral pollution &quot;murky.&quot; Pollution concepts in the Hebrew Bible are connected to certain areas of experience such as sex, death, and certain kinds of illnesses and food. The Hebrew term for pollution appears 286 times and the term for purity appears 207 times. Feinstein says the Hebrew Bible never uses the term &#x27;pure&#x27; (טָהֵר) to describe virginity, but does use it to describe a married woman who has not committed adultery (Numbers 5:28). Wanton, unrepentant sins are seen as having a contaminating effect on the sanctuary similar to environmental pollution.

====In the New Testament====

Jesus often spoke directly to women in public. The disciples were astonished to see Jesus talking with the Samaritan woman at the well of Sychar (John 4:7–26). He spoke freely with the woman taken in adultery (John 8:10–11), with the widow of Nain (Luke 7:12–13), the woman with the bleeding disorder (Luke 8:48; cf. Matt. 9:22; Mark 5:34), and a woman who called to him from a crowd (Luke 11:27–28). Similarly, Jesus addressed a woman bent over for eighteen years (Luke 13:12) and a group of women on the route to the cross (Luke 23:27–31). Jesus spoke in a thoughtful, caring manner. Each synoptic writer records Jesus addressing the woman with the bleeding disorder tenderly as &quot;daughter&quot; and he refers to the bent woman as a &quot;daughter of Abraham&quot; (Luke 13:16). Theologian Donald G. Bloesch infers that &quot;Jesus called the Jewish women &#x27;daughters of Abraham&#x27; (Luke 13:16), thereby according them a spiritual status equal to that of men.&quot; 

Jesus held women personally responsible for their own behavior: for example there&#x27;s the woman at the well (John 4:16–18), the woman taken in adultery (John 8:10–11), and the sinful woman who anointed his feet (Luke 7:44–50). Jesus dealt with each as having the personal freedom and enough self-determination to deal with their own repentance and forgiveness. There are several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to and about women: his public admiration for a poor widow who donated two copper coins to the Temple in Jerusalem, his friendship with Mary of Bethany and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, and the presence of Mary Magdalene, his mother, and the other women as he was crucified. New Testament scholar Ben Witherington III says &quot;Jesus broke with both biblical and rabbinic traditions that restricted women&#x27;s roles in religious practices, and He rejected attempts to devalue the worth of a woman, or her word of witness.&quot;

The New Testament names many women among the followers of Jesus and in positions of leadership in the early church. New Testament scholar Linda Belleville says &quot;virtually every leadership role that names a man also names a woman. In fact there are more women named as leaders in the New Testament than men. Phoebe is a &#x27;deacon&#x27; and a &#x27;benefactor&#x27; (Romans 16:11–12). Mary, Lydia and Nympha are overseers of house churches (Acts 12:12; 16:15; Colossians 4:15). Euodia and Syntyche are among &#x27;the overseers and deacons&#x27; at Philippi (Philippians 1:1; cf, 4:2–3). The only role lacking specific female names is that of &#x27;elder&#x27;—but there male names are lacking as well.&quot;

New Testament scholar Craig Blomberg asserts three primary texts critical to the traditional patriarchal view of women and women&#x27;s roles as being supported in the New Testament: &quot;&quot;1 Corinthians 14:34-35&quot;, where women are commanded to be silent in the church; &quot;1 Timothy 2:11–15&quot; where women (according to the TNIV) are not permitted to teach or have authority over a man; and &quot;1 Corinthians 11:2–16&quot; where the male and female relationship is defined in terms of &quot;kephalē&quot; commonly translated &quot;head&quot;.&quot;

Classics scholar Kyle Harper references the historian Peter Brown as showing ethics concerning sexuality and accepted sexual practices was at the heart of the early clash over Christianity&#x27;s place in the world. Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul&#x27;s letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it. In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances. 

Conflicts between Christianity and the culture surrounding it over sexuality, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce. For example, in Roman culture, widows were required to remarry within a few years of their husband&#x27;s death, but Christian widows were not required to remarry and could freely choose to remain single, and celibate, with the church&#x27;s support. As Harper says, &quot;The church developed the radical notion of individual freedom centered around a libertarian paradigm of complete sexual agency.&quot; Many widows and single women were choosing not to marry, were staying celibate, and were encouraging other women to follow, but pagan response to this female activity was negative and sometimes violent toward Christianity as a whole. Margaret MacDonald demonstrates these dangerous circumstances were likely the catalysts for the &quot;shift in perspective concerning unmarried women from Paul&#x27;s [early] days to the time of the Pastoral epistles&quot;. 

The sexual-ethical structures of Roman society were built on status, and sexual modesty and shame meant something different for men than it did for women, and for the well-born than it did for the poor, and for the free citizen than it did for the slave. In the Roman Empire, shame was a social concept that was always mediated by gender and status. Harper says: &quot;The model of normative sexual behavior that developed out of Paul&#x27;s reactions to the erotic culture surrounding him...was a distinct alternative to the social order of the Roman empire.&quot; For Paul, according to Harper, &quot;the body was a consecrated space, a point of mediation between the individual and the divine.&quot; The ethical obligation for sexual self-control was placed equally on all people in the Christian communities, men or women, slave or free. In Paul&#x27;s letters, &quot;porneia&quot;, (a single name for an array of sexual behaviors outside marital intercourse), became a central defining concept of sexual morality, and shunning it, a key sign of choosing to follow Jesus. Sexual morality could be shown by forgoing sex altogether and practicing chastity, remaining virgin, or having sex only within a marriage. Harper indicates this was a transformation in the deep logic of sexual morality as personal rather than social, spiritual rather than merely physical, and for everyone rather than solely for those with status.

==Criticism==

Elizabeth Anderson, a Professor of Philosophy and Women&#x27;s Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, states that &quot;the Bible contains both good and evil teachings&quot;, and it is &quot;morally inconsistent&quot;. Anderson criticizes what she terms morally repugnant lessons of the New Testament. She claims that &quot;Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin&quot; (Matt 10:35–37), that &quot;Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)&quot;, and that Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives &quot;who must obey their husbands as gods&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34–35, Eph. 5:22–24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11–12, 1 Pet. 3:1). Anderson states that the Gospel of John implies that &quot;infants and anyone who never had the opportunity to hear about Christ are damned [to hell], through no fault of their own&quot;.

Anderson criticizes commands God gave to men in the Old Testament, such as: kill adulterers, homosexuals, and &quot;people who work on the Sabbath&quot; (Leviticus 20:10; Leviticus 20:13; Exodus 35:2, respectively); to commit ethnic cleansing (Exodus 34:11–14, Leviticus 26:7–9); commit genocide (Numbers 21: 2–3, Numbers 21:33–35, Deuteronomy 2:26–35, and Joshua 1–12); and other mass killings. Anderson considers the Bible to permit slavery, the beating of slaves, the rape of female captives in wartime, polygamy (for men), the killing of prisoners, and child sacrifice. She also provides a number of examples to illustrate what she considers &quot;God&#x27;s moral character&quot;: &quot;Routinely punishes people for the sins of others ... punishes all mothers by condemning them to painful childbirth&quot;, punishes four generations of descendants of those who worship other gods, kills 24,000 Israelites because some of them sinned (Numbers 25:1–9), kills 70,000 Israelites for the sin of David in 2 Samuel 24:10–15, and &quot;sends two bears out of the woods to tear forty-two children to pieces&quot; because they called someone names in 2 Kings 2:23–24.

Simon Blackburn states that the &quot;Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women&quot;.

Blackburn criticizes what he terms morally suspect themes of the New Testament. He notes some &quot;moral quirks&quot; of Jesus: that he could be &quot;sectarian&quot; (Matt 10:5–6), racist (Matt 15:26 and Mark 7:27), and placed no value on animal life (Luke 8:27–33).

Blackburn provides examples of Old Testament moral criticisms, such as the phrase in Exodus 22:18, which he says has &quot;helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America&quot;: &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; He states that the Old Testament God apparently has &quot;no problems with a slave-owning society&quot;, considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and &quot;is keen on child abuse&quot;. Additional examples that are questioned today are: the prohibition on touching women during their &quot;period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19–24)&quot;, the apparent approval of selling daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:7), and the obligation to put to death someone working on the Sabbath (Exodus 35:2).

<text>Royal Air Force Machrihanish or RAF Machrihanish (formerly ) is a former Royal Air Force station located near the town of Machrihanish and west of Campbeltown, at the tip of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll and Bute, in Scotland.

Two airfields known as Machrihanish have existed, the first was operational during the First World War and was used by the Royal Naval Air Service and RAF, before closing at the end of the Second World War. A second airfield, which was constructed during the Second World War, was used extensively by the Fleet Air Arm during the war. During the 1960s, it was redeveloped and became an RAF station and was made available to the US Navy as a nuclear weapons store and base for components of the US Navy SEALs Naval Special Warfare Group 2.

The draw-down of US military forces in Europe after the end of the Cold War resulted in the US Navy leaving Machrihanish and returning their facilities to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on 30 June 1995, after which the station became MOD Machrihanish and was retained on a care and maintenance basis.

In May 2012, the station was sold to the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company (MACC) under community right-to-buy legislation. MACC now operates the site as a business park, with part of the airfield incorporating Campbeltown Airport.

==History==
===First World War===
An airfield was first established at Machrihanish towards the end of the First World War, west of Campbeltown. The site, known as Machrihanish Aerodrome and Mooring Out Station, extended to and comprised timber and canvas Bessonneau hangars and Armstrong huts. It was operated by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as a secondary station of the Luce Bay Airship Station, located near Stranraer, approximately to the south-east. Due to Machrihanish being relatively open and without the benefit of shelter from woodland, it is thought that the airfield saw little use by airships. On 1 April 1918, Machrihanish came under the control of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), when the RNAS was merged with the army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps. The airfield became part of No. 25 (Operations) Group, with No. 272 Squadron forming on 25 July 1918, operating eighteen Airco DH.6s on anti-submarine patrols in the Firth of Clyde.

Along with its parent station at Luce Bay, Machrihanish closed towards the end of 1918, with the airfield transferring to civil aviation use. In the 1930s, it was used for scheduled flights to Islay, Renfrew and Belfast by Midland &amp; Scottish Air Ferries.

===Second World War===
The airfield was requisitioned by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in 1940 and in April 1941 it became known as Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Machrihanish or HMS &quot;Landrail&quot;. During the same period, a new airfield was constructed by Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons for the FAA to the north west of the existing airfield. The new airfield was opened on 15 June 1941 and was known as RNAS Strabane until the summer of 1941, when it took on the names RNAS Machrihanish and HMS &quot;Landrail&quot;. The original airfield became a satellite station of the new airfield and became known as HMS &quot;Landrail II&quot;.

Throughout the Second World War, Machrihanish was heavily used for training by a wide range of FAA and RAF aircraft and as a base for squadrons disembarked from aircraft carriers. The airfield was also used for operational anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort duties, becoming one of the top three busiest stations in the UK. At the end of the war activity decreased, with the station closing on 16 April 1946. At the same time, HMS &quot;Landrail II&quot; closed, with the land returned to agricultural use.

===Cold War===
After closure, Machrihanish was retained by the FAA on a care and maintenance basis, until 1 December 1951 when it was reopened as a satellite of HMS &quot;Sanderling&quot; (now Glasgow Airport). It was used for a short period for training FAA pilots in preparation for their involvement in the Korean War aboard the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;, before again being reduced to care and maintenance status on 30 September 1952. The airfield was used by the Fleet Requirements Unit in 1958.

==== Redevelopment for US and NATO use ====
In April 1959, it was announced that the airfield would be upgraded in order to support United States and NATO operations in the Clyde area and wider Atlantic. Paid for by NATO, the station underwent extensive redevelopment in the early 1960s, with land belonging to seven farms and six small holdings being acquired for the purpose. Its four existing runways were replaced by a new runway to allow Avro Vulcan bombers and other large aircraft to use the airfield.

Control of Machrihanish was transferred from the Admiralty to the Air Ministry on 27 May 1963. In June 1964, Machrihanish was opened as an RAF station under No. 18 Group, part of RAF Coastal Command. Although not an operational station and with no flying squadrons based there, it was assigned to NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, for use as a forward operating base in the event of war with the Soviet Union.

==== US Navy use ====
The mid-1960s saw the airfield being made available for use to the US Navy. Although nominally still an RAF station, it came under the command of the US Navy&#x27;s Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command. The first U.S. naval personnel arrived in mid-1967 and were from the Mobile Mine Assembly Unit, previously based at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk. They were later joined by an Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Group detachment, part of the US Atlantic Fleet. On 7 March 1968, the Naval Aviation Weapons Facility Machrihanish (NAWF) was opened, its role being to &#x27;receive, store, maintain, issue and tranship classified weapons in support of the US Navy and NATO operations&#x27;. The NAWF comprised a fenced compound located on the north-west side of the airfield, within which were three rows of flat roofed concrete sheds (known as igloos) about 161m long. The rows were sub-divided into compartments featuring air-tight doors and were designed for the storage of nuclear depth charges and atomic demolition munitions, for use in anti-submarine warfare.

A detachment of the US Marine Corps arrived in 1974, with the role of providing nuclear weapons security, which until then had been provided by USN personnel.

The early 1980s saw the arrival of Naval Special Warfare Unit 2 and Naval Special Warfare Task Group Europe, both components of the US Navy SEALs Naval Special Warfare Group 2. New buildings for the SEAL&#x27;s use were constructed in the south-west part of the airfield. The main building featured offices, debriefing areas, armoury, sound proof room, internal 25m firing range and garage. A separate building contained a parachute drying tower and a large hall which allowed large vehicles to access the building directly from transport aircraft. A Gaydon type hangar was also constructed.

From 1981, RAF Machrihanish was certified as a potential emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle, to be used in the case of a transoceanic abort.

Between 1990 and 1995, £16 million and £39.9 million was spent on building works at the station by the Ministry of Defence and NATO respectively.

=== Military draw-down ===

The draw-down of US military forces in Europe after the end of the Cold War resulted in the US Navy leaving Machrihanish and returning their facilities to the Ministry of Defence on 30 June 1995.

After the departure of the US Navy, the station became known as Ministry of Defence (MOD) Machrihanish and was placed under a care and maintenance regime, meaning that although no longer in active use, it would be kept in a condition whereby it could be reactivated within a reasonable time-scale. The airfield continued to be used for occasional military ground and air exercises.

In March 1996, the Civil Aviation Authority granted Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd. (HIAL) an aerodrome licence which allowed commercial flights to operate from the airfield. In this capacity it became known as Campbeltown Airport.

In 2005, the MOD were still reported to be considering reactivating the airfield.

==Closure and post-military use==

With no apparent military future for the station, the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company (MACC) was established in March 2008 by members of the local community who wished to see the site used for the benefit of those living and working in the area.

On 6 October 2008, it was finally announced that Machrihanish was surplus to defence requirements and would be disposed of. On 14 May 2009, the site was advertised for sale with the MOD looking for expressions of interest to identify potential private sector investors. The move was criticised, with members of the local community expressing concern that they had not been consulted and that the potential for a community buy-out of the site was being ignored.

Plans for the buy-out, to be undertaken through community right-to-buy legislation, were hindered in August 2010 when the results of a local community ballot on the plans was rejected by the Scottish Government, due to concerns over the viability of the proposals. However, following a further ballot, MACC successfully purchased the site from the MOD for £1 on 11 May 2012. Supported by Highlands &amp; Island Enterprise, the Scottish Government and Argyll &amp; Bute Council, MACC have made available parts of the site for commercial use with the aim of creating a sustainable future for the Campbeltown area.

Campbeltown Airport, which has a long lease of their part of the site, continues to be operated by HIAL. Scheduled flights are operated to Glasgow Airport by Loganair.

== Heritage ==
Machrihanish&#x27;s station badge, awarded in 1975, features a silver Scottish sword known as a claymore, with the blade displayed against the backdrop of four waves representing the sea. The badge portrays the station&#x27;s use as forward operating base for maritime-related operations. The station&#x27;s motto () is in Scottish Gaelic and translates as &#x27;Arms to defend the sea&#x27;, again acknowledging the station&#x27;s maritime role.

== Conspiracy theories ==
During the 1990s, rumours that Machrihanish was being used by the US military to operate the alleged experimental Aurora reconnaissance aircraft appeared in the media. The rumours led to a parliamentary question by Llew Smith MP, where in response the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nicholas Soames MP, denied that any prototype aircraft belonging to the US was operating from Machrihanish:

<text>Larry Howard Shue (July 23, 1946 – September 23, 1985) was an American playwright and actor, best known for writing two oft-performed farces, &quot;The Nerd&quot; and &quot;The Foreigner&quot;.

==Early life==
Shue was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and grew up in Kansas and Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He graduated cum laude from Illinois Wesleyan University, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts. He served in the United States Army at Fort Lee, Virginia from 1968 to 1972. He then began his career as a professional actor and playwright with the Harlequin Dinner Theatre in both Washington, D.C., and Atlanta. He worked in repertory theater and on the New York stage, and appeared in television&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Film appearances include the shorts &quot;A Common Confusion&quot;; &quot;Another Town&quot;; and &quot;The Land of the Blind: or The Hungry Leaves&quot;; and the feature-length &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot;.

As a member of Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Shue played the sailor Joe in the 1980 premiere of &quot;Lakeboat&quot; by David Mamet. Mamet dedicated the play to Shue and the production&#x27;s director, John Dillon.

Shue married Linda Faye Wilson in 1968; they were divorced in 1977.

==Career==
Shue&#x27;s two best-known plays were written and first performed while he was playwright-in-residence at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater:
*&quot;The Nerd&quot; premiered in April 1981, and was produced successfully in London&#x27;s West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1987. It is a simple character-based comedy, in which a normal dinner party, interrupted by the house-guest from hell, dissolves into insanity.
*&quot;The Foreigner&quot; premiered in 1983, and transferred to Off-Broadway. The central character is Charlie Baker, who, while on a vacation in a Georgia hunting lodge, pretends not to be able to understand English, so as to avoid the attentions of the other guests. His plan backfires and he soon finds himself the confidant of everyone there, especially a young man named Ellard, who thinks he is teaching Charlie English. Charlie ends up having to foil the schemes of the local Ku Klux Klan chapter without revealing his secret.

His other plays include:
*&quot;Grandma Duck Is Dead&quot; – about antics in a college dormitory
*&quot;My Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; – &quot;set in the kingdom of Mango-Chutney, a one-act children&#x27;s musical based on the Hans Christian Andersen story (Shue works in some cross-dressing, as well as a rhyme for &quot;orange&quot;)&quot;
*&quot;Wenceslas Square&quot; – set in 1974 Prague after the Soviet invasion of 1968

The off-Broadway production of &quot;The Foreigner&quot; resulted in two Obie awards in 1985, to Jerry Zaks for direction and Anthony Heald for performance. From the Outer Critics Circle, it received the John Gassner Playwriting Award and the award for Best Off Broadway Play.

==Death==
Shue&#x27;s success was short-lived. At the age of 39, he died in the crash of a Beech 99 commuter plane en route to Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport near Weyers Cave, Virginia; all fourteen people on the flight were killed, twelve passengers and two crew. At the time, Shue was preparing for his first big Broadway role, as Reverend Crisparkle in Joseph Papp&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;.

Among many other eulogies, author Thomas M. Disch said that Shue&#x27;s death was &quot;fate&#x27;s cruelest trick on the theater since the murder of Joe Orton.&quot; Also in remembrance, Canadian actor, Jeff Brooks, said, &quot;I knew him, and I saw him play Charlie [in the play &quot;The Foreigner&quot;] in New York. Then I played it in New York after him, although we&#x27;re quite different as actors.&quot; Shue played the smaller role of Froggy, and Brooks had something to say about that, as well: &quot;I know damn well he wrote Charlie for himself. As an actor, he was such a cut-up. When I saw him, he was wonderful. I remember thinking a couple of times that he&#x27;s doing things that if he were the playwright sitting out here, he&#x27;d be saying, &#x27;Oh, stop that. Cut that out.&#x27; But he was having so much fun inventively in the role.&quot;

<text>Reinaldo Arenas (July 16, 1943 – December 7, 1990) was a Cuban poet, novelist, and playwright who is known as a vocal critic of Fidel Castro, the Cuban Revolution, and the Cuban government. His memoir of the Cuban dissident movement and of being a political prisoner, &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, was dictated after his escape to the United States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift and published posthumously. Arenas, who was dying of AIDS, had committed suicide with an intentional overdose.

== Life ==
Arenas was born in the countryside of Newport Beach, Aguas Claras, Holguín Province, Cuba, and later moved to the city of Holguín as a teenager. He was six years old when he started school, attending Rural School 91 in Perronales County. There, his interest in boys flourished. He later wrote about his sexual exploration with himself. He talked openly of how the first times he had straight sex, while incomplete, was with his cousin, Dulce Maria. He also shared that his first act of gay sex was at 8 with his cousin Orlando, who was 12. Arenas stated, &quot;In the country, sexual energy generally overcomes all prejudice, repression, and punishment... Physical desire overpowers whatever feelings of machismo our fathers take upon themselves to instill in us.&quot;

After moving to Holguín when he was a teen, Arenas got a job at a guava paste factory. When conditions in the city started to get worse, around 1958, he decided that he wanted to join the guerillas (Castro and his movement). When he was 14, he walked to Velasco, where he met Cuco Sánchez, who took him to the pro-Soviet Cuban guerrilla headquarters in the Sierra Gibara. A guerilla commander, Eddy Suñol, interviewed Arenas and said, &quot;We have plenty of guerrillas; what we need is weapons.&quot;

After ten days with the guerilla, Arenas went back to Holguín with the intention of killing a guard and taking his weapon. When he made it back to the city, he went home to see his grandparents who were not so happy to see him. Because he made the mistake of leaving a note saying that he was going to join the guerillas, the women who lived with his grandparents spread the news like wildfire. Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s secret police, the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities, were on the lookout for him. His brief trip home made him realize that he could not stay and so he trekked back to Velasco to the rebel encampment. It now had to accept him.

When he was 16, he was awarded a scholarship at La Pantoja, the Batista military camp that had been converted into a polytechnic institute. There, one of the most important courses was on Marxist–Leninism. Students had to master &quot;Manual of the Soviet Academy of Sciences&quot;, &quot;Manual of Political Economy&quot; by Pyotr Ivanovich Nikitin, and &quot;Foundations of Socialism in Cuba&quot; by Blas Roca Calderio. Arenas graduated as an agricultural accountant but later described his schooling as &quot;communist indoctrination.&quot;

The first time that Arenas was in Havana was in 1960. He returned later when he enrolled in a planning course at the University of Havana and reported to the &quot;Hotel Nacional de Cuba&quot;. While in the program, he worked for the National Institute for Agrarian Reform. It was not until around 1963 that Arenas started to live his life as a gay man, but even then, it was still a life in extreme secrecy. He feared ending up in one of the Military Units to Aid Production, which were concentration camps for LGBT people, Christians, and suspected members of the Cuban dissident movement. A relationship with a man named Miguel, who was later arrested and taken to a UMAP camp, was the beginning of Arenas&#x27;s life of being known as a gay man by the Cuban Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.

Throughout his life, Arenas became friends with and had relationships with many gay men. He went so far as to say that at one point, he had had sex with at least 5,000 men. He watched as various friends and acquaintances pledged their allegiance to the regime in exchange for safety. They became informers for the government and reported other men, often former friends or relations. The intention was to find gay and bisexual men and either prosecute and jail them or turn them into other informers. The reward for co-operating with the regime was having life being spared. Those who became informers, however, often had to participate in public and very humiliating acts of repudiation that publicly denounced their anti-regime beliefs or their homosexuality.

Arenas watched that happen with Herberto Padilla, who had written a book that was critical of the Cuban Revolution to an official competition. Padilla was arrested in 1971, and after 30 days in a cell, he decided to speak. Various Cuban intellectuals were invited by the state security to hear what he had to say. Padilla stood in front of everyone and apologized for everything that he had done. He painted himself as a coward and a traitor, apologized for his previous work, and threw blame on himself. He publicly denounced his friends and his wife and said that they had counterrevolutionary attitudes. Those whom he named were forced to go to the microphone, accept blame for their actions, and say that they were traitors as well. 

In 1963, he moved to Havana to enroll in the School of Planification and later in the Faculty of Letters at the Universidad de La Habana, where he studied philosophy and literature without completing a degree. The following year, he began working at the National Library José Martí. During his time working for the National Institute for Agrarian Reform, he spent much time at the National Library. After writing a short story and presenting it to a committee, he received a telegram that it was interested in talking to him. When he went, he met María Teresa Freye de Andrade, the director of the National Library. She orchestrated Arenas&#x27;s move from the institute to the library. He then became employed there. After María Teresa lost her job and was replaced by Castro&#x27;s police, Captain Sidroc Ramos, Arenas decided the library was not where he wanted to be. It was around then that his talent was noticed, and he received a literary award for his novel, &quot;Singing from the Well&quot;, at the Cirilo Villaverde National Competition, which was held by the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists.

His &quot;El mundo alucinante&quot; (&quot;This Hallucinatory World&quot;, published in the US as &quot;The Ill-Fated Peregrinations of Fray Servando&quot;) was awarded &quot;first Honorable Mention&quot; in 1966. However, as the judges could find no better entry and they refused to award it to Arenas, no First Prize was awarded that year. His writings and openly gay life were by 1967 bringing him into conflict with the communist government. He left the library and became an editor for the Cuban Book Institute until 1968. From 1968 to 1974, he was a journalist and editor for the literary magazine &quot;La Gaceta de Cuba&quot;.

In 1974, he was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of &quot;ideological deviation&quot; and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped the prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube, but he was rearrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious El Morro Castle alongside murderers and rapists. He survived by helping the inmates to write letters to wives and lovers. He collected enough paper that way to continue his writing. However, his attempts to smuggle his work out of prison were discovered, and he was severely punished. Threatened with death, he was forced to renounce his work and was released in 1976.

In 1980, as part of the Mariel Boatlift, he fled to the United States. He came on the &quot;San Lázaro&quot;, a boat captained by the Cuban émigré Roberto Agüero.

== Death ==
In 1987, Arenas was diagnosed with AIDS but continued to write and speak out against the Cuban government. He mentored many Cuban exile writers, including John O&#x27;Donnell-Rosales. After battling AIDS, Arenas died of an intentional overdose of drugs and alcohol on December 7, 1990, in New York City.

In a suicide letter written for publication, Arenas wrote: 

In 2012, Arenas was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.

== Writings ==
Despite his short life and the hardships that were imposed during his imprisonment, Arenas produced a significant body of work. In addition to significant poetic efforts (&quot;El Central&quot;, &quot;Leprosorio&quot;), his &quot;Pentagonia&quot; is a set of five novels that comprise a &quot;secret history&quot; of post-revolutionary Cuba. It includes &quot;Singing from the Well&quot; (in Spanish also titled &quot;Celestino before Dawn&quot;), &quot;Farewell to the Sea&quot; (whose literal translation is &quot;The Sea Once More&quot;), &quot;Palace of the White Skunks&quot;, the Rabelaisian &quot;Color of Summer&quot;, and &quot;The Assault&quot;. In those novels, his style ranges from a stark realist narrative and high modernist experimental prose to absurd satiric humor. His second novel, &quot;Hallucinations&quot; (&quot;El Mundo Alucinante&quot;), rewrites the story of the colonial dissident priest Fray Servando Teresa de Mier.

In interviews, his autobiography, and some of his fiction work, Arenas draws explicit connections between his own life experience and the identities and fates of his protagonists. As is evident and as critics such as Francisco Soto have pointed out, the &quot;child narrator&quot; in &quot;Celestino,&quot; Fortunato in &quot;The Palace...,&quot; Hector in &quot;Farewell..,&quot; and the triply named &quot;Gabriel/Reinaldo/Gloomy Skunk&quot; character in &quot;Color&quot; appear to live progressive stages of a continuous life story that is also linked to Arenas&#x27;s. 

In turn, Arenas consistently links his individual narrated life to the historical experience of a generation of Cubans. A constant theme in his novels and other writing is the condemnation of the Castro government, but Arenas also critiques the Catholic Church and American culture and politics. He also critiques a series of literary personalities in Havana and internationally, particularly those who he believed had betrayed him and suppressed his work (Severo Sarduy and Ángel Rama are notable examples). His &quot;Thirty truculent Tongue-Twisters,&quot; which he claimed to have circulated in Havana and were reprinted in &quot;The Color of Summer,&quot; mock everyone from personal friends, who he suggests may have spied on him, to figures such as Nicolás Guillén, Alejo Carpentier, Miguel Barnet, Sarduy, and of course Castro himself.

His autobiography &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of the ten best books of the year in 1993. In 2000, the work was made into a film, directed by Julian Schnabel in which Arenas was played by Javier Bardem. An opera based on the autobiography with libretto and music by the Cuban-American composer Jorge Martín premiered at the Fort Worth Opera on May 29, 2010, with baritone Wes Mason singing the role of Arenas.

The Reinaldo Arenas Papers are held at Princeton University Library. &quot;The collection consists of personal and working papers of Reinaldo Arenas&quot; and includes typescript and typescript drafts, essays, interviews, newspaper clippings, correspondence, and other documents.

<text>Matthias Grünewald ( – 31 August 1528; also known as Mathis Gothart Nithart) was a German Renaissance painter of religious works who ignored Renaissance classicism to continue the style of late medieval Central European art into the 16th century.

Only ten paintings—including several polyptychs—and thirty-five drawings survive, all religious, although many others were lost at sea on their way to Sweden as war booty. He was obscure until the late nineteenth century, when many of his paintings were attributed to Albrecht Dürer, who is now seen as his stylistic antithesis. His largest and most famous work is the Isenheim Altarpiece created &quot;c.&quot; 1512 to 1516.

==Life==

He was recognised in his own lifetime, as shown by his commissions, yet the details of his life are unusually unclear for a painter of his significance at this date. The first source to sketch his biography comes from the German art historian Joachim von Sandrart, who describes him around 1505 working on the exterior decoration of an altarpiece by Albrecht Dürer in Frankfurt. This is the sort of work typically performed by apprentices and therefore an estimate of his age can be reached, suggesting he was born in 1475. Sandrart records that Grünewald had as an apprentice the painter Hans Grimmer, who became famous in his time, but most of whose works were lost in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Sandrart describes Grünewald as leading a withdrawn and melancholy life, and marrying unhappily.

More recent investigations have provided further information on Grünewald&#x27;s life. In 1511 he became court artist of Uriel von Gemmingen, Archbishop of Mainz, and he also worked for the next archbishop, Albert of Brandenburg. About 1510 he received a commission from the Frankfurt merchant Jacob Heller and settled in nearby Frankfurt where records indicate he bought a house and married Anna, a converted Jew, then probably aged 18. The marriage was not happy and in 1523 she was institutionalised with what is variously described as mental illness and demonic possession.

From 1512 to 1514 or 1515 he worked on the Isenheim altarpiece, apparently in partnership with another Mathis, variously surnamed Nithart, Neithart, von Würzburg (after his place of birth), or Gothardt. Grünewald seems to have left Isenheim in a hurry, returning to Frankfurt, and his subsequent poverty suggests he was not fully paid for the altarpiece. In 1527 he entered the services of the wealthy and noble von Erbach family, apparently with a child (whether his own or adopted, is unclear). He most probably died in 1532, although sources vary.

There has been considerable uncertainty about the details of his life. In 1938 Walter Karl Zülch published the theory that Grünewald and his partner Nithart/Gothardt were the same person; this Nithart/Gothardt was a painter, engineer, and &quot;water artist&quot; born in Würzburg in the 1460s or maybe 1470s and probably dying in 1528. This theory is now generally discredited, although more recent historians believe Nithart/Gothardt may have pretended to be Grünewald for business reasons.

==Works==

Only religious works are included in his small surviving corpus, the most famous being the &quot;Isenheim Altarpiece&quot;, completed 1515, now in the Musée d&#x27;Unterlinden, Colmar. Its nine images on twelve panels are arranged on double wings to present three views (rather than just the open and closed states of triptych altarpieces), according to the season or occasion. The first view with the outer wings closed shows a Crucifixion flanked by Saint Sebastien and Saint Anthony, with a predella showing the entombment. When the first set of wings is opened, the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, &quot;Angelic Concert&quot; (sometimes interpreted as the &quot;Birth of Ecclesia&quot;) &quot;Mary bathing Christ&quot;, and &quot;Resurrection&quot; are displayed. The third view discloses a carved and gilded wood altarpiece by Nikolaus Hagenauer, flanked by the &quot;Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; and &quot;Anthony&#x27;s visit to Saint Paul&quot;. As well as being by far his greatest surviving work, the altarpiece contains most of his surviving painting by surface area, being 2.65 metres high and over 5 metres wide at its fullest extent.

His other works are in Germany, except for a small Crucifixion in Washington and another in Basel, Switzerland. Around 1510 he was asked to paint four saints in grisaille for the outside of the wings of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s Heller Altarpiece in Frankfurt. Dürer&#x27;s work was destroyed by fire and survives only in copies, but the wings have survived, one pair of saints being displayed in Frankfurt&#x27;s Municipal Art Gallery and the other in Karlsruhe&#x27;s, Staatliche Kunsthalle. There are also the late &quot;Tauberbischofsheim altarpiece&quot; in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, and the &quot;Establishment of the Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome&quot; (1517–1519), Augustiner Museum, Freiburg. A large panel of Saint Erasmus and Saint Maurice in Munich probably dates from 1521 to 1524, and was apparently part of a larger altarpiece project, the rest of which has not survived. Other works are in Munich, Karlsruhe, Aschaffenburg and Stuppach (:de). Altogether four somber and awe-filled Crucifixions survive. The visionary character of his work, with its expressive colour and line, is in stark contrast to Dürer&#x27;s works. His paintings are known for their dramatic forms, vivid colors, and depiction of light.

==Reputation==

The Lutheran theologian Philipp Melanchthon is one of the few contemporary writers to refer to Grünewald, who is rather puzzlingly described as &quot;moderate&quot; in style, when compared with Dürer and Cranach; what paintings this judgement is based on is uncertain. By the end of the century, when the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, embarked on his quest to secure as many Dürer paintings as possible, the Isenheim Altarpiece was already generally believed to be a Dürer. 

In the late 19th century he was rediscovered, and became something of a cult figure, with the angst-laden expressionism—and absence of any direct classicism—of the Isenheim Altarpiece appealing to both German Nationalists and Modernists. Joris-Karl Huysmans promoted his art enthusiastically in both novels and journalism, rather as Proust did that of Vermeer. His apparent sympathies with the peasants in the Peasants&#x27; War also brought him admiration from the political left.

The composer Paul Hindemith based his 1938 opera &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot; on the life of Grünewald during the German Peasants&#x27; War; scene Six includes a partial re-enactment of some scenes from the Isenheim Altarpiece.

Elias Canetti wrote his novel &quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot; surrounded by reproductions of the Isenheim altarpiece stuck to the wall.

German author W. G. Sebald traces the life story of Grünewald in his first literary work, &quot;After Nature&quot;. This book-length prose-poem uses the preoccupations of Grünewald and especially his creation of the Isenheim Altarpiece to communicate an intensely apocalyptic vision of a world that has abandoned nature. The Isenheim Altarpiece also features in the last chapter of Sebald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, in which the painter Max Ferber describes his intuition of the extreme power of pain after seeing Grünewald&#x27;s work.

===Veneration===
He is commemorated as an artist and saint by the Lutheran Church on April 6, along with Dürer and Cranach.

<doc id="306575" wikidata="Q1570005" url="?curid=306575" title="Clay tablet">
<text>In the Ancient Near East, clay tablets (Akkadian ) were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in cuneiform, throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age.

Cuneiform characters were imprinted on a wet clay tablet with a stylus often made of reed (reed pen). Once written upon, many tablets were dried in the sun or air, remaining fragile. Later, these unfired clay tablets could be soaked in water and recycled into new clean tablets. Other tablets, once written, were either deliberately fired in hot kilns, or inadvertently fired when buildings were burnt down by accident or during conflict, making them hard and durable. Collections of these clay documents made up the first archives. They were at the root of the first libraries. Tens of thousands of written tablets, including many fragments, have been found in the Middle East.

Surviving tablet-based documents from the Minoan/Mycenaean civilizations, are mainly those which were used for accounting. Tablets serving as labels with the impression of the side of a wicker basket on the back, and tablets showing yearly summaries, suggest a sophisticated accounting system. In this cultural region, tablets were never fired deliberately as the clay was recycled on an annual basis. However, some of the tablets were &quot;fired&quot; as a result of uncontrolled fires in the buildings where they were stored. The rest, remain tablets of unfired clay and are therefore extremely fragile. For this reason, some institutions are investigating the possibility of firing them &quot;now&quot; to aid in their preservation.

== Scribes (&quot;dub-sar&quot;) ==
Writing was not as we see it today. In Mesopotamia, writing began as simple counting marks, sometimes alongside a non-arbitrary sign, in the form of a simple image, pressed into clay tokens or less commonly cut into wood, stone or pots. In that way, the exact number of goods involved in a transaction could be recorded. This convention began when people developed agriculture and settled into permanent communities that were centered on increasingly large and organized trading marketplaces. These marketplaces were purposed for the trade of sheep, grain, and bread loaves, where transactions were recorded with clay tokens. These, initially very small clay tokens, were continually used all the way from the pre-historic Mesopotamia period, 9000 BCE, to the start of the historic period around 3000 BCE, when the use of writing for recording was widely adopted.

The clay tablet was thus being used by scribes to record events happening during their time. Tools that these scribes used were styluses with sharp triangular tips, making it easy to leave markings on the clay; the clay tablets themselves came in a variety of colors such as bone white, chocolate, and charcoal. Pictographs then began to appear on clay tablets around 4000 BCE, and after the later development of Sumerian cuneiform writing, a more sophisticated partial syllabic script evolved that by around 2500 BCE was capable of recording the vernacular, the everyday speech of the common people.

Sumerians used what is known as pictograms. Pictograms are symbols that express a pictorial concept, a logogram, as the meaning of the word. Early writing also began in Ancient Egypt using hieroglyphs. Early hieroglyphs and some of the modern Chinese characters are other examples of pictographs. The Sumerians later shifted their writing to Cuneiform, defined as &quot;Wedge writing&quot; in Latin, which added phonetic symbols, syllabograms.

== Uses of clay tablets ==

Text on clay tablets took the forms of myths, fables, essays, hymns, proverbs, epic poetry, business records, laws, plants, and animals. What these clay tablets allowed was for individuals to record who and what was significant. An example of these great stories was &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. This story would tell of the great flood that destroyed Sumer. Remedies and recipes that would have been unknown were then possible because of the clay tablet. Some of the recipes were stew, which was made with goat, garlic, onions and sour milk.

By the end of the 3rd Millennium BCE, (2200–2000 BCE), even the &quot;short story&quot; was first attempted, as independent scribes entered into the philosophical arena, with stories like: &quot;Debate between bird and fish&quot;, and other topics, (List of Sumerian debates).

== Communication ==

Communication grew faster as now there was a way to get messages across just like mail. Important and private clay tablets were coated with an extra layer of clay, that no one else would read it. This means of communicating was used for over 3000 years in fifteen different languages. Sumerians, Babylonians and Eblaites all had their own clay tablet libraries.

==Proto-writing==
The Tărtăria tablets, the Danubian civilization, may be still older, having been dated by indirect method (bones found near the tablet were carbon dated) to before 4000 BCE, and possibly dating from as long ago as 5500 BCE, but their interpretation remains controversial because the tablets were fired in a furnace and the properties of the carbon changed accordingly.

==History by region==

===Babylonia===

Fragments of tablets containing the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; dating to 1800–1600 BCE have been discovered. A full version has been found on tablets dated to the 1st millennium BCE.

Tablets on Babylonian astronomical records (such as Enuma Anu Enlil and MUL.APIN) date back to around 1800 BCE. Tablets discussing astronomical records continue through around 75 CE.

Late Babylonian tablets at the British Museum refer to appearances of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 164 BCE and 87 BCE.

<text>The Padri War (also called the Minangkabau War) was fought from 1803 until 1837 in West Sumatra, Indonesia between the Padri and the Adat. The Padri were Muslim clerics from Sumatra who wanted to impose Sharia in Minangkabau in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The Adat comprised the Minangkabau nobility and traditional chiefs. They asked for the help of the Dutch, who intervened in 1821 and helped the nobility defeat the Padri faction.

==Background==
It can be considered that the Padri War began in 1803, before Dutch intervention, and was a conflict that had broken out in Minangkabau country when the Padri started to suppress what they saw as unIslamic customs, i.e. the &quot;adat&quot;. But after the occupation of the Pagaruyung Kingdom by Tuanku Pasaman, one of the Padri leaders in 1815, on 21 February 1821, the Minangkabau nobility made a deal with the Dutch in Padang to help them fight the Padri.

&quot;Adat&quot;, as customary law is called in Indonesia, includes indigenous, pre-Islamic religious practices and social traditions in local customs. The Padri, like contemporaneous jihadists in the Sokoto Caliphate of West Africa, were Islamist purists who had made the hajj to Mecca and returned inspired to bring the Qur&#x27;an and sharia to a position of greater influence in Sumatra. The Padri movement had formed during the early 19th century and sought to purge the culture of traditions and beliefs its partisans viewed as un-Islamic.

In the 1820s, the Dutch had yet to consolidate their possessions in some parts of the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia) after re-acquiring it from the British. This was especially true on the island of Sumatra, where some areas would not come under Dutch rule until the 20th century.

==Padri==
From c.1692, Islam was propagated to the Minangkabau areas of West Sumatra by Sheikh Burhanuddin Ulakan in the Shattari school of Sufism. In 1784, the Sufi ulama called Tuanku Nan Tuo was appointed as the religious head of the Koto Tuo region. He appointed a large number of his students to head various surau surrounding the region. A great number of his students were Hajj returnees and were influenced by the ideals of the Wahabi movement. They called themselves Padri. The Padri movement is considered one of the major precursors of &quot;the Salafiyya&quot; movement of the 19th century; and influenced the Salafi reformist Muhammadiyyah movement of South East Asia.

The Padri had their extremist version of Sharia law which they would implement through violent upheaval to replace the existing &quot;Adat&quot;. Historical accounts of the Padri War reveal several different ideologies. The most influential were by Tuanku Nan Tuo, Tuan Ku Nan Renceh, and Imam Bonjol.

Tuanku Nan Tuo was a Shattari Sufi leader and reformist, not a Padri. He would convince villagers to rid their society of vices like cock-fighting, gambling, and opium. His methods would be through discussion, education, and also public protest. All the Padri leaders were once his students and he continuously disagreed with their extremist fanaticism and militant violence. In revenge for this insolence, the Padri attacked and burnt down numerous villages which were Shattari centers; instigated mass murder of the ulama and &quot;rang cerdek&quot; (intelligentsia) as well as rape and plunder. The Padri waged war against Nan Tuo&#x27;s village of Koto Tuo from 1815. Nan Tuo&#x27;s sons died in battle. Koto Tuo held on until the Dutch arrived in 1821.

Tuanku Nan Renceh was an extremist Wahabbi puritan. Nan Renceh with Tuan Ku Lintau and Tuan Ku Pasaman were at war with the &quot;Adat&quot; and would forbid cock-fighting, gambling, and sireh; and forced women to cover up. Any that disagreed with their interpretation of Islam were punishable by death. They grew wealthy by enslaving the population to grow coffee and other agriculture. While forcing residents to wear white and grow beards, they would wear red.

Imam Bonjol was a mystic, strategist, and visionary. Imam Bonjol with Tuan Ku Rao and Tuan Ku Tambusai were based in the northern areas where the Padri War evolved differently. Many in the north were early Padri sympathisers. While they were as militant and extremist as Nan Renceh initially, their roles were quite different. While Nan Renceh was punishing the &quot;Adat&quot; population, Imam Bonjol and Rao were developing trading routes and fortresses against the Dutch. He also enslaved the Batak people. In January 1824, he signed a peace treaty with the Dutch but a new commander arrived and dishonoured it. In 1831, Imam Bonjol attacked a Dutch garrison killing off 2 thirds of the soldiers. Later, as Imam Bonjol met numerous Hajj returnees who contested the Padri and Wahabbi extremism, he began to have misgivings, doubts, and regrets. By September 1832, Imam Bonjol was disillusioned and, perhaps seeking repentance, he walked out of his village fort and left the Padri.

== First Padri War 1803–1825 ==

===Beginning 1803–1821===
Upon the return of three alim ulama from Mecca around 1803, namely Haji Miskin, Haji Sumanik and Haji Piobang, they expressed their wish to perfecting the application of Islamic law in Minangkabau society. Knowing this, Tuanku Nan Renceh was very interested and supported the wishes of the three scholars. Together with other scholars, these eight figures are known as Harimau Nan Salapan (Tigers of Eight).

Harimau Nan Salapan then asked Tuanku Lintau who has closeness and kinship with Yang Dipertuan Pagaruyung Sultan Arifin Muningsyah to invite the Indigenous People to abandon several habits that are contrary to the teachings Islam. In several negotiations there was no agreement between the Padri and the Indigenous People. This conflict led to turmoil among several nagari in the Pagaruyung Kingdom, until in 1815, the Padri under the leadership of Tuanku Lintau attacked the Pagaruyung Kingdom and war broke out in Koto Tangah. This attack caused Sultan Arifin Muningsyah to be forced to step aside and flee the royal capital. Notes of Thomas Stamford Raffles who visited Pagaruyung in 1818, stated that he only found the remains of Pagaruyung Royal Palace which was burned down.
As part of the Dutch aid agreement, the Indigenous People surrendered the areas of Simawang and Sulit Air, by order of resident James du Puy in Padang. Then on 8 December 1821 additional troops arrived led by Lieutenant Colonel Raaff to strengthen the position in the area that had been controlled.

On 4 March 1822, Dutch troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Raaff succeeded in pushing the Padri people out of Pagaruyung. Then the Dutch built a defensive fort in Batusangkar with the name Fort Van der Capellen, while the Padri gathered strength and defended themselves in Lintau.

===Battle of Baso (1822)===
On 14 August 1822, Padri Ulama forces faced battle with Dutch forces, the Padri Ulama succeeded in defeating the Dutch and their commander was wounded in action.

=== Battle of Batusangkar (1822)===
The battle occurred in 1822 in Batusangkar, where the Padri raided the Dutch. The Dutch suffered heavy casualties including the destruction of the Dutch unit, and their commander was killed in action.

===Battle of Lintau (1823)===
After the Dutch obtained support, they attacked Lintau but the Padri Ulama forces successfully defended, defeating the Dutch forces, causing them to withdraw to Batusangkar.

=== Battle of Bukittinggi (1825) ===
Padri troops carried out a well-planned frontal attack, surprising the Dutch troops, who were not fully prepared for a large-scale attack. This attack inflicted heavy losses on the Dutch.

=== Battle of Sulit Air (1825) ===
The Battle of Sulit Air was also one of the Padri&#x27;s victories, where they succeeded in expelling the Dutch troops from the area and also sacked the Dutch headquarters.

==Treaty of Masang==
Dutch involvement in the war came about because it was &quot;in ited&quot; by the Adat faction, and in April 1821, Dutch troops attacked Simawang and Sulit Air under captains Goffinet and Dienema on the orders of James du Puy, the Dutch Resident in Padang. Between 1821 and 1824, skirmishes broke out throughout the region, ended only by the Treaty of Masang. The war cooled down during the next six years, as the Dutch faced larger-scale uprisings in Java.

== Second Padri War 1831–1838 ==

=== The Fall of Luhak Nan Tigo 1831–1833 ===
After the end of the Diponegoro War and the restoration of Dutch East Indies power in Java, the Dutch East Indies government again tried to subdue the Padri. This is very much based on a strong desire to control coffee cultivation which is expanding in the interior of Minangkabau (the Darek region). Until the 19th century, coffee was one of the mainstay products of the Dutch in Europe. Christine Dobbin calls it more of a trade war, this is in line with the dynamics of social change in Minangkabau society in the twists and turns of trade in the interior and on the west coast or east coast. Meanwhile, on the one hand, the Dutch wanted to take over or have a monopoly.

Furthermore, to weaken the opposing forces, the Dutch violated the ceasefire agreement by attacking the nagari Pandai Sikek which was one of the areas capable of producing gunpowder and firearms. Then to strengthen its position, the Dutch built a fort in Bukittinggi which was known as Fort de Kock. At the beginning of August 1831, Lintau was successfully conquered and put Luhak Tanah Datar under Dutch control. However, Tuanku Lintau still continued to fight from the Luhak Limo Puluah area.

Meanwhile, when Lieutenant Colonel Elout carried out various attacks against The Padri between 1831 and 1832, he obtained additional strength from the troops of Sentot Prawirodirdjo, one of the commanders of Prince Diponegoro who had defected and served in the Dutch East Indies government after the war in Java ended. However, then Lieutenant Colonel Elout argued that the presence of Sentot who was stationed in Lintau actually created new problems. Several official Dutch documents prove that Sentot was guilty of conspiring with the Padri so that Sentot and his legions were then returned to Java. In Java, Sentot also failed to dispel Dutch suspicions about him and sent him back to Sumatra. Sentot was exiled and detained in Bengkulu, while his troops were disbanded and then recruited back into the Dutch army.
In July 1832, from Batavia a large infantry force was sent under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Ferdinand P. Vermeulen Krieger, to speed up the completion of the war. In October 1832, Luhak Limo Puluah was under Dutch rule at the same time as Tuanku Lintau died. Then The Padri continued to consolidate and entrench themselves in Kamang, but the entire strength of the Padri in Luhak Agam also was conquered by the Dutch after the fall of Kamang Magek, Agam Kamang at the end of 1832, so that the Padri were again forced to withdraw from Luak Luhak area and defend themselves in Bonjol.

=== Consolidation of Indigenous Peoples and Padri 1833 ===

Since 1833 a compromise began to emerge between Indigenous People and Padri People. On 11 January 1833, several strongholds of the Dutch garrison were suddenly attacked, making the situation chaotic; mentioned there were around 139 European soldiers and hundreds of native soldiers were killed. Sultan nggul Alam Bagagar who was previously appointed by the Dutch as &quot;Regent of Tanah Datar&quot;, was captured by the troops of Lieutenant Colonel Elout on 2 May 1833 in Batusangkar on charges of treason and exiled to Batavia. In Dutch records Sultan nggul Alam Bagagar denied his involvement in the attack on several Dutch posts, but the Dutch Indies government also did not want to take the risk of rejecting the reports from its officers. The position of &quot;Regent of Tanah Datar&quot; was then given to Tuan Gadang in Batipuh.
Then the Dutch troops began conducting searches in several areas which were still the base of the Padri tribe. In January 1833, Dutch troops built a fortification in Padang Matinggi, but before they could strengthen their position, the fortification was attacked by the Padri under the leadership of Tuanku Rao which resulted in many Dutch casualties. However, in the battle at Air Bangis, on 29 January 1833, Tuanku Rao suffered serious injuries as a result of being hit by bullets. Then he was put on board the ship for exile. Not long after he was on the ship, Tuanku Rao met his death. It is suspected that his body was then thrown into the sea by Dutch soldiers.
Realizing this, now the Dutch are not only facing the Padri but the entire Minangkabau community. So the Dutch East Indies Government in 1833 issued an announcement called &quot;Long Plaque&quot; containing a statement that the arrival of the Dutch to Minangkabau did not intend to control the country, they only came to trade and maintain security, the Minangkabau population would continue to be ruled by the Dutch East Indies, their chief and are not required to pay tax. Then the Dutch argued that to maintain security, build roads, open schools, and so on required money, so the people were obliged to grow coffee and had to sell it to the Dutch.

=== Attack on Fort Amerogen ===
On January 1833 the forces led by Tuanku Tambusai launched the storming attacks on Dutch fort in Sepisang,Bonjol. In the battles the Dutch forces did not expect the suprise attack by Padri forces,the Padri forces effectively attacked the fort and inflicted heavy losses to Dutch sides and killed 11 Dutch troops, and 24 other Dutch troops were wounded.

=== Attack on Bonjol 1833–1835 ===
This war took a long time to complete, forcing Governor General of the Dutch East Indies Johannes van den Bosch on 23 August 1833 to go to Padang to see up close the process of military operations carried out by Dutch troops . Arriving in Padang, he held negotiations with Commissioner Pesisir Barat Sumatra, Major General Riesz and Lieutenant Colonel Elout to immediately conquer Fort Bonjol, the command center of the Padri troops.
Riesz and Elout explained that the right time had not yet come to carry out a general attack on Fort Bonjol, because of the loyalty of the people of Luhak Agam is still doubtful and it is very possible that they will attack the Dutch troops from behind. But van den Bosch insisted on immediately conquering Fort Bonjol no later than 10 September 1833, the two officers asked for a six-day delay so that the fall of Bonjol was expected on 16 September 1833.
Even though the movement of Dutch troops towards Bonjol was still very slow, it took almost a month to approach the area Alahan Panjang Valley. As the leading &quot;front&quot; of Alahan Panjang is the area Padang Lawas which is still fully controlled by The Padri. However, on 8 June 1835, Dutch troops succeeded in controlling this area. The very dense bushes and forests around Bonjol made it difficult for the Dutch troops to see the Padri strongholds. This situation was put to good use by the Padri to build a strategic stronghold, as well as being the main headquarters of Tuanku Imam Bonjol.
The tactics of guerilla attacks applied by The Padri succeeded in slowing down the Dutch attack on Fort Bonjol, even in several resistances almost all of the Dutch troops&#x27; war equipment such as cannons and their supplies were able to recover. confiscated. Dutch troops could only carry weapons and clothing attached to their hands and bodies. So on 21 September 1833, before the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies was replaced by Jean Chrétien Baud, van den Bosch made a report that the attack on Bonjol had failed and efforts were being made to consolidate for the next attack.
During 1834, the Dutch focused on building roads and bridges leading to Bonjol, Pasaman|Bonjol by mobilizing thousands of forced laborers. This was done to facilitate the mobility of his troops in conquering Bonjol. Apart from that, the Dutch also continued to try to exert influence in several areas close to their strongholds.
Then, on 11 June 1835, the Dutch troops moved again to the east of Batang Alahan Panjang and built a fortification there, while the Padri troops remained on standby on the other side.
Dutch troops managed to approach Bonjol, Pasaman|Bonjol] within a distance of approximately only 250 steps at midnight on 16 June 1835, then they tried to build a fortification. Next, using houwitsers, mortars and cannons, the Dutch troops fired at Fort Bonjol. However, the Padri did not remain silent by firing cannons from Tajadi Hill. So with a less favorable position, the Dutch troops suffered many casualties.

=== Fort Bonjol ===

Fort Bonjol is located on a hill which is almost straight up, known as Bukit Tajadi. Not so far from this fort flows Batang Alahan Panjang, a river in the middle of the valley with a fast flow, winding from north to south. This fort is shaped like a long rectangle, surrounded on three sides by two layers of defensive walls approximately 3 meters high. Between the two layers of wall a deep trench was made with a width of 4 meters. The outer wall consists of large stones with almost the same construction technique as fortresses in Europe and on top of it is planted bamboo with long thorns which are planted very close together so that the Padri can observed and even fired cannons at the Dutch troops.
The very dense bushes and forests around Bonjol made it difficult for the Dutch troops to see the Padri strongholds. This situation was put to good use by the Padri to build a strategic stronghold, as well as being the main headquarters of Tuanku Imam Bonjol.

=== Siege of Bonjol 1835–1837 ===

Seeing the strength of Fort Bonjol, the Dutch troops tried to carry out a blockade against Bonjol with the aim of paralyzing the supply of food and weapons for the Padri troops. . This blockade turned out to be ineffective, because it was the Dutch troops&#x27; strongholds and supplies that were attacked by Padri troops in a guerilla manner.
At the same time, all Padri troops began to arrive from areas that had been conquered by Dutch troops, namely from various countries in Minangkabau and surrounding areas. Everyone is determined to defend the Bonjol headquarters until the last drop of blood, live a noble life or die martyrdom.
Efforts to carry out an offensive attack on Bonjol were only made again after army reinforcements consisting of Bugis troops arrived, so in mid-August 1835 attacks began to be carried out against the Padri strongholds in Fort Fort. Bukit Tajadi, and these Bugis troops were at the front of the Dutch troops in capturing one by one the strategic strongholds of the Padri people around Bukit Tajadi.
However, until early September 1835, the Dutch troops had not succeeded in controlling Mount Tajadi, instead on 5 September 1835, The Padri came out of their strongholds and stormed outside the fort destroying the Dutch fortifications built around Mount Tajadi. After the attack, the Padri troops immediately returned to Bonjol Fort.
On 9 September 1835, Dutch troops tried to attack from the direction of Luhak Limo Puluah and Padang Bubus, but the results failed, even causing many losses to the Dutch troops. Lieutenant Colonel Bauer, one of the commanders of the Dutch troops, suffered from illness and was forced to be sent to Bukittinggi and then his position was replaced by Major Prager.
The protracted blockade and the courage of the Padri, aroused the courage of the surrounding people to rebel and attack the Dutch troops, so that on 11 December 1835, the people of Simpang and Alahan Mati took up arms and attacked the strongholds. Dutch defense.
The Dutch troops were unable to overcome this resistance. However, after assistance arrived from Madura soldiers who served in the Dutch troops, this resistance was overcome.
Almost a year after besieging Bonjol, on 3 December 1836, Dutch troops again carried out a large-scale attack on Fort Bonjol, as a final attempt to conquer Bonjol. This powerful attack was able to breach part of Fort Bonjol, so that Dutch troops could invade and succeed in killing several families of Tuanku Imam Bonjol. However, with tenacity and high fighting spirit, the Padri again managed to ravage the enemy so that the Dutch were expelled and forced to leave the fort again, leaving behind many casualties on each side.
The failure of this conquest really hit the policy of the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia which at that time had been held by Dominique Jacques de Eerens, then at the beginning of 1837 he sent a warlord named Major General Cochius to directly lead a massive attack on Fort Bonjol for the umpteenth time. Cochius was a high-ranking Dutch officer who had expertise in the war strategy of &quot;Fort Stelsel&quot;.
Next, the Dutch intensively surrounded Bonjol from all directions for about six months (16 March–17 August 1837) led by a general and several officers. This joint army mostly consisted of various tribes, such as Java, Madura, Bugis and Ambon. There were 148 officers European, 36 officers indigenous, 1,103 soldiers European, 4,130 soldiers indigenous, including &quot;Sumenapsche hulptroepen hieronder begrepen&quot; (auxiliary troops of Sumenap aka Madura). In the list of names of Dutch troop officers include Majjen Cochius, Lieutenant Colonel Bauer, Major Sous, Major Prager, Captain MacLean, Lieutenant van der Tak, Peltu Steinmetz, etc. Then there are also &quot;Inlandsche&quot; (indigenous) names such as Kapitein Noto Prawiro, Indlandsche Lieutenant Prawiro di Logo, Karto Wongso Wiro Redjo, Prawiro Sentiko, Prawiro Brotto, Merto Poero and others.
From Batavia, additional Dutch troops were imported, who arrived on 20 July 1837 on the Perle Ship in Padang, a number of Europeans and Sepoys, soldiers from Africa who served in the Dutch army, recruited from Ghana and Mali, consisting of 1 sergeant, 4 corporaals and 112 flankeurs, and led by Kapitein Sinninghe.
Waves and continuous attacks and rain of bullets from artillery troops armed with large cannons, for approximately 6 months, as well as infantry and cavalry troops who continued to arrive. On 3 August 1837, led by Lieutenant Colonel Michiels as the foremost field commander, he began to control the situation little by little, and finally on 15 August 1837, Tajadi Hill fell, and on 16 August 1837, Fort Bonjol was completely conquered. However, Tuanku Imam Bonjol was able to withdraw from the fort accompanied by several of his followers and continued towards the Marapak area.

==Impact==
With the victory, the Dutch tightened their hold on West Sumatra. Yet, the traditional and religious leaders increasingly reconciled their visions after the war. This helped promulgating the new view of &quot;adat basandi syara&#x27;, syara&#x27; basandi Kitabullah&quot; (&quot;tradition founded upon Islamic law, Islamic law founded upon the Qur&#x27;an&quot;).

<text>The Mouflon (Ovis gmelini) is a wild sheep native to Cyprus, and the Caspian region, including eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Iran. It is also found in parts of Europe. It is thought to be the ancestor of all modern domestic sheep breeds.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ovis gmelini&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Edward Blyth in 1841 for wild sheep in the Middle East.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, several wild sheep were described that are considered mouflon subspecies today:
* &quot;Ovis ophion&quot; by Blyth in 1841 for wild sheep in Cyprus;
* &quot;Ovis laristanica&quot; by Nikolai Nasonov in 1909 for wild sheep in Lar in southern Iran;
* &quot;Ovis orientalis isphahanica&quot; by Nasonov in 1910 for wild sheep in the Zagros Mountains.

== Subspecies ==
Five mouflon subspecies are distinguished by MSW3:
* Armenian mouflon (Armenian red sheep), &quot;O. g. gmelini&quot; (Blyth, 1851): nominate subspecies; native to northwestern Iran, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It has been introduced to Texas in the U.S.
* Esfahan mouflon, &quot;O. g. isphahanica&quot; (Nasonov, 1910): Zagros Mountains, Iran.
* Laristan mouflon, &quot;O. g. laristanica&quot; (Nasonov, 1909): a small subspecies, its range is restricted to some desert reserves near Lar in southern Iran.
* Cyprus mouflon, &quot;O. g. ophion&quot; (Blyth, 1841): also called &quot;agrino&quot; (from the Greek ); nearly driven to extinction during the 20th century. In 1997, about 1,200 individuals were counted. The television show &quot;Born to Explore with Richard Wiese&quot; reported 3,000 individuals on Cyprus.
* Anatolian mouflon, &quot;O. g. anatolica&quot; (Arıhan, 2000), an almost extinct population of mouflon that nowadays only survives in the region of Konya, Turkey 

The European mouflon was once thought to be a subspecies of the mouflon, but is now considered to be a feral descendant of the domestic sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), as &quot;Ovis aries musimon&quot;.

==Relation to other sheep==
Based on comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences, three groups of sheep (&quot;Ovis&quot;) have been identified: Pachyceriforms of Siberia (snow sheep) and North America (bighorn and Dall sheep), Argaliforms (argali) of Central Asia, and Moufloniforms (urial, mouflon, and domestic sheep) of Eurasia. However, a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA control region (CR) found that two subspecies of urial, &quot;Ovis vignei&quot; (or &quot;orientalis&quot;) &quot;arkal&quot; and &quot;O. v./o. bochariensis&quot;, grouped with two different clades of argali (&quot;Ovis ammon&quot;).

The ancestral sheep is presumed to have had 60 chromosomes, as in goats (&quot;Capra&quot;). Mouflon and domestic sheep have 54 chromosomes, with three pairs (1+3, 2+8, 5+11) of ancestral acrocentric chromosomes joined to form bi-armed chromosomes. This is in contrast to the argali and urial, which have 56 and 58 chromosomes respectively. If the urial is as closely related to the mouflons as mitochondrial DNA indicates, then two chromosomes would need to have split during its evolution away from the mouflon (sub)species.

==Description==

Mouflon have reddish to dark brown, short-haired coats with dark back stripes and black ventral areas and light-colored saddle patches. The males are horned; some females are horned, while others are polled. The horns of mature rams are curved almost one full revolution (up to 85 cm). Mouflon have shoulder heights of around 0.9 m and body weights of 50 kg (males) and 35 kg (females).

==Distribution and habitat==
Mouflon are found in the Lesser Caucasus in southeastern Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in Iran&#x27;s western Alborz region and the Zagros Mountains spanning eastern Iraq and western Iran. They were possibly introduced to Cyprus during the Neolithic period.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Reproduction ===
Mouflon rams have a strict dominance hierarchy. Before mating season or &quot;rut&quot;, which is from late autumn to early winter, rams try to create a dominance hierarchy to determine access to ewes (female mouflon) for mating. Mouflon rams fight one another to obtain dominance and win an opportunity to mate with females. Mouflons reach sexual maturity at the age of two to four years. Young rams need to obtain dominance before they get a chance to mate, which takes another three years. Mouflon ewes also go through a similar hierarchy process in terms of social status in the first two years, but can breed even at low status. Pregnancy in females lasts five months, in which they produce one to two offspring.

A mouflon was cloned successfully in early 2001, and lived at least seven months, making it the first clone of an endangered mammal to survive beyond infancy. This demonstrated that a common species (in this case, a domestic sheep) can successfully become a surrogate for the birth of an exotic animal such as the mouflon. If cloning of the mouflon can proceed successfully, it has the potential to reduce strain on the number of living specimens.

== Conservation ==
The mouflon is protected in Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Turkey and Iran, hunting is only allowed with a special license. The population in Cyprus is listed as a strictly protected species in the Habitats Directive of the European Union and has been listed in CITES Appendix I since November 2019.

==In culture==

The male mouflon is called &quot;Mufro&quot; in Corsica, and the female &quot;Mufra&quot;; the French naturalist Buffon (1707–1788) rendered this in French as &quot;&quot;. In Sardinia, the male is called &quot;Murvoni&quot;, and the female &quot;Murva&quot;, though it is not unusual to hear the peasants style both indiscriminately &quot;Mufion&quot;, which is a palpable corruption of the Greek &quot;Ophion&quot;.
* The mouflon was the logo of Cyprus Airways until 2015, and is depicted on the 1-, 2-, and 5-cent Cypriot euro coins.
* The mouflon is featured on the historical flag of the Armenian kingdom of Syunik, and on tombstones.
* The mouflon is the symbol and the nickname of the Cyprus national rugby union team.
* The mouflon is the official mascot of Craghoppers, the UK outdoor clothing manufacturer.

<doc id="306587" wikidata="Q1622440" url="?curid=306587" title="Portrait of an American Family">
<text>Portrait of an American Family is the debut studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on July 19, 1994, by Nothing and Interscope Records. The group was formed in 1989 by vocalist Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, whose names were created by combining the given name of a pop culture icon with the surname of a serial killer: a naming convention which all other band members would conform to for the next seven years. The most prominent lineup of musicians during their formative years included keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, bassist Gidget Gein and drummer Sara Lee Lucas.

The band&#x27;s visually spectacular concerts earned them a loyal fanbase in the South Florida punk and hardcore music scene, eventually gaining the attention of Nine Inch Nails vocalist Trent Reznor, who signed them to his Nothing Records vanity label. The album was initially produced by Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami under the title &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot;. However, the band was unhappy with his production, and this material was then re-produced and remixed in various Los Angeles recording studios by Manson and Reznor, along with assistant producers Sean Beavan and Alan Moulder. Parts of the album were re-recorded at Reznor&#x27;s home studio at 10050 Cielo Drive, where members of the Manson Family infamously committed the Tate murders in 1969.

Gidget Gein was not invited to the L.A. recording sessions. He had been fired from the band in late 1993 due to his ongoing addiction to heroin. Gein was replaced by Twiggy Ramirez. Despite this, Gein is credited with performing the entirety of the bass work on the album, while the majority of Sara Lee Lucas&#x27; live drumming was replaced with electronic drum programming from Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Charlie Clouser. The record contains a wide array of cultural references; Interscope delayed its release on several occasions due to the inclusion of references to Charles Manson, and also because of objections to its controversial artwork.

&quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; was released to limited commercial success and mostly positive reviews; in 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deemed the album one of the greatest in the history of heavy metal music. The group embarked on several concert tours to promote the release, including appearing as an opening act on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Self Destruct Tour&quot;, as well as the &quot;Portrait of an American Family Tour&quot;. &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; and &quot;Lunchbox&quot; were issued as commercial singles, while &quot;Dope Hat&quot; was released as a promotional single. The record was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003 for shipments of over 500,000 units in the United States.

==Background==
Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids was formed in December 1989 when vocalist Marilyn Manson met guitarist Daisy Berkowitz at the Reunion Room, a small nightclub in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The two were writing original compositions by the beginning of 1990, with Manson the sole lyricist and Berkowitz composing the majority of music. Until 1996, the names of band members were derived from combining the first name of a pop culture icon with the surname of a serial killer. The earliest incarnation of the band also included Olivia Newton Bundy on bass guitar, and Zsa Zsa Speck on keyboards, along with an electronic drum machine. Speck was hired by the band on a temporary basis as their original choice for keyboardist, Madonna Wayne Gacy, was unable to obtain a keyboard. The original lineup was retained for two performances, the first of which took place at Churchill&#x27;s Hideaway in Miami, with 20 audience members in attendance. As Gacy could still not afford to purchase an instrument, he appeared on-stage at their second show – at the Reunion Room – playing with toy soldiers. Speck and Bundy both exited the group sometime after this performance.
The band&#x27;s highly visualized concerts primarily drew from elements of shock art. Their live shows routinely featured naked women nailed to crucifixes, young children locked in cages, amateur pyrotechnics and sadomasochism, as well as piñatas filled with butchered animal remains and experiments in reverse psychology. These concerts quickly earned them a loyal fanbase among the South Florida punk and hardcore music scene, and were playing sold-out shows in 300-capacity nightclubs throughout Florida within six months of forming. In February 1990, while working as a journalist at &quot;25th Parallel&quot;, Manson interviewed Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The pair remained friends afterwards, and Reznor was eventually presented with a compilation of the band&#x27;s demo recordings. After being impressed by the material, Reznor offered the group a spot opening for Nine Inch Nails and Meat Beat Manifesto at Club Nu in Miami on July 3, 1990.

In early 1991, the group signed a record deal with Sony Music. However, Berkowitz later recalled that the president of A&amp;R at the label, Richard Griffin, &quot;personally rejected us within minutes, saying he liked the show and the idea but &#x27;didn&#x27;t like the singer&#x27;&quot;. They used the proceeds of the deal to fund the recording of subsequent demo tapes. Bassist Gidget Gein and live drummer Sara Lee Lucas would eventually join the band, and they continued touring and releasing EPs independently for the next two years. In November 1992, Reznor invited the band&#x27;s vocalist to attend &quot;strategic talks&quot; in Los Angeles, and to appear as a guitarist in a music video for the Nine Inch Nails track &quot;Gave Up&quot;. By the end of the year, Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids were the first act signed by Reznor&#x27;s vanity label, Nothing Records, shortening their name to Marilyn Manson in the beginning of 1993.

==Recording==

Marilyn Manson held recording sessions for their debut album, then titled &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot;, in July 1993 at Criteria Studios in Miami with producer Roli Mosimann. The album consisted of re-recorded versions of songs originally demoed by the group during their formative years. According to &quot;Loudwire&quot;, Mosimann&#x27;s original production aimed for a &quot;sleazy, groove-laden&quot; sound. Sessions concluded several months later in the autumn. At this point, Mosimann created a radio edit of &quot;Snake Eyes and Sissies&quot;, indicating that this song was intended to be released as the lead single. However, the band was unhappy with Mosimann&#x27;s production, claiming it to be unrepresentative of their live performances, while Manson claimed the songs sounded too polished, saying: &quot;I thought, &#x27;This really sucks.&#x27; So I played it for Trent, and he thought it sucked.&quot;

Before reworking the album in Los Angeles, the band played shows in Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree, which consisted of members of Marilyn Manson, Amboog-a-Lard, Jack Off Jill and The Itch. Manson had produced various releases by both of the latter bands in 1993. The band then travelled to the Record Plant in L.A. to remix &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot; over a seven-week period with Reznor, with Manson explaining: &quot;We spent seven weeks redoing, fixing, sometimes starting from scratch. That was our band&#x27;s first experience in a real studio on a project this big. We didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It was fifteen-hour days, with a team – Trent, Alan Moulder, Sean Beavan, and me – bringing out the sound.&quot; Berkowitz was initially reluctant to re-record the album, saying: &quot;I felt doing this was unnecessary, and worried it would make us look like a Nine Inch Nails/Reznor spin-off. The final result, however, is a very high-quality piece of work.&quot;

Berkowitz re-recorded some of his guitar work in L.A., and the vast majority of Sara Lee Lucas&#x27; live drumming was replaced with drum programming created by Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Charlie Clouser. Gidget Gein was not invited to these sessions. He had been fired from the band a few days before Christmas 1993 due to his heroin addiction. Berkowitz clarified that this was &quot;the second or third time [he was being fired], for being a junkie and not showing up. And playing really horribly live.&quot; He was replaced by Jeordie White of Amboog-a-Lard, who was renamed Twiggy Ramirez. Despite this, Gein is credited with performing the entirety of the bass work on the album, with Ramirez credited for &quot;base tendencies&quot;. Gein later died of a heroin overdose in 2008. Following this period of re-recording, &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot; was retitled to &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;. Mosimann was listed in the liner notes as an engineer, with no mention of his original production role.

Sections of the album were recorded and mixed at 10050 Cielo Drive: the address of the house where members of the Manson Family committed the Tate murders in 1969. Reznor rented the property in 1992 and built a recording studio inside the residence, which he named &#x27;Pig&#x27;—a reference to that word being written with Sharon Tate&#x27;s blood on the front door of the house on the night of the massacre. The studio is credited as &#x27;Le Pig&#x27; in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Reznor denied renting the property in an attempt to have the infamy of the massacre associated with his music, and chastised Manson for doing so, saying: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t trying to create some manufactured spooky thing. Any shock value to what I was doing was about trying to sneak subversive things to a wide audience. With [Manson] ... he knew exactly what he was doing and exactly what would be shocking. Those were very conscious decisions on his part. What I was doing wasn&#x27;t the same thing.&quot; The house was demolished in late 1994, with Reznor transporting the original &quot;Pig&quot; door to New Orleans, where it was installed as the entrance to his subsequent recording studio, Nothing Studios.

==Composition and style==

The record contains a wide array of cultural references, beginning with the first track: the poem recited in &quot;Prelude (The Family Trip)&quot; is an adaption of a poem originally from the 1964 novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, which later appeared during the tunnel boat ride scene from &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, Manson explained that the lyrics to the second song on the album, &quot;Cake and Sodomy&quot;, were inspired by a trip to New York City in 1990. He said that he wrote its lyrics in a hotel room after spending several hours viewing public-access cable television and &quot;watching Pat Robertson preach about society&#x27;s evils and then ask people to call him with their credit card number. On the adjacent channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking people to call and give him their credit card number.&quot; The song&#x27;s intro contains several samples, including Marlon Brando in the 1972 film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; saying &quot;Go on and smile, you cunt!&quot;, and Mink Stole&#x27;s character from John Waters&#x27; 1977 film &quot;Desperate Living&quot; repeatedly screaming &quot;White trash!&quot;.

&quot;Lunchbox&quot; was inspired by a 1972 law introduced by the Florida Legislature, which made it illegal to carry a metal lunch-box on school grounds. It tells the story of a bullied child who uses a lunch-box as a defensive weapon, and proclaims that one day he will be a &quot;big rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star&quot;. The track incorporates elements from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;Fire&quot;. &quot;Organ Grinder&quot; makes use of various dialogue excerpts of the Child Catcher from the 1968 film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, while &quot;Cyclops&quot; contains a distorted sample of the preacher from &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; (1986). &quot;Dope Hat&quot; contains various samples of dialogue spoken by Charles Nelson Reilly – the actor who portrayed Horatio J. HooDoo – in Sid and Marty Krofft&#x27;s television series &quot;Lidsville&quot; (1971–73). The lyrics to &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; were inspired by the murder of Dr. David Gunn, who was killed by a self-proclaimed pro-life activist. Manson later described his murder as &quot;the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being &#x27;pro-life&#x27;.&quot; The song also features audio from the televised suicide of Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer.

The title of &quot;Wrapped in Plastic&quot; is a reference to David Lynch&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, specifically the scene in the pilot episode where Laura Palmer&#x27;s dead body is discovered wrapped in sheets of plastic. The song includes audio clips of Laura Palmer&#x27;s reverse speech and screaming. &quot;Dogma&quot; contains a sample of dialogue from John Waters&#x27; 1972 film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;. Although the clips from &quot;Desperate Living&quot; on &quot;Cake and Sodomy&quot; and &quot;Misery Machine&quot; are credited in the liner notes, this clip is not; Waters is additionally thanked in the album credits. &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; is the only song on the record for which former bassist Gidget Gein wrote both guitar and bass parts.

A line of dialogue spoken at the start of &quot;Snake Eyes and Sissies&quot; – &quot;Killing is killing whether done for duty, profit or fun&quot; – is a quote taken from an interview with serial killer Richard Ramirez. &quot;My Monkey&quot; contains numerous samples of interviews from Charles Manson; several of its verses are derived from &quot;Mechanical Man&quot;, a song from his 1970 album &quot;&quot;. Its lyrics are credited simply to &quot;Manson&quot;. The song also contains vocals from Robert Pierce, who was six years old at the time of its recording. He was the son of Rambler guitarist Richard Pierce, and was introduced to Marilyn Manson when both bands shared a rehearsal space in Florida. Robert Pierce is also heard in begging for &quot;Lunchbox&quot;.

&quot;Misery Machine&quot; is the thirteenth and final track on the album, and contains an interpolation of &quot;Beep Beep&quot; by The Playmates. The title is a direct reference to the Mystery Machine from the animated television series &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, while a phrase contained in the song, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna ride to the Abbey of Thelema&quot;, is a reference to Aleister Crowley&#x27;s religion of Thelema: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot; An untitled hidden track begins a few seconds after &quot;Misery Machine&quot;, and consists of Stole in &quot;Desperate Living&quot; screaming &quot;Go home to your mother! Doesn&#x27;t she ever watch you!? Tell her this isn&#x27;t some Communist daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!&quot;. After this, a telephone rings for several minutes, followed by an irate answering machine message from the mother of a Manson fan.

The band&#x27;s vocalist discussed his thoughts on &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; in retrospect with &quot;Empyrean Magazine&quot;, circa May/June 1995:

==Cover and packaging==
The four-member family depicted on the album cover were created by Manson using papier-mâché and human hair. In &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, the vocalist said that a painting by John Wayne Gacy was originally set to feature as the cover; the same painting later appeared on the cover of Acid Bath&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;When the Kite String Pops&quot;. Also set to appear as part of the album&#x27;s interior artwork was an image of himself as a child sitting naked on a living room couch. Although the photograph was taken by his mother with no vulgar intent, and no genitalia is shown, Interscope&#x27;s parent company Time Warner demanded it be removed on the grounds that it could constitute child pornography. Manson explained the background of the image: &quot;When I was six years old, that was when Burt Reynolds had posed for &quot;Playgirl&quot;. My mom thought it&#x27;d be funny to have me do that pose, lying on a couch. It&#x27;s only sick if you have a sick mind. It was innocent.&quot; Another piece of interior photography consisted of an image of a Blythe doll surrounded by Polaroid pictures of a mutilated female body, purportedly faked by Manson and several of his friends.

==Release and promotion==
When the record was presented to Nothing&#x27;s parent company Interscope in January 1994, executives at the label refused to release it unless all references to Charles Manson were removed. This included altering the band&#x27;s name, and omitting the song &quot;My Monkey&quot;. The vocalist explained: &quot;I think the Axl Rose/Charles Manson thing panicked them. The heat came from the name of our band. They apparently hadn&#x27;t looked into it very carefully, and they had this knee-jerk reaction to what we&#x27;re about.&quot; Guns N&#x27; Roses had faced widespread criticism over the inclusion of &quot;Look at Your Game, Girl&quot; – a cover of a Charles Manson song – as a hidden track on their 1993 album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;.

During this period, the band&#x27;s management attempted to have it issued through other labels and distributors. They met with Guy Oseary and Freddy DeMann from Maverick Records, Madonna&#x27;s vanity label, who were initially worried that their lyrics or image included antisemitism, although they found this was not the case. Afterward, Maverick offered the band an alternate deal. Before this deal could be finalized, Interscope agreed to release the album, which was issued in the United States on July 19, 1994. The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; reported that Members of the British Parliament tried to ban the album in the United Kingdom and called it an &quot;outrage against society.&quot; &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; was preceded by the release of &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; as the lead single on June 9. Its music video was directed by Rod Chong. 

Marilyn Manson performed as one of the opening acts on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Self Destruct Tour&quot; throughout 1994. They embarked on their first national headlining tour in December, with Monster Voodoo Machine and Arab on Radar supporting. The tour would be problematic, however. The band&#x27;s vocalist was arrested after the tour&#x27;s first date, in Jacksonville, for allegedly violating Florida&#x27;s Adult Entertainment Code by simulating sex on stage while wearing a strap-on dildo. He narrowly avoided arrest four nights later – on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Fort Lauderdale – after Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck jumped on stage wearing a g-string and attempted to play an unspecified practical joke on the singer involving powdered sugar. Manson reacted by tearing the g-string off and placing Finck&#x27;s penis in his mouth. He hid from local police in a backstage bathroom.

This would also be drummer Sara Lee Lucas&#x27; final tour with the band. Tensions developed between him and Manson as the tour progressed and, during the second-to-last show, Manson doused Lucas&#x27; drum kit in lighter fluid and set it ablaze. He was immediately replaced by Kenneth Wilson, who joined the group as Ginger Fish. The &quot;Lunchbox&quot; EP was released on February 6, 1995, containing several remixes of the song created by Charlie Clouser as well as a cover of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Down in the Park&quot;. Richard Kern directed the music video for the track. Marilyn Manson toured again in the spring of 1995, opening for Danzig alongside Korn.

&quot;Dope Hat&quot; was issued as a promotional single in the summer of 1995. Its music video was directed by Tom Stern, and was based on the tunnel boat ride scene from &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;. The band entered Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Studios in New Orleans to record b-sides for the song&#x27;s release as a commercial single. However, the release was cancelled, as the material recorded during these sessions was compiled into a standalone EP of cover versions, remixes and interludes titled &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;. &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; was re-released in 2009 as a limited edition green-colored vinyl LP box set, which also contained a T-shirt emblazoned with the album cover.

==Critical reception and legacy==

The album received mostly positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;Beneath all the camp shock, there are signs of [Manson&#x27;s] unerring eye for genuine outrage and musical talent, particularly on the trio of &#x27;Cake and Sodomy&#x27;, &#x27;Lunchbox&#x27;, and &#x27;Dope Hat&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was negative, saying that the album was not the &quot;sharply rendered cultural critique of America [Manson would] like you to think it is. Most of the record comes off like some low-budget horror movie.&quot; The publication later revised its view of the record; it was included at number 68 on their 2017 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked the album at number thirteen in their list of the &quot;50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;, although they also featured &quot;Cyclops&quot; at number 47 on their list of the &quot;100 Worst Guitar Solos&quot;. Manson himself has been dismissive of the album, ranking it in last place of the band&#x27;s entire discography in a 2018 list compiled for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. Conversely, Kristy Loye of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; dubbed it the best album of the band&#x27;s career, writing: &quot;This album&#x27;s impact on music at the time of release cannot really be underestimated, nor can it be accurately described in a short blurb. Like it or not, Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids gave rock the dark shot in the arm that was needed at the time when music had given itself completely over to the bland and self-indulgent emotional ballads of alt-rock kings like Pearl Jam. Music needed a balance of dark and light and Manson brought the darkness like few were doing at the time when suddenly metal was barely breathing.&quot;

In a feature written for the twentieth anniversary of the record, Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; praised the album&#x27;s production and quality of the band&#x27;s songwriting, but said that &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; had aged badly, and was critical of Manson&#x27;s vocals and the amount of samples used throughout. However, he went on to argue: &quot;What still resonates about Manson isn&#x27;t really his music, though 1998&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; still stands as a pretty incredible album. Manson was a culture-war agitator for &quot;our&quot; side: someone willing to jar and frighten the fuck out of the power structures that seemed there to keep teenagers in their place. His whole thing was a violent, overblown rejection of vast forces of oppression and control, and his tactics made him a target, both of mass-culture disdain and of superior alt-culture snark. All that was by design. He put himself out there to take those attacks. And, on some level, he&#x27;s a saint for that. Simply by existing, and by moving the baseline, he made lives easier for hundreds of thousands of teenagers. That, rather than &#x27;Cake and Sodomy&#x27;, is his legacy.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; failed to chart upon release. Manson later complained: &quot;Well, there was always a real chip on our shoulder that the album never really got the push from the record label that we thought it deserved. It was all about us touring our fucking asses off. We toured for two years solid, opening up for Nine Inch Nails for a year and then doing our own club tours. It was all just about perseverance.&quot; It eventually peaked at number 35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers chart, on the issue dated March 25, 1995. The record was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in May 2003 for shipments in excess of 500,000 units. As of 2015, it has sold over 645,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="306589" wikidata="Q1650007" url="?curid=306589" title="Marquess of Queensberry Rules">
<text>The Marquess of Queensberry Rules, also known as Queensberry Rules, are a set of generally accepted rules governing the sport of boxing. Drafted in London in 1865 and published in 1867, they were so named because the 9th Marquess of Queensberry publicly endorsed the code, although they were actually written by a Welsh sportsman, John Graham Chambers, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. They were the first to mandate the use of gloves in boxing. Other new innovations included each round consisting of three minutes of fighting followed by a minute of rest, and any fighter who went down had to get up unaided within 10 seconds—if he could not he was declared knocked out.

The Queensberry Rules, which eventually superseded the London Prize Ring Rules (revised in 1853), are intended for use in both professional and amateur boxing matches, unlike the less-popular American Fair Play Rules, which were strictly intended for amateur matches. In colloquial use, the term is sometimes used to refer to a sense of sportsmanship and fair play.

==History==
The boxing code was written by John Graham Chambers, a Welshman from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and drafted in London in 1865, before being published in 1867 as &quot;the Queensberry rules for the sport of boxing&quot;. At the time, boxing matches were conducted under the London Prize Ring Rules, written in 1838 and revised in 1853. Bare-knuckle fights under the London Prize Rules continued for the next several decades, although the Queensberry Rules would eventually become the standard set of rules under which all boxing matches were governed. This version persuaded boxers that &quot;you must not fight simply to win; no holds barred is not the way; you must win by the rules&quot;.

One early prize fighter who fought under Marquess of Queensberry rules was Jem Mace, former English heavyweight champion, who defeated Bill Davis in Virginia City, Nevada, under these rules in 1876, with Mace&#x27;s enthusiasm for gloved fighting doing much to popularise the Queensberry rules.

In addition to professional boxing, amateur boxing adopted the Queensberry rules. In 1880, the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), the sport&#x27;s first amateur governing body, was formed in Britain, and in the following year the ABA staged its first official amateur championships. The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) of the US was formed in 1888 and instituted its annual championships in boxing the same year.

==Rules==
The following is the text of the rules.

# To be a fair stand-up boxing match in a 24-foot ring, or as near that size as practicable.
# No wrestling allowed.
# The rounds to be of three minutes&#x27; duration, and one minute&#x27;s time between rounds.
# If either man falls through weakness or otherwise, he must get up unassisted, the boxer has 10 seconds to allow him to do so, the other man meanwhile to return to his corner, and when the fallen man is on his legs the round is to be resumed and continued until the three minutes have expired. If one man fails to come to the scratch in the 10 count allowed, it shall be in the power of the referee to give his award in favour of the other man.
# A man hanging on the ropes in a helpless state, with his toes off the ground, shall be considered down.
# No seconds or any other person to be allowed in the ring during the rounds.
# Should the contest be stopped by any unavoidable interference, the referee to name the time and place as soon as possible for finishing the contest; so that the match must be won and lost, unless the backers of both men agree to draw the stakes.
# The gloves to be fair-sized boxing gloves of the best quality and new.
# Should a glove burst, or come off, it must be replaced to the referee&#x27;s satisfaction.

<text>The Countess Pillar is a 17th-century monument near Brougham, Cumbria, England, between Penrith and Appleby. It is two miles east of Penrith on the A66. The square top of the pillar is brightly painted and carries sundials on its sides. It was erected by Lady Anne Clifford in 1656 to mark the place where she said goodbye for the last time to her mother, Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland.

Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset and Montgomery (1590–1676), spent much of her life in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the rights of her inheritance. Her mother was one of the few people who supported Anne&#x27;s claim to the family estates. In 1616 Anne travelled north to see &quot;her&quot; estates and visit her mother at Brougham Castle. On her departure from the castle, Anne travelled with her mother a quarter of a mile to where the castle drive meets the main road, where they had &quot;a grievous and heavy parting&quot;. Margaret died a month later.

The inscription on the pillar describes Anne as &quot;Sole Heire&quot; of her father, George Earl of Cumberland. It also refers to a bequest in memory of Margaret which was made to the poor of the parish of Brougham. This is commemorated annually on 2 April.

==In literature==
Felicia Hemans&#x27;s poem &quot;The Memorial Pillar&quot;, on the circumstances surrounding the erection of this monument, forms a part of her &quot;Records of Woman&quot;.

<doc id="306603" wikidata="Q1315822" url="?curid=306603" title="Mount Desert Island">
<text>Mount Desert Island (MDI; ) in Hancock County, Maine, is the largest island off the coast of Maine. With an area of it is the 52nd-largest island in the United States, the sixth-largest island in the contiguous United States, and the second-largest island on the Eastern Seaboard, behind Long Island and ahead of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. According to the 2010 census, the island has a year-round population of 10,615. In 2017, an estimated 3.5 million tourists visited Acadia National Park on MDI. The island is home to numerous well-known summer colonies such as Northeast Harbor and Bar Harbor.

==Origin of the name==
Some residents stress the second syllable ( ), while others pronounce it like the English common noun &quot;desert&quot; ( ). French explorer Samuel de Champlain&#x27;s observation that the summits of the island&#x27;s mountains were free of vegetation as seen from the sea led him to call the island (meaning &quot;island of barren mountains&quot;).

==Towns and villages==
There are four towns on Mount Desert Island:
* Bar Harbor, with the villages of Eden, Hulls Cove, Salisbury Cove, and Town Hill;
* Mount Desert, with the villages of Hall Quarry, Northeast Harbor, Otter Creek, Pretty Marsh, Seal Harbor, and Somesville;
* Southwest Harbor, with the villages of Manset and Seawall;
* Tremont, with the villages of Bass Harbor, Bernard, Gotts Island, Seal Cove, and West Tremont.

==History==
Deep shell heaps indicate Native American encampments dating back 6,000 years in Acadia National Park, but prehistoric data is scant. The first written descriptions of the indigenous tribes of the Maine coast, recorded 100 years after European trade contacts began, describe people who lived off the land by hunting, fishing, collecting shellfish, and gathering plants and berries. The Wabanaki knew Mount Desert Island as Pemetic, &quot;the sloping land&quot;. They built bark-covered conical shelters, and traveled in exquisitely designed birch bark canoes. Historical notes record that the Wabanaki wintered in interior forests and spent their summers near the coast. Archeological evidence suggests the opposite pattern; in order to avoid harsh inland winters and to take advantage of salmon runs upstream, Native Americans wintered on the coast and summered inland.

===French colonial period===
The first meeting between the indigenous inhabitants of Pemetic and the Europeans is a matter of conjecture, but it was a Frenchman, Samuel de Champlain, who made the first important contribution to the historical record of Mount Desert Island. Champlain led an expedition from the St. Croix Settlement. He was tasked with exploring the coast in a patache with twelve sailors and two American Indian guides. They were in search of a mythical walled and wealthy American Indian city named Norumbega. On September 6, 1604 the expedition crossed Frenchman Bay and sailed towards Otter Creek, where smoke could be seen rising from an American Indian encampment. During high tide the ship hit a ledge off Otter Cliff and while repairing a hole two American Indians boarded the ship as guides.

It is not clear whether Champlain sailed around the Island or was informed by the guides, but on that day, he wrote in his journal, &quot;Le sommet de la plus part d’icelles est desgarny d’arbres parceque ce ne sont que roches. Je l’ay nommée l’Isle des Monts-déserts&quot;, which translates to &quot;Most of the summits are free of trees because they are only rocks present. I named [the island] Isle of the Desert Mountains.&quot;

====Raid on Mount Desert Island (1613)====

In 1613, French Jesuits, welcomed by Indians, established the first French mission in America—Saint Sauveur Mission—on what is now Fernald Point, near the entrance to Somes Sound. Saint Sauveur Mountain, overlooking the point, still bears the name of the mission.

The French missionaries began to build a fort, plant their corn, and baptize the indigenous inhabitants. Two months later, on July 2, 1613, Captain Samuel Argall of the English colony of Virginia arrived on board the &quot;Treasurer&quot; and destroyed their mission. Three of the missionaries were killed and three were wounded. The rest of the company, some twenty in all, were taken prisoner. Argall took many of the prisoners to Jamestown. He eventually returned to Saint-Sauveur and cut down the cross the Jesuits had planted, replacing it with a Protestant version. He then set fire to the few buildings that were there. He then went on to burn the remaining French buildings on Saint Croix Island and Port Royal, Nova Scotia.

The English raid at Fernald Point signaled the dispute over the boundary between the French colony of Acadia to the north and the English colonies in New England to the south. There is evidence that Claude de La Tour immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing a fur-trading post in the nearby village of Castine in the wake of Argall&#x27;s raid.

There was a brief period when it seemed Mount Desert would again become a center of French activity. In 1688, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, an ambitious young man who had immigrated to New France and bestowed upon himself the title &quot;sieur de Cadillac&quot;, asked for and received of land along the Maine coast, including all of Mount Desert Island. Cadillac&#x27;s hopes of establishing a feudal estate in the New World, however, were short-lived. Although he and his bride resided there for a time, they soon abandoned their enterprise. Cadillac later gained lasting recognition as the founder of Detroit. The island&#x27;s highest point, at the highest point on the eastern seaboard of the United States, bears the name Cadillac Mountain, and is notable for the fact that its summit is among the first points in the United States touched by the rays of the rising sun.

====Raid on Acadia (1704)====
During much of the seventeenth century, nearby Castine was the most southern settlement of Acadia. (Bristol, Maine, was the northernmost English colonial settlement.) No one settled in this contested territory, and for the next 150 years Mount Desert Island&#x27;s importance to Europeans was primarily its use as a landmark for seamen, as for example when John Winthrop, first governor of the English Massachusetts Bay Colony, sketched the island&#x27;s mountains on his voyage to the New World.

During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in response to the French raid on Deerfield, New Englander Benjamin Church raided the Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with the raid on St. Stephen, raid on Grand Pré, the raid on Piziquid, and the raid on Chignecto.

===British colonial period===
In 1759, the British Army defeated the French at Quebec, ending France&#x27;s control over Acadia. This also had the effect of opening lands along the Maine coast opened for settlement by colonists from British North America. The royal governor of Massachusetts, Sir Francis Bernard, obtained a royal land grant on Mount Desert Island. The next year, Bernard attempted to secure his claim by offering free land to colonists. Abraham Somes and James Richardson accepted the offer and settled their families at what is now Somesville.

===American Revolution===
The onset of the American Revolution ended Bernard&#x27;s plans for Mount Desert Island. In its aftermath, Bernard, who had sided with the British Crown, lost his claim. Massachusetts, now independent of British rule, granted the western half of Mount Desert Island to John Bernard, son of the governor, who, unlike his father, sided with the Patriots. The eastern half of the island was granted to Marie Therese de Gregoire, granddaughter of Cadillac. Bernard and de Gregoire soon sold their landholdings to nonresident landlords.

Their real estate transactions probably made very little difference to the increasing number of white settlers homesteading on Mount Desert Island. By 1820, when Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a separate state, farming and lumbering vied with fishing and shipbuilding as major occupations. Settlers converted hundreds of acres of trees into wood products ranging from schooners and barns to baby cribs and hand tools. Farmers harvested wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. By 1850, the familiar sights of fishermen and sailors, fish racks and shipyards, revealed a way of life linked to the sea. Quarrying of granite, which could be cut from hills close to deep water anchorage for shipment to major cities on the east coast, was also a major industry.

==Rusticators==

It was the outsiders, artists, and journalists who revealed and popularized this island to the world in the mid 19th century. Painters of the Hudson River School, including Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, inspired patrons and friends to flock here. Called rusticators, despite the lack of existing accommodations they sought out local fishermen and farmers to put them up for a modest fee. The rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and, most of all, to savor the fresh salt air, scenery, and relaxed pace. Soon the villagers&#x27; cottages and fishermen&#x27;s huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30 hotels competed for vacationers&#x27; dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.

For a select handful of Americans, the 1880s and the &quot;Gay Nineties&quot; meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert, still remote from the cities of the East, became a retreat for prominent people of the time. The Rockefellers, Morgans, Fords, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Astors chose to spend their summers here. Not content with the simple lodgings then available, these families transformed the landscape of Mount Desert Island with elegant estates, called &quot;cottages&quot;. The landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, at the Cadwalder Rawle - Rhinelander Jones family summer home Reef Point Estate, designed the gardens for many of these people. Projects included the Chinese-inspired garden at &quot;The Eyrie&quot; for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller at Seal Harbor (1926–35), and the planting plans for subtle roads at Acadia National Park sponsored by John D. Rockefeller Jr. (c.1930). Luxury, refinement, and ostentatious gatherings replaced buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of an earlier era. Some rusticators also formed &quot;Village Improvement Societies&quot; which constructed hiking trails and walking paths connecting the Island&#x27;s villages to its interior mountains. For over 40 years, the wealthy held sway at Mount Desert, but the Great Depression and World War II marked the end of such extravagance. The final blow came in 1947 when a fire of monumental proportions consumed many of the great estates.

==Acadia National Park==
In 1901, George B. Dorr, disturbed by the growing development of the Bar Harbor area and the dangers he foresaw in the newly invented gasoline-powered portable sawmill, established along with others the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations. The corporation, whose sole purpose was to preserve land for the perpetual use of the public, acquired by 1913. Dorr offered the land to the federal government, and in 1916, President Wilson announced the creation of Sieur de Monts National Monument. Dorr continued to acquire property and renewed his efforts to obtain full national park status for his beloved preserve. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act establishing Lafayette National Park, the first national park east of the Mississippi. Dorr, whose labors constituted &quot;the greatest of one-man shows in the history of land conservation&quot;, became the first park superintendent. In 1929, the park name was changed to Acadia National Park.

John D. Rockefeller Jr. endowed the park with much of its land area. Like many rusticators, Rockefeller, whose family fortune was derived from the petroleum industry, wanted to keep the island free of automobiles, but local governments allowed the entry of automobiles on the island&#x27;s roads. Rockefeller constructed about of carriage roads around the eastern half of the island. These roads were closed to automobiles and included several vistas and stone bridges. About of these roads are within Acadia National Park and open only to hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, horse-drawn carriages and cross country skiers.

In 1950, Marguerite Yourcenar and Grace Frick bought a house, &quot;Petite Plaisance&quot;, in Northeast Harbor on the island. Yourcenar wrote a large part of her novel &quot;Memoires d&#x27;Hadrien&quot; on the island, and she died there in 1987. Their house is now a museum. Both ladies were cremated and their ashes are buried in the Brookside Cemetery in Somesville.

In 1969, College of the Atlantic, the island&#x27;s first and only institution of higher education, was established in Bar Harbor.

In 1986, Friends of Acadia, the nonprofit organization that directs private philanthropy and volunteerism for the benefit of Acadia National Park, was founded.



==Geology==

Mount Desert Island is rich in geological history dating back about 550 million years. The earliest formation on the island is the Ellsworth Schist Formation, which was a sea-floor mud deposit created during the Cambrian period by volcanic ash. During the Ordovician period, the Acadian orogeny — the collision of Laurentia, Gondwanaland, and Avalonia — caused the formation to fold, thrust, and lift above sea level, where later layers were eroded away and the schist was exposed. The Bar Harbor Formation, which is made up predominantly of sands and silts, and Cranberry Island Formation, made up from volcanic ash and magmatic debris, occurred under similar circumstances in the Silurian and Devonian periods, and were deposited on top of the Ellsworth Schist. However, due to less tectonic activity at that time, their deformation was less severe.

Quarrying of granite was historically an important industry. Orogenic activity during the Devonian period gave Mount Desert Island three granite units: the Cadillac Mountain granite, the fine-grained Somesville granite, and the medium-grained Somesville granite. Surrounding these granites (labeled &quot;DCg&quot; on geologic maps) is a zone of brecciated material, known as DSz (Devonian Shatter Zone).

Most recently, Mount Desert Island was host to the Laurentide Ice Sheet as it extended and receded during the Pleistocene epoch. The glacier left visible marks upon the landscape, such as Bubble Rock, a glacial erratic carried by the ice sheet from a Lucerne granite outcrop and deposited precariously on the side of South Bubble Mountain in Acadia National Park. Other examples are the moraines deposited at the southern ends of many of the glacier-carved valleys on the Island such as the Jordan Pond valley, indicating the extent of the glacier; and the beach sediments in a regressional sequence beneath and around Jordan Pond, indicating the rebound of the continent after the glacier&#x27;s recession about 25,000 years ago.

The area around Somes Sound was originally categorized as a fjord and was the only one on the East Coast of North America. It has since been recategorized as a fjard due to the lack of an area of de-oxygenated water (dead zone), as well as the fact that the mountains on either side of the sound are not as steep as is typically expected with a fjord.

==Ecology==
Excavations of old Indian sites in the Mount Desert Island region have yielded remains of the native mammals. Bones of wolf, North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), deer, elk, gray seal (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;), &quot;Indian dog&quot;, and sea mink (&quot;Neogale macrodon&quot;) have been uncovered, as well as large numbers of raccoon, lynx, muskrat, and deer. Although beaver were trapped to extinction on the island, two pairs of beaver that were released in 1920 by George B. Dorr at the brook between Bubble Pond and Eagle Lake and their descendants have repopulated it. A large fire in 1947 cleared the eastern half of the island of its coniferous trees and permitted the growth of aspen, birch, alder, maple and other deciduous trees which enabled the beaver to thrive.

==Transport==
The Island Explorer provides seasonal bus service on and near the island, largely to serve visitors to Acadia.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Far Harbor&quot; add-on for the 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; is set on a 
post-apocalyptic Mount Desert Island. The module draws its name from the game&#x27;s settlement of Far Harbor, which is in the same location as Bar Harbor in reality.

<text>Thomas Neilson Paulin (born 25 January 1949) is a Northern Irish poet and critic of film, music and literature. He lives in England, where he was the G. M. Young Lecturer in English Literature at Hertford College, Oxford.

== Early life ==
Paulin was born in Leeds, England. While he was still young, Paulin&#x27;s Northern Irish Protestant mother and English father moved from Leeds to Belfast. Paulin grew up in a middle class area of the city. According to Paulin, his parents, a doctor and headmaster, held &quot;vaguely socialist liberal views&quot;. While still a teenager, Paulin joined the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League.

Paulin was educated at Annadale Grammar School, Hull University and Lincoln College, Oxford.

== Work ==
From 1972 to 1994, he worked at the University of Nottingham, first as a lecturer and then as a Reader of Poetry. In 1977, he won the Somerset Maugham prize for his poetry collection &quot;A State of Justice&quot; and later established his reputation as a literary critic with work such as &quot;Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation State&quot; (1992). He has championed the work of literary and social critic William Hazlitt and has taken part in a campaign which succeeded in having Hazlitt&#x27;s gravestone refurbished.

Paulin is considered to be among a group of writers from a Unionist background &quot;who have attempted to recover the radical Protestant republican heritage of the eighteenth century to challenge orthodox concepts&quot; of Northern Irish Protestant identity. His passionate arguments and desire for a political poetry hails from the influence of John Milton, according to critic Jonathan Hufstader, though his outrage &quot;often consumes itself in congested anger&quot;.

Paulin is most widely known in Britain for his appearances on the late-night BBC arts programmes &quot;The Late Show&quot;, &quot;Late Review&quot; and &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;.

Following the success of the Field Day Theatre Company&#x27;s tour of Brian Friel&#x27;s play &quot;Translations&quot; in late 1980, the two founding directors (Friel and Stephen Rea) decided to make Field Day a permanent enterprise. Thus, to qualify for financial support from both the Northern Irish and the Irish governments, they expanded the governing board from the original two members to six: Friel, Rea, Paulin, Seamus Deane, Seamus Heaney and David Hammond.

Paulin was a member of the Labour Party but resigned after declaring that the government of Tony Blair was &quot;a Zionist government&quot;. His poem &quot;Killed in Crossfire&quot; when published in British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; aroused some controversy for referring to a Palestinian boy being &quot;gunned down by the Zionist SS&quot;. According to Denis MacShane in &quot;Globalising Hatred: The New Antisemitism&quot; (2008), it was Paulin&#x27;s expression of his &quot;anger and anguish at the behaviour of Israeli troops&quot;. In an interview he gave to the state-owned Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram Weekly&quot;, Paulin described Israeli government actions in Palestine as &quot;an historical obscenity&quot;. When asked how he responds to accusations of anti-Semitism that follow such descriptions, he told the newspaper &quot;I just laugh when they do that to me. It does not worry me at all. These are the Hampstead liberal Zionists. I have utter contempt for them. They use this card of anti-Semitism&quot;. Regarding supporters of Israel, Paulin stated &quot;You are either a Zionist or an anti-Zionist. Everyone who supports Israel is a Zionist&quot;. After his comments in &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; raised controversy, he said in a letter to &quot;The Independent&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, that his views were &quot;distorted&quot;, writing, &quot;I have been, and am, a lifelong opponent of anti-Semitism ... I do not support attacks on Israeli civilians under any circumstances. I am in favour of the current efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians&quot;. In 2009, he translated Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot;. The band Tompaulin were named after Paulin.

<doc id="306609" wikidata="Q108307" url="?curid=306609" title="Group 3 element">
<text>Group 3 is the first group of transition metals in the periodic table. This group is closely related to the rare-earth elements. It contains the four elements scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y), lutetium (Lu), and lawrencium (Lr). The group is also called the scandium group or scandium family after its lightest member.

The chemistry of the group 3 elements is typical for early transition metals: they all essentially have only the group oxidation state of +3 as a major one, and like the preceding main-group metals are quite electropositive and have a less rich coordination chemistry. Due to the effects of the lanthanide contraction, yttrium and lutetium are very similar in properties. Yttrium and lutetium have essentially the chemistry of the heavy lanthanides, but scandium shows several differences due to its small size. This is a similar pattern to those of the early transition metal groups, where the lightest element is distinct from the very similar next two.

All the group 3 elements are rather soft, silvery-white metals, although their hardness increases with atomic number. They quickly tarnish in air and react with water, though their reactivity is masked by the formation of an oxide layer. The first three of them occur naturally, and especially yttrium and lutetium are almost invariably associated with the lanthanides due to their similar chemistry. Lawrencium is strongly radioactive: it does not occur naturally and must be produced by artificial synthesis, but its observed and theoretically predicted properties are consistent with it being a heavier homologue of lutetium. None of the group 3 elements have any biological role.

Historically, sometimes lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac) were included in the group instead of lutetium and lawrencium, because the electron configurations of many of the rare earths were initially measured wrongly. This version of group 3 is still commonly found in textbooks, but most authors focusing on the subject are against it. Some authors attempt to compromise between the two formats by leaving the spaces below yttrium blank, but this contradicts quantum mechanics as it results in an f-block that is 15 elements wide rather than 14 (the maximum occupancy of an f-subshell).
==Composition==
Physical, chemical, and electronic evidence overwhelmingly shows that the correct elements in group 3 are scandium, yttrium, lutetium, and lawrencium: this is the classification adopted by most chemists and physicists who have considered the matter. It was supported by IUPAC in a 1988 report and reaffirmed in 2021. Many textbooks however show group 3 as containing scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium, a format based on historically wrongly measured electron configurations: Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz already considered it to be &quot;incorrect&quot; in 1948, but the issue was brought to a wide debate only in 1982 by William B. Jensen.

The spaces below yttrium are sometimes left blank as a third option, but there is confusion in the literature on whether this format implies that group 3 contains only scandium and yttrium, or if it also contains all the lanthanides and actinides; either way, this format contradicts quantum physics by creating a 15-element-wide f-block when only 14 electrons can fit in an f-subshell. While the 2021 IUPAC report noted that 15-element-wide f-blocks are supported by some practitioners of a specialised branch of relativistic quantum mechanics focusing on the properties of superheavy elements, the project&#x27;s opinion was that such interest-dependent concerns should not have any bearing on how the periodic table is presented to &quot;the general chemical and scientific community&quot;. In fact, relativistic quantum-mechanical calculations of Lu and Lr compounds found no valence f-orbitals in either element. Other authors focusing on superheavy elements since clarified that the &quot;15th entry of the f-block represents the first slot of the d-block which is left vacant to indicate the place of the f-block inserts&quot;, which would imply that this form still has Lu and Lr (the 15th entries in question) as d-block elements under Sc and Y. Indeed, when IUPAC publications expand the table to 32 columns, they make this clear and place Lu and Lr under Y.

As noted by the 2021 IUPAC report, Sc-Y-Lu-Lr is the only form that simultaneously allows for the preservation of the sequence of atomic number, avoids splitting the d-block into &quot;two highly uneven portions&quot;, and gives the blocks the correct widths quantum mechanics demands (2, 6, 10, and 14). While arguments in favour of Sc-Y-La-Ac can still be found in the literature, many authors consider them to be logically inconsistent. For example, it has been argued that lanthanum and actinium cannot be f-block elements because their atoms have not begun to fill the f-subshells. But the same is true of thorium which is never disputed as an f-block element, and this argument overlooks the problem on the other end: that the f-shells complete filling at ytterbium and nobelium (matching the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr form), not at lutetium and lawrencium (as in Sc-Y-La-Ac). Lanthanum, actinium, and thorium are simply examples of exceptions to the Madelung rule; not only do those exceptions represent a minority of elements (only 20 out of 118), but they have also never been considered as relevant for positioning any other elements on the periodic table. In gaseous atoms, the d-shells complete their filling at copper (3d104s1), palladium (4d105s0), and gold (5d106s1), but it is universally accepted by chemists that these configurations are exceptional and that the d-block really ends in accordance with the Madelung rule at zinc (3d104s2), cadmium (4d105s2), and mercury (5d106s2). The relevant fact for placement is that lanthanum and actinium (like thorium) have valence f-orbitals that can become occupied in chemical environments, whereas lutetium and lawrencium do not: their f-shells are in the core, and cannot be used for chemical reactions. Thus the relationship between yttrium and lanthanum is only a secondary relationship between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different kinds of valence orbitals, such as that between chromium and uranium; whereas the relationship between yttrium and lutetium is primary, sharing both valence electron count and valence orbital type.

==History==
The discovery of the group 3 elements is inextricably tied to that of the rare earths, with which they are universally associated in nature. In 1787, Swedish part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock near the Swedish village of Ytterby, Sweden (part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it ytterbite. Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or &quot;earth&quot; in Arrhenius&#x27; sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794; in 1797, the new oxide was named &quot;yttria&quot;. In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been &quot;yttrium&quot;. Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol &quot;Yt&quot; was used for the element, after which &quot;Y&quot; came into common use. Yttrium metal, albeit impure, was first prepared in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride. In fact, Gadolin&#x27;s yttria proved to be a mixture of many metal oxides, that started the history of the discovery of the rare earths.

In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table, which had an empty space for an element above yttrium. Mendeleev made several predictions on this hypothetical element, which he called &quot;eka-boron&quot;. By then, Gadolin&#x27;s yttria had already been split several times; first by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, who in 1843 had split out two more earths which he called &quot;terbia&quot; and &quot;erbia&quot; (splitting the name of Ytterby just as yttria had been split); and then in 1878 when Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac split terbia and erbia themselves into more earths. Among these was ytterbia (a component of the old erbia), which Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson successfully split in 1879 to reveal yet another new element. He named it scandium, from the Latin &quot;Scandia&quot; meaning &quot;Scandinavia&quot;. Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev&#x27;s prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev. Chemical experiments on scandium proved that Mendeleev&#x27;s suggestions were correct; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the correctness of the whole periodic table and periodic law. Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800 °C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides. Scandium exists in the same ores that yttrium had been discovered from, but is much rarer and probably for that reason had eluded discovery.

The remaining component of Marignac&#x27;s ytterbia also proved to be a composite. In 1907, French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James all independently discovered a new element within ytterbia. Welsbach proposed the name &quot;cassiopeium&quot; for his new element (after Cassiopeia), whereas Urbain chose the name &quot;lutecium&quot; (from Latin Lutetia, for Paris). The dispute on the priority of the discovery is documented in two articles in which Urbain and von Welsbach accuse each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other. In 1909, the Commission on Atomic Mass, which was responsible for the attribution of the names for the new elements, granted priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones. An obvious problem with this decision was that Urbain was one of the four members of the commission. In 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. Later work connected with Urbain&#x27;s attempts to further split his lutecium however revealed that it had only contained traces of the new element 71, and that it was only von Welsbach&#x27;s cassiopeium that was pure element 71. For this reason many German scientists continued to use the name &quot;cassiopeium&quot; for the element until the 1950s. Ironically, Charles James, who had modestly stayed out of the argument as to priority, worked on a much larger scale than the others, and undoubtedly possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Lutetium was the last of the stable rare earths to be discovered. Over a century of research had split the original yttrium of Gadolin into yttrium, scandium, lutetium, and seven other new elements.

Lawrencium is the only element of the group that does not occur naturally. It was probably first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso and his team on February 14, 1961, at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now called the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) at the University of California in Berkeley, California, United States. The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron-10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). The nuclide 257103 was originally reported. The team at the University of California suggested the name &quot;lawrencium&quot; (after Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of cyclotron particle accelerator) and the symbol &quot;Lw&quot;, for the new element; IUPAC accepted their discovery, but changed the symbol to &quot;Lr&quot;. In 1965, nuclear-physics researchers in Dubna, Soviet Union (now Russia) reported 256103, in 1967, they reported that they were not able to confirm American scientists&#x27; data on 257103, and proposed the name &quot;rutherfordium&quot; for the new element. The Dubna group criticised the IUPAC approval of the Berkeley group&#x27;s discovery as having been hasty. In 1971, the Berkeley group did a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of element 103 isotopes, in which all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, except that the initial 257103 isotope reported at Berkeley in 1961 turned out to have been 258103. In 1992, the IUPAC Trans-fermium Working Group named the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of element 103. When IUPAC made the final decision of the naming of the elements beyond 100 in 1997, it decided to keep the name &quot;lawrencium&quot; and symbol &quot;Lr&quot; for element 103 as it had been in use for a long time by that point. The name &quot;rutherfordium&quot; was assigned to the following element 104, which the Berkeley team had proposed it for.

==Characteristics==

===Chemical===
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. Due to relativistic effects that become important for high atomic numbers, lawrencium&#x27;s configuration has an irregular 7p occupancy instead of the expected 6d,&lt;ref name=&quot;7p1/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the regular [Rn]5f146d17s2 configuration is low enough in energy that no significant difference from the rest of the group is observed or expected.

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group; chemical properties of lawrencium are not well-characterized, but what is known and predicted matches its position as a heavier homolog of lutetium. The remaining elements of the group (scandium, yttrium, lutetium) are quite electropositive. They are reactive metals, although this is not obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer which prevents further reactions. The metals burn easily to give the oxides, which are white high-melting solids. They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, in which they form mostly ionic compounds and have a mostly cationic aqueous chemistry. In this way they are similar to the lanthanides, although they lack the involvement of f orbitals that characterises the chemistry of the 4f elements lanthanum through ytterbium. The stable group 3 elements are thus often grouped with the 4f elements as the so-called rare earths.

Typical transition-metal properties are mostly absent from this group, as they are for the heavier elements of groups 4 and 5: there is only one typical oxidation state and the coordination chemistry is not very rich (though high coordination numbers are common due to the large size of the M3+ ions). This said, low-oxidation state compounds may be prepared and some cyclopentadienyl chemistry is known. The chemistries of group 3 elements are thus mostly distinguished by their atomic radii: yttrium and lutetium are very similar, but scandium stands out as the least basic and the best complexing agent, approaching aluminium in some properties. They naturally take their places together with the rare earths in a series of trivalent elements: yttrium acts as a rare earth intermediate between dysprosium and holmium in basicity; lutetium as less basic than the 4f elements and the least basic of the lanthanides; and scandium as a rare earth less basic than even lutetium. Scandium oxide is amphoteric; lutetium oxide is more basic (although it can with difficulty be made to display some acidic properties), and yttrium oxide is more basic still. Salts with strong acids of these metals are soluble, whereas those with weak acids (e.g. fluorides, phosphates, oxalates) are sparingly soluble or insoluble.

===Physical===
The trends in group 3 follow those of the other early d-block groups and reflect the addition of a filled f-shell into the core in passing from the fifth to the sixth period. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. But because of the lanthanide contraction, the expected increase in atomic radius from yttrium to lutetium is reversed; lutetium atoms are slightly smaller than yttrium atoms, but are heavier and have a higher nuclear charge. This makes the metal more dense, and also harder because the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding becomes more difficult. All three metals have similar melting and boiling points. Very little is known about lawrencium, but calculations suggest it continues the trend of its lighter congeners toward increasing density.

Scandium, yttrium, and lutetium all crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure at room temperature, and lawrencium is expected to do the same. The stable members of the group are known to change structure at high temperature. In comparison with most metals, they are not very good conductors of heat and electricity because of the low number of electrons available for metallic bonding.
==Occurrence==
Scandium, yttrium, and lutetium tend to occur together with the other lanthanides (except short-lived promethium) in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth&#x27;s crust for group 3 is quite low—all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30 parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16 ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5 ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50 ppm, that of chromium is 160 ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5 ppm.

Scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as gadolinite, euxenite, and thortveitite are the only known concentrated sources of this element, the latter containing up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide. Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well.
The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare-earth phosphate mineral monazite, (Ce,La,etc.)PO4, which contains 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Pure lutetium metal is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare-earth metals with the price about US$10,000/kg, or about one-fourth that of gold.

==Production==
The most available element in group 3 is yttrium, with annual production of 8,900 tonnes in 2010. Yttrium is mostly produced as oxide, by a single country, China (99%). Lutetium and scandium are also mostly obtained as oxides, and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2 tonnes, respectively.

Group 3 elements are mined only as a byproduct from the extraction of other elements. They are not often produced as the pure metals; the production of metallic yttrium is about a few tonnes, and that of scandium is in the order of 10 kg per year; production of lutetium is not calculated, but it is certainly small. The elements, after purification from other rare-earth metals, are isolated as oxides; the oxides are converted to fluorides during reactions with hydrofluoric acid. The resulting fluorides are reduced with alkaline earth metals or alloys of the metals; metallic calcium is used most frequently. For example:

:Sc2O3 + 3 HF → 2 ScF3 + 3 H2O
:2 ScF3 + 3 Ca → 3 CaF2 + 2 Sc

==Biological chemistry==
Group 3 metals have low availability to the biosphere. Scandium, yttrium, and lutetium have no documented biological role in living organisms. The high radioactivity of lawrencium would make it highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.

Scandium concentrates in the liver and is a threat to it; some of its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even though in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1 micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, due to the fact that damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.

Yttrium tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. There is normally as little as 0.5 milligrams found within the entire human body; human breast milk contains 4 ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With up to 700 ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.

Lutetium concentrates in bones, and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.

<text>A rock festival is an open-air rock concert featuring many different performers, typically spread over two or three days and having a campsite and other amenities and forms of entertainment provided at the venue. Some festivals are singular events, while others recur annually in the same location. Occasionally, a festival will focus on a particular genre (e.g., folk, heavy metal, world music), but many attempt to bring together a diverse lineup to showcase a broad array of popular music trends.

==History==
Initially, some of the earliest rock festivals were built on the foundation of pre-existing jazz and blues festivals, but quickly evolved to reflect the rapidly changing musical tastes of the time. For example, the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Jazz Festival was launched in Richmond from 26 to 27 August 1961. The first three of these annual outdoor festivals featured only jazz music, but by the fourth &quot;Jazz &amp; Blues Festival&quot; in 1964, a shift had begun that incorporated some blues and pop artists into the lineup. In 1965, for the first time the event included more blues, pop and rock acts than jazz, and by 1966, when the event moved to the town of Windsor, the rock and pop acts clearly dominated the jazz artists.

A similar, though more rapid, evolution occurred with Jazz Bilzen, a solely jazz festival that was inaugurated in 1965 in the Belgian city of Bilzen. The 1966 festival still featured mostly jazz acts. However, by the time of the third festival from 25 to 27 August 1967, rock and pop acts had edged out most of the jazz bands and become the main attraction.

In the United States, rock festivals seemed to spring up with a more self-defined musical identity. Preceded by several precursor events in the San Francisco area, the first two rock festivals in the US were staged in northern California on consecutive weekends in the summer of 1967: the KFRC Fantasy Fair &amp; Magic Mountain Music Festival on Mount Tamalpais (10–11 June) and the Monterey International Pop Festival (16–17 June).

The concept caught fire and spread quickly as rock festivals took on a unique identity and attracted significant media attention around the world. By 1969, promoters were staging dozens of them. According to Bill Mankin, in their dawning age rock festivals were important socio-cultural milestones: &quot;... it would not be an exaggeration to say that, over a few short years, rock festivals played a unique, significant – and underappreciated – role in fueling the countercultural shift that swept not only America but many other countries [during the 1960s]. It seems fitting... that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the &#x27;Woodstock Generation&#x27;.&quot;

Reflecting their musical diversity and the then-common term &#x27;pop music&#x27;, for the first few years, particularly in the US, many rock festivals were called &#x27;pop festivals&#x27;. This also served to distinguish them among the ticket-buying public from other, pre-existing types of music festivals such as jazz and folk festivals. By the end of 1972, the term &#x27;pop festival&#x27; had virtually disappeared as festival promoters adopted more creative, unique and location-specific names to identify and advertise their events. While it was still in vogue, however, over-zealous promoters eager to capitalize on the festival concept made the most of it, with some using the term &quot;Pop Festival&quot; or &quot;Rock Festival&quot; to advertise events held on a single day or evening, often indoors, and featuring only a handful of acts.

Today, rock festivals are usually open-air concerts spread out over two or more days and many of the annual events are sponsored by the same organization.

==Features==
Production and financing

Several of the early rock festival organizers of the 1960s such as Chet Helms, Tom Rounds, Alex Cooley and Michael Lang helped create the blueprint for large-scale rock festivals in the United States, as well promoters such as Wally Hope in the United Kingdom. In various countries, the organizers of rock festivals have faced legal action from authorities, in part because such festivals have attracted large counterculture elements. In 1972, Mar Y Sol Pop Festival in Manatí, Puerto Rico attracted an estimated 30–35,000 people, and an arrest warrant was issued for promoter Alex Cooley, who avoided arrest by leaving the island before the festival was over. British Free Festival organizers Ubi Dwyer and Sid Rawle were imprisoned for attempting to promote a 1975 Windsor Festival. The British police would later outright attack free festival attendees at the 1985 Battle of the Beanfield.

Festivals may require millions of USD to be organized, with the money often gathered through fundraising and angel investors.

Stages and sound systems

While rock concerts typically feature a small lineup of rock bands playing a single stage, rock festivals often grow large enough to require several stages or venues with live bands playing concurrently. As rock music has increasingly been fused with other genres, sometimes stages will be devoted to a specific genre and may in turn become known and large enough to be seen as festivals themselves, such as was The Glade at the famous Glastonbury Festival in England.

Advances in sound reinforcement systems beginning in the 1960s enabled larger and larger rock festival audiences to hear the performers&#x27; music with much better clarity and volume. The best example was the pioneering work of Bill Hanley, known as the &quot;father of festival sound&quot;, who provided the sound systems for numerous rock festivals including Woodstock. Other examples included the Wall of Sound invented in the 1970s to allow the Grateful Dead to play to larger audiences.

Camping and crowd control

Many festivals offer camping, either because lodging in the area is insufficient to support the crowd, or to allow easy multi-day access to the festival&#x27;s features. Festival planning and logistics are frequently a focus of the media, some festivals such as the heavily commercialized Woodstock 1999 were crowd control disasters, with insufficient water and other resources provided to audiences. Many early rock festivals successfully relied on volunteers for crowd control, for example individuals like Wavy Gravy and biker groups such as the Hells Angels and Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club. Gravy in particular called his security group the &quot;Please Force,&quot; a reference to their non-intrusive tactics at keeping order, e.g., &quot;Please don&#x27;t do that, please do this instead&quot;. When asked by the press — who were the first to inform him that he and the rest of his commune were handling security — what kind of tools he intended to use to maintain order at Woodstock in 1969, his response was &quot;Cream pies and seltzer bottles.&quot; Other rock festivals hire private security or local police departments for crowd control, with varying degrees of success.

<doc id="306612" wikidata="Q737343" url="?curid=306612" title="Crusade (TV series)">
<text>Crusade is an American spin-off television series from J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, released in 1999. It is set in 2267, five years after the events of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, and just after the movie &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;. The Drakh have released a nanovirus plague on Earth, which will destroy all life on Earth within five years if it is not stopped. The Victory class destroyer &quot;Excalibur&quot; has been sent out to look for anything that could help the search for a cure.

== Production background ==
Like &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;Crusade&quot; was intended to have a five-year story arc, although as Straczynski notes in the DVD commentary for &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;, it was intended to resolve the Drakh plague after a season or two and move onto other storylines. Conflicts arose, however, between the producers and executives at TNT, and production was cancelled before the first episode was broadcast.

TNT&#x27;s market research had indicated that the audience for &quot;Babylon 5&quot; did not watch other TNT programming, and likewise TNT&#x27;s main audience was not watching the show, making another related program unattractive to the network&#x27;s management. Straczynski believes that the network&#x27;s &quot;interference&quot; with the production was an attempt to get out of their contract by allowing them to argue that he failed to deliver the series they wanted.

Thirteen episodes were made and broadcast by TNT, with at least four more scripted. The Sci-Fi Channel attempted to pick up the show and continue production, but was unable to find room in its budget.

== Plot background ==

=== Drakh attack ===

In 2267, six years after the end of the Shadow War, the Drakh, a former ally of the Shadows, attempt to destroy the Earth with a leftover Shadow Planet Killer. Interstellar Alliance (ISA) president John Sheridan takes command of &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Victory&quot; and leads the EarthForce and ISA fleets to victory. During the battle, the Drakh release a viral weapon into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, infecting every living thing on the planet. In five years, the virus will become active and kill everything. The &quot;Victory&quot; is destroyed in the battle, but the &quot;Excalibur&quot; survives. Command is turned over to Captain Matthew Gideon who is given a mission: explore the galaxy to find either a cure, or an ally capable of producing one (&quot;War Zone&quot;).

=== Telepath War ===

At some point between 2262 and 2267 (most likely in 2264, and just before &quot;Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers&quot;, which took place in 2265), a civil war broke out on Earth between the Psi Corps and a group of rogue telepaths, with mundanes (non-telepaths) caught in the middle. As a result of the war, the Psi Corps (which all telepaths had been forced by law to join) was disbanded and the laws were rewritten; telepaths were given limited rights and allowed back into society, including the military (e.g. Lt. Matheson in &quot;Crusade&quot;). Few telepaths have advanced very far because of how recent the war was and due to the common fear of telepaths. Telepaths are still banned from scanning others&#x27; thoughts without consent and are required to be &quot;deep scanned&quot; by powerful telepaths on a regular basis to ensure that they are not violating any laws (&quot;The Well of Forever&quot;).

=== Mars independence ===
After the Earth Alliance Civil War in 2261, Earth joined the ISA. As promised by John Sheridan, Mars was granted independence since ISA laws required members to free any colony where the majority of colonists wanted independence (&quot;Rising Star&quot;). There is still resentment between the two sides (&quot;Ruling from the Tomb&quot;). Earth controls most of the information systems and resources in the solar system and Earth-based corporations control much of the Mars economy (&quot;Objects in Motion&quot;). As a result, there is some hostility among Mars-born humans towards Terrans and many in EarthForce do not feel obligated to risk their lives to help Earth fight the plague.

=== Shadow technology ===
The galaxy is dealing with the Shadow technology legacy, which, among other things, includes the release of the plague on Earth by the Drakh, which is made out of Shadow technology, and Earthforce&#x27;s use of it, which Gideon had to experience tragically ten years before.

== Cast ==

This is a list of season star cast members, as credited on the DVDs.
* Gary Cole as Captain Matthew Gideon: captain of &quot;Excalibur&quot;. He was specifically chosen by Interstellar Alliance president John Sheridan because he would be willing to take chances and would not let diplomacy get in the way of completing the mission.
* Tracy Scoggins as Captain Elizabeth Lochley: commanding officer of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. She first encountered Gideon on Mars during an interstellar conference on the plague where she was heading security (&quot;Ruling from the Tomb&quot;). She and Gideon originally clashed due to similarities in personalities, but soon developed a relationship as casual lovers, (&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;). She returned to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; after the conference and appeared on a recurring basis.
* Daniel Dae Kim as Lieutenant John Matheson: second in command and P6 telepath (slightly stronger than a Commercial Telepath (P5)). He is considered to be a role model among human telepaths since no other has advanced so far in the EarthForce military. He served as Gideon&#x27;s first officer on his previous assignment as well. He was assigned to &quot;Excalibur&quot; at the insistence of Gideon.
* David Allen Brooks as Max Eilerson: a successful archaeologist from Interplanetary Expeditions. He was a child prodigy and has a gift for understanding alien languages. He was not originally assigned to &quot;Excalibur&quot; but was recruited by Gideon during their encounter in &quot;War Zone&quot;.
* Peter Woodward as Galen: a technomage, who had saved Gideon&#x27;s life 10 years prior to the series (&quot;The Path of Sorrows&quot;). He was exiled from the technomages&#x27; order in 2267 after he helped Earth and the ISA fight the Drakh in the battle that resulted in Earth becoming infected with the plague (&quot;Babylon 5: A Call to Arms&quot;).
* Marjean Holden as Doctor Sarah Chambers: ship&#x27;s medical officer. She was on Mars at the time of the Drakh attack and was willing to risk the plague to go home to Earth and be with her family and help, but was persuaded that her medical expertise could be put to better use by helping to find a cure.
* Carrie Dobro as Dureena Nafeel: a thief and last known survivor of her race (which was destroyed by the Drakh during the Shadow War). Along with Galen, she assisted the crew during the Drakh attack on Earth. After the attack she was held on Mars by EarthForce for further questioning, but was released when Gideon made her part of the crew.

== Episodes ==
The &quot;correct&quot; order of episodes is somewhat unclear and the episodes contain conflicting evidence as to the in-universe chronological order. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski revised TNT&#x27;s ordering for re-broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel in April 2001 and the episodes have been repeated in this order a number of occasions since then. &quot;War Zone&quot;, an episode made halfway through the production as an opener, has been pushed near the end. In particular, these episodes ignore a discontinuity in uniforms – in the TNT order, the crew start out with the revised uniforms in production, and then in &quot;Appearances and Other Deceits&quot; were forced to change to the &quot;new&quot; uniforms used earlier in production. The fourteenth episode would have featured a return to the older uniforms that the crew prefer.

A third order was formally endorsed by Straczynski as the &quot;true&quot; chronological sequence of in-universe events for the filmed episodes, as it appeared in &quot;The Official Babylon 5 Chronology&quot; (published in the pages of &quot;The Official Babylon 5 Magazine&quot; in 1999–2000) and the book &quot;Across Time and Space: The Chronologies of Babylon 5&quot;. Here, &quot;Babylon 5 Historical Database&quot; author Terry Jones explains the running order was done to take into account Straczynski&#x27;s desire to have the grey bellhop uniform stories incorporated within the black explorer uniform stories and the internal story continuity had the series continued. This also accounted for the various on-air dates given and the changes made to dialogue in &quot;Each Night I Dream of Home&quot;. This particular ordering supersedes Straczynski&#x27;s own &quot;preferred&quot; sequence from a strictly chronological and causal standpoint. The original broadcast order as set by TNT was used for the DVD releases.

A fourth, continuity-based order can be inferred by the events of the episodes themselves as several of the episodes make mini-arcs within the series; i.e. the continuity order of Gideon/Lochley meetings based on dialog is &quot;Ruling from the Tomb&quot;/&quot;Each Night I Dream of Home&quot;/&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; which also requires &quot;Ruling&quot; to precede &quot;Appearances and Other Deceits&quot; while the continuity order of the nanite mask is &quot;The Memory of War&quot;/&quot;Each Night I Dream of Home&quot;/&quot;Patterns of the Soul&quot;, etc.

=== Episode list ===
===Unfilmed episodes===
When production was suspended, planning for the episodes that would have made up the second half of the season was at various stages: three had completed scripts and a number of others were ready for scripting with titles and story outlines.
The completed scripts of &quot;To The Ends of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Value Judgements&quot;, and &quot;End of the Line&quot; were published online for a period during 2001 on bookface.com.

A script written by Peter Woodward for the second season entitled &quot;Little Bugs Have Lesser Bugs&quot; was published in 2011 as part of the &quot;Other Voices Volume 1&quot; collection. Scripts for three further episodes, &quot;Value Judgments&quot;, &quot;Tried and True&quot;, and &quot;War Story&quot; were included in &quot;Other Voices Volume 2&quot;, also published in 2011.

== Home releases ==
The complete series was released as a four-disc set in 2004, almost five years after the series ended and a few months after the final season and movie set of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was released. &quot;Crusade&quot; was also included in &quot;Babylon 5: The Complete Universe&quot;, a set of all B5 shows and movies released in the United Kingdom on October 24, 2005. It was not included in &quot;Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series&quot;, which was a set released in the United States.

The episodes are in the original broadcast order. The set does not include the pilot movie, &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;, which was released earlier as part of the movie set. Unlike &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, the DVD release of &quot;Crusade&quot; was not cropped and re-edited for widescreen; it maintains its original fullscreen format. Initially, the set included a commentary with Straczynski, however he got it removed from subsequent pressings when he learned that parts of it had been replaced with an entirely different interview to cover up his harsh criticism of TNT.

<doc id="306613" wikidata="Q219419" url="?curid=306613" title="Monodontidae">
<text>The cetacean family Monodontidae comprises two living whale species, the narwhal and the beluga whale and at least four extinct species, known from the fossil record. Beluga and Narwhal are native to coastal regions and pack ice around the Arctic Ocean. Both species are relatively small whales, in length, with a forehead melon, and a short or absent snout. Premaxillary teeth are absent. They do not have a true dorsal fin, but do have a narrow ridge running along the back, which is much more pronounced in the narwhal. They are highly vocal animals, communicating with a wide range of sounds. Like other whales, they also use echolocation to navigate. Belugas can be found in the far north of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; the distribution of narwhals is restricted to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.

Monodontids have a wide-ranging carnivorous diet, feeding on fish, molluscs, and small crustaceans. They have reduced teeth, with the beluga having numerous simple teeth, and the narwhal having only two teeth, one of which forms the tusks in males. Gestation lasts 14–15 months in both species, and almost always results in a single calf. The young are not weaned for a full two years, and do not reach sexual maturity until they are five to eight years of age. Family groups travel as part of herds, or &#x27;pods&#x27;, which may contain several hundred individuals.

==Taxonomy==

The monodontids, oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae) and porpoises (Phocoenidae) together comprise the Delphinoidea superfamily. Genetic evidence suggests the porpoises are more closely related to the white whales, and these two families constitute a separate clade which diverged from the Delphinidae within the past 11 million years.

<text>Balaenidae () is a family of whales of the parvorder Mysticeti (baleen whales) that contains mostly fossil taxa and two living genera: the right whale (genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot;), and the closely related bowhead whale (genus &quot;Balaena&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
*Family Balaenidae
**Genus &quot;Balaena&quot;
***Bowhead whale, &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; 
**Genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot;
***North Atlantic right whale, &quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot; 
***North Pacific right whale, &quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot; 
***Southern right whale, &quot;Eubalaena australis&quot; 

Until recently, all right whales of the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot; were considered a single species—&quot;E. glacialis&quot;. In 2000, genetic studies of right whales from the different ocean basins led scientists to conclude that the populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere constitute three distinct species. Further genetic analysis in 2005 using mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA has supported the conclusion that the three populations should be treated as separate species, and the separation has been adopted for management purposes by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Whaling Commission.

The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Pacific right whale and the other members of its family:
===Evolutionary history===
Baleen whales belong to a monophyletic lineage of Mysticeti. Mysticeti are large filter-feeding cetaceans that also include some of the largest animals on earth as well as some of the most critically endangered. Based on morphology and molecular data, four extant family-level clades are recognized within Mysticeti: Balaenidae (bowhead and right whales), Neobalaenidae (pygmy right whales), Eschirichtiidae (gray whales), and Balaenopteridae (rorquals). Phylogenetic relationships of the mysticeti order remain unclear due to legal and logistical challenges. However, recent morphological analysis, support Balaenidae as a monophyletic group that is the sister group to Neobalaenidae.

==Description==

Balaenids are large whales, with an average adult length of 15 to 17 metres (45–50 feet), and weighing 50-80 tonnes. Their principle distinguishing feature is their narrow, arched, upper jaw, which gives the animals a deeply curved jawline. This shape allows for especially long baleen plates. The animals utilise these by ram feeding, swimming at or near the surface with their mouth open for minutes at a time, and straining food from the water, which they then scrape off the baleen with their tongues – a feeding method that contrasts with those of the rorquals and the gray whale. Their diet consists of small crustaceans, primarily copepods, although some species also eat a significant amount of krill. Similarities in terms of physical appearances of jawlines and usages between balaenidae and flamingo have been pointed as a result of possible convergent evolution.

Balaenids are also robustly built by comparison with the rorquals, and lack the grooves along the throat that are distinctive of those animals. They have exceptionally large heads in comparison with their bodies, reaching 40% of the total length in the case of the bowhead whale. They have short, broad, flippers, and lack a dorsal fin.

All species are at least somewhat migratory, moving into warmer waters during the winter, during which they both mate and give birth. Gestation lasts 10–11 months, results in the birth of a single young, and typically occurs once every three years.

==Distribution==

The four species of the Balaenidae are found in temperate and polar waters; &quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot; (North Atlantic right whale), &quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot; (North Pacific right whale), &quot;Eubalaena australis&quot; (southern right whale), and &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; (bowhead whale). Bowhead and right whales can reach up to 18 meters in length and over 100 tons at maturity.

==Exploitation and conservation status==

Members of Balaenidae can live over 70 years and were hunted extensively in the late 1800s for their blubber. Approximately 40% of right whales&#x27; body mass is blubber, and thus they were known as the &quot;right&quot; whale to kill.

After death, the large blubber deposits caused right whales to float to the surface, which facilitated an easier oil harvest. With a population estimated at between 300-350 individuals, the North Atlantic right whale is the most critically endangered great whale. The Northern Pacific right whale is also endangered with only about 500 individuals extant. The Southern right whale (~7500 individuals in 1997) and the Bowhead whale (20,000 to 40,000) have made stronger recoveries since whale hunting was significantly curtailed by international agreement.

<text>Pierre Poujade (; 1 December 1920 – 27 August 2003) was a French right-wing populist politician after whom the Poujadist movement was named.

==Biography==
Pierre Poujade was born in Saint-Céré (Le Lot), France, and studied at Collège Saint-Eugène d&#x27;Aurillac, a Roman Catholic private school. On the death of his father, an architect, in 1928, he was unable to afford the tuition and left school to work as a manual laborer. As a teenager, Poujade joined the Parti populaire français (PPF) of Jacques Doriot.

From 1940 to 1942, Poujade supported the Révolution nationale of Philippe Pétain. After the invasion of the free zone by German forces, he joined the Free French Forces in Algiers, where he met his future wife, Yvette Seva, with whom he would have five children.

===Poujadism===

After the war, Poujade was the owner of a book and stationery store.

On 23 July 1953, with a group of about 20 persons, Poujade prevented inspectors of the tax board from verifying the income of another shopkeeper. This was the start of a tax protest movement by shopkeepers, first in the Lot department, then in the Aveyron department, and finally the whole south of the Massif Central.

On 29 November 1953, Pierre Poujade created the &quot;Union de Défense des Commerçants et Artisans&quot; (UDCA; Defense Union of Shopkeepers and Craftsmen), to organize the tax protesters. This movement would soon be called &quot;Poujadism&quot; (French: &quot;Poujadisme&quot;). Poujadism flourished most vigorously in the last years of the Fourth Republic, and articulated the economic interests and grievances of shopkeepers and other proprietor-managers of small businesses facing economic and social change. The main themes of Poujadism concerned the defense of the common man against the elites.

In addition to the protest against the income tax and the price control imposed by finance minister Antoine Pinay to limit inflation, Poujadism was opposed to industrialization, urbanization, and American-style modernization, which were perceived as a threat to the identity of rural France. Poujadism denounced the French state as &quot;rapetout et inhumain&quot; (&quot;thieving and inhuman&quot;).

The movement&#x27;s &quot;common man&quot; populism led to antiparliamentarism (Poujade called the National Assembly &quot;the biggest brothel in Paris&quot; and the deputies a &quot;pile of rubbish&quot; and &quot;paederasts&quot;), a strong anti-intellectualism (Poujade denounced the graduates from the École Polytechnique as the main culprits for the woes of 1950s France and boasted that he had no book learning), xenophobia, and antisemitism, particularly aimed against Jewish Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France, with Poujade claiming &quot;Mendès is French only as the word added to his name&quot;. Mendès was perceived as being responsible for the loss of French Indochina. Poujadism also supported the cause of French Algeria.

===Political involvement===
In 1955, the UDCA was a strong political movement, with 400,000 members. Its adherents were encouraged to protest against taxes and withdraw their deposits from state-owned banks. The movement called for new Estates General to re-found the French political regime, and published the &quot;Fraternité Française&quot; newspaper.
The UDCA secured 52 seats in the 1956 elections. &quot;Experts said he might win six to eight seats&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; wrote. &quot;A great many political leaders, including M. Faure two years ago, have promised to do something about [the tax system]. If they had made good, Poujadism would never have been born&quot;. The youngest member of parliament, elected on a UDCA list, was Jean-Marie Le Pen, then leader of the youth branch of UDCA. Poujade was critical of the decolonization of Algeria, and of the European Defence Community. To justify his support for the Algerian War, Poujade declared in 1956 to &quot;Time&quot; Magazine:

Big Wall Street syndicates found incredibly rich oil deposits in the Sahara, but instead of exploiting the discovery, they capped the wells and turned the Algerians against us...All this is a great diabolic scheme to dismember France. Already the Saar is gone, and soon the Italians will want Corsica...As for those who are against us, I need only say: let them go back to Jerusalem. We&#x27;ll even be glad to pay their way.&quot;
After the Fifth Republic was established in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency, Poujade and his party largely faded from view.

Poujade ran for National Assembly again, but was defeated in 1962, after which he went on to found an organization that distributed Nazi political speeches and military songs.

In 1965, Poujade supported Jean Lecanuet for president.

In the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections, Poujade favored François Mitterrand, while in the 1995 election he voiced his support for Jacques Chirac.

In 1984, Pierre Poujade was appointed to the &quot;Conseil économique et social&quot; by Mitterrand. Poujade used this position to promote biofuels.

Poujade distanced himself from Le Pen and declared in 2002 that he would have preferred to break his own leg than to make him a deputy.

=== Death ===
Poujade died on 27 August 2003 in La Bastide-l&#x27;Évêque at the age of 82. His funeral was officiated in the Church of Saint John the Baptist in La Bastide-l&#x27;Eveque, on 30 August 2003.

==Legacy==
Although the UDCA has lost its influence, some of the ideas of Poujadism persist in modern French politics.

In 1969, Gérard Nicoud started the CID-UNATI (&quot;Comité Interprofessionnel de Défense-Union Nationale des Travailleurs Indépendants&quot;), a tax protest movement similar to the one of Poujade. Examples of recent political groups with strong Poujadist leanings include Le Pen&#x27;s own National Front (which has a strong anti-tax message), the &quot;Comité de Défense des Commerçants et Artisans&quot; of Christian Poucet (that encouraged French shopkeepers to declare their business in Britain in order to avoid paying the French Social Security taxes), and the &quot;Union des Contribuables Français&quot;. The magazine &quot;Le Cri du Contribuable&quot; owned by Nicolas Miguet also maintains the poujadist tradition.

In France, &quot;Poujadisme&quot; is often used pejoratively to characterize any kind of ideology 
that declares itself &quot;anti-establishment&quot; or strongly criticizes the current French political system or political class, even when the anti-tax or anti-intellectual aspects of the original Poujadism are absent.

For instance, &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; was accused of &quot;poujado-marxisme&quot; in the 1990s.

In a 1990 pamphlet, reissued in 2012, Christopher Hitchens refers to a &quot;... Poujadiste female with ideas above her station&quot;, presumably a reference to Margaret Thatcher and her humble origins as a Grantham grocer&#x27;s daughter.

In February 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commentator Robert Zaretsky compared the American Tea Party movement with Poujadism.

In a May 2016 editorial, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Ross Douthat identified Donald Trump as a Poujadist.

British historian Timothy Garton Ash used Poujade in discussing the British vote to leave the European Union. In a piece published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2016, he wrote about some of those who voted for Brexit, saying that:

It is a mistake to disqualify such people as racist. Their concerns are widespread, genuine and not to be dismissed. Populist xenophobes such as Nigel Farage exploit these emotions, linking them to subterranean English nationalism and talking, as he did in the moment of victory, of the triumph of &quot;real people, ordinary people, decent people&quot;. This is the language of Orwell hijacked for the purposes of a Poujade.

<text>Palestine is an unincorporated community in Wirt County, West Virginia, United States. It is located at the confluence of the Little Kanawha River and Reedy Creek, at , at an elevation of 682 feet (208 m). Its ZIP code is 26160. The community was named after Palestine.

Prior to 1905, the name of Palestine&#x27;s post office was Reedy Ripple, to distinguish its name from a community named &quot;Palatine&quot; in Marion County; the name &quot;Reedy Ripple&quot; derived from an accumulation of gravel in the Little Kanawha River at the mouth of Reedy Creek. Palestine gained notice in 2003 for being the hometown of Jessica Lynch.

The Buffalo Church near Palestine was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

<text>Ukrainian music covers diverse and multiple component elements of the music that is found in the Western and Eastern musical civilization. It also has a very strong indigenous Slavic and Christian uniqueness whose elements were used among the areas that surround modern Ukraine.

Ukraine is also the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former Russian Empire, home to its first professional music academy, which opened in the mid-18th century and produced numerous early musicians and composers.

Modern Ukraine is situated north of the Black Sea, previously part of the Soviet Union. Several of its ethnic groups living within Ukraine have their own unique musical traditions and some have developed specific musical traditions in association with the land in which they live.

== Folk music ==
Ukraine found itself at the crossroads of Asia and Europe and this is reflected within the music in a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony which does not always easily fit the rules of traditional Western European harmony.
The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals. This is an indication that the major-minor system developed in Western European music did not become as entrenched in Ukraine.

Rhythmically the music rarely uses complex time-signatures, but compound meters are encountered, and the music can be extremely complex harmonically.

Harmonically three and even four part harmony had developed and was recorded in the central steppe regions of Ukraine, but was not in popular use in the mountain regions by the late 19th century.

*Ritual songs show the greatest tendency to preservation. They are frequently in recitative style, essentially monodic, based on notes in the range of a third or a fourth. An example of this style is the theme for the Shchedrivka &quot;Shchedryk&quot; known in the West as &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;.
*A large group of Ukrainian ritual melodies fall within a perfect fourth with the main central tone as the lowest note. Many of the ritual Easter melodies known as Haivky fall into this category. The tetrachordal system is also found in wedding and harvest songs. Folk dances often have melodies based on two tetrachords fused together.
*The pentatonic scale in anhemitonic form is common in spring songs known as Vesnianky.
*The bulk of Ukrainian folk songs melodies are based on scales identical to mеdieval modes, but differ in melodic structure. The Mixolydian and Dorian modes are used more often than Ionian and Aeolian modes. This is a feature of traditional paraliturgical Koliadky.
*The augmented 2nd interval is found, as well as the raising of the fourth and seventh degree of the scale. It is often used for melodic expression. This melodic manner gives an effect that is described as adding severe tension or sadness in some Ukrainian songs. The phenomenon is not found in Russian folk songs and is thought to have been introduced or developed in the 17th century.

=== Vocal ===

Ukrainian folk song singing style can be divided into a number of broad aesthetic categories.

1. Solo singing – primarily ritual songs including holosinnya sung at wakes.

2. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment by professional itinerant singers known as kobzari or lirnyky. The highest form of development of this style of singing can be seen in the lyric historical folk epics known as &quot;dumy&quot; sung to the accompaniment of the bandura, kobza or lira (lirnyk). &quot;Dumy&quot; were sung primarily in the dorian mode.

3. The third is an archaic type of modal &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal style in which a phrase sung by a soloist is answered by a choral phrase in 2- or 3- voice vertical polyphony/heterophony/harmony. The vocal inflection here is quite mediaeval in character, and some peculiarities of distinctly Ukrainian flavor are noticeable, such as parallel fifths and octaves, and several types of plagal cadences. This type of song, once dominant, after 1650 has ceded its hegemony to the newer tonal types, but can still be found in isolated villages. This style is evident in the &quot;Koliadka&quot; and &quot;Shchedryk&quot;.

4. The other vocal styles are marked by the influences exerted by European music, by paraliturgical music of Danylo Tuptalo and his circle in the early 18th century, and later by classical music and urban culture.

Ukrainian vocal music exhibits a wide variety of forms – monodic, heterophonic, homophonic, harmonic and polyphonic.

One of the most active proponents of Ukrainian vocal music is Nina Matviyenko, along with recently established groups dedicated to the preservation of traditional polyphony such as &quot;Bozhychi&quot;, &quot;Hurtopravci&quot;, &quot;Volodar&quot;, &quot;Korali&quot; and &quot;Drevo&quot;. Popular folk songs include:

*&quot;Yikhav Kozak za Dunai&quot;
*&quot;Pidmanula Pidvela&quot;
*&quot;Nich Yaka Misiachna&quot;
*&quot;Shchedryk&quot; – originally an ancient folk chant arranged by Mykola Leontovych
*&quot;Zaporozhets za Dunaiem&quot; – comic opera based on popular folk song
*&quot;Oi ne khody, Hrytsiu&quot; – by popular folk artist Marusia Churai
*&quot;Rozpriahaite Khloptsi Konei&quot; – originally Ukrainian folk song
=== Instrumental ===

Common traditional instruments include: the kobza (lute), bandura, torban (bass lute), violin, basolya (3-string cello), the relya or lira (hurdy-gurdy) and the tsymbaly; the sopilka (duct flute), floyara (open, end-blown flute), trembita (alpenhorn), fife, volynka (bagpipes); and the buben (frame drum), tulumbas (kettledrum), resheto (tambourine) and drymba/varhan (Jaw harp). Traditional instrumental ensembles are often known as troïstï muzyki (literally ‘three musicians’ that typically make up the ensemble, e.g. violin, sopilka and buben). When performing dance melodies instrumental performance usually includes improvisation.

The traditional dances of Ukraine include: the Kozak, Kozachok, Tropak, Hopak, Hrechanyky, Kolomyjka and Hutsulka, Metelytsia, Shumka, Arkan, Kateryna (Kadryl) and Chabarashka. Dances originating outside the Ukrainian ethnic region but which are also popular include: the Polka, Mazurka, Krakowiak, Csárdás, Waltz, Kamarinskaya and Barynya. Ukrainian instrumental and dance music has also influenced Jewish (&quot;Hava Nagila&quot; - &quot;Let&#x27;s Rejoice&quot;) and Gypsy music and much of it was included in the repertoire of itinerant klezmorim.

Early in the 20th century, Pavlo Humeniuk of Philadelphia became famous in North America for his fiddle music.

==== Vocal-instrumental folk music and performers ====
Although most instrumental dance music in Ukraine can be sung to, there exist in Ukraine a group of professional folk musicians who sing to their own accompaniment. These itinerant musicians were generically called kobzari (kobzar – singular), and accompanied their singing with the kobza, bandura, or lira. Although their origins stretch back to antiquity, their repertoire and customs directly date back to the 17th century in which they depict the period of the conflicts between the Kozaks and various foreign oppressors. There were many cases of those folk singers being blind which became a stereotype in the cultural memory.

==== Kobzari ====
The kobzari organized themselves into regional professional guild-like structures, known as a &quot;Kobzar Guild&quot;.

During Soviet era almost all of the traditional kobzari were killed, the bulk perishing during Stalin&#x27;s &quot;purges&quot; during the 1930s. Even the instrument, kobza and bandura, were prohibited and confiscated, a practice of the Ukrainian ethnocide that continued after the fall of the Russian Empire.

Under the inspiration of noted traditional bandurist Heorhiy Tkachenko a Kobzar Guild was re-established in 1991 in Kyiv by Mykola Budnyk in order to revive and foster the ancient kobzar traditions. The Guild unites many singer-musicians in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora. Many of its members are not formally Conservatory trained.

=== Soviet-inspired folk music ===
With the establishment of the Soviet regime in Ukraine a policy based on state atheism was instituted which gradually grew to an intolerance to organized religion. Religious music was not supported by the regime and in time was purged from performance. Many aspects of classical music were also branded as being bourgeois and decadent.

A movement was started in the 20s for &quot;Proletarian songs&quot; – music of the working people. In time it was noticed that this music only catered for the working classes in the cities and did not take into account the large percentage of Ukrainian peasants living in village setting. As a consequence, songs of the village were also defined as being also from the working class. Resulting from this reclassification the Soviet government began to give significant support to this form of music. Hence, various &quot;fakeloric&quot; ensembles came into existence. After World War II huge resources continued to be given to support this style of music in order to displace the onslaught of mass culture from the West.

Numerous folk choirs were established such as the Veriovka folk choir directed by Hryhoriy Veriovka. A stylized dance troupe was established by Pavlo Virsky based on a synthesis of ethnographic dance and ballet. Particularly popular were the numerous Bandurist Capellas. These particular pseudo-folk forms blending ethnographic materials in an art setting have also become popular in the Ukrainian diaspora in North America.

=== Bandura ===
In North America pseudo-folk or &quot;reconstructive&quot; bandurists such as Zinoviy Shtokalko, Hryhoriy Kytasty, Julian Kytasty, Victor Mishalow, et al. have played a significant role in defining Ukrainian ethnicity in the New World, while fusing traditional musical material with new possibilities offered by contemporary instruments.

=== Music of non-Ukrainian ethnic minorities ===
Of the traditional musics of non-Ukrainian ethnic minorities living in Ukraine possibly the richest and most developed is that of Jewish music (including Klezmer, cantorial, Yiddish-language folksongs, and Yiddish theatre music) which can trace most of its origins to the Jewish Pale of Settlement and to South-western Ukraine. It is estimated that one third of the total Jewish population of Europe lived on Ukrainian ethnic territory at the turn of the 19th century. Therefore a number of Soviet and Russian Empire Jewish folklorists collected and documented Jewish music primarily in Ukraine, including S. Ansky, Susman Kiselgof, Moisei Beregovsky, Joel Engel, and Sofia Magid. Many of these collected works are now in the possession of the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.

Russian music has also had a strong base for development in Ukraine. Many of the early performers on Russian folk instruments came from Ukraine and these performers often included Ukrainian melodies in their repertoire. The 4 string Russian domra continues to be used and taught in Ukraine despite the fact that it has been replaced by the 3 string domra in Russia proper.

=== Ukrainized versions and borrowed music ===
* Polonaise
* The Hills of Manchuria ()

== Classical music ==
Composers of Ukrainian ethnicity that lived in Ukraine during the 19th century are associated with the a national school of music that was influenced by Ukrainian folk tunes and texts. Non-Ukrainian composers who lived in territories that now form part of modern Ukraine, such as Franz Xavier Mozart, Isaak Dunayevsky, Rheinhold Gliere, and Sergei Prokofiev, rarely composed music that influenced in this way. Ukrainian-born composers who lived abroad, such as Dmytro Bortniansky, Maksym Berezovsky, Artemy Vedel, Dimitry of Rostov, Mykola Fomenko, Yuriy Oliynyk, Zinoviy Lawryshyn, Wasyl Sydorenko, Mykola Roslavets and Dunayevsky, have had an influence upon Ukrainian classical music.

=== Baroque music ===
During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the kobza, bandura, or torban.

In the course of the 18th century in the Russian Empire, court musicians were typically trained at the music academy in Hlukhiv and largely came from Ukraine. Notable performers of the era include Tymofiy Bilohradsky, who later studied the lute under Sylvius Leopold Weiss in Dresden; his daughter Yelyzaveta, who was a famous operatic soprano; and Oleksiy Rozumovsky, a court bandurist and the morganatic husband of Empress Elizabeth.

The first professional music academy of the Russian Empire was established in Ukraine in Hlukhiv in 1738, the Hlukhiv Music Academy, where students were taught to sing and play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers of the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv or having been closely associated with this music school.

=== Ukrainian nationalist movement in music ===

During the 19th century, musical nationalism arose in Europe, characterized by an emphasis on national musical elements, and associated with the growth of national consciousness of European peoples. A Ukrainian nationalist movement in music appeared during the late 19th century. Ukrainian writers, poets, and professional musicians used folklore to arrange folk songs. The opening of the first professional theatres in Kyiv (1803) and Odesa (1810), which staged works on national themes, played an important role in the formation of Ukrainian opera. the first of which was &quot;Zaporozhets za Dunayem&quot; by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky (1863).

A key figure in the development of Ukrainian nationalist music during the 19th century was the composer, conductor and pianist Mykola Lysenko, whose compositions include nine operas, and music for piano. He used Ukrainian poetry, including that of the poet Taras Shevchenko. In 1904, Lysenko opened the Russian Empire&#x27;s first Ukrainian music school in Kiev (now the ). He is credited with establishing a classical music tradition that was a blend of folk music and classical music forms.

Lysenko&#x27;s work was continued by other composers, including Mykola Leontovych, Kyrylo Stetsenko, Yakiv Stepovy, and Stanyslav Lyudkevych.

=== Musical culture in the Ukrainian State (1918) ===
In the period of the Liberation War numerous Ukrainian artistic groups were created. The Government of the Ukrainian State has taken a consistent position in the field of cultural development, including music, as evidenced by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers on the mobilization of literary, scientific, artistic and technical forces of Ukraine. In particular, by the decree of Pavel Skoropadsky in 1918, the State Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine, the Ukrainian State Chapel, the First and Second National Choirs were established. The Kyiv opera was named the Ukrainian Drama and Opera Theater, and a significant number of world-famous operas have been translated into Ukrainian. Also in 1918, the Kobzar Choir was founded, which would later be revived as the State Bandura Chapel.

=== Soviet Romantic school ===
The arrival of Soviet authorities in Ukraine was marked by a number of tragic events. In 1921, Leontovych was killed by an agent of the Cheka, and in 1928 the society in his memory were banned. Ukrainian art suffered the worst losses in the 1930s, during which the Soviet authorities exterminated several hundred bandura players, kobzars, and lyre players, and in 1938, musician and ethnographer Hnat Khotkevych was shot among other artists of the &quot;shot revival.&quot;

At the same time, the Soviet authorities opened a number of music institutions in various cities of Ukraine. In particular, these are opera and ballet theaters in Kharkiv (1925), Poltava (1928), Vinnytsia (1929), Dnipropetrovsk (1931), Donetsk (1941), choral and symphonic groups were organized. According to the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party &quot;On the Restructuring of Literary and Artistic Organizations&quot; in 1932, The Union of Soviet Musicians of Ukraine (later - &quot;Union of Composers&quot;) was organized and entrusted with the functions of ideological control over compositions by Ukrainian composers.

Among Ukrainian composers of the Soviet period were Gliere, Borys Lyatoshynsky, Lev Revutsky, Mykola Vilinsky, Anatoliy Kos-Anatolsky, Andriy Shtoharenko, Mykola Dremliuha, Vitaly Kyreyko.

=== Soviet modernist school ===
The 1960s are marked by the breakthrough of the Ukrainian school of composition on the world stage, the mastery of the latest trends in European musical culture. A group of Kyiv Avant-Garde artists is being formed in Kyiv, which includes composers such as Valentyn Silvestrov, Leonid Grabovsky, Vitaliy Godziatsky, and Volodymyr Guba. The central figure in this group was the conductor Igor Blazhkov. As a result of differences with the retrograde tendencies of the official musical circles of the USSR, the members of the &quot;Kyiv avant-garde&quot; were subjected to various kinds of oppression.

In the 1970s and 1980s, composers became famous who expanded the traditional late Romantic style for Ukrainian music through the latest techniques of European modernism - Myroslav Skoryk, Yevhen Stankovych, Ivan Karabyts, Lev Kolodub, and others. Among composers of Ukrainian diaspora - Virko Baley.

=== Post-independence ===
After Ukraine gained independence, any ideological barriers were removed and composers got an opportunity to experiment with different styles and genres. Festivals of avant-gard music such as Kyiv Music Fest, Kontrasty, Two Days and Two Nights of New Music were established. Among composers of new generation - Oleksandr Kozarenko, Volodymyr Runchak, Hanna Havrylets&#x27;, Ivan Nebesnyy. In 2000s experimental electronic music in Ukraine began to develop, the leader of this trend is Alla Zahaikevych.

There are also musicians and ensambles that are difficult to categorize, such as
* Mariana Sadovska – avantgarde and folk singer and composer
* Roman Turovsky – historicist lutenist-composer
* Dakha Brakha
* Dakh Daughters
* New Era Orchestra - a classical music orchestra that also plays contemporary music
* - techno-punk with obscene lyrics 
* Zhadan i Sobaky - ska-punk with folk elements

There are also musicians in Ukraine (Kostyantyn Chechenya, Vadym Borysenko) and in diaspora (Volodymyr Smishkevych, Julian Kytasty, Roman Turovsky) who have been preserving Ukrainian music of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Eras.

== Pop music ==
Pop music in Ukraine is Western influenced pop music in its various forms that has been growing in popularity in Ukraine since the 1960s. The 1970s saw the emergence of a number of folk rock groups such as Kobza. Major contributions were made by songwriter Volodymyr Ivasyuk, Oleksandr Bilash. After Ivasyuk&#x27;s death in 1979, developments in Ukrainian pop music almost ground to a halt. Even established folk-rock groups such as Kobza began to sing in Russian.

The revival of Ukrainian pop music emerged in 1990s after Ukraine gained an independence. The Chervona Ruta Festival played an important role in popularisation and evolution of the modern Ukrainian song. In 2004 Ruslana was a first Ukrainian singer who won the Eurovision Song Contest.

Until the Russo-Ukrainian War broke out in 2014, the Russian language was widely used by Ukrainian artists in order to also reach audiences outside Ukraine who could understand Russian. Russian-language songs gradually lost popularity in Ukraine after 2014, while Ukrainian-language music experienced a surge; this trend accelerated when the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Muzvar music journalist Julian Novak stated in July 2022: &#x27;Many popular artists have decided to switch to the Ukrainian language, and change their existing Russian-language repertoire to Ukrainian.&#x27; The war became an increasingly prominent theme in songs, with lyrics about consolation in trying times of losing loved ones and having to flee one&#x27;s home and country, but also the courage to go on. New musical tracks from Ukraine also incorporated ever more elements of Ukrainian folklore, such as the remake of a traditional lullaby by Eurovision Song Contest 2022 winner &quot;Stefania&quot;, and the use of the traditional flute.

<text>The music of [[Belize]] has a mix of Creole, Mestizo, Garìfuna, Mayan and European influences.

== European and African influences ==
After many centuries of Maya habitation, British colonizers arrived in the area in the 17th century. Belize was Britain&#x27;s only colony in Spanish-dominated Central America until self-government in 1964 and gaining full Independence in 1981. Belize is still part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Far more influential than this presence, however, was the importation of African slaves.

Europeans brought polkas, waltzes, schottisches and quadrilles, while Africans brought numerous instruments and percussion-based musics, including marimba. African culture resulted in the creation of brukdown music in interior logging camps, played using banjo, guitar, drums, dingaling bell, accordion and an ass&#x27; jaw bone played by running a stick up and down the teeth.

== Mestizo and Maya music ==

The Maya presence in Belize traces back to 2600 B.C. Almost forty sites of ancient Mayan ruins have been discovered in the Belizean area of the Yucatán Peninsula. Most of what is known about the music of ancient Maya in Belize has been discovered in the iconographies and artifacts discovered in these sites. In 1986, the excavation of the tombs of two elite Maya women in Pacbitun revealed a myriad assortment of ancient flutes, rattles, and ceramic drums. The shapes and styles of the flutes found in the tombs suggest that instruments served an important role in Mayan burial. One globular flute, for example, represents a god/religious figure of death. These flutes were also capable of playing several octaves, which suggests melody and tone as a key musical aspect in ancient Maya. 
Much of Mayan culture is sustained through the Maya-Mestizo population. Of the 60% of the Belize&#x27;s population with Mayan ancestry, 83% are also of Mestizo/Spanish origins. While little research has been done on the musics of Belize&#x27;s largest demographic, what is known about contemporary Maya music can be derived from neighboring Guatemalan and Mexican traditions. One possible reason for a lack of knowledge surrounding Mestizo musical history is the lack of potential fieldwork due to the complex demographic populations. Contemporary Maya-Metstizo music exists in a hybrid form. An example of contemporary Maya music is the traditional flute and drum alongside traditional Spanish instruments like the marimba, violin, and guitar. The K’ekchi harp ensemble is one example of such cultural blending. The origin of the K’ekchi varies depending on the source: Maya communities believe that the K’ekchi harp music was created by the Maya Gods, while others attest that the ensemble is a hybrid creation brought on by the Spaniards as they converted the Maya to Christianity. The K’ekchi primarily plays during Easter and Christmas, which is evidence of Christian influence.

Maya Mestizo culture in north and west Belize, and also Guatemala, is characterised by marimba, a xylophone-like instrument descended from an African instrument. Marimba bands use drum sets, double bass and sometimes other instruments. Famous performers included Alma Belicena and the Los Angeles Marimba Band. Well known band of Maya Pax music was La Banda de San Jose. One of the popular contemporary marimba bands is the Benque Marimba Youth Academy. In the villages of northern Belize you will also find Maya Pax bands which mostly play for traditional Maya dances like the Hoghead dance like La banda de San Jose in Orange Walk district.

Cumbia music is mostly performed by bands in the northern region of the country where Mestizos and Maya (Yucatec Maya) are abundant.

== Creole music ==
Creole music culture is largely focused around political issues surrounding the Creole people of both Belize and the Caribbean. Stylistically, Creole music is widely known in Belize for its call-and-response structure, which requires at least two voices. The call– usually just one person– sings the first line and alternates lines with the response– who can be one or many people– in a typical ABA or three-part rondo form. The melodies, often in common time, showcase diatonic movement, arpeggios and sequential figures.

Among the most popular styles created by Kriol musicians is brukdown. Brukdown evolved out of the music and dance of loggers, especially a form called buru. Buru was often satirical in nature, and eventually grew more urban, accompanied by a donkey&#x27;s jawbone, drums and a banjo. The word &quot;brukdown&quot; may come from &quot;broken down calypso&quot;, referring to the similarities between brukdown and Trinidadian calypso music; the presence of large numbers of Jamaicans in Belize also led to an influence from mento music.

In modern forms, new instruments have been added to brukdown. The &quot;boom and chime groups&quot; use bass guitar, electric guitar and congas, for example. Popular brukdown groups include The Tigers, The Mahogany Chips, Mimi Female Duet and Brad Pattico.

== Garifuna music ==

The Garifuna (also called Garinagu) are descended from escaped Island Caribs who were deported from St. Vincent to Central America (especially Honduras and also Belize) in 1802 by the British when they conquered St. Vincent. The Garifunas kept themselves apart from the social system then dominant, leading to a distinctive culture that developed throughout the 20th century.

Forms of Garifuna folk music and dance encompass many styles including: punta, hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, charikanari, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta and Punta rock are the most popular forms of dance music in Garifuna culture. Punta is performed around holidays and at parties, and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. Chumba and hunguhungu are circular dances in a three beat rhythm, which are often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having eremwu eu and abaimajani, rhythmic a cappella songs, and laremuna wadaguman, men&#x27;s work songs.

Drums play an important role in Garifuna music. These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep. Also used in combination with the drums are the sisera. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.

In contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds in a style described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio&#x27;s album Watina released on the Belizean record label &quot;Stone Tree Records.&quot;

== Modern music ==
Belize&#x27;s musical base has expanded considerably in recent years with the addition of local Punta rockreggae, reggaeton, punta, soca, dancehall, hip hop, rock, and metal acts. The latter genre includes musicians like Shyne, Lova Boy, Hanal Pixan and Ascenthium.

However, despite growing local scenes, modern music from other Caribbean nations (primarily Jamaican dancehall and Trinidadian soca ), as well as commercial pop music from the United States and United Kingdom still remain the most popular genres of music among young Belizeans.

<doc id="306645" wikidata="Q2558473" url="?curid=306645" title="Sine-Gordon equation">
<text>The sine-Gordon equation is a second-order nonlinear partial differential equation for a function formula_1 dependent on two variables typically denoted formula_2 and formula_3, involving the wave operator and the sine of formula_1. 

It was originally introduced by in the course of study of surfaces of constant negative curvature as the Gauss–Codazzi equation for surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature −1 in 3-dimensional space. The equation was rediscovered by in their study of crystal dislocations known as the Frenkel–Kontorova model. 

This equation attracted a lot of attention in the 1970s due to the presence of soliton solutions, and is an example of an integrable PDE. Among well-known integrable PDEs, the sine-Gordon equation is the only &quot;relativistic&quot; system due to its Lorentz invariance.

== Realizations of the sine-Gordon equation ==

=== Differential geometry ===
This is the first derivation of the equation, by Bour (1862).

There are two equivalent forms of the sine-Gordon equation. In the (real) &quot;space-time coordinates&quot;, denoted formula_5, the equation reads:

: formula_6

where partial derivatives are denoted by subscripts. Passing to the light-cone coordinates (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;), akin to &quot;asymptotic coordinates&quot; where

: formula_7

the equation takes the form

: formula_8

This is the original form of the sine-Gordon equation, as it was considered in the 19th century in the course of investigation of surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature &quot;K&quot; = −1, also called pseudospherical surfaces. 

Consider an arbitrary pseudospherical surface. Across every point on the surface there are two asymptotic curves. This allows us to construct a distinguished coordinate system for such a surface, in which &quot;u&quot; = constant, &quot;v&quot; = constant are the asymptotic lines, and the coordinates are incremented by the arc length on the surface. At every point on the surface, let formula_1 be the angle between the asymptotic lines.

The first fundamental form of the surface is

: formula_10

and the second fundamental form isformula_11and the Gauss–Codazzi equation isformula_12Thus, any pseudospherical surface gives rise to a solution of the sine-Gordon equation, although with some caveats: if the surface is complete, it is necessarily singular due to the Hilbert embedding theorem. In the simplest case, &quot;the&quot; pseudosphere, also known as the tractroid, corresponds to a static one-soliton, but the tractroid has a singular cusp at its equator. 

Conversely, one can start with a solution to the sine-Gordon equation to obtain a pseudosphere uniquely up to rigid transformations. There is a theorem, sometimes called the &quot;fundamental theorem of surfaces&quot;, that if a pair of matrix-valued bilinear forms satisfy the Gauss–Codazzi equations, then they are the first and second fundamental forms of an embedded surface in 3-dimensional space. Solutions to the sine-Gordon equation can be used to construct such matrices by using the forms obtained above.

=== New solutions from old ===
The study of this equation and of the associated transformations of pseudospherical surfaces in the 19th century by Bianchi and Bäcklund led to the discovery of Bäcklund transformations. Another transformation of pseudospherical surfaces is the Lie transform introduced by Sophus Lie in 1879, which corresponds to Lorentz boosts for solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. 

There are also some more straightforward ways to construct new solutions but which do not give new surfaces. Since the sine-Gordon equation is odd, the negative of any solution is another solution. However this does not give a new surface, as the sign-change comes down to a choice of direction for the normal to the surface. New solutions can be found by translating the solution: if formula_1 is a solution, then so is formula_14 for formula_15 an integer.

=== Frenkel–Kontorova model ===
=== A mechanical model ===

Consider a line of pendula, hanging on a straight line, in constant gravity. Connect the bobs of the pendula together by a string in constant tension. Let the angle of the pendulum at location formula_2 be formula_1, then schematically, the dynamics of the line of pendulum follows Newton&#x27;s second law:formula_18and this is the sine-Gordon equation, after scaling time and distance appropriately.

Note that this is not exactly correct, since the net force on a pendulum due to the tension is not precisely formula_19, but more accurately formula_20. However this does give an intuitive picture for the sine-gordon equation. One can produce exact mechanical realizations of the sine-gordon equation by more complex methods.

== Naming ==

The name &quot;sine-Gordon equation&quot; is a pun on the well-known Klein–Gordon equation in physics:

: formula_21

The sine-Gordon equation is the Euler–Lagrange equation of the field whose Lagrangian density is given by

: formula_22

Using the Taylor series expansion of the cosine in the Lagrangian,

: formula_23

it can be rewritten as the Klein–Gordon Lagrangian plus higher-order terms:

: formula_24

== Soliton solutions ==

An interesting feature of the sine-Gordon equation is the existence of soliton and multisoliton solutions.

=== 1-soliton solutions ===
The sine-Gordon equation has the following 1-soliton solutions:

: formula_25

where

: formula_26

and the slightly more general form of the equation is assumed:

: formula_27

The 1-soliton solution for which we have chosen the positive root for formula_28 is called a &quot;kink&quot; and represents a twist in the variable formula_1 which takes the system from one constant solution formula_30 to an adjacent constant solution formula_31. The states formula_32 are known as vacuum states, as they are constant solutions of zero energy. The 1-soliton solution in which we take the negative root for formula_28 is called an &quot;antikink&quot;. The form of the 1-soliton solutions can be obtained through application of a Bäcklund transform to the trivial (vacuum) solution and the integration of the resulting first-order differentials:

: formula_34

: formula_35

for all time.

The 1-soliton solutions can be visualized with the use of the elastic ribbon sine-Gordon model introduced by Julio Rubinstein in 1970. Here we take a clockwise (left-handed) twist of the elastic ribbon to be a kink with topological charge formula_36. The alternative counterclockwise (right-handed) twist with topological charge formula_37 will be an antikink.

=== 2-soliton solutions ===

Multi-soliton solutions can be obtained through continued application of the Bäcklund transform to the 1-soliton solution, as prescribed by a Bianchi lattice relating the transformed results. The 2-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation show some of the characteristic features of the solitons. The traveling sine-Gordon kinks and/or antikinks pass through each other as if perfectly permeable, and the only observed effect is a phase shift. Since the colliding solitons recover their velocity and shape, such an interaction is called an elastic collision.

The kink-kink solution is given by
formula_38

while the kink-antikink solution is given by
formula_39

Another interesting 2-soliton solutions arise from the possibility of coupled kink-antikink behaviour known as a &quot;breather&quot;. There are known three types of breathers: &quot;standing breather&quot;, &quot;traveling large-amplitude breather&quot;, and &quot;traveling small-amplitude breather&quot;.

The standing breather solution is given by
formula_40

=== 3-soliton solutions ===

3-soliton collisions between a traveling kink and a standing breather or a traveling antikink and a standing breather results in a phase shift of the standing breather. In the process of collision between a moving kink and a standing breather,
the shift of the breather formula_41 is given by

: formula_42

where formula_43 is the velocity of the kink, and formula_44 is the breather&#x27;s frequency. If the old position of the standing breather is formula_45, after the collision the new position will be formula_46.

==Bäcklund transformation==

Suppose that formula_1 is a solution of the sine-Gordon equation
:formula_48

Then the system
:formula_49
where &quot;a&quot; is an arbitrary parameter, is solvable for a function formula_50 which will also satisfy the sine-Gordon equation. This is an example of an auto-Bäcklund transform, as both formula_1 and formula_50 are solutions to the same equation, that is, the sine-Gordon equation.

By using a matrix system, it is also possible to find a linear Bäcklund transform for solutions of sine-Gordon equation.

For example, if formula_1 is the trivial solution formula_54, then formula_50 is the one-soliton solution with formula_56 related to the boost applied to the soliton.

==Topological charge and energy==
The topological charge or winding number of a solution formula_1 is
formula_58
The energy of a solution formula_1 is
formula_60where a constant energy density has been added so that the potential is non-negative. With it the first two terms in the Taylor expansion of the potential coincide with the potential of a massive scalar field, as mentioned in the naming section; the higher order terms can be thought of as interactions. 

The topological charge is conserved if the energy is finite. The topological charge does not determine the solution, even up to Lorentz boosts. Both the trivial solution and the soliton-antisoliton pair solution have formula_61.

==Zero-curvature formulation==
The sine-Gordon equation is equivalent to the curvature of a particular formula_62-connection on formula_63 being equal to zero.

Explicitly, with coordinates formula_64 on formula_63, the connection components formula_66 are given by
formula_67
formula_68
where the formula_69 are the Pauli matrices.
Then the zero-curvature equation
formula_70

is equivalent to the sine-Gordon equation formula_71. The zero-curvature equation is so named as it corresponds to the curvature being equal to zero if it is defined formula_72.

The pair of matrices formula_73 and formula_74 are also known as a Lax pair for the sine-Gordon equation, in the sense that the zero-curvature equation recovers the PDE rather than them satisfying Lax&#x27;s equation.

==Related equations==

The is given by

: formula_75

This is the Euler–Lagrange equation of the Lagrangian

: formula_76

Another closely related equation is the elliptic sine-Gordon equation or Euclidean sine-Gordon equation, given by

: formula_77

where formula_1 is now a function of the variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. This is no longer a soliton equation, but it has many similar properties, as it is related to the sine-Gordon equation by the analytic continuation (or Wick rotation) &quot;y&quot; = i&quot;t&quot;.

The elliptic sinh-Gordon equation may be defined in a similar way.

Another similar equation comes from the Euler–Lagrange equation for Liouville field theory

formula_79

A generalization is given by Toda field theory. More precisely, Liouville field theory is the Toda field theory for the finite Kac–Moody algebra formula_80, while sin(h)-Gordon is the Toda field theory for the affine Kac–Moody algebra formula_81.

==Infinite volume and on a half line==

One can also consider the sine-Gordon model on a circle, on a line segment, or on a half line. It is possible to find boundary conditions which preserve the integrability of the model. On a half line the spectrum contains &quot;boundary bound states&quot; in addition to the solitons and breathers.

==Quantum sine-Gordon model==

In quantum field theory the sine-Gordon model contains a parameter that can be identified with the Planck constant. The particle spectrum consists of a soliton, an anti-soliton and a finite (possibly zero) number of breathers. The number of the breathers depends on the value of the parameter. Multiparticle production cancels on mass shell.

Semi-classical quantization of the sine-Gordon model was done by Ludwig Faddeev and Vladimir Korepin. The exact quantum scattering matrix was discovered by Alexander Zamolodchikov.
This model is S-dual to the Thirring model, as discovered by Coleman.
 This is sometimes known as the Coleman correspondence and serves as an example of boson-fermion correspondence in the interacting case. This article also showed that the constants appearing in the model behave nicely under renormalization: there are three parameters formula_82 and formula_83. Coleman showed formula_84 receives only a multiplicative correction, formula_83 receives only an additive correction, and formula_86 is not renormalized. Further, for a critical, non-zero value formula_87, the theory is in fact dual to a &quot;free&quot; massive Dirac field theory.

The quantum sine-Gordon equation should be modified so the exponentials become vertex operators

: formula_88

with formula_89, where the semi-colons denote normal ordering. A possible mass term is included.

=== Regimes of renormalizability ===
For different values of the parameter formula_90, the renormalizability properties of the sine-Gordon theory change. The identification of these regimes is attributed to Jürg Fröhlich.

The finite regime is formula_91, where no counterterms are needed to render the theory well-posed. The super-renormalizable regime is formula_92, where a finite number of counterterms are needed to render the theory well-posed. More counterterms are needed for each threshold formula_93 passed. For formula_94, the theory becomes ill-defined . The boundary values are formula_95 and formula_96, which are respectively the free fermion point, as the theory is dual to a free fermion via the Coleman correspondence, and the self-dual point, where the vertex operators form an affine sl2 subalgebra, and the theory becomes strictly renormalizable (renormalizable, but not super-renormalizable).

==Stochastic sine-Gordon model==
The stochastic or dynamical sine-Gordon model has been studied by Martin Hairer and Hao Shen

allowing heuristic results from the quantum sine-Gordon theory to be proven in a statistical setting.

The equation is
formula_97
where formula_98 are real-valued constants, and formula_99 is space-time white noise. The space dimension is fixed to 2. In the proof of existence of solutions, the thresholds formula_100 again play a role in determining convergence of certain terms.

==Supersymmetric sine-Gordon model==

A supersymmetric extension of the sine-Gordon model also exists. Integrability preserving boundary conditions for this extension can be found as well.

==Physical applications==
The sine-Gordon model arises as the continuum limit of the Frenkel–Kontorova model which models crystal dislocations.

Dynamics in long Josephson junctions are well-described by the sine-Gordon equations, and conversely provide a useful experimental system for studying the sine-Gordon model.

The sine-Gordon model is in the same universality class as the effective action for a Coulomb gas of vortices and anti-vortices in the continuous classical XY model, which is a model of magnetism. The Kosterlitz–Thouless transition for vortices can therefore be derived from a renormalization group analysis of the sine-Gordon field theory.

The sine-Gordon equation also arises as the formal continuum limit of a different model of magnetism, the quantum Heisenberg model, in particular the XXZ model.
