<text>Terry Gene Bollea (; born August 11, 1953), better known by his ring name Hulk Hogan, is an American retired professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE as a brand ambassador. Known for his flamboyance and massive physique, and his trademark blond horseshoe moustache and bandanas, Hogan is widely regarded as the most recognized wrestling star worldwide, the most popular wrestler of the 1980s and one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.

Hogan began his professional wrestling career in 1977, but gained worldwide recognition after signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in December 1983. There, his persona as a heroic all-American helped usher in the 1980s professional wrestling boom, where he headlined eight of the first nine editions of the WWF&#x27;s flagship annual event WrestleMania. Hogan also was a regular headliner of Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event and its spin-off The Main Event. During his initial run, he was a five-time WWF Champion, with his 1,474-day reign being the longest of the WrestleMania era ever. He is the first wrestler to win consecutive Royal Rumble matches, winning in 1990 and 1991. His match with André the Giant on WWF The Main Event on February 5, 1988, still holds American television viewership records for wrestling with a 15.2 Nielsen rating and 33 million viewers.

In 1993, Hogan departed the WWF to pursue a career in film and television. He was lured back to the ring when he signed with rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. He won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship six times, and holds the record for the longest reign. In 1996, he underwent a career renaissance upon adopting the villainous persona of &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan, leading the popular New World Order (nWo) stable. As a result, he became a major figure during the &quot;Monday Night War&quot;, another boom of mainstream professional wrestling. He headlined WCW&#x27;s annual flagship event Starrcade three times (1994, 1996 and 1997) in which Starrcade 1997 was the most profitable WCW pay-per-view in the company&#x27;s history.

Hogan returned to the WWF in 2002 following its acquisition of WCW the prior year, winning the Undisputed WWF Championship for his record equaling (for the time) sixth reign before departing in 2003. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, and inducted a second time in 2020 as a member of the nWo. Hogan also performed for the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he headlined the inaugural AWA closed circuit supercard, Super Sunday in 1983, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) – where he was the inaugural winner of the original IWGP Heavyweight Championship – and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

During and after wrestling, Hogan had an extensive acting career, beginning with his 1982 role in &quot;Rocky III&quot;. He has starred in several films (including &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;, &quot;Suburban Commando&quot; and &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot;) and three television shows (&quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;, and &quot;China, IL&quot;), as well as in Right Guard commercials and the video game, &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Main Event&quot;. He was the frontman for The Wrestling Boot Band, whose sole record, &quot;Hulk Rules&quot;, reached 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Kid Audio chart in 1995.

== Early life ==
Hogan was born in Augusta, Georgia, on August 11, 1953, the son of construction foreman Pietro &quot;Peter&quot; Bollea (December 6, 1913 – December 18, 2001) and homemaker and dance teacher Ruth V. (&quot;née&quot; Moody; 1922 – January 1, 2011). Bollea is of Italian, Panamanian, Scottish, and French descent; his paternal grandfather also named Pietro was born in 1886 in Cigliano, Province of Vercelli. Bollea had an older brother named Allan (1947–1986) who died at the age of 38 from a drug overdose. When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Hogan attended Robinson High School. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered Dusty Rhodes, and he regularly attended cards at the Tampa Sportatorium. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first noticed Superstar Billy Graham and began looking to him for inspiration; since he first saw Graham on TV, Hogan wanted to match his &quot;inhuman&quot; look.

Hogan was also a musician, spending a decade playing fretless bass guitar in several Florida-based rock bands. He went on to study at Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, he dropped out of the University of South Florida. Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976. The band soon became popular in the Tampa Bay region. During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector&#x27;s Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region.

Impressed by Hogan&#x27;s physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsudathe man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)to make him a potential trainee. In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Hogan eventually agreed. At first, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. After Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that he was going to be a wrestler, Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers&#x27; request. During the first session in training, Matsuda broke Hogan&#x27;s leg. After 10 weeks of rehab, Hogan returned to train with Matsuda and blocked him when he tried to break his leg again.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years (1977–1979) ===
In mid-1977, after training for more than a year with Matsuda, the Brisco brothers dropped by Matsuda&#x27;s gym to see Hogan. During this visit, Jack Brisco handed Hogan a pair of wrestling boots and informed him that he was scheduled to wrestle his first match the following week. In his professional wrestling debut, Eddie Graham booked him against Brian Blair in Fort Myers, Florida, on August 10, 1977, in CWF. A short time later, Hogan donned a mask and assumed the persona of &quot;The Super Destroyer&quot;, a hooded character first played by Don Jardine and subsequently used by other wrestlers.

Hogan eventually could no longer work with Hiro Matsuda, whom he felt was an overbearing trainer, and left CWF. After declining an offer to wrestle for the Kansas City circuit, Hogan took a hiatus from wrestling and managed The Anchor club, a private club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, for a man named Whitey Bridges. Eventually, Whitey and Hogan became close friends, and opened a gym together; the gym became known as Whitey and Terry&#x27;s Olympic gym.

Soon after, Hogan&#x27;s friend Ed Leslie (later known as Brutus Beefcake) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry&#x27;s Olympic Gym. In his spare time, he and Leslie worked out in the gym together, and eventually Beefcake developed a muscular physique. Hogan was impressed by Beefcake&#x27;s physical stature and became convinced that the two of them should wrestle together as tag team partners. Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet&#x27;s Alabama territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.

In Alabama, Hogan and Leslie wrestled as Terry and Ed Boulder, known as The Boulder Brothers. These early matches prompted a rumor among wrestling fans (who were not aware of the inner workings of the wrestling business) that the two really were brothers, as few people actually knew their real names outside of immediate friends, family, and the various promoters the two worked for. After wrestling a show for Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Jerry Jarrett, the promoter for the CWA, approached Hogan and Leslie and offered them a job in his promotion for $800 a week; this was far more than the $175 a week they would make working for Tillet. Hogan and Leslie accepted this offer and left Tillet&#x27;s territory.

During his time in Memphis, Hogan appeared on a local talk show, where he sat beside Lou Ferrigno, star of the television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. The host commented on how Hogan, who stood 6 ft 7 in (201 cm) and weighed 295 pounds with 24-inch biceps, actually dwarfed &quot;The Hulk&quot;. Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles. As a result, Hogan began performing as Terry &quot;The Hulk&quot; Boulder and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.

On December 1, 1979, Hogan won his first professional wrestling championship, the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division), recognized in Alabama and Tennessee, when he defeated Bob Roop in Knoxville, Tennessee. He dropped it in January 1980 to Bob Armstrong. He briefly wrestled in the Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) territory from September through December 1979 as Sterling Golden.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1981) ===

In the fall of 1979, former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Terry Funk introduced Bollea to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) owner/promoter Vincent J. McMahon, who was impressed with his charisma and physical stature. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave him the last name Hogan, and also wanted him to dye his hair red. Bollea claims his hair was already beginning to fall out by that time, and he refused to dye it, simply replying, &quot;I&#x27;ll be a blond Irish&quot;. Bollea wrestled his first match in the WWF under the ring name &quot;Hulk Hogan&quot; by defeating Harry Valdez on the November 17 episode of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;. He made his first appearance at Madison Square Garden on December 17, 1979, defeating Ted DiBiase after a bearhug. After the match, Hogan thanked DiBiase for putting him over and told him that he &quot;owed him one&quot;, a favor he repaid during DiBiase&#x27;s second run with the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s as &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot;. McMahon gave Hogan former tag team champion Tony Altomare as chaperone and guide. At this time, Hogan wrestled Bob Backlund for the WWF Championship, and he started his first big feud with André the Giant, which culminated in a match with André at Shea Stadium in August 1980. During his initial run as a villain in the WWF, Hogan was paired with &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie, himself a villainous wrestler-turned-manager.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1980–1985) ===

In 1980, Hogan began appearing in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) where Japanese wrestling fans nicknamed him . Hogan first appeared on May 13, 1980, while he was still with the WWF. He occasionally toured the country over the next few years, facing a wide variety of opponents ranging from Tatsumi Fujinami to Abdullah the Butcher. When competing in Japan, Hogan used a vastly different repertoire of wrestling moves, relying on more technical, traditional wrestling holds and maneuvers as opposed to the power-based, brawling style American fans became accustomed to seeing from him. In addition, Hogan used the &quot;Axe Bomber&quot;, a crooked arm lariat, as his finisher in Japan instead of the running leg drop that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental Championship on March 26, 1981. On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) tournament winner and the first holder of an early version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, defeating Antonio Inoki by knockout in the finals of a ten-man tournament. Since then, this championship was defended annually against the winner of the IWGP League of the year until it was replaced by current IWGP Heavyweight Championship, that is defended regularly.
Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the MSG (Madison Square Garden) Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to wrestle Inoki to defend the early version of the IWGP title after that Inoki won in the finals of the IWGP League, becoming the new No. 1 contender to the championship. Hogan lost the match and title belt by countout, thanks to interference from Riki Choshu. Hogan also defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Seiji Sakaguchi and Fujinami, among others, until ending his tour in Nagoya on June 13 losing to Inoki via count-out in a championship match for the early version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Hogan was the only challenger in the history of that title that didn&#x27;t win the tournament to become the No. 1 contender to the championship.

=== American Wrestling Association (1981–1983) ===
After accepting an offer to work on the film &quot;Rocky III&quot; (a decision Vincent J. McMahon disapproved of and subsequently chose to release Hogan from the promotion for), Hogan made his debut in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), owned by Verne Gagne, in August 1981. Hogan started his AWA run as a villain, with &quot;Luscious&quot; Johnny Valiant as his manager. This did not last long, however, as the AWA fans fell in love with Hogan&#x27;s presence and Hogan became the top fan favorite of the AWA, battling the Heenan Family and Nick Bockwinkel.

Hogan&#x27;s turn as a fan favorite came at the end of July 1981, when during a television taping that aired in August, Jerry Blackwell, after suffering a pinfall loss to Brad Rheingans, began beating down Rheingans and easily fighting off anyone who tried to run in for the save. Hogan ran in, got the upper hand and ran Blackwell from the ring. Hogan was eventually victorious in his feud with Blackwell and by the end of 1981, gained his first title matches against Bockwinkel.

In March 1982, Hogan defeated Bockwinkel and his manager Bobby Heenan in a non-title handicap match in the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois. Hogan went on to repeatedly challenge Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, with the matches generally ending in disqualifications (a decision wherein the Championship does not change hands). In April 1982, Hogan defeated Bockwinkel and was declared the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion, only for the decision to be overturned by AWA President Stanley Blackburn due to the use of a foreign object during the match.

Hogan left the AWA in November 1983.

=== Return to WWF (1983–1993) ===
==== Rise of Hulkamania (1983–1984) ====
After purchasing the company from his father in 1982, Vincent K. McMahon had plans to expand the territory into a nationwide promotion, and he handpicked Hogan to be the company&#x27;s showpiece attraction due to his charisma and name recognition. Hogan made his return at a television taping in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 27, 1983, defeating Bill Dixon.

On the January 7, 1984, episode of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, Hogan confirmed his fan favorite status (for any WWF fans unaware of his late 1981 babyface turn) by saving Bob Backlund from a three-way assault by the Wild Samoans. Hogan&#x27;s turn was explained simply by Backlund: &quot;He&#x27;s changed his ways. He&#x27;s a great man. He&#x27;s told me he&#x27;s not gonna have Blassie around&quot;. The storyline shortcut was necessary because less than three weeks later on January 23, Hogan won his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship, pinning The Iron Sheik (who had Blassie in his corner) in Madison Square Garden. The storyline accompanying the victory was that Hogan was a &quot;last minute&quot; replacement for the Sheik&#x27;s original opponent Bob Backlund, and became the champion by way of being the first man to escape the camel clutch (the Iron Sheik&#x27;s finishing move).

Immediately after the title win, commentator Gorilla Monsoon proclaimed: &quot;Hulkamania is here!&quot;. Hogan frequently referred to his fans as &quot;Hulkamaniacs&quot; in his interviews and introduced his three &quot;demandments&quot;: training, saying prayers, and eating vitamins. Eventually, a fourth demandment (believing in oneself) was added during his feud with Earthquake in 1990. Hogan&#x27;s ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him ritualistically ripping his shirt off his body, flexing, and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan&#x27;s matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been booked as unstoppable monsters, using a format which became near-routine: He delivered steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. After being hit with his opponent&#x27;s finishing move, he got a sudden second wind, fighting back while &quot;feeding&quot; off the energy of the audience, becoming impervious to attack a process described as &quot;Hulking up&quot;. His signature maneuvers pointing at the opponent (later accompanied by a loud &quot;you!&quot; from the audience), shaking his finger to scold him, three punches, an Irish whip, the big boot and running leg drop – followed, ensuring victory. That finishing sequence occasionally changed depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with &quot;giant&quot; wrestlers, the sequence might involve a body slam.

In 1984, similarities between Hogan&#x27;s character and that of The Incredible Hulk led to a quitclaim deal between Titan Sports, Marvel Comics and himself wherein Marvel obtained the trademarks &quot;Hulk Hogan&quot;, &quot;Hulkster&quot; and &quot;Hulkamania&quot; for 20 years, and Titan agreed to no longer refer to him as &quot;incredible&quot; nor simply &quot;Hulk&quot; or ever dress him in purple or green. Marvel also subsequently received .9% of reportable gross merchandise revenue associated with Hogan, $100 for each of his matches and 10% of Titan&#x27;s portion of his other earnings under this name (or 10% of the earnings, if Titan held no interest). This extended to WCW, whose parent company Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner in 1996 and became sister companies with Marvel rival DC Comics. (As Hogan was well underway with the nWo storyline under the &quot;Hollywood Hogan&quot; ring name at the time, this avoided Time Warner the awkward situation of paying Marvel the rights to the name while owning its chief rival.) In a story in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Comics Presents #45&quot;, a wrestler resembling Hogan was tossed through an arena roof by The Incredible Hulk, because he &quot;picked the wrong name.&quot;

==== International renown (1985–1988) ====
Over the next year, Hogan became the face of professional wrestling as McMahon pushed the WWF into a pop culture enterprise with The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection on MTV, drawing record houses, pay-per-view buyrates, and television ratings in the process. The centerpiece attraction for the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985, Hogan teamed with legit friend, TV and movie star Mr. T to defeat his archrival &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and &quot;Mr Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff when &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton, who had been in the corner of Piper and Orndorff, accidentally caused his team&#x27;s defeat by knocking out Orndorff after he jumped from the top turnbuckle and hit him in the back of the head with his arm cast in a shot meant for Hogan. On &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event I&quot;, Hogan successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Orton in a match that Hogan won by disqualification.

Hogan was named the most requested celebrity of the 1980s for the Make-a-Wish Foundation children&#x27;s charity. He was featured on the covers of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (the first and , only professional wrestler to do so), &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and &quot;People&quot; magazines, while also appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and having his own CBS Saturday morning cartoon titled &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;. Hogan, as the premier WWF icon, headlined seven of the first eight WrestleMania events. He also co-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 30, 1985, during this lucrative run. AT&amp;T reported that the 900 number information line he ran while with the WWF was the single biggest 900 number from 1991 to 1993. Hogan continued to run a 900 number after joining World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

On &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event II&quot;, he successfully defended the title against Nikolai Volkoff in a flag match. He met long-time rival Roddy Piper in a WWF title match at the Wrestling Classic pay-per-view (PPV) event. Hogan retained the title by disqualification after Bob Orton interfered and hit Hogan with his cast. Hogan had many challengers in the way as the new year began. Throughout 1986, Hogan made successful title defenses against challengers such as Terry Funk, Don Muraco, King Kong Bundy (in a steel cage match at WrestleMania 2), Paul Orndorff, and Hercules Hernandez.
In the fall of 1986, Hogan occasionally wrestled in tag team matches with The Machines as Hulk Machine under a mask copied from NJPW&#x27;s gimmick &quot;Super Strong Machine&quot;. At WrestleMania III in 1987, Hogan was booked to defend the title against André the Giant, who had been the sport&#x27;s premier star and was pushed as undefeated for the previous fifteen years. A new storyline was introduced in early 1987; Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three consecutive years. André the Giant, who was Hogan&#x27;s good friend, came out to congratulate him. Shortly afterward, André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being &quot;undefeated in the WWF for 15 years&quot;. Hogan came out to congratulate André, who walked out in the midst of Hogan&#x27;s speech. Then, on an edition of &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, Hogan was confronted by Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, who announced that André was his new protégé, and Andre challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant. During the match, Hogan hit a body slam on the 520-pound André (which was dubbed &quot;the bodyslam heard around the world&quot;) and won the match after a leg drop.

==== The Mega Powers (1988–1989) ====
Hulk Hogan vs Big Boss Man on March 7, 1989, at the El Paso Civic Center for a video-taping of a WWF &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; event.
Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, Hogan finally lost the title to André on &quot;The Main Event I&quot; after a convoluted scam involving &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match&#x27;s appointed referee). After André delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan&#x27;s left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, André handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and André were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop André interfering which helped &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.

Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (André the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick&#x27;s Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man.
In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his &quot;War Bonnet&quot;, a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE&#x27;s online comedy series &quot;Are You Serious?&quot; in 2012.

The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage&#x27;s burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on &quot;The Main Event II&quot;, when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage. After ensuring Elizabeth was all right, Hogan returned to the ring and begged Savage to tag him in. Savage, in a fury, grabbed Hogan&#x27;s outstretched hand with one hand, and slapped him across the face with the other before leaving the ring. Hogan eventually won the match by himself. After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a feud between the two. Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V.

==== Final WWF Championship reigns (1989–1993) ====
Hogan&#x27;s second run in 1989 lasted a year, during which he defended the title in two matches against Savage in April that he lost both times by count-out, before defeating The Big Boss Man in a steel cage match on the &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXI&quot;, which was aired on May 27. In May on &quot;WWF on NESN&quot;, Hogan retained the title by losing once again by count-out against Savage. This was also the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was referred to as such during a televised title defense, as Hogan&#x27;s next successful title defense against The Honky Tonk Man on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXII&quot; saw the title being renamed and referred simply as the WWF Championship. Also during Hogan&#x27;s second reign as champion, he starred in the movie &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;, which was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan&#x27;s co-star Tom Lister, Jr., who appeared at wrestling events as his movie character, Zeus (an &quot;unstoppable monster&quot; who was jealous over Hogan&#x27;s higher billing and wanted revenge). Hogan easily beat Zeus in a series of matches across the country during late 1989, beginning with a tag team match at SummerSlam, in which Hogan and Brutus Beefcake topped Zeus and Savage. Hogan and Zeus met at the Survivor Series, where the &quot;Hulkamaniacs&quot; faced the &quot;Million Dollar Team&quot;; in the early part of the match, Hogan put Zeus over by hitting him with everything to no effect. Zeus then manhandled Hogan and shoved referee Dave Hebner down twice, with the second shove prompting Hebner to disqualify Zeus from the match. Hogan and Beefcake then defeated Zeus and Savage in a rematch at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view to end the feud. Hogan also had defeated Savage to retain the WWF Championship in their official WrestleMania rematch on October 10, at United Kingdom show First WWF UK Event at London Arena. During his second reign as the WWF Champion, Hogan won the 1990 Royal Rumble match, before losing to Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior in a title versus title match at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990.

Hogan soon became embroiled in a heated feud with the 468-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan&#x27;s ribs in a sneak attack on &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot; in May 1990. On television, announcers explained that both Hogan&#x27;s injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit that he wanted to retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a &quot;thank you&quot;). Hogan returned by SummerSlam, and he dominated Earthquake for several months in a series of matches across the country. His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe prompted Hogan to add a fourth demandment—believing in yourself—and he also became known as &quot;The Immortal&quot; Hulk Hogan. Hogan became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row, as he won the 1991 Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania VII, Hogan stood up for the United States against Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him for his third WWF Championship, and then defeating him again in the rematch at United Kingdom-only pay-per-view UK Rampage at London Arena. In the fall of 1991, Hogan was challenged by Ric Flair, the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who recently arrived in the WWF. The challenge went unmet, as Hogan lost the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at Survivor Series. Jack Tunney immediately granted Hogan a rematch at This Tuesday in Texas six days later, which Hogan won. Flair had interfered in both matches and due to the resulting controversy, the championship was again declared vacant. It was decided that the winner of the 1992 Royal Rumble match would also be declared the new WWF Champion. Hogan entered in the #26 spot, but failed to regain the championship as he was eliminated by friend Sid Justice. In turn, Hogan 
helped cause Sid&#x27;s elimination, leaving Flair (who had entered the match as the 3rd entrant) as the winner and new WWF Champion. Hogan and Sid patched things up and teamed together on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot; against Flair and Undertaker, but during the match Sid abandoned Hogan, starting their feud. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid&#x27;s manager Harvey Wippleman. Hogan was then attacked by Papa Shango and was saved by the returning Ultimate Warrior.

At this time, news sources began to allege that Dr. George Zahorian III, a doctor for the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, had been selling steroids illegally to wrestlers in general and Hogan in particular. Hogan appeared on an episode of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; to deny the allegations. Due to intense public scrutiny, Hogan took a leave of absence from the company. Hogan returned to the WWF in February 1993, helping out his friend Brutus Beefcake in his feud with Money Inc. (Irwin R. Schyster and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase), and officially renaming themselves The Mega-Maniacs, taking on Money Inc.&#x27;s former manager &quot;The Mouth of the South&quot; Jimmy Hart (a long-time friend of Hogan&#x27;s outside of wrestling) as their manager in what was the first time WWF audiences had seen Hart as a fan favorite. At WrestleMania IX, Hogan and Beefcake took on Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship, a match the Mega-Maniacs lost via disqualification. Hogan went into the match injured (he had a cut above his left eyebrow, and the left eye itself was fully black). The WWF used Hogan&#x27;s injury in a storyline that had DiBiase allegedly paying a group of thugs in a failed attempt to take Hogan out before WrestleMania. Later that night, Hogan won his fifth WWF Championship by pinning Yokozuna in an impromptu match only moments after Yokozuna had defeated Bret Hart for the championship. Hogan reportedly used his influence to have the finish of WrestleMania changed the weekend of the event so he would be champion during an upcoming international and de facto farewell tour.

At the first annual King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 13, Hogan defended the WWF Championship in a rematch against Yokozuna. This was Hogan&#x27;s first and only title defense since defeating Yokozuna at WrestleMania IX. Yokozuna kicked out of Hogan&#x27;s signature leg drop and scored the pinfall win after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by a &quot;Japanese photographer&quot; (actually a disguised Harvey Wippleman). The victorious Yokozuna proceeded to give Hogan a &quot;Banzai Drop&quot;. This was Hogan&#x27;s last WWF pay-per-view appearance until 2002, as both he and Jimmy Hart were preparing to leave the promotion. Hogan continued his feud on the international house show circuit with Yokozuna until August 1993. After that, Hogan sat out the rest of his contract which expired later that year.

=== Return to NJPW (1993–1994) ===
On May 3, 1993, Hogan returned to NJPW as WWF Champion and defeated IWGP Heavyweight Champion The Great Muta in a dream match at Wrestling Dontaku. Hogan wrestled against Muta again, this time under his real name (Keiji Mutoh), on September 26, 1993. Hogan also wrestled The Hell Raisers with Muta and Masahiro Chono as his tag team partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994, at Battlefield, when he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1994–2000) ===

==== World Heavyweight Champion (1994–1996) ====

Starting in March 1994, Hogan began making appearances on WCW television, as interviewer Gene Okerlund—who was now a WCW employee—visited him on the set of &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; episodes. Hype then built over whether Hogan should remain with &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; or join WCW and have an opportunity to wrestle Ric Flair. On the May 28, 1994, episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, Hogan tore up his &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; contract and stated he was now willing to quit the show and return to wrestling, and Okerlund issued a telephone survey asking if people wanted to see Hogan in WCW. On June 11, 1994, Hogan officially signed with Ted Turner&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in a ceremony that was held at Disney-MGM Studios. The next month, with Jimmy Hart as his manager, Hogan won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in his debut match, defeating Ric Flair in a &quot;dream match&quot; at Bash at the Beach. Hogan continued his feud with Flair (who defeated him by count-out on the &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVIII&quot;, thus Hogan retained the title), which culminated in a steel cage match (with Flair&#x27;s career on the line and Mr. T as the special guest referee) that Hogan won.

After Hogan headlined WCW&#x27;s premier annual event Starrcade (Starrcade: Triple Threat) in December 1994 by defeating The Butcher for the title, his next feud was against Vader, who challenged him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at SuperBrawl V, where Hogan won by disqualification after the returning Flair&#x27;s interference. Hogan then defeated Vader (who was managed part-time by Flair) in a non-title leather strap match at Uncensored. Because of the controversial ending caused once again by Flair at Uncensored, Hogan&#x27;s feud with Vader culminated in a steel cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Bash at the Beach, where Hogan won by escaping the cage. After successfully retaining the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Big Bubba Rogers and Lex Luger in two separate matches on &quot;Nitro&quot; in September 1995. The October 9, 1995, broadcast of &quot;Nitro&quot; was Hogan&#x27;s first appearance in an all-black attire. Hogan feuded with The Dungeon of Doom, which led to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl where Hogan&#x27;s team (Lex Luger, Randy Savage, and Sting) won. Hogan&#x27;s reign as WCW World Heavyweight Champion (which, at 469 days, is the longest in the title&#x27;s history) ended when he lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to The Giant at Halloween Havoc via disqualification.

Following the controversial loss (which was due to a &quot;contract clause&quot;), the WCW World Heavyweight Championship became vacant and a new champion was to be crowned in a 60-man three-ring battle royal at World War III, where The Giant cost Hogan the title. This led to a steel cage match between Hogan and The Giant at SuperBrawl VI, where Hogan won to end their feud. In early 1996, Hogan reformed The Mega Powers with Randy Savage to feud with The Alliance to End Hulkamania, which culminated at Uncensored in a Doomsday Cage match that Hogan and Savage won. After coming out victorious from his feuds, Hogan began to only appear occasionally on WCW programming.

==== New World Order (1996–1999) ====

At Bash at the Beach on July 7, during a six-man tag team match pitting The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) against WCW loyalists, Hogan interfered and attacked Randy Savage on behalf of Hall and Nash, thereby turning heel for the first time in nearly fifteen years. After the match, Hogan delivered a promo, accosting the fans and WCW for under-appreciating his talent and drawing power, and announcing the formation of the New World Order (nWo). The new stable gained prominence in the following weeks and months. Hogan grew a beard alongside his famous mustache and dyed it black, traded his red and yellow garb in for black and white clothing, often detailed with lightning bolts, and renamed himself &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan (often shortened to Hollywood Hogan). Hogan won his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Hog Wild on August 10 by defeating The Giant for the title. He spray painted &quot;nWo&quot; across the title belt, scribbled across the nameplate, and referred to the title as the &quot;nWo title&quot;. Hogan then started a feud with Lex Luger after Luger and The Giant defeated Hogan and Dennis Rodman in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach on July 13, 1997.

On the August 4 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hogan lost the title to Lex Luger by submission. Five days later at Road Wild on August 9, Hogan defeated Luger to regain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan then lost the title to Sting in a match at Starrcade on December 28. In the match, WCW&#x27;s newly contracted Bret Hart accused referee Nick Patrick of fast-counting a victory for Hogan and had the match restarted – with himself as referee. Sting later won by submission. After a rematch the following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, where Sting controversially retained the title, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship became vacant. Sting went on to win the vacant title against Hogan at SuperBrawl VIII on February 22, 1998, and Hogan then developed a rivalry with former friend (and recent nWo recruit) Randy Savage, who had just cost Hogan the title match at SuperBrawl by hitting him with a spray can. The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Uncensored on March 15, which ended in a no contest. Savage took the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Sting at Spring Stampede on April 19, while Hogan teamed with Kevin Nash to take on Roddy Piper and The Giant in the first-ever bat match.

Hogan betrayed Nash by hitting him with the bat and then challenged Savage the following night on &quot;Nitro&quot; for the world title. In the no disqualification match for Savage&#x27;s newly won title, Nash entered the ring and hit a powerbomb on Hogan as retribution for the attack the previous night, but Bret Hart interfered moments later and jumped in to attack Savage and preserve the victory for Hogan, who won his fourth WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Nash&#x27;s attack on him signified a split of the nWo into two separate factions – Hogan&#x27;s became nWo Hollywood and Nash&#x27;s became nWo Wolfpac that feuded with each other for the remainder of the year. Hogan defended the title until July of that year, when WCW booked him in a match against newcomer and then WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Goldberg, who had yet to lose a match in WCW. Late in the match, Hogan was distracted by Karl Malone, and Goldberg pinned Hogan to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the July 6 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

Hogan spent the rest of 1998 wrestling celebrity matches: his second tag team match with Dennis Rodman pitted them against Diamond Dallas Page and Karl Malone at Bash at the Beach on July 12, and at Road Wild on August 8 he and Eric Bischoff lost to Page and Jay Leno thanks to interference from Kevin Eubanks. Hogan also had a critically panned rematch with The Warrior at Halloween Havoc on October 25, where his nephew Horace aided his victory.

On the Thanksgiving episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Hogan officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling, as well as his candidacy for President of the United States. Campaign footage aired on &quot;Nitro&quot; of Hogan and Bischoff holding a press conference, making it appear legitimate. Both announcements were false and made as publicity stunts to draw some of the hype of Jesse Ventura&#x27;s Minnesota gubernatorial win back to him. After some time off from WCW, Hogan returned on the January 4, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; to challenge Kevin Nash for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship which Hogan won for the fifth time, but many people found the title change to be &quot;scandalous&quot;. As a result, the warring factions of the nWo reunited into one group, which began feuding with Goldberg and The Four Horsemen.

==== Final years in WCW (1999–2000) ====
Hogan lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Ric Flair at Uncensored in a steel cage First Blood match. Later, Hogan was severely injured in a Texas tornado match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship featuring him, Diamond Dallas Page, Flair, and Sting at Spring Stampede. On the July 12 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hogan made his return as a face for the first time in three years and accepted an open challenge from Savage, who had won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Bash at the Beach the night before in a tag team match by pinning Kevin Nash. Thanks to interference from Nash, Hogan defeated Savage to win his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Nash turned on him the next week, and the two began a feud that lasted until Road Wild.

On August 9, 1999, Hogan started the night dressed in the typical black and white, but after a backstage scene with his son came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main event six-man tag team match. Hogan then defeated Nash in a retirement match at Road Wild to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Injuries and frustrations mounted, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book &quot;Hollywood Hulk Hogan&quot;, Hogan said that he was asked to take time off by newly hired head of creative booking Vince Russo and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at Halloween Havoc, Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan came to the ring in street clothes, lay down for the pin, and left the ring.
Soon after his return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was involved in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan that he was going to have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett&#x27;s chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, &quot;Is this your idea, Russo? That&#x27;s why this company is in the damn shape it&#x27;s in, because of bullshit like this!&quot; After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming this would be the last time fans would ever see &quot;that piece of shit&quot; in a WCW stadium. This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the &quot;creative control&quot; clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan could control what would happen with his own character, without anyone else telling him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, &quot;That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [Hogan] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!&quot;. Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.

As a result, Hogan filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Russo soon after, which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims the whole thing was a work, and Hogan claims that Russo made it a shoot. Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan&#x27;s side of the story when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the belt was a work (devised by Bischoff rather than Russo), and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan. It was the last time he was seen in WCW.

=== Post-WCW endeavors (2001) ===
In the months following the eventual demise of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees in order for him to wrestle again. As a test, Hogan worked a match in Orlando, Florida on November 14, for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF) promotion run by his longtime manager Jimmy Hart. Hogan defeated Curt Hennig in this match and felt healthy enough to accept an offer to return to the WWF in February 2002.

=== Second return to WWF/WWE (2002–2003) ===

At No Way Out on February 17, 2002, Hogan returned to the WWF as a heel. Returning as leader of the original nWo with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, the three got into a confrontation with The Rock and cost Stone Cold Steve Austin a chance at becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion against Chris Jericho in the main event. The nWo feuded with both Austin and The Rock, and Hogan accepted The Rock&#x27;s challenge to a match at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, where Hogan asked Hall and Nash not to interfere, wanting to defeat The Rock by himself. Despite the fact that Hogan was supposed to be the heel in the match, the crowd cheered for him heavily. The Rock cleanly won the contest, and befriended Hogan at the end of the bout, helping him fight off Hall and Nash, who were upset by Hogan&#x27;s conciliatory attitude. After the match, Hogan turned face by siding with The Rock, though he continued wearing black and white tights for a few weeks after WrestleMania X8 until he resumed wearing his signature red and yellow tights. During this period, the &quot;Hulk Rules&quot; logo of the 1980s was redone with the text &quot;Hulk Still Rules&quot;, and Hogan also wore the original &quot;Hulk Rules&quot; attire twelve years earlier, when he headlined WrestleMania VI at the same arena, in the SkyDome. For a time, he was still known as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan, notably keeping the Hollywood Hogan style blond mustache with black beard while wearing Hulkamania-like red and yellow tights and using the &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; entrance theme music he&#x27;d used in WCW. On the April 4, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hogan began a feud with Triple H, and then defeated Triple H for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash on April 21, thus becoming the last ever WWF Champion, as a legal battle with the World Wildlife Fund soon compelled the company to change its name from World Wrestling Federation/WWF to World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE in May 2002.

On May 19 at Judgment Day, Hogan lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to The Undertaker. After losing a number one contender match for the WWE Undisputed Championship to Triple H on the June 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hogan began feuding with Kurt Angle resulting in a match between the two at the King of the Ring on June 23, which Angle won by submission. On the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hogan teamed with Edge to defeat Billy and Chuck and capture the WWE Tag Team Championship for the first time. They celebrated by waving the American flag as the overjoyed audience sang along to Hogan&#x27;s theme song &quot;Real American&quot;. They lost the belts to The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm) at Vengeance on July 21. In August, Hogan was used in an angle with Brock Lesnar, culminating in a main event singles match on the August 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which Lesnar won by technical submission (the match was called after Hogan became unconscious from a bear hug hold). Lesnar became only the second WWE wrestler to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), and the first to defeat Hogan by having the match called. Following the match, Lesnar continued to beat on Hogan, leaving him bloody and unconscious in the ring.
As a result of Lesnar&#x27;s assault, Hogan went on hiatus until early 2003, shaving off his black beard and dropping &quot;Hollywood&quot; from his name in his return. Hogan battled The Rock (who had turned heel) once again at No Way Out on February 23 and lost and defeated Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania XIX on March 30 in a street fight billed as &quot;twenty years in the making&quot;. After WrestleMania, he had a run as the masked Mr. America, a character who, despite sounding and behaving like Hogan, consistently denied he was the Hulkster. Mr. America used Hogan&#x27;s &quot;Real American&quot; as his entrance theme, as well as all of Hogan&#x27;s signature gestures, moves, and phrases. He was the subject of a storyline that took place after Hogan was forced by Mr. McMahon to sit out the rest of his contract. A WWE pre-debut push took place with mysterious Mr. America promos airing for weeks during &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. There was also on-screen discussion on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; between then General Manager Stephanie McMahon and other players concerning her hiring Mr. America &quot;sight unseen&quot;. On May 1, Mr. America debuted on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on a &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment. McMahon appeared and claimed that Mr. America was Hogan in disguise; Mr. America shot back by saying, &quot;I am not Hulk Hogan, brother!&quot; (lampooning Hogan&#x27;s use of &quot;brother&quot; in his promos). The feud continued through the month of May, with a singles match between Mr. America and Hogan&#x27;s old rival &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper at Judgment Day on May 18, a match Mr. America won.

Mr. America&#x27;s last WWE appearance was on the June 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when Big Show and The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After &quot;SmackDown!&quot; went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his finger to his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and &quot;fired&quot; him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon terminated Hogan&#x27;s contract in storyline.

=== Second return to NJPW (2003) ===
Hogan returned to NJPW in October 2003, when he defeated Masahiro Chono at Ultimate Crush II in the Tokyo Dome.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003) ===
Shortly after Hogan left WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in Jeff Jarrett, co-founder of TNA and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan in October 2003. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA&#x27;s first three-hour pay-per-view. Due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA. Still, the incident has been shown several times on TNA broadcasts, and was included in the TNA DVD &quot;TNA&#x27;s Fifty Greatest Moments&quot;.

=== Third return to WWE (2005–2007) ===
On April 2, 2005, Hogan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2005 by actor and friend Sylvester Stallone. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Hogan came out to rescue Eugene, who was being attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Khosrow Daivari. The build-up to Hogan&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction and preparation for his WrestleMania angle was shown on the first season of &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels approached &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but told Michaels if he found a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hogan to team with him. On the April 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, saving Michaels and accepting his offer. At Backlash on May 1, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels.

Hogan then appeared on July 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as the special guest of Carlito on his talk-show segment &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Cabana&quot;. After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke, Hogan attacked Carlito. Kurt Angle then also appeared, making comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan, who was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle, but was saved by Shawn Michaels. Later that night, Michaels and Hogan defeated Carlito and Angle in a tag team match; during the post-match celebration, Michaels performed the &quot;Sweet Chin Music&quot; on Hogan and walked off. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels appeared on &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; and challenged Hogan to face him one-on-one for the first time. Hogan appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; one week later and accepted the challenge. The match took place at SummerSlam on August 21, which Hogan won. After the match, Michaels extended his hand to him, telling him that he &quot;had to find out for himself&quot;, and Hogan and Michaels shook hands as Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd.

Prior to WrestleMania 22 in April 2006, Hogan inducted friend and former announcer &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006. Hogan returned on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIII&quot; with his daughter Brooke. During the show, Randy Orton flirted with Brooke and later attacked Hogan in the parking lot. He later challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam on August 20, which Hogan won. This was Hulk Hogan&#x27;s final match wrestling for the WWE, although he had negotiations for a match against John Cena at WrestleMania 25 which ultimately fell through.

=== Memphis Wrestling (2007–2008) ===

After a brief fall out with McMahon and WWE, Hogan was lured to Memphis Wrestling with the proposal of wrestling Jerry Lawler. The match had been promoted on &quot;Memphis Wrestling Prime Time&quot; for several months. On April 12, 2007, Lawler announced in a news conference that WWE had barred him from wrestling Hogan on the basis that NBC performers (including Lawler, on the basis of co-hosting the NBC-owned USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; and his appearances on the biannual WWE&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;) are contractually prohibited from appearing on VH1, the channel on which &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot; airs. The situation resulted in a lawsuit being filed against WWE by event promoter Corey Maclin. Lawler was replaced with Paul Wight. Hogan defeated Wight at Memphis Wrestling&#x27;s PMG Clash of Legends on April 27, 2007, when he picked up and hit a body slam on Wight before pinning him following his signature running leg drop.

=== Hulkamania: Let the Battle Begin (2009) ===

On November 21, 24, 26 and 28, Hogan performed with a group of wrestlers including Spartan-3000, Heidenreich, Eugene, Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake and Orlando Jordan across Australia in a tour titled . The main event of each show was a rematch between Hogan and Ric Flair – the wrestler who defeated Hogan more times than any other. Hogan defeated Flair in all four matches.

=== Return to TNA (2009–2013) ===

==== Dixie Carter&#x27;s business partner (2009–2010) ====
On October 27, 2009, it was announced that Hogan had signed a contract to join TNA on a full-time basis. The footage of his signing and the press conference at Madison Square Garden following it were featured on the October 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

On December 5, Hogan announced on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; that he would make his official TNA debut on January 4, 2010, in a special live three-hour Monday night episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; to compete with WWE&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; (which featured the return of Bret Hart).

On the January 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hogan debuted, reuniting briefly with former nWo partners Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman, the latter two of whom made their returns to the company. He refused to join them for a full-fledged reunion of their group claiming, &quot;it&#x27;s a different time&quot;, and stuck to his business relations with Bischoff, who made his appearance to declare that, the two of them would &quot;flip the company upside down&quot; and everyone would have to earn their spot. Hogan also encountered TNA founder Jeff Jarrett on the broadcast, appearing via video wall and interrupting Jarrett&#x27;s company success speech, stating that Carter was instrumental to the company&#x27;s survival, and that just like the rest, Jarrett would have to earn his spot in TNA.

On the February 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hogan took Abyss under his wing, and during this sequence, gave him his Hall of Fame ring and claimed it would make him a &quot;god of wrestling&quot;. Hogan made his in-ring return on the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, teaming with Abyss to defeat A.J. Styles and Ric Flair when Abyss scored a pinfall over Styles. Afterward, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Hogan and Abyss from a beatdown by Styles, Flair and Desmond Wolfe. The storyline became a Team Flair versus Team Hogan situation, with Jarrett and the debuting Rob Van Dam joining Team Hogan and Beer Money (James Storm and Robert Roode) and Sting joining Team Flair. At Lockdown on April 18, Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) in a Lethal Lockdown match.

==== Immortal (2010–2011) ====
On the June 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hogan&#x27;s alliance with Abyss came to an abrupt end when Abyss turned heel. Abyss later claimed that he was controlled by some entity that was coming to TNA. The next month, Hogan worked with Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Hogan and Bischoff were up to something. During this time, Abyss went on a rampage, attacking Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and eventually put his hands on TNA president Dixie Carter, which led to her signing the paperwork, presented by Bischoff, that would have Abyss fired from TNA following his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory on October 10. Hogan was set to wrestle with Jarrett and Joe against Sting, Nash and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero at Bound for Glory, but was forced to miss the event due to a back surgery. He made an appearance at the end of the event, and helped Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship and aligning himself with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett, turning heel in the process. On the October 14 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff&#x27;s and Hogan&#x27;s new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Ric Flair&#x27;s Fortune. Dixie Carter returned on the November 25 episode of &quot;Reaction&quot;, informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. During his absence, Hogan underwent a potentially career–ending spinal fusion surgery on December 21.

Hogan returned to TNA on the March 3, 2011, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, declaring himself as the new owner of TNA, having won the court battle against Dixie Carter. In April, he began hinting at a possible return to the ring to face the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Sting. On the May 12 episode of the newly renamed &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan lost control of the program to Mick Foley, who revealed himself as the Network consultant who had been causing problems for Immortal ever since Hogan and Bischoff took over the company. This angle was cut short three weeks later, when Foley left TNA. During the following months, Hogan continued to interfere in Sting&#x27;s matches, costing him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship first at Hardcore Justice on August 7, recruiting Kurt Angle to Immortal in the process, on the September 1 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; and finally at No Surrender on September 11. On the September 15 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Sting defeated Immortal member Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory on October 16. On October 4, it was reported that Hogan had signed a contract extension with TNA. After feigning retirement from professional wrestling, Hogan accepted the match at Bound for Glory on the October 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, while also agreeing to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting win the match.

Hogan was defeated by Sting at Bound for Glory, ending his storyline as the president of TNA. After the match, Immortal attacked Sting, but Hogan turned on Immortal and helping Sting, turning face in the process. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan, wearing his trademark yellow and red again, admitted to his mistakes, and put over Sting for winning.

==== Feud with Aces &amp; Eights (2012–2013) ====

During TNA&#x27;s tour of the United Kingdom, on January 26 and 27, 2012, Hogan returned to the ring at house shows in Nottingham and Manchester, where he, James Storm and Sting defeated Bobby Roode, Bully Ray and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag team main event at both events, the latter of which was Hogan&#x27;s final match. Hogan returned to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; on February 2, when he was revealed as Garett Bischoff&#x27;s trainer. On the March 29 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan returned and accepted Sting&#x27;s offer to replace him as the new General Manager.

In July, Hogan, alongside Sting, began feuding with a mysterious group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the &quot;Aces &amp; Eights&quot;. The group&#x27;s attack on Hogan on the July 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; was used to write Hogan off television as he was set to undergo another back surgery.

In November, Hogan moved into a storyline with Bully Ray after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between Ray and Hogan&#x27;s daughter Brooke. After seeing them kissing in a parking garage on the December 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan suspended Ray indefinitely on the January 3, 2013 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, after Ray saved Brooke from a kidnapping by the Aces &amp; Eights, Brooke accepted his marriage proposal. Despite Hogan&#x27;s disapproval, he still walked Brooke down the aisle for her wedding on the next episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, during which Ray&#x27;s groomsmen Taz interrupted and revealed himself as a member of the Aces &amp; Eights, leading the group to attack Hogan, Ray, and the rest of the groomsmen.

=== Fourth return to WWE (2014–2015) ===

On February 24, 2014, on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hogan made his first WWE in-ring appearance since December 2007 to hype the WWE Network. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hogan came out to introduce the guest appearances of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joe Manganiello; this was to promote the guests&#x27; new movie &quot;Sabotage&quot;.
At WrestleMania XXX in April, Hogan served as the host, coming out at the start of the show to hype up the crowd. During his promo, he mistakenly referred to the Superdome, the venue the event was being held at, as the Silverdome, which became the subject of jokes throughout the night. Hogan was later joined by Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, and they finished their promo by drinking beer together in the ring. Later in the show, Hogan shared a moment with Mr. T, Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper, with whom he main-evented the first WrestleMania.
On February 27, 2015, Hogan was honored at Madison Square Garden during a WWE live event dubbed &quot;Hulk Hogan Appreciation Night&quot; with a special commemorative banner hanging from the rafters, honoring his wrestling career and historic matches he had in the arena.

On the March 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hogan along with Snoop Dogg confronted Curtis Axel – who at the time had been &quot;borrowing&quot; Hogan&#x27;s Hulkamania gimmick with Axel referring to himself as &quot;AxelMania&quot;. On March 28, the night before WrestleMania, Hogan posthumously inducted longtime partner and rival &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015. The next night at WrestleMania 31, Hogan reunited with Hall and Nash to reform the nWo, appearing in Sting&#x27;s corner in his match against Triple H, who himself was joined by D-Generation X (DX) members Billy Gunn, X-Pac, Road Dogg, and Shawn Michaels.

==== Racism scandal and departure ====

In July 2015, &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and Radar Online publicized an anti-black rant made by Hogan on a leaked sex tape recorded in 2007. In the recording, he is heard expressing disgust with the notion of his daughter dating a black man, referenced by repeated use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot;. Hogan also admitted to being &quot;a racist, to a point&quot;.

Once the recordings went public erupting in a media scandal, Hogan apologized for the remarks, which he said is &quot;language that is offensive and inconsistent with [his] own beliefs.&quot; Three black wrestlers who worked in the WWF and WCW with Hogan made supportive comments. Virgil commented &quot;Hogan has never given me a reason to believe he is a racist&quot; while Dennis Rodman said he &quot;most certainly is not a racist&quot; and Kamala added &quot;I do not think Hogan meant harm by saying that. Hogan is my brother until he decides not to be.&quot; Black wrestlers working in the WWE made different comments. Mark Henry said he was pleased by WWE&#x27;s &quot;no tolerance approach to racism&quot; response, and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan&#x27;s manner and tone. Booker T said he was shocked and called the statements unfortunate.

On July 24, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan, stating that they are &quot;committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds,&quot; although Hogan&#x27;s lawyer said Hogan chose to resign. A day prior, WWE removed almost all references to Hogan from their website, including his listing as a judge for &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, his merchandise from WWE Shop, and his entry from its WWE Hall of Fame page (he was still listed in the Hall of Fame entry of the official WWE encyclopedia released in October 2016). His DLC appearance from &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; was taken down from sale, and his character was cut from then upcoming &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; game during development.

In response to the controversy, Mattel stopped producing Hogan action figures, while Hogan&#x27;s merchandise was taken down from online stores of Target, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and Walmart. On July 28, Radar Online reported that Hogan had also used homophobic slurs on the leaked sex tape. Days later, it was reported that Hogan had used racist language in a 2008 call to his then-imprisoned son, Nick, and also said that he hoped they would not be reincarnated as black males.

Hogan gave an interview with &quot;ABC&quot; on August 31 in which he pleaded forgiveness for his racist comments, attributing these to a racial bias inherited from his neighborhood while growing up. Hogan claimed that the term &quot;nigger&quot; was used liberally among friends in Tampa; former neighbors disputed this claim.

In the time that followed, numerous African-Americans associated with wrestling expressed some level of support for Hogan including: The Rock, Dennis Rodman, Booker T, Kamala, Virgil, Mr. T, Mark Henry, Big E, and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero, who stressed his forgiveness of Hogan, whom he saw as having made a &quot;positive mark on humanity&quot; for over three decades.

=== Fifth return to WWE (2018–present) ===
On July 15, 2018, Hogan was reinstated into the WWE Hall of Fame.

=== Legacy ===
Hogan has been described as one of the largest attractions in professional wrestling history and a major reason why Vince McMahon&#x27;s expansion of his promotion worked. Wrestling historian and journalist Dave Meltzer stated that &quot;...You can&#x27;t possibly overrate his significance in the history of the business. And he sold more tickets to wrestling shows than any man who ever lived&quot;. Hogan&#x27;s match with Andre the Giant at The Main Event on February 5, 1988, holds American television records for a wrestling audience with a 15.2 Nielsen rating and 33 million viewers. IMDb ranked Hogan as the biggest draw in professional wrestling history, ranking him number 1 in a list with 60 other wrestlers.

In a 2022 survey, Hogan was the most often cited professional wrestler by those in the general public who could name a professional wrestler.

Fellow wrestler Cody Rhodes has said numerous times that Hogan&#x27;s WrestleMania X8 match with The Rock is the greatest match in wrestling history and that it epitomized what professional wrestling is.

Fellow WWE Hall of Fame member Bret Hart has been repeatedly critical of Hogan&#x27;s wrestling abilities, including in 2021 saying that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know a headlock from a headlamp&quot;, and that he was &quot;very limited&quot;. Hart had previously referred to Hogan as a &quot;hero&quot; to fans. and previously complimented Hogan&#x27;s look. &quot;You look at Hulk Hogan, okay? Unbelievable look, 6&#x27;8″ with the 24-inch pythons, it&#x27;s an incredible [look]. When he walks in the room, the whole room stops. Like, you see it. He [has] got, like, legs stuck on his shoulders. His arms are as big as somebody&#x27;s legs.

Former writer Vince Russo, who Hogan had previously sued, said in 2022 that more wrestlers should wrestle like Hogan, as opposed to the modern-day style acrobats.

Hogan himself has previously said he is &quot;number two&quot; behind Ric Flair, who he said is the greatest wrestler of all time.

Chris Jericho said on his podcast in 2023 that Hogan was a better worker than Flair in his experience. &quot;Hogan is a better worker than Flair. For me. I always had amazing matches with Hogan because he knew exactly who he was as a babyface, as a heel, whatever. He was so great. He knew his audience. He didn&#x27;t do anything he didn&#x27;t have to. It was one of my favorite times in my career.&quot;

On February 20, 2019, it was announced that Chris Hemsworth would portray him in a biopic, directed by Todd Phillips. However, in 2024, Phillips announced the movie has been scrapped.

However, there is no direct evidence to support this claim. Instead, Hogan endorsed a blender, known as the Hulk Hogan Thunder Mixer. He has since endorsed a grill known as &quot;The Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill&quot;, voluntarily recalled as a fire hazard in 2008 along with other QVC and Tristar grills.

== Personal life ==
=== Legal issues ===

==== Belzer lawsuit ====

On March 27, 1985, just days prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, Richard Belzer requested on his cable TV talk show &quot;Hot Properties&quot; that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified Guillotine choke, which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. On the October 20, 2006 broadcasting of the &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge Show&quot;, it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.

==== Testimony in McMahon trial ====

In 1994, Hogan, having received immunity from prosecution, testified in the trial of Vince McMahon relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician George T. Zahorian III. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used anabolic steroids since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither sold him the drugs nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government&#x27;s case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.

==== Gawker lawsuit ====

In April 2012, a sex tape between Hogan and Heather Clem, the estranged wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge, emerged online. On October 4, 2012, Gawker released a short clip of the video. In the video, Bubba can be heard saying that the couple can &quot;do their thing&quot; and he will be in his office. At the end of the video, he can also be heard telling Heather, &quot;If we ever need to retire, here is our ticket&quot;. Hogan later told Howard Stern on his satellite radio show that, &quot;it was a bad choice and a very low point&quot; and &quot;I was with some friends and made a wrong choice. It has devastated me, I have never been this hurt&quot;. On October 15, 2012, Hogan filed a lawsuit against Bubba and Heather Clem for invading his privacy. A settlement with Bubba was announced on October 29, 2012. Clem publicly apologized to Hogan. In December 2012, a federal court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, found that Gawker&#x27;s publication of the video snippet did not violate U.S. copyright law. Hogan then joined Gawker in the ongoing action against Heather Clem in state court in Florida, alleging invasion of privacy, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking $100 million in damages.

On October 1, 2015, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that a Florida Judge granted Hogan access to Gawker&#x27;s computer system for a forensic expert to search Gawker&#x27;s computers and office.

Hogan sued Gawker for $100 million for defamation, loss of privacy, and emotional pain, and on March 18, 2016, was awarded $115 million. Also, on August 11, 2016, a Florida judge gave Hogan control of the assets of A.J. Daulerio, former Gawker editor-in-chief, who was involved in the posting of Hogan&#x27;s sex tape.

Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel helped Hogan to finance his lawsuit against Gawker Media.

On November 2, 2016, Gawker reached a $31 million settlement with Hogan.

=== Past fabrications ===
Hogan has been accused multiple times of fabricating elements of his past, including that he was one of the last people to see Kerry Von Erich prior to his death, that an experience with a terminally ill child through the Make-A-Wish Foundation at SummerSlam in 1992 inspired the songs on his &quot;Hulk Rules&quot; album (despite the fact that he never made an appearance at the event and was not working for the WWF at the time), that he was scouted by MLB teams prior to having suffered an elbow injury, that he played in the Little League World Series and finished with a batting average of .714 (despite Little League Baseball having no record of him having played at any of those events), that The Undertaker injured his neck at the Survivor Series in 1991, that Elvis Presley was a fan of his (despite having died two years before Hogan&#x27;s debut), that both The Rolling Stones and Metallica wanted him to play bass for their bands, that André the Giant weighed over 600 pounds at the time of their match at WrestleMania III, and that he was offered the starring role in the film &quot;The Wrestler&quot; but turned it down. During an appearance on Bubba the Love Sponge, Hogan claimed to have a 10-inch penis. During the Gawker trial, he admitted in court that this was not true, claiming he was speaking as the character Hulk Hogan, and not as Terry Bollea.

=== Family ===

On December 18, 1983, Hogan married Linda Claridge. They have a daughter Brooke (born May 5, 1988) and a son Nick (born July 27, 1990). Hogan made his personal life the centerpiece of the television show &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;, which included his wife and two children.

According to an interview in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, Christiane Plante claimed that Hogan had an affair with her in 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. Plante was 33 years old at the time and had worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album.

On November 20, 2007, Linda filed for divorce in Pinellas County, Florida. In November 2008, Linda claimed to the public that she made the decision to end her marriage after finding out about Hogan&#x27;s affair. In his 2009 autobiography, Hogan acknowledged that Linda on numerous occasions suspected he was having infidelities whenever he developed friendships with other women, but denied allegations that he ever cheated on her. Hogan only retained around 30% of the couple&#x27;s liquid assets totaling around $10 million in the divorce settlement. Hogan considered committing suicide after the divorce and credits Laila Ali, his co-star on &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, with preventing him from doing so.

Hulk Hogan began a relationship with Jennifer McDaniel in early 2008. The two were engaged in November 2009 and married on December 14, 2010, in Clearwater, Florida. On February 28, 2022, Hogan stated on Twitter that he and McDaniel divorced.

Hogan became engaged to yoga instructor Sky Daily in July 2023, proposing to her at actor Corin Nemec&#x27;s wedding reception. They married on September 22, 2023.

===Religious beliefs===
In 2007, he has spoken about his faith in his life saying, &quot;[I&#x27;ve] leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted Christ as my savior. He died on the cross and paid for my sins[...] I could have went the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road&quot;.

On December 20, 2023, he was baptized at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Florida.

=== Health ===
Hogan has suffered numerous health problems, particularly with his back since retiring as a wrestler following the years of heavy weight-training and jolting as a wrestler.

In January 2013, Hogan filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, citing that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen &quot;unnecessary and ineffective&quot; spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. After the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Hogan underwent traditional spinal fusion surgery in December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements without his permission.

== Awards and honors ==
Hogan was honored as the 2008 King of the Krewe of Bacchus, a New Orleans carnival organization. Hogan visited the Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Orleans and rode in the parade where he threw doubloons with his likeness. Hogan received the honor in part because meeting Hogan is one of the most requested &quot;wishes&quot; of the terminally ill children benefited by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Hogan was inducted in the Boys and Girls Club Alumni Hall of Fame on May 3, 2018.

<doc id="301776" wikidata="Q346411" url="?curid=301776" title="Michael Landon">
<text>Michael Landon (born Eugene Maurice Orowitz; October 31, 1936 – July 1, 1991) was an American actor and filmmaker. He is known for his roles as Little Joe Cartwright in &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–1973), Charles Ingalls in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; (1974–1983), and Jonathan Smith in &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; (1984–1989). Landon appeared on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; 22 times, second only to Lucille Ball.

==Early life==
Landon was born Eugene Maurice Orowitz on October 31, 1936, in Forest Hills, a neighborhood of Queens, New York. His parents were Kathleen &quot;Peggy&quot; (née O&#x27;Neill; a dancer and comedian) and Eli Maurice Orowitz. His father was Jewish, and his mother was Roman Catholic. Eugene was the Orowitz family&#x27;s second child; their daughter, Evelyn, was born three years earlier, in 1933. In 1941, when Landon was 4, he and his family moved to the borough of Collingswood, New Jersey. He attended, and celebrated his &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; at Temple Beth Sholom. His family recalls that Landon &quot;went through a lot of hassle studying for the big event, which included bicycling to a nearby town every day in order to learn how to read Hebrew and recite prayers.&quot;

During his childhood, Landon was constantly worrying about his mother attempting suicide. He reported that on a family beach vacation, his mother tried to drown herself, but Landon rescued her. Shortly after the attempt, his mother acted as if nothing happened, and a few minutes later, he vomited. He said that it was the worst experience of his life. Stress overload from the suicide attempts of his mother caused Landon to battle the childhood problem of bedwetting, which was reported in the unauthorized biography &quot;Michael Landon: His Triumph and Tragedy&quot;. His mother put his wet sheets on display outside his window for all to see. He ran home every day and tried to remove them before his classmates could see. Some of these experiences were incorporated into his semi-autobiographical television movie, &quot;The Loneliest Runner&quot;, which he wrote, produced and directed.
Landon attended Collingswood High School and was an excellent javelin thrower, with his toss in 1954 being the longest throw by a high schooler in the United States that year. This earned him an athletic scholarship to the University of Southern California, but he subsequently tore his shoulder ligaments, putting an end to his days as a college athlete and as a student. Landon considered show business and served as an attendant at a service gas station opposite the studios of Warner Bros. He was eventually noticed by Bob Raison, a local agent. Following advice, Landon changed his surname, selecting a new one from a phone book.

==Career==
===Early work===
Landon&#x27;s first starring appearance was on the television series &quot;Telephone Time&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Mystery of Casper Hauser&quot; (1956) as the title character. Other parts came: movie roles in &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; (1957), &quot;Maracaibo&quot; (1958), &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Legend of Tom Dooley&quot; (1959), as well as many roles on television, such as &quot;Crossroads&quot; (three episodes), &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; (pilot episode aired on &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;), &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot; (in &quot;Human Bomb&quot;), &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot; (as Don Sayers in &quot;The Champ&quot;), &quot;Crusader&quot;, &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (in &quot;End of a Young Gun&quot;, 1958), &quot;The Adventures of Jim Bowie&quot;, &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;, &quot;Wire Service&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The Court of Last Resort&quot;, &quot;State Trooper&quot; (two episodes), &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; (three episodes), &quot;The Texan&quot; (in the 1958 episode &quot;The Hemp Tree&quot;), &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot; (in the episodes &quot;The Man From Brewster&quot;, with John Carradine and &quot;Rose of the Rio Bravo&quot;, with Kathleen Nolan), &quot;Trackdown&quot; (two 1958 episodes), and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, starring Steve McQueen (in episodes &quot;The Martin Poster&quot;, 1958, and &quot;The Legend&quot;, 1959). Landon also appeared in at least 2 episodes of &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theater&quot; including &quot;Gift from a Gunman&quot; in 1957 and &quot;Living is a Lonely Thing&quot; in 1959. Landon can be seen in two uncredited speaking roles as a cavalry trooper in a 1956 episode of the ABC/Warner Bros. television series &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, an episode titled &quot;Decision.&quot; Two years later, Landon returned to that same series as White Hawk in &quot;The White Warrior&quot;.

===&quot;Bonanza&quot;===

In 1959, at the age of 22, Landon began his first starring TV role as Little Joe Cartwright on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, one of the first TV series to be broadcast in color. Also starring on the show were Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, and Dan Blocker. During &quot;Bonanza&quot;″s sixth season (1964–1965), the show topped the Nielsen ratings and remained number one for three years.

Receiving more fan mail than any other cast member, Landon negotiated with executive producer David Dortort and NBC to write and direct some episodes. In 1962, Landon wrote his first script. In 1968, Landon directed his first episode. In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed Little Joe&#x27;s September 1972 two-hour wedding episode (&quot;Forever&quot;) as one of TV&#x27;s most memorable specials. Landon&#x27;s script recalled Little Joe&#x27;s brother, Hoss, who was initially the story&#x27;s groom, before Dan Blocker&#x27;s death. During the final season, the ratings declined, and NBC canceled &quot;Bonanza&quot; in November 1972. The last episode aired on January 16, 1973. Along with Lorne Greene and Victor Sen Yung, Landon appeared in all 14 seasons of the series. Landon was loyal to many of his &quot;Bonanza&quot; associates including producer Kent McCray, director William F. Claxton, and composer David Rose, who remained with him throughout &quot;Bonanza&quot; as well as &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;.

===&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;===

The year after &quot;Bonanza&quot; was canceled, Landon went on to star as Charles Ingalls in the pilot of what became another successful television series, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, again for NBC. The show was taken from a 1935 book written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose character in the show was played by 9-year-old actress Melissa Gilbert. In addition to Gilbert, two other unknown actresses also starred on the show: Melissa Sue Anderson, who appeared as Mary Ingalls, the oldest daughter in the Ingalls family, and Karen Grassle as Charles&#x27; wife, Caroline. Landon served as executive producer, writer, and director of &quot;Little House&quot;. The show was nominated for several Emmy and Golden Globe awards. After eight seasons, &quot;Little House&quot; was retooled by NBC in 1982 as &quot;Little House: A New Beginning&quot;, which focused on the Wilder family and the Walnut Grove community. Though Landon remained the show&#x27;s executive producer, director and writer, &quot;A New Beginning&quot; did not feature Charles and Caroline Ingalls. &quot;A New Beginning&quot; was actually the final chapter of &quot;Little House&quot;, as the series ended in 1983. The following year, three made-for-television movies aired.

In a 2015 interview, Gilbert said of Landon &quot;He gave me so much advice...the overall idea that he pounded into me, from a little girl, into my brain was that nothing&#x27;s more important than &#x27;Home &amp; Family&#x27;; no success, no career, no achievements, no accomplishments, nothing&#x27;s more important than loving the people you love and contributing to a community. Though we were working, really, really hard, we were &#x27;Not Saving The World&#x27;, one episode of television at a time, we&#x27;re just entertaining people and there are more important things to do... and have fun; no matter what.&quot;

===&quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;===
After producing both &quot;Little House&quot; and later the &quot;Father Murphy&quot; TV series, Landon starred in another successful program. In &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, he played a probationary angel (who named himself Jonathan Smith) whose job was to help people in order to earn his wings. His co-star on the show was Victor French (who had previously co-starred on Landon&#x27;s &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;) as ex-cop Mark Gordon. On &quot;Highway&quot;, Landon served as executive producer, writer, and director. &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; was the only show throughout his long career in television that he owned outright.

By 1985, prior to hiring his son, Michael Landon Jr., as a member of his camera crew, he also brought real-life cancer patients and disabled people to the set. His decision to work with disabled people led him to hire a couple of adults with disabilities to write episodes for &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;.

By season four, &quot;Highway&quot; dropped out of the Nielsen top 30, and in June 1988, NBC announced that the series would return for an abbreviated fifth season, which would be its last. Its final episodes were filmed in the fall of 1988. One aired in October, two in December, one in March 1989, and the remainder aired on Fridays from June to August. French did not live to see &quot;Highway&quot; series finale broadcast; he died of advanced lung cancer on June 15, 1989, two months after it was diagnosed. Landon invited his youngest daughter, Jennifer Landon, to take part in the final episode.

===Other projects===

In 1972, he was among the guests in David Winters&#x27; musical television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;, starring Tom Jones and Jennifer O&#x27;Neill.

In 1973, Landon was an episode director and writer for the short-lived NBC romantic anthology series &quot;Love Story&quot;. In 1982, he co-produced an NBC &quot;true story&quot; television movie, &quot;Love Is Forever&quot;, starring himself and Laura Gemser (who was credited as Moira Chen), about Australian photojournalist John Everingham&#x27;s successful attempt to scuba dive under the Mekong to rescue his lover from communist-ruled Laos in 1977. The real Everingham was cast as an extra in the film, which also marked the acting debut of Priscilla Presley.

&quot;Sam&#x27;s Son&quot; was a 1984 coming-of-age feature film written and directed by Landon and loosely based on his early life. The film stars Timothy Patrick Murphy, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Hallie Todd, and James Karen. Karen previously worked for Landon in the made-for-television film &quot;Little House: The Last Farewell&quot;.

He was a guest of the PBS television series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

After the cancellation of &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; and before his move to CBS, Landon wrote and directed the teleplay &quot;Where Pigeons Go to Die&quot;. Based on a novel of the same name, the film starred Art Carney and was nominated for two Emmy awards.

Up through the run of &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, all of Landon&#x27;s television programs were broadcast on NBC, a relationship which lasted 30 consecutive years with the network. After the cancellation of &quot;Highway&quot; and due to a fallout with those within NBC&#x27;s upper management, he moved to CBS and in 1991 starred in a two-hour pilot called &quot;Us&quot;. &quot;Us&quot; was meant to be another series for Landon but, with his diagnosis on April 5 of pancreatic cancer, the show never aired beyond the pilot. Also during the 1990–91 season, Landon appeared as host of the CBS special &quot;America&#x27;s Missing Children&quot;, which explored actual cases of missing children that were under investigation. This special was, as well, being considered as the pilot for a new series. He appeared as a celebrity panelist on the premiere week of &quot;Match Game &quot;on CBS.

===Singing===
Landon also had a singing career, of the teen idol type.

In 1957, Candlelight Records released a Michael Landon single &quot;Gimme a Little Kiss (Will &quot;Ya&quot; Huh)&quot;/ &quot;Be Patient With Me&quot; during the height of his notoriety for his role in the film &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;. Some copies show the artist credited as the &quot;Teenage Werewolf&quot; rather than as Michael Landon. In 1962, both the A- and B-side of the record were re-released on the Fono-Graf label that included a picture sleeve of Landon&#x27;s then-current role on &quot;Bonanza&quot; as Little Joe Cartwright.

In March 1964, RCA Victor Records released another Landon single, &quot;Linda Is Lonesome&quot;/&quot;Without You&quot;. All of Landon&#x27;s singles have since been issued on compact disc by Bear Family Records as part of a &quot;Bonanza&quot; various artists compilation.

Landon sang on television, on the &quot;Dean Martin Show,&quot; &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, and other venues, and also sang live on stage at theatrical venues (sometimes with a holster and gun strapped to his hip).

==Personal life==
Landon was married three times and was a father to nine children (three of whom were adopted):
* Dodie Levy-Fraser (married 1956; divorced 1962)
** Mark Fraser Landon (adopted; Dodie&#x27;s biological son (in 1956 aged 11) 
** Josh Fraser Landon (adopted as infant)
* Marjorie Lynn Noe (married 1963; divorced 1982) 
** Cheryl Lynn Landon (born Cheryl Ann Pontrelli), Lynn&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage; she was nine when her mother and Landon married.
** Leslie Ann Landon 
** Michael Landon Jr.
** Shawna Leigh Landon
** Christopher Beau Landon
* Cindy Clerico (married 1983), a makeup artist on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;
** Jennifer Rachel Landon
** Sean Matthew Landon

In February 1959, Landon&#x27;s father died from a heart attack.

In 1973, his eldest daughter, Cheryl, and three others were involved in a serious car collision just outside Tucson, Arizona, while Cheryl was a student at the University of Arizona. She was the sole survivor. She was hospitalized with serious injuries and remained in a coma for days.

Landon&#x27;s mother, Peggy, died in March 1981.

Landon admitted to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker.

Landon said in an interview with The Associated Press &quot;I believe in God, I believe in family, I believe in truth between people, I believe in the power of love, I believe that we really are created in God’s image, that there is God in all of us.&quot;

A 1985 profile in &quot;People&quot; described him as a conservative who was close to Ronald Reagan. In a 1991 interview, he criticized political polarization and political correctness in America. In 1990 he supported a pro-environmentalist proposition in California.

==Illness and death==

Landon began to suffer from a severe headache while he was on a skiing vacation in Utah. Three days later, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which had begun to impact the tissues and blood vessels around his pancreas. The cancer was inoperable and terminal. Landon said that he believed his smoking and drinking had caused his pancreatic cancer, and that he had tried to quit smoking after co-star Victor French died of lung cancer.

He appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; to speak about the cancer and condemn the tabloid press for its sensational headlines and inaccurate stories, including the claim that he and his wife were trying to conceive another child. During his appearance, Landon pledged to fight the disease and asked his fans to pray for him. Twelve days after his appearance on the show, he underwent successful surgery for a life-threatening blood clot in his left leg. In June, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine after granting the periodical an exclusive private interview about his life, his family, and his struggle to live.

On July 1, 1991, at age 54, Landon died in Malibu, California, at 1:20 p.m., with his wife at his bedside. Landon was interred in a private family mausoleum at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, in Culver City, California. Landon&#x27;s headstone reads &quot;He seized life with joy. He gave to life generously. He leaves a legacy of love and laughter.&quot; His adopted son Mark, who died in May 2009, is also interred there.

==Legacy==

A community building at Malibu&#x27;s Bluffs Park was named &quot;The Michael Landon Center&quot; following the actor&#x27;s death. Landon&#x27;s son, Michael Jr., produced a memorial special called &quot;Michael Landon: Memories with Laughter and Love,&quot; featuring the actor&#x27;s family, friends and co-stars: &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-star David Canary said that one word that described Landon was &quot;fearless&quot; in his dealings with network brass. Melissa Gilbert, who played his daughter on &quot;Little House&quot;, said that the actor made her feel &quot;incredibly safe&quot; and that he was &quot;paternal&quot;. Often cited on the special was Landon&#x27;s bizarre sense of humor, which included having toads leap from his mouth and dressing as a superhero to visit a pizza parlor.

In 1991, during Landon&#x27;s final &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, Johnny Carson related how the actor took him back to a restaurant the two had dined at previously. Carson had been led to believe he accidentally ran over the owner&#x27;s cat in the parking lot during their first visit. When sitting down to eat the second time, Carson discovered that Landon had helped create a fake menu of dinner items featuring cat metaphors.

A made-for-TV movie, &quot;Michael Landon, the Father I Knew&quot;, co-written and directed by his son Michael Jr., aired on CBS in May 1999. John Schneider starred in the title role as Michael Landon, with Cheryl Ladd as Lynn Noe and Joel Berti as Michael Landon Jr. The biopic detailed, from Michael Jr.&#x27;s point of view, the personal emotional trauma he endured during his parents&#x27; divorce and his father&#x27;s premature death. The movie spanned a timeline from the 1960s through the early 1990s.

A plaque and small playground referred to as the &quot;Little Treehouse on the Prairie&quot; was erected in Knight Park, a central park in Landon&#x27;s hometown of Collingswood. In 2011, the plaque was removed from the park by the borough and was later given to a local newspaper by an unnamed person. According to the Collingswood, NJ, website, the plaque was removed during a fall cleanup with plans to return it to a safer location. The plaque was reinstated next to a bench in a safer location the following summer.

In 2021, Karen Grassle, Landon&#x27;s co-star on &quot;Little House&quot;, published her memoir, &quot;Bright Lights, Prairie Dust: Reflections on Life, Loss, and Love by House&#x27;s Ma&quot;. In the book, Grassle detailed the troubled relationship she had with Landon, citing derogatory remarks he made about her while on the set of &quot;Little House&quot;, often with other members of the cast and crew present. Grassle subsequently &quot;mended fences&quot; with Landon prior to his death in 1991 from pancreatic cancer.

Landon allegedly damaged a motel room wall during a 1962 stay while headlining the local county fair in Neligh, Nebraska. The room, now called the Michael Landon Suite, remains largely unchanged, and the plaque beside the hole commemorates the incident.

<doc id="301778" wikidata="Q1127677" url="?curid=301778" title="Prumnopitys taxifolia">
<text>Prumnopitys taxifolia, the mataī () or black pine, is an endemic New Zealand coniferous tree that grows on the North Island and South Island. It also occurs on Stewart Island / Rakiura (47 °S) but is uncommon there.

It grows up to 40 m high, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter. The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 10–15 mm long and 1.5–2 mm broad. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 3–4 cm long bearing 1–6 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, 10–15 mm long, violet-purple with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by the New Zealand pigeon (kererū), which eats the &#x27;berries&#x27; and passes the seeds in its droppings.

==Classification==
The scientific name &quot;taxifolia&quot; derives from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the yew (&quot;Taxus&quot;). In the past the species, like the other species of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;, was often included in &quot;Podocarpus&quot;; in this species under the name &quot;Podocarpus spicatus&quot;. It is distinguished from &quot;Prumnopitys ferruginea&quot; (miro) by the shorter, more slender leaves and the globose violet-purple cones.

==Juvenile state==
 Unlike the related miro (&quot;Prumnopitys ferruginea&quot;), mataī has a distinctive and long-lasting juvenile stage. The juvenile is a shrub with a tangle of slender, flexible, divaricating branchlets interspersed with a scattering of brown, pale yellow, or dirty white leaves. After a number of years, the adult tree begins to grow out of the top of the juvenile shrub and then the divaricating branchlets will wither and drop off.

==Ecology==

Mataī are the host plant for caterpillars of the New Zealand endemic moth species &quot;Pyrgotis zygiana&quot;. The seeds of this tree also play host to another endemic moth, &quot;Heterocrossa iophaea.&quot;

==Use==
The timber of this tree was used extensively in New Zealand for flooring during the mid-20th century. Mataī is not threatened, although as a forest-type it has been greatly reduced through widespread logging. Very few intact examples of mataī-dominated forest remain.

<doc id="301780" wikidata="Q881267" url="?curid=301780" title="Harvey Parnell">
<text>Harvey Parnell (February 28, 1880 – January 16, 1936) was an American farmer and politician from Southeast Arkansas. Parnell served in the Arkansas General Assembly for eight years, first in the Arkansas House of Representatives, and later serving a term in the Arkansas Senate. Following the re-establishment of the lieutenant governor position, Parnell won the statewide election and served under Governor John Martineau. When Martineau resigned to take a federal judgeship in March 1928, Parnell was elevated to become the state&#x27;s 29th governor, a position he would hold until 1933. Early in his time as governor, Parnell was responsible for Progressive reforms popular with rural voters, including expansion and modernization of the highway system and public school reform. But as the Dust Bowl and Great Depression ravaged the Arkansas economy, Parnell&#x27;s programs were blamed for bankrupting the state, and his popularity plummeted. He left politics after his second full gubernatorial term ended in January 1933.

==Biography==
Parnell was born in Orlando in Cleveland County in South Arkansas. Parnell attended public schools and graduated from Warren High School in Warren, Arkansas. After graduation, he worked as a bookkeeper and store clerk and farmed in Chicot County in Southeast Arkansas.

==Early career==
Elected in 1918, Parnell was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1919 to 1921. In 1922, Parnell was elected to the Arkansas Senate, representing Ashley and Chicot counties.

In 1927, he assumed the post of Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas and the next year was elevated to the office of governor when John Ellis Martineau resigned to become a federal judge.

==Governor==

===First term===
Entering the 1928 gubernatorial election, Parnell sought a term as governor in his own right. Parnell defeated future U.S. Representative Brooks Hays of Little Rock in the Democratic primary. Parnell easily defeated Republican challenger Drew Bowers, 77.3 to 22.7 percent. Bowers, an attorney from Pocahontas, had also been the GOP gubernatorial nominee in 1926, when he was defeated by Martineau by a similar margin.

===Second term===

Parnell sought a second term in 1930, an election usually assured to faithful Arkansas politicians in this era. Parnell again defeated Hays in the 1930 Democratic Primary. He also fended off a challenge from Lee Cazort, who had resigned as lieutenant governor to challenge Parnell in the primary, though he withdrew and supported Cazort before the primary was held. In the 1930 gubernatorial election, Parnell defeated the Republican J. O. Livesay, a district judge from Foreman in Little River County in Southwest Arkansas. Livesay had lost a Republican race for the United States House of Representatives in 1912 from Arkansas&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

The Republicans ran a newspaper advertisement prior to the 1930 general election in which it claimed the Democrats had given Arkansas &quot;Inefficiency, wanton waste, coercive machine rule, and government for private gain at public expense.&quot; The GOP pledged instead a &quot;clean business administration, substantial tax reductions, honest audits, law enforcement, industrial leadership, and real statesmanship.&quot; The notice pleaded with voters to &quot;go to the polls and vote for Arkansas instead of self-seeking politicians.&quot; Livesay also had a running-mate for lieutenant governor, C. H. Harding, a Pennsylvania native who was the president of the Fort Smith Building and Loan Association in Fort Smith.

Osro Cobb of Montgomery County, the only Republican member of the Arkansas House at the time, did not seek a third two-year term but managed Livesay&#x27;s race against Parnell. Livesay finished with only 18.8 percent of the vote. Cobb noted that Republicans at the time had no representation on Arkansas election boards and were not guaranteed precinct watcher positions. Therefore, he considered Livesay&#x27;s small vote &quot;suspect,&quot; meaning it could have been larger had there been a way to check for fraud. Six years later, in 1936, Cobb was himself his party&#x27;s unsuccessful gubernatorial nominee against the Democrat Carl Bailey.

===Legacy===
The Parnell administration focused on establishing a state highway fund, creating a Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and upgrading the school system. Henderson State Teachers College in Arkadelphia was also created under Parnell. Parnell himself was a consistent supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage and appointed Hattie Caraway to the United States Senate. Caraway would later win election for the office and become the first woman elected to the Senate.

Many Arkansans blamed Parnell for their situation as the Great Depression began, and he left office in 1933 to return to farming. He later worked for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for three years.

==Death==
Harvey Parnell died in Little Rock and is interred at Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Trivia==
The singer-songwriter Johnny Cash was born in Kingsland, Arkansas on February 26, 1932, during Parnell&#x27;s term as governor.

<doc id="301782" wikidata="Q4043323" url="?curid=301782" title="M-expression">
<text>In computer programming, M-expressions (or meta-expressions) were an early proposed syntax for the Lisp programming language, inspired by contemporary languages such as Fortran and ALGOL. The notation was never implemented into the language and, as such, it was never finalized.

M-expressions are a syntax for LISP code and provide function notation, syntax for a form and for embedded literal data (via S-expressions) into programs. Thus M-Expressions used S-Expressions for literal data. The syntax for S-Expressions (&quot;The Data Language&quot;) and M-Expressions (&quot;The Meta Language&quot;) is defined on pages 8 and 9 of the Lisp 1.5 manual.

M-Expressions also had a corresponding S-Expression representation. Code was manually translated from M-Expressions to S-Expressions. The in M-expressions embedded literal data, then had to be quoted in S-Expressions.

The M-Expression form

 append[listvar;(PARIS BERLIN NEWYORK TOKYO)]

then needs to be transformed to the S-Expression form

 (APPEND LISTVAR (QUOTE (PARIS BERLIN NEWYORK TOKYO)))

==Background==
John McCarthy published the first paper on Lisp in 1960 while a research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In it he described a language of symbolic expressions (S-expressions) that could represent complex structures as lists. Then he defined a set of primitive operations on the S-expressions, and a language of meta-expressions (M-expressions) that could be used to define more complex operations. Finally, he showed how the meta-language itself could be represented with S-expressions, resulting in a system that was potentially self-hosting. The draft version of this paper is known as &quot;AI Memo 8&quot;.

McCarthy had planned to develop an automatic Lisp compiler (LISP 2) using M-expressions as the language syntax and S-expressions to describe the compiler&#x27;s internal processes. Stephen B. Russell read the paper and suggested to him that S-expressions were a more convenient syntax. Although McCarthy disapproved of the idea, Russell and colleague Daniel J. Edwards hand-coded an interpreter program that could execute S-expressions. This program was adopted by McCarthy&#x27;s research group, establishing S-expressions as the dominant form of Lisp.

McCarthy reflected on the fate of M-expressions in 1979:

The book &quot;Anatomy of LISP&quot; by John Allen explains the definition of M-expressions and uses them throughout the book to explain Lisp and its implementation.

== Examples ==

The definitions for the functions apply and eval from the Lisp 1.5 Manual, page 13.

 apply[fn;x;a] =
 [atom[fn] →
 [eq[fn;CAR] → caar[x];
 eq[fn;CDR] → cdar[x];
 eq[fn;CONS] → cons[car[x];cadr[x]];
 eq[fn;ATOM] → atom[car[x]];
 eq[fn;EQ] → eq[car[x];cadr[x]];
 T → apply[eval[fn;a];x;a]];
 eq[car[fn];LAMBDA] → eval[caddr[fn];parlis[cadr[fn];x;a]];
 eq[car[fn];LABEL] → apply[caddr[fn];x;cons[cons[cadr[fn];caddr[fn]];a]]]

 eval[e;a] =
 [atom[e] → cdr[assoc[e;a]];
 atom[car[e]] →
 [eq[car[e],QUOTE] → cadr[e];
 eq[car[e];COND] → evcon[cdr[e];a];
 T → apply[car[e];evlis[cdr[e];a];a]];
 T → apply[car[e];evlis[cdr[e];a];a]]

Using the function eval on an s-expression.

 eval[(EQ (QUOTE A) (CAR (CONS (QUOTE A) (QUOTE (B C D)))));NIL]

== Implementations ==

=== For LISP ===

MLisp was a contemporary (1968–1973) project to implement an M-expression-like frontend for Lisp. A few extra features like hygienic macros, pattern matching, and backtracking were incorporated. It eventually evolved into an abandoned LISP70 draft. M-LISP (MetaLISP) from 1989 was another attempt to blend M-expressions with Scheme.

A parser for the &quot;AI Memo 8&quot; M-expression is available in Common Lisp, but the author intends it as a case against M-expressions due to its perceived inability to cope with macros.

==Further development==
A CGOL (1977) was implemented in MacLisp and follows a similar goal of introducing Algol-like syntax with infix operators. It is known to work on Armed Bear Common Lisp.

A more recent (circa 2003) variant is the &quot;I-expression&quot;, which use indentation to indicate parentheses implicitly, and are thus in some ways intermediate between S-expressions and M-expressions. I-expressions were introduced in Scheme Request For Implementation 49 as an auxiliary syntax for Scheme, but they have not been widely adopted.

A further development is the &quot;sweet&quot; &quot;t-expression&quot;, which has infix operators without precedence. Like I-expressions, t-expressions are only a simple transformation away from S-expressions, so that theoretically they can be used on any Lisp dialect and not interfere with features like macros.

Additional syntax-related include Apple&#x27;s Dylan (Algol-like tokens) and Clojure&#x27;s addition of other literal syntaxes.

<doc id="301785" wikidata="Q1752147" url="?curid=301785" title="Α-Amanitin">
<text>α-Amanitin (&quot;alpha&quot;-Amanitin) is a cyclic peptide of eight amino acids. It is possibly the most deadly of all the amatoxins, toxins found in several species of the mushroom genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, one being the death cap (&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;) as well as the destroying angel, a complex of similar species, principally &quot;A. virosa&quot; and &quot;A. bisporigera&quot;. It is also found in the mushrooms &quot;Galerina marginata&quot;, &quot;Lepiota subincarnata&quot; and &quot;Conocybe filaris&quot;. The oral of amanitin is 100 μg/kg for rats.

Unlike most cyclic peptides, amatoxins (and phallotoxins) are synthesized on ribosomes. The genes encoding the proprotein for α-amanitin belong to the same family as those that encode for phallacidin (a phallotoxin).

== Scientific use ==
α-Amanitin is a selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase II and III but not I. This mechanism makes it a deadly toxin.

α-Amanitin can also be used to determine which types of RNA polymerase are present. This is done by testing the sensitivity of the polymerase in the presence of α-amanitin. RNA polymerase I is insensitive, RNA polymerase II is highly sensitive (inhibited at 1μg/ml), RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive (inhibited at 10μg/ml), and RNA polymerase IV is slightly sensitive (inhibited at 50μg/ml).

== Chemical structure ==
α-amanitin is a highly modified bicyclic octapeptide consisting of an outer and an inner loop. The outer loop is formed by peptide bonds between a carboxyl terminus of an amino acid to the subsequent amino terminus of the next residue. The inner loop is closed by a tryptathionine linkage between 6-hydroxy-tryptophan and cysteine. In addition, α-amanitin is decorated with modified amino acid side chains (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-4,5-dihydroxy-isoleucine, &quot;trans&quot;-4-hydroxy-proline, which gives its high affinity for RNA polymerase II and III.

== Detection techniques ==
Early methods to detect alpha-amanitin included thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In most solvent systems used in TLC, alpha-amanitin and beta-amanitin would travel at different rates, thus allowing individual identification of each toxin. Another early method was the Meixner test (also known as the Wieland test), which would detect amatoxins, but also yielded false positives for some compounds, such as psilocin. Capillary zone electrophoresis was also developed, but was not adequately sensitive for clinical samples, but sufficient for mushroom extracts.

More recently, the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become the preferred method, which allows for better resolution, reproducibility, and higher sensitivity. A range of detectors can be paired with HPLC, such as UV or mass spectrometry.

As early as the 1980s, antibody-based assays (immunoassays) were developed for amanitin (but more often recognize amatoxins as the antibodies cross-react with some of the congeners). The earliest immunoassays were radioimmunoassays and then enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). More, recently, in 2020, a monoclonal antibody-based lateral flow immunoassay (similar to a pregnancy test) has been developed that can quickly and selectively detect amatoxins in mushrooms and in urine samples.

== Total synthesis ==
Matinkhoo et al. devised strategies to surmount three synthetic hurdles to give α-amanitin in 2018. First, enantioselective synthesis of solid phase peptide synthesis-compatible (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-4,5-dihydroxyisoleucine was afforded in 11 steps from 2-(benzyloxy)acetaldehyde. Two key stereochemistry-defining steps include Brown crotylation at (&quot;3R&quot;,&quot;4R&quot;)-positions, and asymmetric Strecker amino acid synthesis at the (&quot;2S&quot;)-α carbon. Secondly, chemoselective inner ring closure by fluorocyclization between 6-hydroxytrytophan and cysteine was achieved by intra-annular Savige-Fontana reaction. This requires a solid phase peptide synthesis-compatible, and methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA), a boron protecting group, orthogonal amino acid in 5 steps. As a final step, enantioselective oxidation at the tryptathionine linkage was achieved using a bulky organic oxidizing agent and an optimized solvent system to afford the desired bio-reactive (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer sulfoxide, completing the total synthesis.

== Symptoms of poisoning ==
α-Amanitin has an unusually strong and specific attraction to the enzyme RNA polymerase II. Upon ingestion and uptake by liver cells, it binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme, effectively causing cytolysis of hepatocytes (liver cells). Few effects are reported within 10 hours; it is not unusual for significant effects to take as long as 24 hours after ingestion to appear, with this delay in symptoms making α-amanitin poisoning even more difficult to diagnose and all the more dangerous. By then, it is far past the time in which stomach pumping would yield an efficient result. Diarrhea and cramps are the first symptoms, but those pass, giving a false sign of remission. Typically, on the 4th to 5th day, the toxin starts to have severe effects on the liver and kidneys, leading to total system failure in both. Death usually takes place around a week from ingestion.

Around 15% of those poisoned will die within 10 days, progressing through a comatose stage to kidney failure, liver failure, hepatic coma, respiratory failure and death. Those who recover are at risk of permanent liver damage. Diagnosis is difficult, and is established by observation of the clinical symptoms as well as the presence of α-amanitin in the urine. Urine screening is generally most useful within 48 hours of ingestion. Treatment is mainly supportive (gastric lavage, activated carbon, fluid resuscitation) but includes various drugs to counter the amatoxins, including intravenous penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives, and, in cases of greater ingestion, can extend to an orthotopic liver transplant. The most reliable method to treat amanitin poisoning is through gastric lavage immediately after ingestion; however, the onset of symptoms is generally too late for this to be an option. Chemically modified silibinin, silibinin dihydrogen disuccinate disodium (trade name Legalon SIL) a solution for IV administration, is used in treatment of severe intoxications with hepatotoxic substances such as paracetamol and amanitins.

== Mode of inhibitory action ==

Based on a 2002 crystal structure analysis, α-amanitin interacts with the bridge helix in RNA polymerase II (pol II). This interaction interferes with the translocation of RNA and DNA needed to empty the site for the next round of RNA synthesis. The addition of α-amanitin can reduce the rate of pol II translocating on DNA from several thousand to a few nucleotides per minute, but has little effect on the affinity of pol II for nucleoside triphosphate, and a phosphodiester bond can still be formed. The bridge helix has evolved to be flexible and its movement is required for translocation of the polymerase along the DNA backbone. Binding of α-amanitin puts a constraint on its mobility, hence slowing down the translocation of the polymerase and the rate of synthesis of the RNA molecule.

== Use in antibody-drug conjugates ==
A new antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology based on α-amanitin has shown activity in therapy-resistant tumor cells, e.g. cells expressing multi-drug resistant transporters, tumor-initiating cells and non-dividing cells at picomolar concentrations.

The unique mode of action of α-amanitin seems to make the amanitin-based ADCs a suitable toxic payload. Amanitin has a water-soluble structure, resulting in ADCs with low tendency for aggregation.

<doc id="301787" wikidata="Q637916" url="?curid=301787" title="Universology">
<text>Universology literally means &quot;the science of the universe.&quot; Popularizing universologic science was a life&#x27;s work for 19th century intellectual Stephen Pearl Andrews, a futurist utopian. The word can be used synonymously with consilience, a term Edward Osborne Wilson has popularized with his writings elucidating the apparent unity of all knowledge.

In recent years, Dr. Mamoru Mohri, Japan&#x27;s first astronaut and Director of Japan&#x27;s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, has popularized and expanded on universology. For Mohri the universological worldview was an epiphany after seeing the planet from space on two missions in the 1990s, and he has become the chief proponent of universology today. &quot;Everything in this universe is part of an uninterrupted sequence of events&quot; Mohri has said.

In 1872 Andrews published &quot;The Basic Outline of Universology&quot; which was subtitled &quot;An introduction to the newly discovered science of the universe, its elementary principles, and the first stages of their development in the special sciences.&quot;

Ilya Romanovich Prigogine (born January 25, 1917) was a Belgian and American physicist and chemist who was born in Russia and became a Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. In the book &quot;Order Out of Chaos: Man&#x27;s New Dialogue With Nature&quot;, which he co-wrote with Isabelle Stengers, another professor at Prigogine&#x27;s group in the University of Brussels, Prigogine states:

&quot;Altogether, we tend to accept the idea propelled by Dialectical Materialism, regarding the necessity of overcoming the antithesis of humane, historical realm and the material world, perceived as atemporal. We do believe, that the setting rapprochement of these opposites will have to be enhanced, as there will be new approaches which will outline the internally evolving Universe, which we are part of.&quot; A central aspect of the ways of &quot;outlining the internally evolving Universe&quot;, that is what Universology is all about.

<doc id="301789" wikidata="Q326259" url="?curid=301789" title="Death march">
<text>A death march is a forced march of prisoners of war or other captives or deportees in which individuals are left to die along the way. It is distinct from simple prisoner transport via foot march. Article 19 of the Geneva Convention requires that prisoners must be moved away from a danger zone such as an advancing front line, to a place that may be considered more secure. It is not required to evacuate prisoners who are too unwell or injured to move. In times of war, such evacuations can be difficult to carry out.

Death marches usually feature harsh physical labor and abuse, neglect of prisoner injury and illness, deliberate starvation and dehydration, humiliation, torture, and execution of those unable to keep up the marching pace. The march may end at a prisoner-of-war camp or internment camp, or it may continue until all those who are forced to march are dead.

== Notable death marches ==

=== Jingkang incident ===
In 1127, during the Jin–Song Wars, the forces of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty besieged and sacked the Imperial palaces in Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng), the capital of the Han-led Song dynasty. The Jin forces captured the Song ruler, Emperor Qinzong, along with his father, the retired Emperor Huizong, as well as many members of the imperial family and officials of the Song imperial court. According to &quot;The Accounts of Jingkang&quot;, Jin troops looted the imperial library and palace. Jin troops also abducted all the female servants and imperial musicians. The imperial family was abducted and their residences were looted. Facing the prospect of captivity and enslavement by the Jurchens, numerous palace women chose to take their own lives. The remaining captives, over 14,000 people, were forced to march alongside the seized assets towards the Jin capital. Their entourage – almost all the ministers and generals of the Northern Song dynasty – suffered from illness, dehydration, and exhaustion, and many never made it. Upon arrival, each person had to go through a ritual where the person had to be naked and wearing only sheep skins.

=== African slave trade ===
Forced marches were utilized against slaves who were bought or captured by slave traders in Africa. They were shipped to other lands as part of the East African slave trade with Zanzibar and the Atlantic slave trade. Sometimes, the merchants shackled the slaves and provided insufficient food. Slaves who became too weak to walk were frequently killed or left to die.David Livingstone wrote of the East African slave trade:
=== Forced displacement of Native Americans ===
As part of Native American removal in the United States, approximately 6,000 Choctaw were forced to leave Mississippi and move to the newly forming Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma) in 1831. Only about 4,000 Choctaw arrived in 1832. In 1836, after the Creek War, the United States Army deported 2,500 Muskogee from Alabama in chains as prisoners of war. The rest of the tribe (12,000) followed, deported by the Army. Upon arrival to Indian Territory, 3,500 died of infection. In 1838, the Cherokee nation was forced by order of President Andrew Jackson to march westward towards Indian Territory. This march became known as the Trail of Tears. An estimated 4,000 men, women, and children died during relocation. When the Round Valley Indian Reservation was established, the Yuki people (as they came to be called) of Round Valley were forced into a difficult and unusual situation. Their traditional homeland was not completely taken over by settlers as in other parts of California. Instead, a small part of it was reserved especially for their use as well as the use of other Indians, many of whom were enemies of the Yuki. The Yuki had to share their home with strangers who spoke other languages, lived with other beliefs, and used the land and its products differently. Indians came to Round Valley as they did to other reservations– by force. The word &quot;drive,&quot; widely used at the time, is descriptive of the practice of &quot;rounding up&quot; Indians and &quot;driving&quot; them like cattle to the reservation where they were &quot;corralled&quot; by high picket fences. Such drives took place in all weathers and seasons, and the elderly and sick often did not survive. During the Long Walk of the Navajo in August 1863, all Konkow Maidu were to be sent to the Bidwell Ranch in Chico and then be taken to the Round Valley Reservation at Covelo in Mendocino County. Any Indians remaining in the area were to be shot. Maidu were rounded up and marched under guard west out of the Sacramento Valley and through to the Coastal Range. 461 Native Americans started the trek, 277 finished. They reached Round Valley on 18 September 1863. After the Yavapai Wars, 375 Yavapai perished during deportations out of 1,400 remaining Yavapai.

=== Congo Free State ===
King Leopold II sanctioned the creation of &quot;child colonies&quot; in his Congo Free State which had orphaned Congolese kidnapped and sent to schools operated by Catholic missionaries in which they would learn to work or be soldiers; these were the only schools funded by the state. More than 50% of the children sent to the schools died of disease, and thousands more died in the forced marches into the colonies. In one such march, 108 boys were sent over to a mission school and only 62 survived, eight of whom died a week later.

=== Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) ===
During the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877), 700,000 to 800,000 Hui Muslims from Shaanxi were deported to Gansu, in a process in which most were killed along the way from thirst, starvation, and massacres by the militia escorting them, with only a few thousand surviving.

=== Armenian Genocide ===
The Armenian genocide resulted in the death of up to 1,500,000 people from 1915 to 1918. Under the cover of World WarI, the Young Turks sought to cleanse Turkey of its Armenian population. As a result, much of the Armenian population was exiled from large parts of Western Armenia and forced to march to the Syrian desert. Many were raped, tortured, and killed on their way to the 25 concentration camps set up in the Syrian desert. The most infamous camps were the Deir ez-Zor camps, where an estimated 150,000 Armenians were killed.

=== World War I ===
Grand Duke Nicolas (who was still commander-in-chief of the Western forces), after suffering serious defeats at the hands of the German army, decided to implement the decrees for the German Russians living under his army&#x27;s control, principally in the Volhynia province. The lands were to be expropriated, and the owners deported to Siberia. The land was to be given to Russian war veterans once the war was over. In July 1915, without prior warning, 150,000 German settlers from Volhynia were arrested and shipped to internal exile in Siberia and Central Asia. (Some sources indicate that the number of deportees reached 200,000). Ukrainian peasants took over their lands. While precise figures remain elusive, estimates suggest that the mortality rate associated with these deportations ranged from 30% to 50%, translating to a death toll between 63,000 and 100,000 individuals.

In the eastern part of Russian Turkestan, after the suppression of the Urkun uprising against the Russian Empire tens of thousands of surviving Kyrgyz and Kazakhs fled toward China. In the Tien-Shan mountains, thousands died in mountain passes over 3,000 meters high.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, death marches of POWs occurred in both German-occupied Europe and the Japanese colonial empire. Death marches of those held in Nazi concentration camps were common in the later stages of the Holocaust as Allied forces closed in on the camps. One infamous death march occurred in January 1945, as the Soviet Red Army advanced on German-occupied Poland. Nine days before the Red Army arrived at the Auschwitz concentration camp, the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; marched nearly 60,000 prisoners out of the camp towards Wodzisław Śląski, where they were put on freight trains to other camps. Approximately 15,000 prisoners died on the way. The death marches were judged during the Nuremberg trials to be a crime against humanity.
On the Eastern Front, death marches were amongst the forms of German atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war.

During the NKVD prisoner massacres in 1941, NKVD personnel led prisoners on death marches to various locations in Eastern Europe; upon arriving to pre-designated execution sites, the survivors were summarily executed. After the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943, numerous German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union were subject to death marches; after enduring a period of captivity near Stalingrad, they were sent by the Soviet authorities on a &quot;death march across the frozen steppe&quot; to labor camps elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

The Brno death march during the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia occurred in May 1945. The Bleiburg repatriations also occurred in May 1945 (during the last days of World War II and after), a total of 280,000 Croats, were involved in the Independent State of Croatia evacuation to Austria. Mostly Ustaše and the Croatian Home Guard, but also civilians and refugees, tried to flee the Yugoslav Partisans and the Red Army, and marched northwards through Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia to Allied-occupied Austria. However, the British refused to accept their surrender and directed them to surrender to Yugoslav forces, who subjected them to death marches back to Yugoslavia, resulting in the death of 70–80,000 people.

In the Pacific theatre, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces conducted death marches of Allied POWs, including the 1942 Bataan Death March and the 1945 Sandakan Death Marches. The former forcibly transferred 60–80,000 POWs to Balanga, resulting in the deaths of 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 100–650 American POWs, while the latter caused the deaths of 2,345 Australian and British POWs, of which only 6 survived. Lieutenant-General Masaharu Homma was charged with failure to control his troops in 1945 in connection with the Bataan Death March. Both the Bataan and Sandakan death marches were judged by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to be war crimes.

=== Population transfer in the Soviet Union ===
Population transfer in the Soviet Union refers to the forced transfer of various groups from the 1930s up to the 1950s ordered by Joseph Stalin and may be classified into the following broad categories: deportations of &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; categories of population (often classified as &quot;enemies of workers&quot;), deportations of entire nationalities, labor force transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to fill the ethnically cleansed territories. Soviet archives documented 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement and up to 400,000 deaths of persons deported to forced settlements in the Soviet Union during the 1940s; however Steven Rosefield and Norman Naimark put overall deaths closer to some 1 to 1.5 million perishing as a result of the deportations — of those deaths, the deportation of Crimean Tatars and the deportation of Chechens were recognized as genocides by Ukraine and the European Parliament respectively.

=== Lydda Death March ===


During the 1948 Palestine war, 50,000-70,000 Palestinians were expelled from the cities of Lydda (also spelled Lod) and Ramla by the Israeli military. Occurring as a part of the broader 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight and the Nakba, the operation is widely considered to have been an instance of ethnic cleansing. Ramla&#x27;a residents were expelled by bus but Lydda&#x27;s residents had to walk 10–15 miles to meet up with the lines of the Arab Legion. Many people died from the heat, thirst, and exhaustion on the journey and the event has come to be known as the Lydda Death March.

Reports vary regarding how many died. Palestinian historian Aref al-Aref estimated 500 died in the expulsion from Lydda, and that 350 of that number died from thirst and exhaustion. Nur Masalha estimated 350 deaths in the &quot;expulsion and forced march&quot; from Lydda. Historian Benny Morris has written that it was a &quot;handful and perhaps dozens.&quot; Glubb Pasha wrote that &quot;nobody will ever know how many children died.&quot; Nimr al Khatib estimated that 335 died. Historian Benny Morris calls this number &quot;certainly an exaggeration&quot;, while historian Michael Palumbo called Khatib&#x27;s estimate &quot;a very conservative figure.&quot;

=== Korean War ===
During the Korean War, in the winter of 1951, 200,000 South Korean National Defense Corps soldiers were forcibly marched by their commanders, and 50,000 to 90,000 soldiers starved to death or died of disease during the march or in the training camps. This incident is known as the National Defense Corps incident. During the Korean War, prisoners who were held by the North Koreans underwent what became known as the &quot;Tiger Death March&quot;. The march occurred while North Korea was being overrun by United Nations forces. As North Korean forces retreated to the Yalu River on the border with China, they evacuated their prisoners with them. On 31 October 1950, some 845 prisoners, including about eighty non-combatants, left Manpo and went upriver, arriving in Chunggang on 8 November 1950. A year later, fewer than 300 of the prisoners were still alive. The march was named after the brutal North Korean colonel who presided over it, his nickname was &quot;The Tiger&quot;. Among the prisoners was George Blake, an MI6 officer who had been stationed in Seoul. While he was being held as a prisoner, he became a KGB double agent.

=== Phnom Penh ===
The Khmer Rouge marked the beginning of their rule with the forced evacuation of various cities including Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

<doc id="301798" wikidata="Q110206" url="?curid=301798" title="Dirty Harry">
<text>Dirty Harry is a 1971 American action-thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, the first in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series. Clint Eastwood plays the title role, in his first appearance as San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Inspector &quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan. The film drew upon the real-life case of the Zodiac Killer as the Callahan character seeks out a similar vicious psychopath.

&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was a critical and commercial success and set the style for a whole genre of police films. It was followed by four sequels: &quot;Magnum Force&quot; in 1973, &quot;The Enforcer&quot; in 1976, &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; in 1983, and &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; in 1988.

In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
A psychopathic sniper, later referred to as &quot;Scorpio&quot;, shoots a woman while she swims in a San Francisco skyscraper rooftop pool. He leaves behind a threatening letter demanding he be paid $100,000 or he will kill more people. The note is found by SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan, who is investigating the killing. The mayor teams up with the police to track down the killer; to stall for time, he agrees to Scorpio&#x27;s demand over Callahan&#x27;s objections. During his lunch break, Harry foils a bank robbery. He shoots one robber dead, and holds another at gunpoint with his Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 revolver, giving him an ultimatum:

I know what you&#x27;re thinking: &#x27;Did he fire six shots or only five?&#x27; Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I&#x27;ve kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: &#x27;Do I feel lucky?&#x27; Well, do you, punk? 

Despite surrendering, the robber insists on knowing, and Harry jovially pulls the trigger, revealing the gun is empty.

Harry is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez, against his opposition to working with yet another inexperienced police officer. Meanwhile, Scorpio is spotted by a police helicopter while staking for potential victims, but he escapes. Harry and Chico ride the beat, and Harry is assaulted by a neighborhood watch gang after they mistake Harry for a peeping tom. Chico comes to Harry&#x27;s aid. After assisting in preventing a suicide, Harry and Gonzalez learn that Scorpio has murdered a 10-year-old African-American boy. Based on Scorpio&#x27;s letter, the police think his next victim will be a Catholic priest, and set a trap for him.

Scorpio eventually arrives, kills a police officer in a shootout, and flees. The next day, the police receive another letter in which Scorpio claims to have kidnapped a teenager named Ann Mary Deacon. He threatens to kill her if he is not given a ransom of $200,000. Harry is assigned to deliver the money, wearing a radio earpiece so Gonzalez can secretly follow him. Scorpio instructs Harry via payphones around the city. They meet at the Mount Davidson cross, where Scorpio beats Harry and admits he intends to kill him and let Ann Mary die. Gonzalez intervenes and gets shot in the chest. Harry manages to stab Scorpio in the leg, but he escapes.

Harry learns of Scorpio&#x27;s hospital visit and a doctor reveals that the killer lives in a room at Kezar Stadium. Harry finds him there and chases him, shooting him in the leg. Harry tortures Scorpio into confessing where Ann Mary is being held, but the police find her dead. The district attorney reprimands Harry for his conduct, explaining that because Harry obtained his evidence against Scorpio illegally, all of it is inadmissible in court, and Scorpio is to be freed. An outraged Harry continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. Scorpio pays a man $200 to beat him severely and frames Harry for it, forcing Harry to stop following him. Meanwhile, a hospitalized Gonzalez tells Harry of his intention to leave the SFPD and become a teacher instead.

Scorpio steals a pistol from a liquor store owner and hijacks a school bus. He contacts the police with another ransom demand that includes a flight out of the country. Harry waits for him, then jumps onto the roof of the bus from an overpass. Scorpio crashes the bus into a dirt mound and flees to a nearby quarry, where he takes a hostage before Harry wounds him. Harry aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots. Scorpio reaches for his gun and Harry shoots. This time, the gun fires, killing Scorpio. Harry removes his police badge from his wallet, throws it into the water, and walks away.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
The script, titled &quot;Dead Right&quot;, by the husband-and-wife team of Harry Julian Fink and Rita M. Fink, was originally about a hard-edged New York City police inspector, Harry Callahan, who is determined to stop Davis, a serial killer, even if he has to skirt the law and accepted standards of policing, blurring the distinction between criminal and cop, addressing the question of how far a free, democratic society can go to protect itself. The original draft ended with a police sniper, instead of Callahan, shooting the killer. Another earlier version of the story was set in Seattle, Washington. Four more drafts of the script were written.

Although Dirty Harry is arguably Clint Eastwood&#x27;s signature role, he was not a top contender for the part. The role of Harry Callahan was offered to John Wayne and Frank Sinatra, and later to Robert Mitchum, Steve McQueen, and Burt Lancaster. In his 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, George C. Scott claimed that he was initially offered the role, but the script&#x27;s violent nature led him to turn it down. When producer Jennings Lang initially could not find an actor to take the role of Callahan, he sold the film rights to ABC Television. Although ABC wanted to turn it into a TV movie, the amount of violence in the script was deemed excessive for television, so the rights were sold to Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. purchased the script with a view to casting Frank Sinatra in the lead. Sinatra was 55 at the time and since the character of Harry Callahan was originally written as a man in his mid-to-late 50s (and Eastwood was then only 41), Sinatra fit the character profile. Initially, Warner Bros. wanted either Sydney Pollack or Irvin Kershner to direct. Kershner was eventually hired when Sinatra was attached to the title role, but when Sinatra later left the film, Kershner did as well.

John Milius was asked to work on the script when Sinatra and Kershner were attached. Milius claimed he was requested to write the screenplay for Sinatra in three weeks. Terrence Malick wrote a draft of the film (dated November 1970) in which the shooter (also named Davis) was a vigilante who killed wealthy criminals who had escaped justice.

Details about the film were first released in film industry trade papers in April. After Sinatra left the project, the producers started to consider younger actors for the role. Burt Lancaster turned down the lead role because he strongly disagreed with the violent, end-justifies-the-means moral of the story. He believed the role and plot contradicted his belief in collective responsibility for criminal and social justice and the protection of individual rights. Marlon Brando was considered for the role, but was never formally approached. Both Steve McQueen and Paul Newman turned down the role. McQueen refused to make another &quot;cop movie&quot; after &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968). Believing the character was too &quot;right-wing&quot; for him, Newman suggested that the film would be a good vehicle for Eastwood.

The screenplay was initially brought to Eastwood&#x27;s attention around 1969 by Jennings Lang. Warner Bros. offered him the part while his directorial debut film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; was still in post production. On December 17, 1970, a Warner Bros. studio press release announced that Clint Eastwood would star in, and produce the film through his company, Malpaso.

Eastwood was given a number of scripts, but he ultimately reverted to the original as the best vehicle for him. In a 2008 MTV interview, Eastwood said &quot;So I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do it,&#x27; but since they had initially talked to me, there had been all these rewrites. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m only interested in the original script&#x27;.&quot; Looking back on the 1971 Don Siegel film, he remembered &quot;[The rewrites had changed] everything. They had Marine snipers coming on in the end. And I said, &#x27;No. This is losing the point of the whole story, of the guy chasing the killer down. It&#x27;s becoming an extravaganza that&#x27;s losing its character.&#x27; They said, &#x27;OK, do what you want.&#x27; So, we went and made it.&quot;

Scorpio was loosely based on the real-life Zodiac Killer, an unidentified serial killer who had committed five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area several years earlier. Elements of Gary Steven Krist were also worked into the characterization, since Scorpio, like Krist, kidnaps a young girl and buries her alive while demanding ransom. In a later novelization of the film, Scorpio was referred to as &quot;Charles Davis&quot;, a former mental patient from Springfield, Massachusetts, who murdered his grandparents as a teenager. There are significant differences between the book and the film. Among the differences are: Scorpio&#x27;s point of viewin the book, he uses astrology to make decisions (including being inspired to abduct Ann Mary Deacon), Harry working on a murder case involving a mugger before he is assigned to Scorpio, the omission of the suicide jumper, and Harry throwing away his badge at the end.

Audie Murphy was initially considered to play Scorpio, but he died in a plane crash before his decision on the offer could be made. When Kershner and Sinatra were still attached to the project, James Caan was under consideration for the role of Scorpio. The part eventually went to a relatively unknown actor, Andy Robinson. Eastwood had seen Robinson in a play called &quot;Subject to Fits&quot; and recommended him for the role of Scorpio; his unkempt appearance fit the bill for a psychologically unbalanced hippie. Siegel told Robinson that he cast him in the role of the Scorpio killer because he wanted someone &quot;with a face like a choirboy&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s portrayal was so memorable that after the film was released he was reported to have received several death threats and was forced to get an unlisted telephone number. In real life, Robinson is a pacifist who deplores the use of firearms. Early in principal photography on the film, Robinson would reportedly flinch in discomfort every time he was required to use a gun. As a result, Siegel was forced to halt production briefly and sent Robinson for brief training in order to learn how to fire a gun convincingly.

Milius says his main contribution to the film was &quot;a lot of guns. And the attitude of Dirty Harry, being a cop who was ruthless. I think it&#x27;s fairly obvious if you look at the rest of my work what parts are mine. The cop being the same as the killer except he has a badge. And being lonely ... I wanted it to be like &quot;Stray Dog&quot;; I was thinking in terms of Kurosawa&#x27;s detective films.&quot; He added:

In my script version, there&#x27;s just more outrageous Milius crap where I had the killer in the bus with a flamethrower. I tried to make the guy as outrageous as possible. I had him get a police photographer to take a picture of him with all the kids lined up at the school – he kidnaps them at the school, actually – and they showed the picture to the other police after he&#x27;s made his demands; he wants a 747 to take him away to a country where he&#x27;ll be free of police harassment [Milius laughs uproariously], terrible things like this. And the children all end up like a graduation picture, and the teacher is saying, &quot;What is that object under Andy Robinson?&quot; and a cop says, &quot;That&#x27;s a claymore mine.&quot; Teacher asks, &quot;What&#x27;s a claymore mine?&quot; And we hear the voice of Harry say, &quot;If he sets it off, they&#x27;re all spaghetti.&quot; Chief says, &quot;That&#x27;s enough, Harry.&quot; Everybody said, &quot;That&#x27;s too much, John; we can&#x27;t have Milius doing this kind of stuff.&quot; I wanted the guy to be just totally outrageous all the time, and he is. I think Siegel restrained it enough.
Screenwriter John Milius owns one of the actual Model 29s used in principal photography in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Magnum Force&quot;. , it is on loan to the National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia, and is in the Hollywood Guns display in the William B. Ruger Gallery.

=== Principal photography ===
Glenn Wright, Eastwood&#x27;s costume designer since &quot;Rawhide&quot;, was responsible for creating Callahan&#x27;s distinctive old-fashioned brown and yellow checked jacket to emphasize his strong values in pursuing crime. Filming for &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; began in April 1971 and involved some risky stunts, with much footage shot at night and filming the city of San Francisco aerially, a technique for which the film series is renowned. Eastwood performed the stunt in which he jumps onto the roof of the hijacked school bus from a bridge, without a stunt double. His face is clearly visible throughout the shot. Eastwood also directed the suicide-jumper scene.

The line, &quot;My, that&#x27;s a big one&quot;, spoken by Scorpio when Callahan removes his gun, was an ad-lib by Robinson. The crew broke into laughter as a result of the double entendre and the scene had to be re-shot, but the line stayed.

The final scene, in which Callahan throws his badge into the water, is supposedly an homage to a similar scene from 1952&#x27;s &quot;High Noon&quot;. Eastwood initially did not want to toss the badge, believing it indicated that Callahan was quitting the police department. Siegel argued that tossing the badge was instead Callahan&#x27;s indication of casting away the inefficiency of the police force&#x27;s rules and bureaucracy. Although Eastwood was able to convince Siegel not to have Callahan toss the badge, when the scene was filmed, Eastwood changed his mind and went with Siegel&#x27;s preferred ending.

=== Filming locations ===
One evening Eastwood and Siegel had been watching the San Francisco 49ers in Kezar Stadium in the last game of the season and thought the eerie Greek amphitheater-like setting would be an excellent location for shooting one of the scenes where Callahan encounters Scorpio.

== Release ==
=== Critical reception ===

The film caused controversy when it was released, sparking debate over issues ranging from police brutality to victims&#x27; rights and the nature of law enforcement. At the 44th Academy Awards, feminists protested outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, holding up banners that displayed messages such as &quot;Dirty Harry is a Rotten Pig&quot;. Also, Andy Robinson&#x27;s portrayal as the Scorpio Killer was so convincing that he received death threats after the film&#x27;s release.

Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; praised Eastwood&#x27;s performance as Dirty Harry, describing him as &quot;giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character&quot;. Neal Gabler also praised Eastwood&#x27;s performance in the film: &quot;There&#x27;s an incredible pleasure in watching Clint Eastwood do what he does, and he does it so well.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;very effective at the level of a thriller&quot; but denouncing its moral position as &quot;fascist&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film a full four out of four stars and praised it as &quot;one of the great police thrillers of motion picture history&quot;, though he too thought that the film&#x27;s message was &quot;dangerous&quot;. Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;What makes &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; worth watching, no matter how dumb the story, is Siegel&#x27;s superb sense of the city, not as a place of moods but as a theater for action.&quot;

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote that &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was &quot;a stunningly well-made genre piece&quot;, but also &quot;a deeply immoral movie&quot;. She said that the film was &quot;not about the actual San Francisco police force; it&#x27;s about a right-wing fantasy of that police force as a group helplessly emasculated by unrealistic liberals... this action genre has always had a fascist potential, and it has finally surfaced.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a high-style film with lowbrow appeal, a movie after which you may dislike yourself for liking it as much as you do&quot;. Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; as &quot;disgusting&quot;.

Siegel was largely unbothered by the film&#x27;s critics, stating:
&quot;I enjoy the controversy, because if you make a film that&#x27;s safe, you&#x27;re in trouble. I&#x27;m a liberal; I lean to the left. Clint is a conservative; he leans to the right. At no point in making the film did we ever talk politics. I don&#x27;t make political movies. I was telling the story of a hard‐nosed cop and a dangerous killer. What my liberal friends did not grasp was that the cop is just as evil, in his way, as the sniper.&quot;

Eastwood himself denied that the film was right wing, but rather that it &quot;showed the frustration with our courts and our judicial system&quot;.

A generation later, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; is now regarded as one of the best films of 1971. Based mainly on reviews from the 2000s, the film holds an approval rating of 89% on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 53 critics, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;As tough and taciturn as its no-nonsense hero, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; delivers a deceptively layered message without sacrificing an ounce of its solid action impact.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on ten critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was listed at 78th place in this list.

John Milius later said he loved the film: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great film, one of the few recent great films, more important than &quot;The Godfather&quot;. It&#x27;s larger than the sum of its parts; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so brilliantly written or so brilliantly acted. Siegel can take more credit than anyone for it.&quot;

=== Box office performance ===
The benefit world premiere of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was held at Loews Theaters&#x27; Market Street Cinema in San Francisco on December 22, 1971. The film was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1971, earning an approximate total of $36 million in its U.S. theatrical release, making it a major financial success in comparison with its modest $4 million budget.

=== Home media ===
Warner Home Video owns rights to the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series. The studio first released the film to VHS and Betamax in 1979. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971) has been remastered for DVD three times – in 1998, 2001 and 2008. It has been repurposed for several DVD box sets. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; made its high-definition debut with the 2008 Blu-ray Disc. The commentator on the 2008 DVD is Clint Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel. The film, along with its sequels, has been released in high definition, on various Digital distribution services, including the iTunes Store.

== Legacy ==
Since its release, the film&#x27;s critical reputation has grown in stature. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was selected in 2008 by &quot;Empire&quot; as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. It was placed similarly on The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made list by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In January 2010, &quot;Total Film&quot; included the film on its list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; also included the film on their lists of the 50 best movies.

&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; received recognition from the American Film Institute. The film was ranked No. 41 on 100 Years ... 100 Thrills, a list of America&#x27;s most heart-pounding movies. Harry Callahan was selected as the 17th greatest movie hero on 100 Years ... 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. The movie&#x27;s famous quote &quot;You&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: &#x27;Do I feel lucky?&#x27; Well, do ya, punk?&quot; was ranked 51st on 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was also on the ballot for several other AFI&#x27;s 100 series lists including 100 Years ... 100 Movies, 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition), and 100 Years of Film Scores.

== Real-life copycat crime and killers ==
The film allegedly inspired a real-life crime, the Faraday School kidnapping. In October 1972, soon after the release of the movie in Australia, two armed men (one of whom coincidentally had the last name &quot;Eastwood&quot;) kidnapped a teacher and six school children in Victoria. They demanded a $1 million ransom. The state government agreed to pay, but the children managed to escape and the kidnappers were subsequently jailed.

Frederick Newhall Woods IV was inspired by the film to plan the 1976 Chowchilla kidnapping, in which a bus with twenty-six schoolchildren and its driver were kidnapped and buried in a van in a rock quarry in Livermore, California. The students and driver escaped before the kidnappers could send their ransom demand.

In September 1981, a case occurred in Germany, under circumstances quite similar to the Barbara Mackle kidnapping: A ten-year-old girl, Ursula Herrmann, was buried alive in a box fitted with ventilation, lighting and sanitary systems to be held for ransom. The girl suffocated in her prison within 48 hours of her abduction because autumn leaves had clogged up the ventilation duct. Twenty-seven years later, a couple were arrested and tried for kidnapping and murder on circumstantial evidence. This case was also dealt with in the German TV series &quot;Aktenzeichen XY… ungelöst&quot;.

== Influence ==

Eastwood&#x27;s iconic portrayal of the blunt, cynical, unorthodox detective, who is seemingly in perpetual trouble with his incompetent bosses, set the style for a number of his later roles and a genre of &quot;loose-cannon&quot; cop films. Author Patrick McGilligan argued that America needed a hero, a winner at a time when the authorities were losing the battle against crime. The box-office success of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; led to the production of four sequels.

In the 2007 film &quot;Zodiac&quot;, also set in San Francisco and inspired by the Zodiac Killer, cartoonist Robert Graysmith approaches police detective Dave Toschi at a movie theater, where he is watching &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; with his wife. When Graysmith tells Toschi he is going to catch the Zodiac killer, Toschi replies: &quot;Pal? They&#x27;re already making movies about it.&quot;

&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; helped popularize the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 revolver, chambered for the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge, and initiated an increase in sales of the handgun. In 2010, artist James Georgopoulos included the screen-used guns from &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; in his Guns of Cinema series.

Dirty Harry&#x27;s famous line &quot;...you&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: &#x27;Do I feel lucky?&#x27; Well, do you, punk?&quot; is often misquoted and popularly used in a humorous and boastful manner as saying, &quot;Do you feel lucky, punk?&quot;

==Early life==
Robinson was born in New York City. His middle name, Jordt, was given to honor his grandfather, though he did not begin using it in his professional credits until the 1996 &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode, &quot;Body Parts&quot;. His father was a soldier in World War II and was killed when Robinson was three years old. After his death, he and his mother moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where he was raised with her family. In his later childhood, Robinson became a juvenile delinquent and was eventually sent to St. Andrew&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Rhode Island.

After graduating from high school, Robinson attended the University of New Hampshire. After he picketed the school&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program his degree was withheld by the university, so he transferred to The New School for Social Research in New York City and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English. He originally intended to become a journalist but went into acting after earning a Fulbright Scholarship. After graduating, he went to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art on the scholarship.

Robinson began acting in high school and college theatre. While attending the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), he studied Shakespeare and voice training.

==Career==
Robinson&#x27;s first professional roles were as a stage actor and playwright in New York. His first role in New York was in the play &quot;MacBird!&quot; He went on to appear in productions in North America and Europe, including &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, &quot;Futz&quot;, Werner Liepolt&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master Dante&quot; and &quot;The Cannibals&quot;. In 1969, he had his first television role with a guest part on &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot; at the age of 26. In 1971, he began acting in feature films.

===&quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and typecasting===
Robinson&#x27;s first feature film role was in 1971&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Don Siegel, the film&#x27;s director, and Clint Eastwood picked Robinson for the role after seeing him in a production of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Robinson was cast as the Scorpio Killer, the film&#x27;s antagonist. The Scorpio Killer was largely based on the contemporary real life Zodiac Killer, and Robinson integrated many known aspects of that serial killer&#x27;s personality into his acting, such as a disturbed sense of humour and a sadistic inclination to taunt his pursuers. In the film, his character murders a young woman, a 10-year old boy, a teenage girl and a police officer and takes a school bus full of young children hostage. His portrayal was so convincing that he received death threats after the film&#x27;s release. Director Don Siegel noted that he cast Robinson because he had the face of &quot;a choir boy.&quot;

Critical reactions to Robinson were generally positive. &quot;Box Office Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Andy Robinson is the maniacal Scorpio ... a good blending of cunning and savagery.&quot; His role as Scorpio gave him widespread exposure, but Robinson also found himself typecast as &quot;psycho&quot; characters. He claimed the role severely limited his casting options, as film producers were reluctant to cast him in any &quot;good guy&quot; roles. Some of his notable &quot;psycho&quot; roles include a demented and ill-fated military barber in &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; (1991) and the character Frank Cotton (in the skin of Larry Cotton, Robinson&#x27;s actual character) in the horror film &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (1987), in which Robinson had his first lead role in a feature film.

===Film and television, 1971–1992===
Robinson starred in &quot;Charley Varrick&quot;, a 1973 film that starred Walter Matthau and was directed by Don Siegel. Robinson played Frank Ryan on the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; from 1976–78, for which he received a Daytime Emmy nomination. Robinson has had many one-time and recurring roles on a wide variety of television shows, in including the miniseries &quot;Once an Eagle&quot;. His filmography includes guest roles on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, and &quot;Without a Trace&quot;.

He met his wife Irene after wrapping a production of &quot;Springvoices&quot; and the two married in 1970. He has two stepsons from his wife&#x27;s previous marriage and one daughter named Rachel, who became an actress as well.

In 1975 he co-starred as the sleazy, ill-fated chauffeur in the detective drama &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;, starring Paul Newman.

In 1978 Robinson left full-time acting for five years and concentrated on raising his family in the small mountain community of Idyllwild, California, located about from Los Angeles. During that time he taught community theatre for middle and high school students and also worked as a carpenter to bring in a regular salary. He returned to acting full-time in the mid-1980s.

In 1986, he played President John F. Kennedy in an episode of the 1980s revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Profile in Silver&quot;. In 1988 he portrayed Liberace in a television biopic. Robinson had described it as one of his favorite roles and that &quot;The most fun was wearing his furs and jewelry and singing &#x27;I&#x27;ll be Seeing You.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer noted that &quot;Robinson does rather well in the leading role.&quot; He returned to the stage in 1993 with a Broadway production of Frank Gilroy&#x27;s &quot;Any Given Day&quot;, but the play closed after only six weeks.

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;===
In 1993, Robinson was cast in his first regular television role since &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; in 1978. He played Elim Garak on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, a Cardassian tailor, and a former operative of the Obsidian Order. The character was intended to be an enigmatic darkly comedic foil for the character of Julian Bashir (played by Alexander Siddig), and the two were often paired together onscreen. Prior to being cast in the role, Robinson knew little of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and had never seen an episode of any of the television series.

Robinson was offered the role of Garak after he originally auditioned for the role of Odo, which eventually went to René Auberjonois. He almost did not accept the role but was pressured into accepting for financial reasons.

===Other works===
After working on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; for several years, Robinson began a career in television directing, starting with the 1996 episode &quot;Looking for par&#x27;Mach in All the Wrong Places&quot;. He went on to direct two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and seven episodes of the courtroom drama &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, in which his real-life daughter, Rachel Robinson, was appearing.

In 2000, he wrote the novel &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;, based on his character on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Robinson has stated that one of the reasons he wrote the novel was to get &quot;total closure&quot; of the character. He starred opposite &quot;DS9&quot; costar Michael Dorn on an episode of &quot;Martial Law&quot;.

In 1993, Robinson was a founding member of The Matrix Theatre Company in Los Angeles.

In 2024, Robinson returned to his role as Elim Garak in Star Trek Lower Decks.

<doc id="301800" wikidata="Q2849163" url="?curid=301800" title="Andy Robinson">
<text>Richard Andrew Robinson OBE (born 3 April 1964) is an English rugby union coach and retired player. He was the director of rugby at Bristol until November 2016. He is the former head coach of Scotland and England. From September 2019 to December 2022, he was the head coach of the Romanian national team.

Robinson played as an openside flanker for Bath, England and the British &amp; Irish Lions. He was head coach of England from October 2004 until November 2006, then coach of Edinburgh Rugby and joint coach of Scotland A between October 2007 and June 2009. On 4 June 2009 Robinson was named the new head coach of Scotland. He resigned on 25 November 2012 following a 21–15 defeat at home against Tonga.

==Playing career==

Born in Taunton, Somerset, Robinson made his England debut against Australia on 12 June 1988, and gained eight caps, playing his last match on 18 November 1995 against South Africa. Robinson was quite small for a back row forward, being only 5 ft 9in (1.75 m), and weighing 13 st 12 lb (88 kg). He played 6 non-international games for the British &amp; Irish Lions on their 1989 tour of Australia.

==Teaching==
Whilst playing for Bath, Robinson taught mathematics, physical education and rugby at Writhlington School, King Edward&#x27;s School, Bath and later Colston&#x27;s Collegiate School in Bristol, where he and Alan Martinovic masterminded the school&#x27;s Daily Mail Cup wins in 1995 and 1996. &#x27;Robbo&#x27; then left to play rugby professionally with Bath.

==Coaching==
Robinson later coached Bath before being appointed forwards coach of England and was deputy to Clive Woodward with the World Cup-winning England side in 2003. When Woodward resigned from the role of England coach in September 2004, Robinson was named as acting coach before being confirmed in the position. He was also a coach on the Lions tours to Australia in 2001 and New Zealand in 2005.

Robinson won just nine of his twenty two matches in charge of England. In November 2006, it was confirmed that Robinson would remain head coach with the position reviewed after the two tests against South Africa. Defeat in the second test increased demands from supporters that he should be replaced. On 29 November his resignation as head coach was announced, with Robinson blaming his lack of support from the RFU.

=== International matches as head coach with England ===

==== Record by country ====
In the summer of 2007, the Scottish Rugby Union appointed Robinson the new head coach of Edinburgh Rugby, as well as joint coach of Scotland A with Glasgow coach Sean Lineen. In his first season as coach, he guided Edinburgh to the highest ever finish by a Scottish side at that time in the Celtic League (joint 3rd), despite numerous international players leaving the previous summer for more lucrative contracts in England and France. The following season (2008–09) Edinburgh leap-frogged Leinster and the Ospreys on the final day of the competition to finish runners-up behind Munster. Edinburgh also finished highest points scorers. He stepped down in June 2009 to take up the role of head coach of Scotland, replacing Frank Hadden. Although his time as Scotland coach included a 2–0 series win in Argentina and home wins over Australia and South Africa – the latter advancing Scotland to a record sixth place in the world rankings – his stint ended after a string of disappointing results, culminating in defeat by Tonga on 24 November 2012 which was followed a day later by his resignation.

=== International matches as head coach with Scotland ===
==== Record by country ====
On 18 February 2013 it was announced by Bristol Rugby club that Andy Robinson was joining the club as the new director of rugby and in 2016 Bristol gained promotion to the Aviva Premiership under him.

==Personal life==
Robinson is a vegetarian.
He has four children; Olly Robinson who currently plays for the Cardiff Blues; Ed Robinson, who is assistant coach at Jersey Reds; Henry; and one daughter, Charlotte Robinson.

Robinson attended Loughborough University between 1982 and 1986. He received a BSc in Physical Education and Sports Science in 1985 and then PGCE the following year.

<text>John Ellis Martineau (December 2, 1873 – March 6, 1937) was the 28th governor of Arkansas and was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. His term as Governor was marked by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, with Martineau serving as President of the Tri-State Flood Commission.

==Education and career==

Born on December 2, 1873, in Clay County, Missouri, to Sarah Hetty Lamb and Gregory Martineau, a farmer recently arrived from Quebec, Canada, Martineau received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1896 from the Arkansas Industrial University (now the University of Arkansas) and a Bachelor of Laws in 1899 from the University of Arkansas School of Law. He entered private practice in Little Rock, Arkansas starting in 1899. He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1903 to 1905. He was a Chancellor for the Arkansas Chancery Court for the First Chancery District from 1907 to 1927.

===Grant of habeas corpus===

While serving on the chancery court, Martineau issued a writ of habeas corpus for defendants in the criminal prosecutions arising out of the Elaine Race Riot in Phillips County in eastern Arkansas. Although the Arkansas Supreme Court later vacated that order, it allowed the defendants enough time to avoid execution and to seek habeas corpus relief in federal court. Their guilty verdicts were eventually reversed by the United States Supreme Court in its decision in &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot;.

==Gubernatorial service==

Martineau ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Arkansas in the 1924 Democratic primary. In 1926, he unseated in the primary the one-term incumbent Tom Jefferson Terral and then defeated in the general election the Republican attorney Drew Bowers, originally from Pocahontas in Randolph County, in northeastern Arkansas. Martineau received 76.5 percent of the vote to Bowers&#x27;s 23.6 percent. Bowers was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas in both the Coolidge and Eisenhower administrations. Martineau left office early to accept a federal judgeship.

===Achievements as governor===

Martineau was the first Governor of Arkansas to broadcast his inaugural address on radio. The Martineau administration established a Confederate pensions board and authorized state aid to cities for highway construction through the Martineau Road Plan. Martineau was forced to deal with a major crisis when the Mississippi River broke free of its banks and covered 13 percent of the state during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Martineau was named President of the Tri-State Flood Commission. In May 1927, Martineau called out the National Guard in response to the lynching of an African-American prisoner by a mob of 2,000 to 5,000 people in Little Rock. Martineau earned the reputation of fairness, integrity, and as a progressive politician. His role in state politics and effective management of crisis situations further secured his reputation as one of Arkansas better governors and brought him national attention.

==Federal judicial service==

Martineau was nominated by President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1928, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas vacated by Judge Jacob Trieber. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 2, 1928, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on March 6, 1937, due to his death. He was interred in Roselawn Memorial Park in Little Rock.

==Memberships==

Martineau was a member of the secret society, Knights of Pythias, and the fraternal organization of the Freemasons Martineau is an 1894 initiate of Kappa Sigma - Xi chapter at the University of Arkansas. Contemporaries of Martineau at Xi Chapter included future State Senator and acting Arkansas Governor Xenophon Overton Pindall, future acting Governor Michael Pleasant Huddleston, future Federal Judge Thomas Clark Trimble III, and future Congressman and Federal Judge Samuel Billingsley Hill.

<text>An Elvis impersonator is an entertainer who impersonates or copies the look and sound of American musician and rock singer Elvis Presley. Professional Elvis impersonators, commonly known as Elvis tribute artists (ETAs), work all over the world as entertainers, and such tribute acts remain in great demand due to the iconic status of Elvis Presley. In addition, there were several radio stations that exclusively feature Elvis impersonator material. Some of these impersonators go to Graceland Memphis, Tennessee on the anniversary of Presley&#x27;s death to pay tribute to the beloved artist.

While some impersonators perform a wide variety of Presley&#x27;s discography, his songs from the 1950s and 1970s remain fan favorites.

==Origins==
Contrary to popular belief, Elvis impersonators have existed since the mid-1950s, just after Elvis Presley himself began his career. The first known Elvis impersonator was a young man named Carl &#x27;Cheesie&#x27; Nelson from Texarkana, Arkansas, who in 1954 built up a local following on WLAC radio with his renditions of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right, Mama&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky.&quot; Nelson even performed alongside Presley when they first met, also in 1954. The friendship between Nelson and Presley is documented in the book &quot;Elvis in Texas&quot;.

The second known impersonator was a 16-year-old boy named Jim Smith. In 1956, shortly after Elvis began to rise in popularity, Smith began jumping on stage and imitating Elvis. Smith&#x27;s physical resemblance to Elvis and his mannerisms happened to catch the attention of Canadian DJ Norm Pringle of Victoria, British Columbia, who had been playing &quot;That&#x27;s All Right, Mama&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on the radio. Smith was featured several times on Pringle&#x27;s regular TV show, though Smith only lip synced to the music, since he could not actually sing or play the guitar at that time.

Many other Elvis impersonators appeared while Elvis was still alive, evolving mainly out of small town talent competitions which took their influences from major music artists of that time. Dave Ehlert from Waukegan, Illinois began performing as Elvis in 1967 a full 10 years before Elvis died. Some of his contemporaries included Rick Saucedo of Chicago and Johnny Harra, a Kansas City native who started in 1958 moved his show to Texas in 1977. Ehlert performed throughout the Chicago Metro Area until Elvis died, then traveled the country with his act. He was on hand for the first anniversary of Elvis&#x27; death at the Prince William County Fair in Manassas, Virginia on August 16, 1978. He has continuously performed his Elvis tribute act for almost 50 years, including performances in Las Vegas and headlining an Elvis tribute show in Branson, Missouri for almost 20 years beginning in 1993. Only after Elvis&#x27; death on August 16, 1977, did impersonating Elvis start to become popular in the mainstream. The large growth in Elvis impersonators seems tightly linked with his ever-growing iconic status.

American protest singer Phil Ochs appeared in concert in March 1970 at Carnegie Hall wearing a 1950s Elvis-style gold lamé suit, made for him by Presley&#x27;s costumer Nudie Cohn. His performance may be considered the first significant Elvis impersonation. Jeremy Spencer of British blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac became known for his high-energy Elvis tribute performances during his tenure with the band. Spencer would perform as Elvis (often in a gold lamé suit) as the main part of a mini-set in which he also did other impersonations of figures such as Buddy Holly and slide guitarist Elmore James.

In the mid-1970s, Andy Kaufman made an Elvis impersonation part of his act. He is considered to be one of the first notable Elvis impersonators and even Presley himself supposedly said that Kaufman was his favorite impersonator. In his act, Kaufman would precede with several failed impersonations before unexpectedly launching into a skilled impersonation of Elvis Presley. As Kaufman gained fame, the impersonation was used less and less.

According to a popular myth, Presley himself entered an Elvis lookalike contest at a local restaurant shortly before his death, and came in third place. This fabricated myth was featured as a news item in the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;, and has been misunderstood to be factual by people who do not realize that the &quot;Weekly World News&quot; is well known to publish outlandish and often unbelievable articles. This joke may have its origins in Charlie Chaplin, who once did enter a lookalike contest and is often reported to have also placed third, although Chaplin&#x27;s actual ranking in the contest is not known.

==Types of impersonators==
There are many different types of Elvis impersonators and Elvis tribute artists. Most fall under the following categories:
* Look-alikes, who concentrate more on visual elements of Elvis fashion and style using accessories such as wigs and fake sideburns (if necessary), costumes and jewelry. A common example of this type are male Elvis fans (although they may not sing or have a performing career) who limit their impersonation only to combing or styling their hair or growing sideburns in the style of Presley in their everyday lives.
* Sound-alikes, who concentrate on changing their voice to sing or talk like Elvis. Notable examples of this type include country artists Ronnie McDowell, Jimmy Ellis and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll artists including Terry Stafford and Ral Donner. Kurt Russell did this type of Elvis impersonation in his 1994 film, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, even though he was uncredited for his voice role of Elvis. Donner served as voice-over narrator in the 1981 documentary &quot;This Is Elvis&quot;, changing his speaking voice to sound like Presley. McDowell recorded covers of Presley&#x27;s songs in the style of Presley for use in several made-for-TV Presley biopics, such as &quot;Elvis&quot; (1979) and &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;.
* Combination, who use a combination of both the visual and aural methods listed above. Country singer Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock was an example of this in the 1970s and actor Kurt Russell was an example of this type in his 1979 film, Elvis and in his 2001 film, &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot;. Professional ETAs normally fall under this type.
*Pastiche, who look like, sound like, and write songs in the style of Elvis. David Daniel, called the Great Pretender, performs dozens of originals in the style of Elvis.

== Level of impersonation ==
There are different levels of impersonation, which depends largely on who is doing the impersonation and for what purpose. They mainly fall under three main levels of impersonation, which are:

* Professional (Elvis Tribute Artist/ETA) Full-time and part-time, serious Elvis impersonators who are in the business of performing for a living. One such artist is Blake Rayne (real name Ryan Pelton), a Screen Actors Guild member who created his Elvis tribute act during pre-production of &quot;The Identical&quot; in 2012.

Enacting a typical &#x27;70s Elvis concert is a preferred choice of most ETAs; however, some ETAs may portray various phases of Presley&#x27;s career in a single show. For example, an ETA may open his show with a &#x27;50s set dressed in appropriate attire (such as a gold lame jacket), reenactments of musical scenes from Presley&#x27;s movies or reenactments of segments from the &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;; and after an intermission closes his show with a full-blown 70s concert dressed in an appropriate jumpsuit.

Some ETAs perform with a live band in the style of the TCB Band, complete with a brass ensemble and background singers to add to the originality; while others rely solely on karaoke for their performances. However, some ETAs may utilize both a live band and karaoke (either one or the other, in most cases depending on the type and size of the venue).

Some ETAs record CDs to sell at their shows, which of course contain many of the Elvis standards, but could also include some of their own songs as well as songs of other artists.

Some ETAs perform under stage names, mostly using names associated in some way with Presley&#x27;s life or career (such as Presley&#x27;s character names in his movies).
* Amateur Enthusiasts who impersonate Elvis in contests, for a hobby, or at social gatherings (such as parties, reunions, etc.). Most of this type of impersonator aspire to become professional ETAs.
* Fun or Comedy Usually done as part of a parody. Clownvis Presley is an example of a performing combining Elvis impersonation, comedy, and original compositions in the style of Elvis.

== Impersonation derivatives ==
&quot;There are heavily-bearded Elvii, four-year-old Elvii, and Elvis duos; Italian Elvii, Greek Elvii, Fat Elvii, a Lady Elvis, even a Black Elvis. Impersonator impresario Ed Franklin boasts, &#x27;We&#x27;ve had every type of Elvis there is in the world.&#x27;&quot; Professional Elvis impersonation can be called a special branch of the entertainment industry. &quot;Michael Chapa, an Elvis impersonator who works in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, helped entertain more than 2500 of his relatives at what is believed to be the country&#x27;s largest Hispanic family reunion ...&quot;

There are also some Elvis impersonators who specialize in experimenting with gender, sexuality, race, taste and decency. According to social historian Eric Lott, &quot;the widespread embarrassment and innuendo surrounding Elvis impersonation points more directly to the homoerotic implications built into such acts.&quot; There are even some performers who satirize other Elvis impersonators.

According to Gael Sweeney, Elvis impersonation offers a spectacle of the grotesque, the display of the fetishized Elvis body by impersonators who use a combination of Christian and New Age imagery and language to describe their devotion to The King. &#x27;True&#x27; impersonators believe that they are &#x27;chosen&#x27; by The King to continue His work and judge themselves and each other by their &#x27;Authenticity&#x27; and ability to &#x27;Channel&#x27; Elvis&#x27; true essence. True impersonators don&#x27;t &#x27;do Elvis&#x27; for monetary gain, but as missionaries to spread the message of The King. Especially interesting are those who do not perform, per se, that is, they don&#x27;t do an Elvis act, they just &#x27;live Elvis,&#x27; dressing as The King and spreading His Word by their example.&quot;

However, the Elvis industry includes &quot;professional Elvis impersonator registries.&quot; The international guide &quot;I am Elvis&quot;, for instance, contains &quot;photos, repertoire, and personal testimonies that serve to materialize the phenomenon of Elvis impersonation and further institutionalize it, including female Elvii, child Elvii, Black Elvii, El Vez the Mexican Elvis, and scores of British, German, Greek and Indian Elvii.&quot; According to George Plasketes, there are &quot;legions of impersonators. Airlines have offered discount fares for look-alikes on Elvis holidays... His omnipresence hauntingly hovers...&quot;

In August 1996, Elvis Herselvis, a female Elvis impersonator and drag king, who had been invited to take part in the Second International Elvis Presley Conference held at the University of Mississippi in order &quot;to test the limits of race, class, sexuality and property...,&quot; was banned from this event by the conservative sponsors of Elvis Presley Enterprises.

==Contests, festivals and events==
There are many Elvis contests for amateurs, festivals and other events held across the world celebrating Elvis Presley and his many impersonators. Events tend to attract large numbers of amateur Elvis impersonators and Elvis fans.

The Ultimate Elvis Tribute Artist competition, for example, is held every year in Graceland. In 2023, Cote Deonath won the title after having placed in the top 10 for 6 years.

CKX, Inc., which now owns Elvis Presley&#x27;s estate, has full control including the grave of Elvis Presley and his family members along with his home Graceland in early 2008. This has seen some impact on what Elvis impersonators and contests have on the media and marketing industry. They began using the contest along with their Elvis brand, licensing anyone wanting to charge a fee to hold an Elvis contest.

The small western New South Wales town of Parkes in Australia has been hosting the Parkes Elvis Festival since 1993, which includes a special &quot;Elvis Express&quot; train from Sydney to Parkes.

In Las Vegas (the city where the real Elvis married Priscilla Presley), there are some wedding chapels where the ceremony can include an ETA. Blackpool in the UK features a busy Elvis wedding chapel based at the Norbreck Castle Hotel, Queens promenade, where couples can have their wedding vows renewed by Martin Fox.

The largest gathering of Elvis impersonators occurred on 12 July 2014 when 895 impersonators gathered in the Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Casino Resort in Cherokee, North Carolina.

==In the media==

===Literature===
A number of books are available on the topic of Elvis tribute artists. One of the first books to document the phenomenon was, &quot;I Am Elvis: A Guide to Elvis Impersonators&quot; released by American Graphic Systems in 1991. More recent titles include photo essays, &quot;Living the Life&quot; by Patty Carroll and &quot;The King and I: A little Gallery of Elvis Impersonators&quot; by Kent Baker and Karen Pritkin.

Novelist William McCranor Henderson wrote about his attempts to learn the Elvis trade in, &quot;I, Elvis: Confessions of a Counterfeit King&quot;.

A more scholarly examination of Elvis impersonation is, &quot;Impersonating Elvis&quot; by Leslie Rubinowski released in 1997. On &quot;the thriving phenomenon of Elvis impersonators&quot;, see also Gilbert B. Rodman, &quot;Elvis After Elvis: The Posthumous Career of a Living Legend&quot; (1996). In the Summer 1997 issue of The Oxford American magazine author Tom Graves wrote an acclaimed article, &quot;Natural Born Elvis&quot;, about the first Elvis impersonator, Bill Haney, the only tribute artist Elvis himself ever went to see perform. The article has been published in the anthology The Oxford American Book of Great Music Writing and the anthology &quot;Louise Brooks, Frank Zappa, &amp; Other Charmers &amp; Dreamers&quot; by Tom Graves.

There are also three &quot;how to&quot; guides, &quot;Be Elvis!&quot; by Rick Marino, a well-known tribute artist, released in 2000 by Sourcebooks and the more recent, &quot;The Elvis Impersonation Kit&quot; by Laura Lee, released in 2006 by Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers. Also recently released &quot;Just Pretending&quot; by Kurt Burrows is full of tips on how to talk, sing and dress like Elvis. It contains interviews with many famous Elvis impersonators, and also gives you five free Sunfly Karaoke backing tracks, allowing you to download your favorite Elvis tracks to perform to.

There are also several university studies, for instance, Eric Lott&#x27;s critical essay, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men: Elvis Impersonators and White Working-Class Masculinity,&quot; published in Harry Stecopoulos and Michael Uebel, eds., &quot;Race and the Subject of Masculinities&quot; (Duke University Press, 1997). The author, professor of American Studies at the University of Virginia, has also written a long piece on Elvis impersonators and the EPIIA (Elvis Presley Impersonators International Association) to be published in his next book. For this paper, he interviewed many impersonators and draws parallels with minstrelsy. &quot;It is indeed one place minstrelsy ends up; where 19th-century white guys imitated what they thought of as slave culture and Elvis took from R &amp; B performers, the impersonators copy the copy, if you will—it&#x27;s minstrelsy once-removed.&quot; In her paper, &quot;Women Who &#x27;Do Elvis&#x27;&quot;, Case Western Reserve University researcher Francesca Brittan deals with female Elvis Presley impersonators and finds them to be &quot;campy, cheeky, and often disturbingly convincing.&quot; According to Marjorie Garber&#x27;s academic study, &quot;Vested Interests: Cross-dressing and Cultural Anxiety&quot; (1992), Elvis impersonation is so insistently connected with femininity that it is &quot;almost as if the word &#x27;impersonator&#x27;, in contemporary popular culture, can be modified &quot;either&quot; by &#x27;female&#x27; &quot;or&quot; by &#x27;Elvis.&#x27;&quot;

===Plays===
One of the most popular modern plays dealing with Elvis impersonation is Lee Hall&#x27;s &quot;Cooking with Elvis&quot; (1999). The comedy centers on the family life of Dad, an Elvis impersonator who was paralyzed in a car crash and is forced to spend the rest of his life in a wheel chair. Climaxes of the play are surreal fantasy scenes in which Dad&#x27;s hallucinatory Elvis dreams are bursting into popular Presley songs as a reminiscence of his one-time persona of Elvis impersonator.

Playwright Charlotte Jones&#x27; award-winning play &quot;Martha, Josie and the Chinese Elvis&quot; opened 15 April 1999 at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton. The play features a Chinese Elvis impersonator called Timothy Wong, who transforms the lives of the characters in the play.

Another popular theater event has been the &quot;Elvis Story&quot; over the last five years. Different Elvis artists have been in the main role with very detailed outfits, wigs and props. This has prompted other impersonators, like Mark Lee Pringle of Ohio, to include these details in their shows. Mark portrays the 1950s rock-a-billy era complete with exact replicas of all of Elvis&#x27; performance guitars and stage clothes from 1954 to 1958, as well as old 1950s RCA microphones and even a full-size Nipper dog statue on-stage (Mark is the only impersonator that uses RCA&#x27;s Nipper).

===Influences in academia===
In paleontology, researchers D.H. Erwin and M.L. Droser in a 1993 paper derived from the Elvis impersonators the term &quot;Elvis taxon&quot; (plural &quot;Elvis taxa&quot;), which denotes a taxon that has been misidentified as having re-emerged in the fossil record after a period of presumed extinction, but is not actually a descendant of the original taxon, instead having developed a similar morphology through convergent evolution. A humorous example of mathematical extrapolation posits that if the growth of Elvis impersonators continued at the rate it did since 1977, by 2043, all humans on earth would be Elvis impersonators.

The museum is the resting place of Ham, the chimpanzee who, in 1961, became the first great ape to fly into space.

==Exhibits==

===Main building===
The museum includes exhibits about the planets of the Solar System, space flight and the primates that were used in early space flight experiments conducted by the United States. The museum holds mock-ups and training units of many important space artifacts such as satellites, the Space Shuttle, and the Apollo Lunar Module (the originals are still in space or on the Moon).

===Outlying buildings===

The Clyde W. Tombaugh IMAX Theater and Planetarium has a projection dome that doubles as an IMAX screen and as a planetarium. IMAX-format films are screened daily.

The Hubbard Space Science Education Building was dedicated in spring 1991. It holds the museum&#x27;s library, small archives and curatorial offices.

The Museum Support Center is an offsite warehouse and workshop that prepares items for display.
===Outdoors===
The John P. Stapp Air and Space Park is an outdoor exhibit area holding large artifacts, including the Sonic Wind No. 1 rocket sled ridden by Stapp.

Ham, the chimpanzee who in 1961 became the first ape in space, is buried at the museum in front of the flagpoles. Ham died in 1983.

The Astronaut Memorial Garden was created and dedicated to the memory of the astronauts who died in the Apollo 1 accident and Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; explosion. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the names of &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s astronauts were added to the memorial.

The Daisy Track (named after the Daisy air rifle) was an air-powered sled track used to test safety devices, including the ancestor of the automobile seat belt. The museum rescued the pieces of the Daisy Track in 1986 and reassembled them as an outdoor exhibit in 2004.

The Daisy Track exhibit is partly outside and partly inside a building that has some other exhibits. A temporary exhibit about the Delta Clipper Experimental (DC-X) is also housed in this building. 
==Programs==

===International Space Hall of Fame===

The International Space Hall of Fame honors persons who have made great contributions to the advancement of space flight and technology. One of the museum exhibits is a collection of photos and biographies of inductees. Induction is held each year, typically in October.

===New Mexico Space Academy Summer Camp===
New Mexico Rocketeer Academy Summer Camp
 is a summer program started in 1986 to interest children in science and engineering. The program emphasizes rocketry, space science, space history, and astronomy. There are different classes for different ages groups. The program is open to cadets entering grades kindergarten through 12th grade.

===Repository for Spaceport America===
The New Mexico Spaceport Authority has declared the museum the repository for materials dealing with Spaceport America, a commercial spaceport near Upham.

===Annual fireworks extravaganza===
The museum puts on a large fireworks show every July 4, funded partly by the museum and partly by City of Alamogordo. It is visible all over the city, and museum members get to view it from the museum grounds.

==History==

The museum was originally created as the International Space Hall of Fame. In 1973 former Alamogordo mayor Dwight Ohlinger was inspired by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, to propose a Space Hall of Fame, and further to propose that it be built at Alamogordo because so much of the developmental work for the space program had been done in the Tularosa Basin. 
 Ohlinger rallied support among elected officials at the local, state, and national levels, and Governor Bruce King adopted the idea into the Office of Cultural Affairs. The early plans called for displays of space-related artifacts and the inclusion of a planetarium.

Charles E. Nolan and Associates were hired as the architects. The main building was designed and constructed as a &quot;golden cube&quot; (a cube with a gold-tinted glass exterior) and dedicated on October 5, 1976, opening to the public on November 23, 1976. At the dedication ceremony the initial fifteen Hall of Fame members were inducted.

The planetarium was constructed in combination with an IMAX theater and opened in 1981. The combined facility was named after Clyde Tombaugh, New Mexico resident and discoverer of Pluto.

In 1987 the name of the facility was changed to Space Center, reflecting the growing role of the exhibits. In 2001 the name changed again to its present name of New Mexico Museum of Space History.

<text>The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was the most destructive river flood in the history of the United States, with inundated in depths of up to over the course of several months in early 1927. The period cost of the damage has been estimated to be between $246 million and $1 billion, which ranges from $4.2–$17.3 billion in 2023 dollars.

About 500 people died and over 630,000 people were directly affected; 94% of those affected lived in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, especially in the Mississippi Delta region. 127 people died in Arkansas, making it one of the deadliest disasters ever recorded in the state. More than 200,000 African Americans were displaced from their homes along the Lower Mississippi River and had to live for lengthy periods in relief camps. As a result of this disruption, many joined the Great Migration from the South to the industrial cities of the North and the Midwest; the migrants preferred to move, rather than return to rural agricultural labor.

To prevent future floods, the federal government built the world&#x27;s longest system of levees and floodways. Then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover&#x27;s handling of the crisis gave him a positive nationwide reputation, helping pave the way to his election as U.S. President in 1928. Political turmoil from the disaster at the state level aided the election of Huey Long as governor in Louisiana.

==Events==
By the late nineteenth century, the United States was well aware of flooding potential along the Mississippi, which drained 40% of the nation&#x27;s area. The Mississippi River Commission was established by the federal government in 1879, with the directive to deepen the river channel, improve navigation, prevent major flooding, and increase river-based commerce. This commission recommended raising extensive levees along its channels to contain the flow, dismissing the advice of experts such as James Eads, who had directed the Saint Louis Bridge project in the 1860s. These critics predicted that compressing a swollen river between walls would increase its destructive potential.

Flooding began due to heavy rainfall in summer 1926 across the river&#x27;s central basin. By September, the Mississippi&#x27;s tributaries in Kansas and Iowa were swollen to capacity. On Christmas Day of 1926, the Cumberland River at Nashville, Tennessee, exceeded , the second-highest recorded level (a destructive flood in 1793 had produced the record level – ).

Flooding peaked in the Lower Mississippi River near Mound Landing, Mississippi, and Arkansas City, Arkansas, and broke levees along the river in at least 145 places. The water flooded more than of land, and left more than 700,000 people homeless. Approximately 500 people died as a result of flooding. Monetary damages due to flooding reached approximately $1 billion, which was one-third of the federal budget in 1927. If the event were to have occurred in 2023, the damages would total around $1.38 trillion to $1.48 trillion.

The flood affected Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. Arkansas was hardest hit, with 14% of its territory covered by floodwaters extending from the Mississippi and Arkansas deltas. By May 1927, the Mississippi River below Memphis, Tennessee, reached a width of . Without trees, grasses, deep roots, and wetlands, the denuded soil of the watershed could not do its ancient work of absorbing floodwater after seasons of intense snow and rain.

==Attempts at relief==
In an unrelated flood at the same time, on Good Friday (15 April 1927), of rain fell in New Orleans in 18 hours. This far exceeded the City&#x27;s rainwater pumping system, and up to of water flooded some parts of the city. This local rain related flood was not connected to the Mississippi River flooding.

A group of influential bankers in New Orleans met to discuss how to guarantee the safety of the city, as they had already learned of the massive scale of flooding upriver. On 29 April they arranged to set off about 30 tons of dynamite on the levee at Caernarvon, Louisiana, releasing of water. This was intended to prevent New Orleans from suffering serious damage, and it resulted in flooding much of the less densely populated St. Bernard Parish and all of Plaquemines Parish&#x27;s east bank. As it turned out, the destruction of the Caernarvon levee was unnecessary; several major levee breaks well upstream of New Orleans, including one the day after the demolitions, released major amounts of flood waters, reducing the water that reached the city. The New Orleans businessmen did not compensate the losses of people in the downriver parishes.

To address the disaster, Congress passed the Mississippi Flood Control Act, which put greater stress on construction in the Mississippi Delta levee camps despite warnings from the NAACP about harsh living conditions and mistreatment of black laborers within the camps.

==Abatement and assessment==

By August 1927, the flood subsided. Hundreds of thousands of people had been made homeless and displaced; properties, livestock and crops were destroyed. In terms of population affected, in territory flooded, in property loss and crop destruction, the flood&#x27;s figures were &quot;staggering&quot;. Great loss of life was averted by relief efforts, largely by the American Red Cross through the efforts of local workers. 

African Americans, comprising 75% of the population in the Delta lowlands and supplying 95% of the agricultural labor force, were most affected by the flood. Historians estimate that of the 637,000 people forced to relocate by the flooding, 94% lived in three states: Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana; and that 69% of the 325,146 who occupied the relief camps were African American. In one location, over 13,000 evacuees near Greenville, Mississippi, were gathered from area farms, and evacuated to the crest of the unbroken Greenville Levee. But many were stranded there for days without food or clean water.

==Political and social responses==
Following the Great Flood of 1927, multiple states needed money to rebuild their roads and bridges. Louisiana received $1,067,336 from the federal government for rebuilding, but it had to institute a state gasoline tax to create a $30,000,000 fund to pay for new hard-surfaced highways.

The Corps of Engineers was charged with taming the Mississippi River. Under the Flood Control Act of 1928, the world&#x27;s longest system of levees was built. Floodways that diverted excessive flow from the Mississippi River were constructed. While the levees prevented some flooding, scientists have found that they changed the flow of the Mississippi River, with the unintended consequence of increasing flooding in succeeding decades. Channeling of waters has reduced the absorption of seasonal rains by the floodplains, increasing the speed of the current and preventing the deposit of new soils along the way. The levees did not prevent recurrences of significant flooding, especially a major flood in 1937. To better study and plan for future situations, Lt. Eugene Raybold proposed laying out a physical hydraulic model to simulate the basin&#x27;s response to various rainfall scenarios. Land was procured at the SE edge of Clinton, Mississippi, and a 200-acre hydraulic model was constructed, matching to the river&#x27;s flow from Baton Rouge to Omaha, modeling the confluence points of its major tributaries across 16 states. The work was completed during 1942, with some labor provided by POWs from Camp Clinton. The Corps used this model to accurately study river flows and mitigation strategies, but by 1970 it fell out of use. In the 1970s it was transferred to the city government of Jackson, and the Buddy Butts Park was created around it. It is presently little-known or recognized.

The devastation of the flood and the strained racial relations resulted in many African Americans joining the Great Migration from affected areas to northern and midwestern cities, a movement that had been underway since World War I. The flood waters began to recede in June 1927, but interracial relations continued to be strained. Hostilities had erupted between the races; a Black man was shot and killed by a white police officer when he refused to unload a relief boat at gunpoint. Near Helena, Arkansas, Owen Flemming was lynched after he killed a plantation overseer, who wanted to force him to rescue the plantation owner&#x27;s mules. As a result of displacements lasting up to six months, tens of thousands of local African Americans moved to the big cities of the North, particularly Chicago; many thousands more followed in the following decades.

Herbert Hoover enhanced his reputation by his achievements in directing flood relief operations as Secretary of Commerce under President Calvin Coolidge. The next year Hoover easily won the Republican 1928 nomination for President, and the general election that year. In upstate Louisiana, anger among yeomen farmers directed at the New Orleans elite for its damage of downriver parishes aided Huey Long&#x27;s election to the governorship in 1928. Hoover was much lauded initially for his masterful handling of the refugee camps known as &quot;tent cities&quot;. These densely populated camps required basic necessities which were difficult to attain, such as water and sanitation facilities. Hoover used a combination of bureaucratic resources and grassroots forces to give the tent cities the opportunity to become self-sufficient. This method presented difficulties, as rural leaders were unprepared to manage the chaotic circumstances found in large camps. This led Hoover eventually to place the relief camps under government supervision.

The refugee camps also dealt with extreme racial inequality, as supplies and means of evacuation after flooding were given strictly to white citizens, with Blacks receiving only leftovers. African Americans also did not receive supplies without providing the name of their white employer or voucher from a white person. In order to fully exploit black labor, Blacks were frequently forced to work against their will, and were not permitted to leave the camps. Later reports about the poor treatment in camps led Hoover to make promises of change to the African-American community, which he broke. As a result, he lost the Black vote in the North in his re-election campaign in 1932. Several reports on the terrible situation in the refugee camps, including one by the Colored Advisory Commission headed by Robert Russa Moton, were kept out of the media at Hoover&#x27;s request, with the pledge of further reforms for Blacks after the presidential election in 1928. His failure to deliver followed other disappointments by the Republican Party; Moton and other influential African Americans began to encourage Black Americans to align instead with the national Democrats.

<text>Seven More Minutes is the second studio album by American rock band The Rentals, released on April 13, 1999, and features numerous guests, including Petra Haden (of that dog.; also appeared on The Rentals&#x27; first studio album, &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot;), Donna Matthews (of Elastica), Miki Berenyi (of Lush), Tim Wheeler (of Ash), Kevin March, and Damon Albarn (of Blur).

The album reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseeker Albums chart.

==Theme==
&quot;Seven More Minutes&quot; was written by Matt Sharp while in Barcelona, Spain. There is a constant theme on the album about a Spanish girl he met there:
*&quot;Getting By&quot; mentions &quot;a girl who lives off the coast of Spain&quot;
*&quot;She Says It&#x27;s Alright&quot; mentions the line &quot;she says it&#x27;s alright that you don&#x27;t speak the language&quot;
*&quot;Barcelona,&quot; which is about the Spanish city and has the line &quot;My sweet angel, Barcelona, hide me safely, give me shelter&quot;
*&quot;Say Goodbye Forever&quot;, (&quot;Your place is so much different than mine, It&#x27;s so calm and peaceful&quot;) This song was written before Return of the Rentals.
*&quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (&quot;The Europeans say...&quot;)

Additionally, CD artwork is based on photographs taken in Barcelona. La Rambla appears on the CD sleeve and images of Montjuïc and El Raval in the booklet and cover.

==Track listing==


==Album background==
A well-known bootleg called &quot;Little Russell Street&quot; features many of the demos and early mixes of songs from this album, all original songs by Matt Sharp except &quot;My Head Is in the Sun&quot;, co-written by Weezer lead singer Rivers Cuomo. Two tracks, however, were salvaged from earlier Rentals releases:

* &quot;The Cruise&quot; (which features Miki Berenyi) is a reworking of the song &quot;So Soon&quot; (featuring Petra Haden), previously released as a b-side for the &quot;Friends Of P&quot; single. It was penned in honor of Timothy &quot;Speed&quot; Levitch&#x27;s 1998 documentary film The Cruise. 
* &quot;Barcelona&quot; is a reworking of &quot;California&quot;, the very first Rentals song.

==Performers==
*Matt Sharp - Bass guitar, vocals
*Rod Cervera - Guitar
*Jim Richards - Moog synthesizer
*Kevin March - Drums

===Additional musicians===
* Damon Albarn - vocals on &quot;Big Daddy C.&quot;
* Petra Haden - vocals on various tracks. 
* Miki Berenyi - vocals on &quot;The Cruise&quot;
* Donna Matthews - vocals on &quot;Must Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye Forever&quot;
* Maya Rudolph - vocals on &quot;Barcelona&quot; and &quot;My Head Is in the Sun&quot;
* Tim Wheeler - guitars on &quot;Overlee&quot; and &quot;Hello, Hello&quot;

<doc id="301816" wikidata="Q1607143" url="?curid=301816" title="Henry Parkes">
<text>Sir Henry Parkes, (27 May 1815 – 27 April 1896) was a colonial Australian politician and the longest-serving non-consecutive premier of the Colony of New South Wales, the present-day state of New South Wales in the Commonwealth of Australia. He has been referred to as the &quot;Father of Federation&quot; due to his early promotion for the federation of the six colonies of Australia, as an early critic of British convict transportation and as a proponent for the expansion of the Australian continental rail network.

Parkes delivered his famous Tenterfield Oration in 1889, which yielded a federal conference in 1890 and a Constitutional Convention in 1891, the first of a series of meetings that led to the federation of Australia. He died in 1896, five years before this process was completed. He was described during his lifetime by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the most commanding figure in Australian politics&quot;. Alfred Deakin described Sir Henry Parkes as having flaws but nonetheless being &quot;a large-brained self-educated Titan whose natural field was found in Parliament&quot;.

==Early life==

Parkes was born in Canley (now a suburb of Coventry) in Warwickshire, England, and christened in the nearby village of Stoneleigh. His father, Thomas Parkes, was a small-scale tenant farmer. His mother, Martha Falconbridge, died in 1842 and would serve as the namesake for his home in New South Wales. He received little formal education, and at an early age was working on a ropewalk for 4 pence a day. His next work was in a brickyard, describing it as &quot;breaking stones on the Queen&#x27;s highway with hardly enough clothing to protect him from the cold&quot;. He was then apprenticed to John Holding, a bone and ivory turner at Birmingham, and around 1832 joined the Birmingham political union. Between then and 1838 he was associated with the political movements that aimed to improve living and working conditions for the working classes.

As a young adult, Parkes educated himself by reading extensively, and also developed an interest in poetry. In 1835, he wrote poems (later included in his first volume of poems) that were addressed to Clarinda Varney, the daughter of a local butcher. On 11 July 1836 he married Clarinda Varney and went to live in a single room home. Parkes commenced business on his own account in Birmingham and had a bitter struggle to make ends meet.

===Immigration to Australia===

After the loss of their two children at an early age and a few unsuccessful weeks living in London, Parkes and his wife emigrated to New South Wales. They travelled aboard the &quot;Strathfieldsaye&quot;, which arrived at Sydney on 25 July 1839. Another child was born two days before. On arrival they had only a few shillings between them and had to sell their belongings as Parkes looked for work. He was eventually employed as a labourer with John Jamison, one of the colony&#x27;s wealthiest settlers, on the Regentville estate near Penrith. He was paid with £25 a year and food rations. After spending six months at Regentville, he returned to Sydney and worked in various low-paying jobs, first with an ironmongery store and then with a firm of engineers and brass-founders.

About a year after his arrival in Sydney, Parkes was hired by the New South Wales Customs Department as a , and given the task of inspecting merchant vessels to guard against smuggling. He had been recommended for this post by Jamison&#x27;s son-in-law, William John Gibbes, who was the manager of Regentville and the son of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes who led the Customs Department.

Parkes&#x27; financial position improved due to his stable new government job, even though he was still burdened with a backlog of undischarged debts. Parkes continued to write poetry. A volume entitled &quot;Stolen Moments&quot; was published in Sydney in 1842. He met the poet Charles Harpur and William Augustine Duncan, the editor of a local newspaper; he mentions in his &quot;Fifty Years of Australian History&quot;, that these two men became his &quot;chief advisers in matters of intellectual resource&quot;. In early 1846, he left the Customs Department after a disagreement with Colonel Gibbes over a press leak that concerned the alleged behaviour of one of Parkes&#x27; co-workers. Despite this, Parkes would continue to remain on friendly terms with Gibbes and his family for the rest of his life. Gibbes&#x27; grandson, Frederick Jamison Gibbes, was also a member of the Parliament of New South Wales in the 1880s and like Parkes became a supporter of federation.

After his departure from the Customs Service, Parkes worked in the private sector. He worked as an ivory and bone turner and later ran a shop of his own in Hunter Street. At one stage, he owned several newspapers, including &quot;The People&#x27;s Advocate and New South Wales Vindicator&quot; &quot;Empire&quot;. He was not successful as a businessman and eventually went bankrupt after running up debts totaling £48,500. He continued to support Australian culture and published poetry in his newspapers.

==Early campaigns==
During his early years in Australia, Parkes took an interest in political issues. Most notably, he joined the growing movement in the colony for self-governance. This was already a major political issue; the New South Wales Legislative Council had been reformed in 1843 to include elected members for the first time. He also became an opponent of the transportation of convicts to Australia and a supporter of land reform.

He voiced his opinions on political issues in &quot;Atlas&quot; and the &quot;People&#x27;s Advocate&quot;. He first became involved in politics in 1848 when he worked for Robert Lowe in his successful campaign in the Legislative Council elections. The following year, he supported a petition to the Parliament of the United Kingdom for fewer restrictions on voting. He spoke in favour of universal suffrage for the first time. Parkes thought his own speech a very weak performance. The petition succeeded in securing less restrictive voting requirements.

On 8 June 1849, Parkes attended a protest in Circular Quay against the arrival of a convict ship in Sydney. He continued to support the anti-transportation cause with writings and speeches, until the British Government ended almost all transportation to Australia in 1853.

In December 1850, Parkes founded the&quot; Empire&quot; newspaper. At first a broadsheet only published weekly, it soon became a daily. Parkes was loyal to the British Empire, but also wanted critics of the establishment to have a voice. As a result, the paper became critical of the incumbent Governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy and the rest of the colonial government. He also attacked William Wentworth&#x27;s plans to introduce self-governance because it proposed an unelected Legislative Council and a restrictive franchise for the elected Legislative Assembly. The proposal was eventually passed after some amendments to make it more democratic. Some years later, Parkes said that, &quot;in the heated opposition to the objectionable parts of Mr Wentworth&#x27;s scheme, no sufficient attention was given to its great merits&quot;.

===Election to Legislative Council===
Wentworth went to England to support the bill in its passage through the British Parliament in 1854, and resigned his seat as a representative for the City of Sydney. Charles Kemp and Parkes were nominated for the vacancy, and the latter was successful by 1427 votes to 779. Parkes in his election speeches had advocated the extension of the power of the people, increased facilities for education and a bold railway policy.

In any event, Parkes began his political career quietly. He was with the minority faction in the Legislative Council, and he and his political allies could afford to bide their time until the new constitution came into force. His workload at the &quot;Empire&quot; office was extremely heavy, and in December 1855 he announced his intention of retiring from parliament. He was persuaded to alter his mind, and a month later he stood as a liberal candidate for Sydney City in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.

==Legislative Assembly==
The first parliament under responsible government commenced on 22 May 1856 but, for some months, no stable government could be formed. Parkes was once offered office but declined as he felt he would be deserting his friends. The &quot;Empire&quot; was not profitable despite its reputation. Around the end of 1856, he resigned his seat to focus on saving the newspaper business. He was not successful, and the liabilities of the paper amounted to £50,000. Though his friends tried to ease the situation by advancing the sum required to pay off a mortgage of £11,000 in 1858, the position became hopeless.

Early in that year, Parkes had entered the Legislative Assembly again, this time as member for the North Riding of Cumberland. Parkes sat in this parliament for about six months but then resigned at the end of August 1858 on account of his insolvency. His liabilities were estimated at £50,000 and his assets at £48,500. The issuing of a certificate of insolvency was bitterly opposed and the proceedings were long drawn out. An investigation of Parkes&#x27; accounts found he had generally acted under the advice of his banker, and he was ultimately exonerated by the chief commissioner in insolvency of any fraudulent intent.

===First Parliament===
Relieved of his heavy work on the &quot;Empire&quot;, which was continued in other hands, Parkes stood for parliament and was elected for East Sydney on 10 June 1854. He stood as an independent candidate, but in the list of candidates elected he was described by the Sydney Morning Herald as a &quot;radical&quot;. He was generally in favour of Sir John Robertson&#x27;s land policy, of the extension of education, and of free trade. He was a strong supporter of free trade, immigration programmes and education reforms. He was also strongly in favour of developing manufactures as he was of encouraging agriculture. He introduced laws that gave the Government the power to employ teachers and create public schools, abolished government funding to religious schools and improved prisons.

Parkes also believed in immigration, and his well-known powers as an orator led to his being sent to England with William Dalley as commissioners of emigration at a salary of £1000 a year each in May 1861. Parkes left his wife and five, soon to become six, children in poverty, on a rented farm at Werrington. Their duties were confined to diffusing information, and Parkes spoke at about 60 meetings at towns in the west and north of England and in Scotland. He felt that he had done good work, but it was difficult to say how much effect his words had. During the 14 months he was in England he met Thomas Carlyle. He returned to Australia in January 1863.

In August he opposed J. B. Darvall at East Maitland and was defeated; but in the following year, was elected for Kiama. In January 1866 the premier, Charles Cowper, resigned in consequence of an amendment moved by Parkes having been carried. Strictly speaking the governor should have asked Parkes whether he could form a government, but Sir James Martin was sent for and Parkes was given the position of Colonial Secretary. This ministry remained in office for nearly three years, from January 1866 to October 1868. An important piece of legislation carried through was the Public Schools Act 1866, introduced by Parkes, which required teachers to have training and created a funding mechanism. A council of education was formed, and for the first four years after the passing of the act Parkes filled the office of president. As a result of the act, many new schools were established all over the colony. Parkes also initiated the introduction of nurses from England trained by Florence Nightingale.

In 1867 to 1868 Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (Queen Victoria&#x27;s second oldest son) visited the Australian colonies. On 12 March 1868 the Duke was shot in the back by one Henry James O&#x27;Farrell. The would-be assassin was Irish, and at the time claimed he was a Fenian. The wound, while painful, was not fatal. Despite the Duke&#x27;s requests for leniency, the colonial government allowed O&#x27;Farrell to be executed. O&#x27;Farrell had, in the meantime, admitted he was not really a member of the Fenians, but by the time of the execution other acts of violence connected with the Fenians (most notably the murder of D&#x27;Arcy McGee in Canada) spurred anti-Fenian and anti-Irish Catholic feelings. Parkes pushed anti-Fenianism hard. For a while his claims of a vast Fenian conspiracy in New South Wales gained some traction, but when nothing further occurred public opinion began to reverse and he was accused of being anti-Irish. As a result, his political position was weakened.

He resigned from the Martin ministry in September 1868, and for the next three and a half years was out of office. In the first year of the Robertson government he moved a want-of-confidence motion which was defeated by four votes. Parkes continued to be one of the most conspicuous figures in the house, and at the 1869 election was returned at the head of the poll for East Sydney.

==Resignation, re-election and first premiership==

In 1870, Henry Parkes was again in financial difficulties and was obliged to resign his seat. He had been in business as a merchant in a comparatively large way, and when declared insolvent he had liabilities of £32,000 and assets of £13,300. He was at once re-elected for Kiama, but an extremely hostile article in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; led to his resigning again. The suggestion had been made that his presence in the assembly while in the insolvency court might influence the officials.

His ongoing financial woes had become a matter of some public notoriety, causing the barrister and fellow politician, William Dalley, to remark of Parkes, in 1872, that, &quot;If he lives long, he will rule not over a nation of admirers and friends, but of creditors&quot;.

It was not until December 1871 that a seat could be found for him and he was then elected at a by-election for Mudgee. The Martin-Robertson ministry had involved itself in a dispute with the colony of Victoria over a question of border duties, and Parkes effectively threw ridicule on the proceedings. When parliament met, the government was defeated and a dissolution was granted. In the general election which followed in which Parkes was generally recognised as the leader of the opposition, and the ministry was defeated at the polls. When parliament assembled, Parkes (now back representing East Sydney) was elected leader of the opposition. The acting-governor had sent for William Forster before parliament met, but he was unable to form a ministry, and in May 1872 Parkes formed his first ministry which was to last for nearly three years.

Parkes had always supported free trade, and his convictions were strengthened during a visit to England when he met Cobden and other leading advocates. During his first administration, he reduced the duties in New South Wales that practically it became a free trade colony. Generally there was a forward policy. His government also sponsored the building of railway and telegraph lines and reduced some taxes.

In 1873 the retirement of Sir Alfred Stephen, the Chief Justice, led Parkes into controversy. Parkes appears to have encouraged his Attorney-General, E. Butler to believe that he would be appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales. Opposition developed in many quarters and Parkes decided to appoint Sir James Martin instead. When the announcement of his appointment was made on 11 November 1873, Butler took the opportunity to make a statement, read publicly the correspondence between Parkes and himself, and resigned his seat in the cabinet. Parkes was accused of manoeuvring to get rid of Butler, who was seen as an opponent within Parkes&#x27; faction, but no evidence was found to support this.

The ministry continued to government, though it did not succeed in creating an elected upper house. Two or three unsuccessful attempts were made to oust the government without success, but in February 1875, Governor Robinson&#x27;s decision to release of the bushranger Frank Gardiner led to the defeat of the ministry. Subsequent discussions between Robinson, Parkes and the Colonial Office clarified the governor&#x27;s responsibilities in pardoning prisoners.

===Second premiership===

When Parkes was defeated Robertson came into power, and for the next two years little was done of real importance. Parkes became tired of his position as leader of the opposition and resigned early in 1877. In March, the Robertson ministry was defeated and Parkes formed one which lasted five months. The parties were equally divided and business was sometimes at a standstill. Parkes said of this ministry that it had &quot;as smooth a time as the toad under the harrow&quot;. Robertson returned to the Premiership from August to December 1877, including an election in October.

Parkes was returned for Canterbury. James Squire Farnell then formed a stop-gap ministry which existed for a year from December 1877 to December 1878. In the middle of this year Parkes made a tour of the western districts of the colony speaking at many country centres. This gave him many opportunities of criticising the government then in power. At the end of the year it was defeated, but the situation was still obscure, because the parties led by Robertson and Parkes were nearly equal.

===Third premiership===

Robertson tried to form a government but failed, and tired of the unsatisfactory position which he was confronted with, resigned his seat in the Legislative Assembly. He was then approached by Parkes, and a government was formed with Robertson as vice-president of the Executive Council and representative of the government in the Upper House. The combination was unexpected, due to Parkes&#x27; rivalry with Robertson; nonetheless it produced two years of stable government after years of instability. It amended the electoral law, brought in a new education act, improved the water-supply and sewerage systems, appointed stipendiary magistrates, and regulated the liability of employers with regard to injuries to workers. In the 1880 election, Parkes was returned for St Leonards. When the Parkes Government left office in there was a large surplus in the New South Wales Treasury. Towards the end of 1881 Parkes was in bad health. He still kept up his habit of working long hours, and except for week-end visits to his house in the mountains he had no relaxation. It was suggested that a grant should be made by Parliament to enable him to go away on a voyage, but he declined to allow this to be brought forward. He also vetoed a suggestion that a substantial testimonial should be presented to him by his friends.

Parkes decided to visit England at his own expenses. He stayed in America for about six weeks on his way to Europe and did his best to make Australia better known. In England, he was received as an honoured guest. Parkes argued in favour of good relations between England and her colonies while also arguing for their right to self-determination; &quot;the softer the cords&quot; he said &quot;the stronger will be the union between us&quot;. Among the friends he made in England was Tennyson, and Lord Leigh, being aware that Parkes had been born at Stoneleigh, invited him to stay at Stoneleigh Abbey. Parkes was able to visit the farmhouse where he was born and the church where he was christened. On his way home, he visited Melbourne where he was given a banquet on 15 August 1882. Two days later he was back in Sydney.

===Electoral defeat===
When Parkes returned, the government was apparently in no danger, and the topic of political debate turned to land reform. This aimed to reduce the amount of land that was in the hands of the large graziers and reduce dummying. Parkes had argued for land reform as far back as 1877, and Robertson&#x27;s bill only proposed comparatively unimportant amendments. The government was defeated over the issue, a dissolution was obtained. Parkes&#x27; faction was not only defeated, but Parkes lost his own seat at East Sydney. He was soon returned to Parliament in another constituency (Tenterfield) but he took little interest in politics for some time. He went to England as representative of a Sydney financial company and did not return until August 1884, having been absent 14 months. In November, he resigned his seat and announced his retirement from politics.

He was now 70 years old. He opened an office in Pitt Street as representative of the financial association which had sent him to England, and remained in this position until 1887. He could not, however, keep long away from politics. At the beginning of 1885 W. B. Dalley, while acting-premier, offered a contingent of troops to go to the Sudan and the offer was accepted. Parkes strongly disapproved and, though public opinion was against him, on 31 March he won a by-election in Argyle. When he took his seat in September objection was taken to claims of parliamentary corruption he had made when resigning from Parliament in 1884, and Sir Alexander Stuart moved a resolution affirming that the words he had used were a gross libel on the house. His motion was carried by four votes. Parkes did not apologise, but his ministry was discouraged from going further. One of the supporters of the ministry moved that Parkes should be expelled but only obtained the support of his seconder.

===Fourth premiership===

In October 1885 parliament was dissolved, the government was reconstructed and George Dibbs became Premier of New South Wales. At the election Parkes stood against Dibbs at St Leonards, and defeated him by 476 votes. Among the reasons for Parkes&#x27; victory were his campaign for a bridge across the harbour, and a railway line going inland from North Shore. The ministry was defeated and was succeeded by a Robertson ministry which lasted only two months. The next ministry, under Sir Patrick Jennings, lasted nine months and was defeated in January 1887. In the meantime, Robertson had retired from politics and Parkes, as leader of the opposition, formed a ministry and obtained a dissolution. He fought a strenuous campaign pointing out that in the four years since he was last in office, the public debt had more than doubled and the surplus of £2,000,000 had become a deficit of £2,500,000. He proposed to do away with the recent increase in duties, to bring in an amended land act, and to create a body to control the railways free of political influence. Parkes&#x27; faction won a narrow majority. When parliament met, free trade was soon restored and there was a well-meant but abortive inquiry into the state of the civil service.

Parkes campaigned against Chinese immigration at the point when it became a political issue. He was received with &quot;loud and continuous cheers&quot; in the Legislative Assembly when he spoke of the need &quot;to terminate a moral and social pestilence, and preserve to ourselves and to our children unaltered and unspotted the rights and privileges which we have received from our forefathers&quot;. Along with many politicians of his day, Parkes avoided the claim that the Chinese and other Asians should be excluded because they were an &quot;inferior&quot; race. Some years before, he had said of them: &quot;They are a superior set of people . . . a nation of an old and deep-rooted civilisation. . . . It is because I believe the Chinese to be a powerful race capable of taking a great hold upon the country, and because I want to preserve the type of my own nation . . . that I am and always have been opposed to the influx of Chinese.&quot; In spite of some discouragement from the British Government, he succeeded in passing an act of parliament which raised the entrance tax to £100 per head.

Though Parkes was personally opposed to it, a Payment of Members Act was passed, and two important and valuable measures, the Government Railways Act and the Public Works Act both became law. The government, however, was defeated on allegations that William Meeke Fehon, whom he had appointed a rail commissioner, was corrupt. His wife Clarinda Varney (after whom Clarinda Falls at Faulconbridge, New South Wales were named) died in 1888. A year later, he married Eleanor Dixon. In February 1889, Parkes opened Fairfield Public School in Western Sydney.

==Fifth premiership and Federation==
At the ensuing election Parkes was returned with a small majority and formed his fifth administration, which began in March 1889 and lasted until October 1891. The proposal to join the colonies of Australia into a federation became a major political issue. As far back as 1867, Parkes had said at an intercolonial conference: &quot;I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion.&quot; Shortly afterwards, a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses. This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be &quot;better to let the idea of federation mature in men&#x27;s minds&quot;, and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme.
In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways. Parkes had come to the conclusion that the time had come for a new federal movement.
He now felt more confidence in the movement and on 15 October 1889 telegraphed to the premiers of the other colonies suggesting a conference.

On 24 October 1889, at the Tenterfield School of Arts, Parkes delivered the Tenterfield Oration. The oration was seen as a clarion call to federalists and he called for a convention &quot;to devise the constitution which would be necessary for bringing into existence a federal government with a federal parliament for the conduct of national undertaking&quot;.

Parkes convened the 1890 Federation Conference of February 1890 and may be considered the first real step towards Federation. In May he moved resolutions in the assembly approving of the proceedings of the conference that had just been held in Melbourne, and appointing him and three other members&#x27; delegates to the Sydney 1891 National Australasian Convention. On 18 May he broke his leg and was laid up for some time. It was 14 weeks before he was able to be assisted to his seat in the house. When the convention met on 2 March 1891 Parkes was appointed as its president. The next business was the debating of a series of resolutions proposed by Parkes as a preliminary interchange of ideas and a laying down of guiding principles. It was at this convention that the first draft of a bill to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia was framed. Parkes proposed the name of Commonwealth of Australia for the new nation.

When it was about to be submitted to the New South Wales assembly, George Reid on the address-in-reply moved an amendment hostile to the bill. Parkes then announced that in view of Reid&#x27;s amendment he proposed to put the federal bill third on the list. Dibbs moved a vote of no confidence, defeated only on the casting vote of the speaker, and Parkes resigned on 22 October 1891.

===On the backbench===

Parkes, now 77 years old, was replaced by Reid as the leader of the free traders, and he henceforth sat as an independent member. Parkes&#x27; political energies were now wholly occupied by Federation. In response to pressure from Parkes, Reid endorsed a scheme of a second, directly elected federal convention, followed by a referendum. Parkes had already mooted a referendum, but strongly favoured a convention delegates being chosen by premiers, rather than elected by the public. In quest of his political enemy, Parkes stood against Reid at the 1895 general election for Sydney-King, winning 44 percent of the vote. In 1896 he sought to re-enter parliament at the bye-election for the seat of Waverley, winning just 11.5 percent of the vote. This proved to be the anti-climactic end of his 40 year long career in the New South Wales Parliament.

In 1887, a sum of £9,000 had been collected by his friends and placed in the hands of trustees for investment. From this fund he had been receiving an income of over £500 a year, but the financial crisis of 1893 reduced this to little more than £200. Parkes was obliged to sell his collection of autograph letters and many other things that he valued, to provide for his household. A movement was made in December 1895 to obtain a grant for him from the government but nothing had been done when he fell ill in April 1896. Towards the end of his life, Parkes resided at &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, a Gothic mansion in Johnston Street, Annandale, a Sydney suburb. Its owner sought the prestige of having Parkes as a tenant, and gave favourable terms.

He died on 27 April; by that time he was living in poverty. He was survived by his third wife, five daughters and one son of the first marriage, and five sons and one daughter by the second. One of his sons, Varney Parkes, an architect, entered parliament and was postmaster-general in the Reid ministry from August 1898 to September 1899. Another, Cobden Parkes, eventually became the New South Wales Government Architect. Parkes had left directions that his funeral should be as simple as possible; a state funeral was declined, but a very large number of people attended when he was placed by the side of his first wife at Faulconbridge in the grounds of his former home in the Blue Mountains. His portrait by the artist Julian Ashton is in a public collection in Sydney.

==Evaluations==
Parkes was described during his lifetime by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the most commanding figure in Australian politics&quot;. Alfred Deakin described him as &quot;though not rich or versatile, his personality was massive, durable and imposing, resting upon elementary qualities of human nature elevated by a strong mind. He was cast in the mould of a great man and though he suffered from numerous pettinesses, spites and failings, he was in himself a large-brained self-educated Titan whose natural field was found in Parliament and whose resources of character and intellect enabled him in his later years to overshadow all his contemporaries&quot;.

Five years after Parkes&#x27; death, Australia became a federation on 1 January 1901. The negotiations to form the federation followed directly from the conferences that Parkes had instigated.

Parkes was known for his commanding personality and skills as an orator, despite having a minor speech impediment with controlling aspirates. He spoke to his supporters in plain, down-to-earth language, and pursued his causes with great determination. Some of his acquaintances perceived him as being vain, temperamental and even rude. Despite this, he had a warm reception when he met Thomas Carlyle and Alfred, Lord Tennyson while visiting the UK. He was interested in early Australian literary men, having been a friend of both Harpur and Kendall. He had received almost no formal education, but educated himself by reading widely.

Parkes was not successful as a businessman or at managing his personal finances, and he had little wealth at the time of his death. On the other hand, his governments managed their finances well, largely due to the treasurers he appointed. Although he was not a socialist, he supported improving the living standards of the working class. He was less ambitious with social reform legislation in the later years of his career, due to the strong conservative opposition he encountered. In 1891, as Premier, he repulsed as &quot;barbarous&quot; a proposal to remove from Aboriginals the right to vote.

==Marriages and children==
Parkes was first married to Clarinda Varney on 11 July 1836 in Birmingham. She died on 2 February 1888 in Balmain, New South Wales, aged 74. They had twelve children:

After his first wife&#x27;s death, Parkes married Eleanor Dixon on 6 February 1889 in Sydney. They remained married until her death on 16 July 1895 in Annandale, New South Wales, aged 38. They had five children, three born before their marriage:
* Sydney Parkes (1884 – 20 April 1937), married Marion Edith Morrissey and had issue.

Parkes married thirdly in Parramatta on 23 October 1895 to Julia Lynch, his 23-year-old former cook and housekeeper. They had no children, but Lady Parkes raised her stepchildren from Sir Henry&#x27;s second marriage. They remained married until his death a year later. Lady (Julia) Parkes died on 11 July 1919 in Lewisham, New South Wales.

==Honours==
Henry Parkes was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1877, and Knight Grand Cross of the same order in 1888.

His image appears on the Australian one-dollar coin of 1996; and on the Centenary of Federation commemoration Australian $5 note issued in 2001.

==Literary works==

Parkes&#x27; literary work includes six volumes of verse, &quot;Stolen Moments&quot; (1842), &quot;Murmurs of the Stream&quot; (1857), &quot;Studies in Rhyme&quot; (1870), &quot;The Beauteous Terrorist and Other Poems&quot; (1885), &quot;Fragmentary Thoughts&quot; (1889), &quot;Sonnets and Other Verses&quot; (1895). Although critical reception of his poetry was often negative, some of his poems have been included in Australian anthologies. His prose work includes &quot;Australian Views of England&quot; (1869), and his autobiographical &quot;Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History&quot; (1892). A collection of his &quot;Speeches on Various Occasions&quot;, delivered between 1848 and 1874, was published in 1876, and another collection dealing mostly with federation appeared in 1890 under the title of &quot;The Federal Government of Australasia&quot;. In 1896, shortly after his death, &quot;An Emigrant&#x27;s Home Letters&quot;, a small collection of Parkes&#x27; letters to his family in England between 1838 and 1843, was published at Sydney, edited by his daughter, Annie T. Parkes.

<text>The W Window System, or simply W, is a discontinued windowing system and precursor, in name and concept, to the modern X Window System.

W was originally developed at Stanford University by Paul Asente and Brian Reid for the V operating system. In 1983, Paul Asente and Chris Kent ported the system to UNIX on the VS100, giving a copy to those working at MIT&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science.

In 1984, Bob Scheifler of MIT replaced the synchronous protocol of W with an asynchronous alternative and named the result X.

Since this time, the X window system has gone through many fundamental changes and no longer bears any significant resemblance to W.

<text>Valley International Airport (VIA) is owned by the city of Harlingen, in Cameron County, Texas, United States. It is operated by a nine-member airport board appointed by the mayor. HRL is centrally located in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) and is referred to as the &quot;Gateway to South Padre Island&quot; with travel amenities and door to door transportation to South Padre Island. With over HRL is the largest airport in the RGV with room for future expansion. HRL has the longest runways in the area with modern aircraft approach systems that minimize chances of delays during bad weather.

As of 2024, the airport is served by Southwest Airlines, United Airlines (via United Express), American Airlines (via American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (seasonally), Delta Connection, and Sun Country Airlines (seasonal service). Destinations served nonstop from the airport include Austin, Cancún, Chicago (ORD), both Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field, Denver, Houston (both Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Houston Hobby Airport), and Minneapolis/St. Paul. The airport is also a large air cargo port ranked in the top 80 airports in the United States and is served by FedEx and DHL wide body jet freighters.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport.

==History==

Harlingen Air Force Base closed in 1962; a 1961 budget by President John F. Kennedy proposed to close 70 air bases in the U.S., and the military airfield was turned over to the City of Harlingen and then converted to civil use as Harlingen Industrial Airport. In 1967, following Hurricane Beulah, the original Harlingen civil airport, Harlingen Municipal Airport/Harvey Richards Field (at , where the Harlingen Country Club is now located) was permanently closed due to wind and flood damage and all civil aviation operations shifted to Harlingen Industrial Airport.

The airport was later renamed Harlingen Regional Airport until it was renamed to its current name of Valley International Airport. Despite its closure as an active military installation, Valley International Airport still sees approximately 50% of its flight operations consisting of military aircraft. These are primarily U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy training aircraft originating from multiple Air Force bases and Naval Air Stations in southern and central Texas. 

===Past airline service===

From 1947–48 to 1960, Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) Douglas DC-3s served Harlingen Air Force Base under a joint civil-military airport agreement; in 1960, Harvey Richards Field received a new 4900-ft runway, and TTa moved their operations there until the airline moved its flights back to the former air force base following Hurricane Beulah.

The first jet service into Harlingen was operated by Trans-Texas Airways with Douglas DC-9-10s at the end of 1967. In 1968, Trans-Texas DC-9s flew nonstop to Corpus Christi and Houston Hobby Airport as well as direct to Dallas Love Field, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee. Trans-Texas flights to Mexico started in 1967; in 1968, TTa Convair 600 turboprops flew nonstop to Monterrey, Mexico, and Tampico, Mexico, with one-stop service to Veracruz, Mexico. TTa Convair 600s also flew to Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Houston, Laredo, San Antonio and other Texas cities. Flights from Harlingen to Mexico ended in 1971–72. Trans-Texas Airways subsequently changed its name to Texas International Airlines and continued to serve Harlingen.

In 1978, all Texas International (TI) flights from the airport were operated with DC-9 jets with nonstops to Austin and Houston Intercontinental Airport; TI flew direct to Los Angeles (LAX) via Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Albuquerque. Texas International pulled out of HRL in 1979, but later merged with Continental Airlines which in turn began serving Harlingen. Continental then merged with United Airlines which continues to serve the airport at the present time via United Express with Canadair CRJ-700s operated by SkyWest Airlines.

Mainline jets operated into the airport in the past included American Airlines Boeing 727-100s and Boeing 727-200s, Braniff International Airways Boeing 727-200s and Continental Airlines Boeing 727-100s, Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. In 1982, Braniff 727s flew nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth three times a day with continuing direct service to Chicago, Denver and Omaha In 1987, Continental was operating DC-9 nonstops to Houston (IAH) with continuing service to Baton Rouge, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Omaha. In 1989, American flew four nonstop 727-200s to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and one 727-200 nonstop to Houston (IAH) while Continental had three daily nonstops to Houston (IAH), one 727-100 and two DC-9-10s. By 1999, American Eagle ATR-72 turboprops had replaced American jets with nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth while Continental Express ATR-42 turboprops had replaced Continental jets with nonstop service to Houston Intercontinental.

Southwest Airlines began serving Harlingen as an intrastate airline in 1975 with Boeing 737-200 jets. Harlingen was the fourth new destination served by Southwest following its initial flights from Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby Airport and San Antonio in 1971. In 1979, Southwest Boeing 727-200s and Boeing 737-200s served HRL. In 1986, Southwest was operating ten weekday 737 flights from the airport with seven nonstops to Houston Hobby Airport, two nonstops to San Antonio and one nonstop to Austin. In addition, eight flights a day operated by Southwest served Dallas Love Field on a direct one stop basis. Today, Southwest is the largest airline at HRL, accounting for approximately 62% of the airport&#x27;s airline market share. Southwest currently serves Harlingen with Boeing 737-700, 737-800, and 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mexicana de Aviacion Boeing 727-100s flew nonstop to Mexico City and to Monterrey.

Sun Country Airlines flew Boeing 727-200s and wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10s into the airport from Minneapolis/St. Paul during winter months in the past and continues to serve Harlingen seasonally with Boeing 737-800s.

Delta Air Lines began seasonal Airbus A320 service to Harlingen in 2013 from its Minneapolis/St. Paul hub; Delta Connection also operated the route seasonally with Canadair CRJ-900 regional jets, but that service was suspended following the COVID-19 Pandemic. Delta resumed the daily in February-April 2023.

Frontier Airlines commenced nonstop service to Harlingen as Frontier&#x27;s 100th destination city with Airbus A320s between both Denver (DEN) and Harlingen and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare (ORD) and Harlingen in November 2018. The ORD-HRL service then ceased in November 2019. The ORD-HRL route was subsequently picked up by American Airlines (via American Eagle) regional jet flights on March 6, 2021. However, Frontier began nonstop flights between both Las Vegas (LAS) and Harlingen and Orlando (MCO) and Harlingen in 2021. Frontier terminated service in Harlingen in August 2022 in light of crew shortages.

Viva began twice weekly A320 service to Harlingen from its Monterrey, Mexico hub on May 6, 2021. Service ceased in June 2022, after the reopening of the United States-Mexico bridges.

===Commemorative Air Force===

In 1968, the Commemorative Air Force (CAF), then known as the Confederate Air Force (CAF), relocated from Mercedes, Texas, to what was then Harlingen Industrial Airport, leasing three former USAF buildings and a section of flightline ramp area, to include 26,000 square feet of museum space. An American non-profit organization, the CAF was officially founded in 1961 to restore and preserve historically significant former military combat aircraft of the World War II era, with the vast majority maintained in an operational flying condition for historical education, aerial demonstrations, and airshows. The name, which was originally chosen as a tongue-in-cheek joke referring to the organization&#x27;s ragtag beginnings, never had anything to do with the American Civil War or the former Confederate States of America. Over the next twenty-two years, the CAF continued to expand, with additional elements established and additional historical aircraft based at other airports across the United States while the organization&#x27;s headquarters, museum, and main operating base remained at Harlingen.

By 1990, the CAF had outgrown the Harlingen facility with no further room to expand. Upon conclusion of its lease, the CAF, its museum, and that portion of its aircraft based at Harlingen relocated to larger facilities at the then-Midland International Airport in Midland, Texas.

In November 2000, the group voted to rename, using the initials &quot;CAF&quot; until a permanent name was selected. Following a 2001 membership vote, the group changed its name to the current Commemorative Air Force, effective January 1, 2002. Many felt the name Confederate Air Force was confusing, did not accurately reflect the true purpose of the organization, and was detrimental to fundraising efforts. According to then-CAF chief of staff Ray Kinney, &quot;In many people&#x27;s minds, the word &#x27;confederacy&#x27; brings up the image of slavery and discrimination. We, in no way, are associated with that kind of stuff. So, it gives us, in a way, a black eye.&quot; Per a 2014 decision, in 2015 and 2016 the CAF headquarters, its museum, and its headquarters-based aircraft relocated to their present home of Dallas Executive Airport in Dallas, Texas.

<doc id="301829" wikidata="Q57151" url="?curid=301829" title="Ernst Busch (field marshal)">
<text>Ernst Bernhard Wilhelm Busch (6 July 1885 – 17 July 1945) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) during World War II who commanded the 16th Army (as a &quot;Generaloberst&quot;) and Army Group Centre.

During World War I, Busch served as an infantry officer and was retained in the postwar army of the Weimar Republic. He steadily rose in seniority and by 1936 was a general and commander of the 23rd Infantry Division. During the invasion of Poland, he commanded VIII Army Corps. In 1940, he was appointed commander of the 16th Army; he led it during the 1940 Battle of France and Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.

By October 1943, Busch was the commander of Army Group Centre but he was dismissed in June 1944 after the collapse of his command during the Red Army&#x27;s Operation Bagration. He was later the commander of Army Group Northwest in the final months of the war and died as a prisoner of war in England.

==Early life and World War I==
Busch was born on 6 July 1885 at Essen in the Ruhr district of Germany. In 1904, having graduated from the Gross Lichterfelde Cadet Academy, he joined the Imperial Army as a &quot;Fahnenjunker&quot; (officer cadet). He was initially posted to the Westphalian 13th Infantry Regiment but was later assigned to the 57th Infantry Regiment, in which he was commissioned a &quot;Leutnant&quot; (second lieutenant). In 1913, he was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (first lieutenant) and received further training at the War Academy.

During World War I, Busch served mostly on the Western Front, initially as a company commander. Within months of the beginning of the war, he had been awarded both the first and second classes of the Iron Cross. In 1915, he was promoted to &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain) and then appointed a battalion commander in the 56th Infantry Regiment. He fought in several battles across the Artois, Flanders, and Champagne sectors of the front. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords in 1917 and the following year received the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

==Interwar period==
After the war, Busch was retained in the postwar &quot;Reichsheer&quot;. He mostly served in a series of staff positions for the next several years, including a period as Inspector of Transport Troops and as a battalion commander in the 9th Infantry Regiment. An ardent supporter of Adolf Hitler, he received a series of rapid promotions from 1933. He soon held the rank of &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) and was commander of 9th Infantry Regiment, which was based at Potsdam, and in 1935 was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and given command of the 23rd Infantry Division. During the tensions of 1938 between Hitler and the two senior officers in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Werner von Blomberg and &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Werner von Fritsch, Busch sided with Hitler. At this stage of his career, Busch was a &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; (General of Infantry) and was commander of &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; VIII.

==World War II==
===Invasion of Poland and France===
On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Busch was commander of the VIII Army Corps which participated in the invasion of Poland as part of the 14th Army. It captured the city of Kraków, reached the Vistula River and advanced as far as Lviv. During the campaign in Poland, he was twice awarded the Clasp to the Iron Cross.

The following year Busch led the 16th Army, which consisted of 13 infantry divisions, during the Battle of France and covered the left flank of &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Heinz Guderian&#x27;s XIX &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps. During the later stages of the fighting in France, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and this was followed by a promotion to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; on 19 July 1940. Once the campaign in France was completed, Busch&#x27;s 16th Army remained in the country until early 1941, when it was transferred to Poland.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
When Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, commenced in late June 1941, the 16th Army controlled seven infantry divisions. Assigned to Army Group North, and operating on its southern flank during the advance into the Baltic States and Russia, it captured Staraya Russa in August. By December, the 16th Army had been considerably expanded, and Busch now had nine infantry divisions along with two motorised divisions, with one more in reserve, under his command. When the Red Army began its winter offensive in January 1942, several parts of his army became encircled and Staraya Russa was nearly lost. Busch had to resort to his reserve to ensure his forces could hold onto the city. The commander of Army Group North, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Georg von Küchler, became dissatisfied with Busch&#x27;s performance and wanted to relieve him of command. Permission to do so was denied. The Red Army offensive shifted focus towards Army Group Centre which relieved the pressure on the 16th Army. Busch was able to relieve his encircled troops although it took several months and required his army to be reinforced.

For the remainder of 1942 and into 1943 the 16th Army&#x27;s sector was relatively quiet, with the Red Army directing its offensive operations against the 18th Army, which was besieging Leningrad. On 1 February 1943, Busch was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarshall&quot; but this owed more to Hitler&#x27;s patronage than to his leadership of the 16th Army. Six months later, he received the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross he had been awarded during the campaign in France.

On 28 October 1943, &quot;Generalfeldmarshall&quot; Gunther von Kluge, the commander of Army Group Centre, was injured in a vehicle accident and Busch was named as his replacement. Army Group Centre controlled 76 divisions across four field armies. Fifty-four of these divisions were infantry, which included six from Hungary, and there were also five Panzer divisions. However, few divisions were at full strength and over the coming months Busch amalgamated several of them. Others were low quality, particularly the Hungarian divisions and also the eight Luftwaffe Field Divisions that were also part of two of his armies. By June 1944, his command numbered 38 infantry divisions.

Busch had to contend with several attacks when the Red Army commenced its winter operations in late 1943. He showed little independence in exercising his command and often deferred to Hitler&#x27;s orders without protest. When fighting around Vitebsk threatened to cut off one of the divisions of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Georg-Hans Reinhardt&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Army, he had to seek Hitler&#x27;s permission to allow it to withdraw. Hitler declined and the division was only saved when Reinhardt, on his own initiative, ordered it to retreat. In May 1944, Busch also conceded to Hitler&#x27;s instructions to transfer his LVI Panzer Corps to Army Group North Ukraine despite this leaving his own command with minimal tanks.

An increased build-up of Soviet forces opposite Army Group Centre was largely ignored by Busch. Despite some of his subordinates&#x27; efforts to reduce their frontage, he refused to let them do so and blindly reiterated Hitler&#x27;s orders that there be no retreat. In particular, the towns of Vitebsk, Orsha, Mogilev, and Bobruisk were to be held in force. Busch had attempted to query this with Hitler but was rebuffed and ridiculed. This only strengthened Busch&#x27;s resolve to follow Hitler&#x27;s directives without question. By mid-June, the 700,000 troops of Army Group Centre were outnumbered by 2,500,000 Soviet soldiers. When the Soviet summer offensive of 1944, Operation Bagration, began on 22 June, Army Group Centre&#x27;s 34 divisions were overwhelmed by nearly 120 Red Army divisions. His army commanders immediately sought permission to withdraw to the Dnieper River but this was denied by Busch, who insisted their positions be held. Within two days, most of his divisions were effectively destroyed. Having overseen the loss of 250,000-300,000 men (25 full divisions), the biggest defeat for Germany on the Eastern Front, Busch was relieved of his command by Hitler on 28 June. He was replaced by Field Marshal Walter Model who managed to stop the advance of the Red Army, but not until it reached the Vistula. In the meantime, Busch became depressed after his sacking which effectively came about because of his adherence to Hitler&#x27;s orders.

===Army Group Northwest===
Having gradually returned to favour with Hitler, Busch was recalled to duty on 20 March 1945 when he became head of Army Group Northwest. Tasked with defending the portion of German coastline along the North Sea, he had few resources and lacked the respect of many men under his command. Busch surrendered to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery on 4 May 1945. He died in a prisoner of war camp in Aldershot, England, on 17 July 1945, and was initially buried at Aldershot Military Cemetery before his remains were later re-interred at Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery.

<doc id="301830" wikidata="Q6418571" url="?curid=301830" title="Kitty Kelley">
<text>Katherine Kelley (born April 4, 1942) is an American journalist and author of best-selling unauthorized biographies of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, the British royal family, the Bush family, and Oprah Winfrey.

For the Sinatra biography, Kelley won praise for the quality of her research and willingness to risk a lawsuit, but critics have not rated her other works as highly. She has been described as a &quot;professional sensationalist&quot; and the &quot;consummate gossip monger.&quot;

==Early life==
Catherine Kelley was raised in Spokane, Washington, the eldest of seven children of Adele ( Martin) and William Vincent Kelley, a lawyer who served as president of the city&#x27;s bar association. She had &quot;an unhappy home life with an alcoholic mother&quot; who &quot;wasn’t just a closet drunk. She was often a nasty public drunk.&quot; She helped take care of her five sisters, Mary Cary, Ellen, Margaret, Adele Monica and Madeleine Sophie, as well as her brother, John. The family vacationed in Europe and spent summers at their two lakeside cottages in western Idaho. Kelley graduated from St. Augustine&#x27;s Elementary School and then attended the private prep school Holy Names Academy.

According to the biography &quot;Poison Pen&quot; by George Carpozi Jr., in 1962, Kelley was expelled from the University of Arizona in lieu of police filing criminal charges for grand larceny against her; the stolen items were expensive pieces of jewelry that Kelley&#x27;s fellow students had kept in their dorm rooms; one sorority sister reported Kelley had also stolen her corselet and &quot;lots more.&quot;

During the aftermath of her leaving the University of Arizona, her parents refused to let her live with them and sent her to live in Seattle with her maternal grandparents, the Martins. It was there that Kelley suffered a breakdown and used a wheelchair during some of that time. After this eight-month hiatus, she surfaced at the University of Washington, where she received a B.A. in English. She worked at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and went on to become a receptionist-press secretary for Senator Eugene McCarthy.

Following four years as a press assistant to McCarthy, Kelley worked for two years as the editorial page researcher for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. She went on to have a full-time career as a freelance writer. Her articles have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

In 1976, Kelley married Michael Edgley. Edgley was media director for the National Council on Aging. He later quit his job to help Kelley with her early books, even looking in the garbage of Elizabeth Taylor and her then husband, U.S. Senator John Warner. Kelley and Edgley divorced in 1989. In 1992 Kelley married John Zucker, an allergist. Zucker died in 2011.

==Books==

===Jacqueline Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor biographies===
Kelley&#x27;s first celebrity biography was &quot;Jackie Oh!&quot; (1978), a life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, which was written at the request of Lyle Stuart, who launched the book into the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In the book, Kelley describes John F. Kennedy&#x27;s womanizing and includes &quot;revelations&quot; about Onassis&#x27;s love life, her depression and electric shock treatment. Kelley&#x27;s publisher Lyle Stuart was later quoted saying &quot;at the time I believed her shock-treatment story. Looking back, I feel I was had and the whole thing was a fable. I doubt that it ever happened. And knowing how she makes things up, I believe she was sure she could get away with it because no one would sue.&quot; Journalist Michael Crowley stated &quot;Jackie Oh!&quot; contained &quot;core truths—including an unflinching look at JFK that showed him to have been &#x27;more of a Romeo than has been previously revealed.&#x27;&quot;

This book was followed by &quot;Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star&quot; (1981).

=== &quot;His Way&quot; ===
Kelley&#x27;s next book, &quot;His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra&quot; (1986), was declared &quot;an act of bravery.&quot; Kelley discussed Sinatra&#x27;s marriages, affairs and links to the Mob. Sinatra filed a $2 million lawsuit to prevent it from being published but subsequently dropped it.

The book was number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and hit best-seller lists in England, Canada, Australia and France. William Safire of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;&quot;His Way&quot;... turns out to be the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jonathan Yardley wrote that &quot;&quot;His Way&quot; is such an improvement over her two previous books... that comparisons border on the pointless.&quot;

===&quot;People&quot; magazine story===
In 1990, Kelley wrote a piece for &quot;People&quot; magazine based on interviews she had conducted with Judith Campbell Exner, a former girlfriend of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s who claimed to have had an affair with John F. Kennedy. Exner told Kelley that she had arranged ten meetings between Kennedy and Mafia gangster Sam Giancana, and they discussed having the mafia kill Fidel Castro. It was subsequently revealed that Exner, who was terminally ill, had been paid $50,000 to talk with Kelley and had not mentioned these &quot;revelations&quot; in her own autobiography, published years earlier. A former FBI agent said that Giancana had been under a federal wiretap, so these multiple meetings with Kennedy would have been impossible to cover up.

===Nancy Reagan biography===
In 1991 Kelley published &quot;Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography&quot;. She was paid $3.5 million to write the book. The book claimed that Nancy Reagan had had affairs with Frank Sinatra, that she frequently relied on astrology, that she had lied about her age, and that she had a very poor relationship with her children, even alleging that she hit her daughter, Patti. In December 2021, the book&#x27;s allegation that the future first lady, &quot;was renowned in Hollywood for performing oral sex... not only in the evening but in offices. That was one of the reasons that she was very popular on the MGM lot&quot; became a minor internet meme.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate/2021/nancy-twitter-madonna&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Despite her wretched excesses, Kelley has the core of the story right. Even her staunchest defenders concede that Nancy Reagan is more Marie Antoinette than Mother Teresa.&quot; However &quot;Newsweek&quot; also criticized the book&#x27;s basic factual accuracy, noting that Kelley had reported that Ronald Reagan had allegedly date raped a 19-year-old, when the accuser would have actually been 25 at the time. The book included an interview with actress Jacquelyn Park, who detailed an alleged affair with Ronald Reagan in the 1950s.

Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement saying the book &quot;has no basis in fact and serves no decent purpose.&quot;

Michael Korda, who had been the editor for Kelley&#x27;s previous book on Elizabeth Taylor, asked to excuse himself from this work as he was slated to edit Ronald Reagan&#x27;s autobiography. The Nancy Reagan book was edited instead by Alice Mayhew. Korda stated that Nancy Reagan was purported to have said about Kelley, &quot;I hope she gets hit by a truck.&quot;

===British royal family and the Bush family===
In September 1997, Kelley wrote &quot;The Royals&quot; (Warner Books, New York, ) about the British royal family. Kelley stated that the Windsors obscured their German ancestry and described scandals surrounding the members of the royal family.

&quot;The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty&quot; was published in September 2004. Kelley announced plans for the book shortly after George W. Bush&#x27;s election in 2000 and worked on it for four years.

===Oprah Winfrey biography===
In December 2006, Crown announced it would publish Kelley&#x27;s unauthorized biography of Oprah Winfrey. The book, &quot;Oprah: A Biography&quot;, was released on April 13, 2010. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared the biography &quot;one of those King Kong vs. Godzilla events in celebrity culture.&quot; Oprah dismissed the book as a &quot;so-called biography.&quot;

===&quot;Capturing Camelot&quot;===
Kelley&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;Capturing Camelot: Stanley Tretick&#x27;s Iconic Images of the Kennedys&quot;, was published by Thomas Dunne Books in November 2012.

==Criticism==
Barbara Walters said books like Kelley&#x27;s are more focused on salacious rather than factual content. &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed that Kelley &quot;just aims for the jugular.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that most journalists believe Kelley &quot;too frequently fails to bring perspective or analysis to the fruits of her reporting and at times lards her work with dollops of questionable inferences and innuendos.&quot; Joe Klein described Kelley as a &quot;professional sensationalist.&quot;

Michael Crowley of &quot;Slate&quot; magazine once called Kelley &quot;the consummate gossip monger, a vehicle for all the rumor and innuendo surrounding her illustrious subjects.&quot; Kelley maintains, &quot;I am an unabashed admirer of transparency and believe in the freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment&quot; and, to that end, her writing is about &quot;moving an icon out of the moonlight and into the sunlight.&quot; Crowley, while conceding that Kelley&#x27;s books, in particular her Sinatra biography, have revealed core truths not addressed by more sympathetic biographers, has also stated that her investigative methods are questionable, and many of the claims in her books have been falsified, as with her 1990 &quot;People&quot; magazine story about John F. Kennedy and organized crime boss Sam Giancana, and her Nancy Reagan biography. Similar criticism has been leveled at her by Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Joe Klein of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Other work==
Kelley is on the board of Washington Independent Review of Books, and Reading is Fundamental. In 2008 she was on the board of Healthy Women.

==Awards and honors==
Kelley won the 2005 PEN Oakland Censorship Award and the Outstanding Author Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors for her &quot;courageous writing on popular culture.&quot; She received the Medal of Merit from the Lotos Club of New York City.

<text>Hermann Karl Bruno von François (31 January 1856 – 15 May 1933) was a German &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; during World War I, and is best known for his key role in several German victories on the Eastern Front in 1914.

==Early life and military career==

Born in Luxembourg to a noble family of partial Huguenot extraction, François was exposed to a military life from an early age. His father was a Prussian major general and commander of the who was killed in action leading his men during the Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870.

After attending cadet schools in Wahlstatt and in Berlin, François entered the Prussian Army on 15 April 1875 as a &quot;Seconde-Lieutenant&quot; (2nd Lieutenant) in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards (&quot;1. Garde-Regiment zu Fuß&quot;) in Potsdam. On 25 March 1884, he was transferred to Schwerin as a company officer in the Grand Ducal Mecklenburg Grenadier Regiment No. 89 (&quot;Großherzoglich Mecklenburgisches Grenadier-Regiment Nr 89&quot;), with a predated patent of 16 October 1874. On 14 August 1884, he was promoted to &quot;Premier-Lieutenant&quot; (1st Lieutenant). 

From 14 October 1884 to 21 July 1887, he attended the War Academy (&quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;) in Berlin. On 1 April 1888, he was commanded to the Great General Staff and on his promotion to &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (Captain) on 22 March 1889 transferred to the general staff. On 23 April 1889, François was posted as a general staff officer to the XV Corps based in Strasbourg (Imperial Territory of Alsace–Lorraine). On 27 January 1891, he was assigned as general staff officer on the staff of the 31st Division. On 29 March 1892, François was appointed commander of the 6th Company of the 2nd Lorraine Infantry Regiment (&quot;2. Lothringisches Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 131&quot;) in Metz. 

On 1 February 1894, François was transferred to the general staff of the 8th Division in Mannheim as the chief of operations (&quot;1. Generalstabsoffizier&quot; or Ia). He was promoted to Major on 18 October 1894. On 17 December 1896, he was appointed Ia on the general staff of the IV Corps, based in Magdeburg. He returned to troop command on 25 March 1899 as commander of the I. Battalion of the 2nd Baden Grenadier Regiment &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm I&quot; No. 110 (&quot;2. Badisches Grenadier-Regiment „Kaiser Wilhelm I.“ Nr. 110&quot;) in Mannheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden. 

On 25 June 1900, François returned to Magdeburg as Chief of the General Staff of the IV Corps, which from 27 January 1903 was commanded by &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Paul von Hindenburg. On 18 April 1901, François was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant colonel) and on 18 April 1903 to &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel). In 1901, François&#x27;s mother, Marie took the family to German South-West Africa to follow her youngest son, Hugo von François who was a &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain) in the Schutztruppe. The family was based in the region during the Herero Wars, in which Hugo fought and was killed in action 13 March 1904 near Owikokorero. François&#x27; other brother, Curt von François, was a Prussian Major in the General Staff, later a well-known scientist and researcher specialising in Africa.

On 24 August 1904, François was seconded as acting commander to the 3rd Guards Grenadier Regiment &quot;Queen Elisabeth&quot; (&quot;Königin Elisabeth Garde-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 3&quot;) in Charlottenburg and on 15 September 1904 he was named commander of the regiment. On 18 November 1907, he was named acting commander of the in Darmstadt and with his promotion to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; on 27 January 1908 he was named commander of the brigade. 

François was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; on 20 March 1911 and given command of the 13th Division. On 1 October 1913, he took command of the I Corps based in Königsberg in the province of East Prussia.

==World War I==
François began the war in August 1914 as commander of the I Corps under the 8th Army and was soon promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; on 19 August 1914. His task was to defend the easternmost regions of East Prussia against a Russian attack directed at the key city of Königsberg. The 8th Army would be expected to hold out against significantly larger Russian forces until it could be reinforced by troops coming from the west after the expected quick defeat of France, in accordance with the Schlieffen Plan, which would guide German forces in the opening phase of a war in which Germany faced both France and Russia.

When war broke out, François&#x27; corps faced the right wing of a two-pronged Russian invasion of East Prussia, led by Paul von Rennenkampf&#x27;s Russian First Army. On 17 August the overall German theater commander, General Maximilian von Prittwitz und Gaffron, nervously eying the advance of the Russian left wing far to the south, ordered François to retreat while under heavy attack from Rennenkampf.

François, reluctant to surrender any territory, and naturally pugnacious, also felt breaking off while engaged would be deadly, and so he ignored Prittwitz&#x27; order, responding with the famous reply &quot;General von François will withdraw when he has defeated the Russians!&quot; He counterattacked Rennenkampf&#x27;s massive army, bringing on the Battle of Stalluponen, and won a surprising victory while inflicting 5,000 casualties and taking 3,000 prisoners.

After winning the battle, François obeyed Prittwitz&#x27;s order and withdrew to the west, where three days later he fought Rennenkampf to a draw at the Battle of Gumbinnen. François&#x27; aggressiveness resulted in the cautious Rennenkampf halting his advance westward.

 Following that battle and a change of overall commanders (Prittwitz was judged to have lost his nerve by the German High Command), François&#x27; corps was transferred by rail to the southwest, to confront the Russian Second Army advancing into southern East Prussia under the command of General Alexander Samsonov. Although not trusted by the new German commanders Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff due to his previous disobedience, François played the decisive role in the upcoming Battle of Tannenberg. On 27 August, François attacked the lead elements of Samsonov&#x27;s army and began to make steady advances into their rear. Ludendorff, fearing a Russian counterattack by Rennenkampf, now ordered him to break off the advance. However, François twice ignored his direct orders and played a decisive role in the following encirclement and defeat of Samsonov&#x27;s army.

When Hindenburg and Ludendorff went south to lead the 9th Army in Russian Poland, François remained with his corps in East Prussia and led it with much success in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes the following month. When General Richard von Schubert, the new commander of the 8th Army, ordered him to retreat, he dispatched a telegram to the Supreme Army Command (&quot;Oberste Heeresleitung&quot; or OHL) describing his success and stating &quot;the commander is badly counselled.&quot; The telegram impressed the Kaiser so much that he immediately relieved Schubert and, on 3 October, gave François temporary command of the 8th Army. He did not hold it for long. When Hindenburg and Ludendorff prepared their counter-attack from Thorn in the direction of Łódź, François was reluctant to send the requested I Corps, sending the badly trained and ill-equipped XXV Reserve Corps instead. That was too much for his superiors. In early November 1914 von François was removed and replaced by General Otto von Below.

After some time spent &quot;on the shelf&quot;, François received the command of the XXXXI Reserve Corps on 20 December 1914, and after a spell in the West, he returned to the Eastern Front in April 1915 where he took part in the Spring Offensive that conquered Russian Poland. He continued to distinguish himself. He was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, Germany&#x27;s highest military decoration, on 14 May 1915 for his performance in the breakthrough at Gorlice. On 30 June 1915 he was transferred back to the Western Front to take command of the Westphalian VII Corps in France, and in July 1916 a task force known as Meuse Group West (&quot;Maasgruppe West&quot;) in the Verdun sector. He added the Oak Leaves to his &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; on 27 July 1917, for outstanding performance during the Battle of Verdun. During the German spring offensive of 1918, in the Third Battle of the Aisne, he led another task force, the Attack Group on the Oise (&quot;Angriffsgruppe an der Oise&quot;). Due to a conflict with Ludendorff, François was on 6 July 1918 placed on the standby list until 14 October 1918 when he retired.

==Post-war==
After the war ended, François returned home and wrote several books on military history, including the best-seller (in Germany) &quot;Marneschlacht und Tannenberg&quot; in 1920. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Tübingen on 20 May 1925 for his scholarship in military history. He died on 15 May 1933 in Berlin of a kidney infection.

<doc id="301834" wikidata="Q1627015" url="?curid=301834" title="Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport">
<text>Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport is five miles north of Lubbock, in Lubbock County, Texas, United States. Originally Lubbock International Airport, it was renamed in 2004 for former Texas governor Preston E. Smith, an alumnus of Texas Tech University.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 classifies it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 520,181 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2019, and 487,000 in 2018.

The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock International is first among the smaller Texas cities (behind both Dallas airports, both Houston airports, San Antonio, Austin, and El Paso). Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport is a hub for FedEx and UPS feeder planes to cities around the South Plains.

==History==
The airport opened in November 1937 as South Plains Airport. In 1942 the United States Army Air Forces indicated a need for the airport as a training airfield. After its requisition by the Air Force, it was assigned to the World War II Army Air Forces Flying Training Command, Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command). The airport was renamed South Plains Army Airfield and a rapid period of construction was begun to convert the civil airport into a military training airfield.

Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways and a large apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also built. Buildings were utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, but most support buildings had concrete foundations and frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper.

The base was activated on September 11, 1942, as the South Plains Flying School. The mission was ground and flying training of glider pilots. Glider training was performed by the 848th School Squadron (Special), with overall training being under the 64th Two-Engine Flying Training Group of the 80th Flying Training Wing. Aircraft assigned were Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Waco CG-4A gliders. The CG-4A was the USAAF&#x27;s primary glider, consisting of little more than a wooden and fabric shell, equipped with radio, wheels, and brakes. Glider pilots trained at South Plains flew these craft in combat during the Normandy Invasion, Operation Market-Garden, and also Operation Varsity, the airborne invasion of Germany.

By late 1944 Flying Training Command ended all glider instruction, and control of South Plains AAF was transferred to the Air Service Command at Tinker Field, Oklahoma. Under Air Service Command, South Plains became a maintenance and supply depot for excess aircraft that could not be accommodated at Tinker. After the war ended, in 1946 and 1947, South Plains was used as a storage facility for excess aircraft prior to their reclamation.

Military use of South Plains ended on December 1, 1947, and it was returned to the local government for civil use. A civilian terminal was constructed on the southwest corner of the airfield for commercial airline activity and used through the 1950s and 1960s. The current airline terminal was opened about 1976. The original terminal now houses the Silent Wings Museum dedicated to World War II glider pilots.

Major renovations to the terminal building began in 2019, featuring an expanded TSA screening area, refreshed check-in counters, gates, waiting areas, restrooms, concessions, rental-car desks and more. Many of these improvements began to open to the public in late 2021.

===Historical airline service===

Braniff Airways, later to be Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, and Pioneer Air Lines all began scheduled passenger flights to Lubbock by 1945. Braniff began with an Amarillo-Lubbock-Dallas route, Continental with a multi-stop route between El Paso and Tulsa, and Pioneer with a multi-stop route between Amarillo and Houston. Pioneer later added flights on a multi-stop route between Albuquerque and Dallas. Pioneer merged into Continental Airlines in 1955 and then Trans-Texas Airways took over the Albuquerque to Dallas route in 1963. By then Continental was flying nonstop to Dallas, Albuquerque, and El Paso however the flight to Tulsa still made stops at Wichita Falls, Lawton, and Oklahoma City. Flights to Houston stopped at Midland/Odessa and San Antonio. 

Airline jets arrived in 1965 on Braniff International Airways and 1966 on Continental Airlines. In spring 1966 Braniff BAC One-Elevens flew nonstop to Dallas Love Field and Amarillo, in addition to Lockheed L-188 Electra and Convair 340 flights, while Continental Douglas DC-9-10s flew nonstop to Dallas Love Field and El Paso in addition to Vickers Viscount flights. Trans-Texas Airways became Texas International in 1969 and began jet service with DC-9&#x27;s on a Denver-Amarillo-Lubbock-Austin-Houston route. 

By 1976 all scheduled passenger airline flights at Lubbock were jets: Braniff Boeing 727-100s and Boeing 727-200s, Continental 727-200s and Texas International Airlines Douglas DC-9-10s. A 1976 OAG lists nonstop jets to Lubbock from Albuquerque, Amarillo, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), El Paso, Midland/Odessa and Wichita Falls and direct jets from Colorado Springs, Corpus Christi, Denver, Houston (IAH), Lawton, Los Angeles (LAX), Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Tulsa. Braniff Boeing 727s flew direct from Lubbock to New York Newark Airport, Washington D.C. National Airport and Nashville.

Southwest Airlines began serving Lubbock on May 20, 1977, as an intrastate airline with Boeing 737-200s to Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby Airport, San Antonio, Corpus Christi and Harlingen. By 1978 Southwest had added nonstop 737 jet flights to El Paso in addition to nonstop jets to Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby Airport and direct jets to other Texas cities. Flights to Albuquerque were added in 1983. In 1983 Muse Air McDonnell Douglas MD-80s briefly flew nonstop to Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby Airport and Los Angeles (LAX). Muse Air later merged into Southwest Airlines.

Braniff declared bankruptcy and shut down in 1982. Continental and Texas International merged in late 1982 then Continental left Lubbock in 1983 after declaring bankrupty as well.

The late 1970&#x27;s and early 1980&#x27;s also saw several commuter airlines; Crown Air flew to Clovis and Albuquerque, NM. Air Midwest flew to Roswell, Hobbs, and Carlsbad, NM as well as Oklahoma City. Mesa Airlines also flew to Roswell, Hobbs, and Carlsbad. Permian and Trans Central Airlines both flew to Amarillo and Midland/Odessa. 

American Airlines began serving Lubbock in 1981 and Delta Air Lines in 1982, both flying nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW) and Amarillo, American with 727-200s and Delta with 737-200s. Delta left Lubbock in 2005 when they discontinued their hub operation at DFW.

Aspen Airways started flying Convair 580s direct from Denver via Amarillo in 1983. This service was later upgraded with BAe 146-100 jets and began operating as United Express in cooperation with United Airlines by 1986. The United Express service to Denver was transferred to Mesa Airlines through much of the 1990&#x27;s and has been operated by several other regional carriers since then.

In 1987 America West Airlines began flying Boeing 737-200&#x27;s nonstop from Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Midland/Odessa however this service ended in 1991.

Continental Express, operating on behalf of Continental Airlines, began direct flights to Denver in 1990 with one stop at Amarillo. This service ended in 1994. Continental returned in 1996 with nonstop flights to Houston and this service was later replaced with Embraer 145 regional jets operated by Continental Express. Continental merged into United Airlines in 2012 and United Express continues the service to Houston.

Northwest Airlink, operating on behalf of Northwest Airlines began nonstop service to Memphis in 2009 with Bombardier CRJ100/200 regional jets. Northwest was merged into Delta Air lines in 2010 marking a return to Lubbock for Delta however the service to Memphis ended in 2012.

American Eagle, operating on behalf of American Airlines, began supplementing American&#x27;s service to DFW in 1990 and began nonstop flights to Phoenix in 2016.

<text>Mantronix was an influential 1980s hip hop and electro funk music group from New York City. The band was formed by DJ Kurtis Mantronik (Kurtis el Khaleel) and rapper MC Tee (Touré Embden). The group is primarily remembered for its pioneering blend of old school hip hop, electronic, and club music. They underwent several genre and line-up changes during its seven-year existence between 1984 and 1991, and released five albums beginning with their 1985 debut &quot;The Album&quot;.

==History==
===Early years: 1984–1988 ===
Kurtis Mantronik (Kurtis el Khaleel), a Jamaican-American émigré, began experimenting with electro music in the early 1980s, inspired by early electro tracks like &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; (1980) by Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s Ryuichi Sakamoto. In 1984, while working as the in-store DJ for Downtown Records in Manhattan, Kurtis Mantronik met MC Tee, a Haitian-born, Flatbush, Brooklyn-based rapper (and regular record store customer). The duo soon made a demo, &quot;Fresh Is The Word,&quot; and eventually signed with William Socolov&#x27;s Sleeping Bag Records.

==== &quot;The Album&quot; ====
Mantronix&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Fresh Is the Word,&quot; was a club hit in 1985, reaching No. 16 on &quot;Billboard Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, and was featured on &quot;The Album&quot; which was released the same year.

Mantronix&#x27;s efforts on &quot;The Album&quot; and its effect on early hip hop and electronic music is perhaps best summed up by music critic Omar Willey&#x27;s observation in 2000:

The influence of &quot;The Album&quot; is seen among other artists through the sampling of &quot;Needle to the Groove&quot; by Beck in the single &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot; from the 1996 album, &quot;Odelay&quot; (&quot;&quot;we&#x27;ve got two turntables and a microphone&quot;...&quot;), as well as, &quot;Fresh Is The Word&quot; by the Beastie Boys in the single &quot;Jimmy James&quot; from the 1992 album, &quot;Check Your Head&quot; (&quot;&quot;for all the Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and the White people too&quot;...&quot;) The Beastie Boys later sampled &quot;Bassline&quot; for the song &quot;3 the Hard Way&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;To the 5 Boroughs&quot;.

==== &quot;Music Madness&quot; ====
Mantronix&#x27;s second album, &quot;Music Madness&quot;, was released in 1986. While MC Tee&#x27;s rhyming style on the album continued in the traditional b-boy fashion of the times, Mantronik&#x27;s club-oriented production and mixing in &quot;Music Madness&quot; tended to attract more electronic dance music and electro funk aficionados than hardcore hip-hop fans. During this period, while Mantronix was signed to Sleeping Bag Records, Mantronik was employed by the label in their A&amp;R Department, while also producing other artists and groups, including Just-Ice, T La Rock, Nocera, and Joyce Sims.

==== &quot;In Full Effect&quot; ====

Mantronix signed with Capitol Records in 1987, in what was one of the first 7-figure deals for a hip-hop group, and released &quot;In Full Effect&quot; in 1988, which, according to the liner notes, was the first album to be mastered from DAT instead of reel-to-reel tape. The album continued in and expanded on the hip-hop/electro funk/dance music vein of its predecessor, eventually reaching No. 18 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, Mantronix&#x27;s highest showing for an album. &quot;In Full Effect&quot; marked the last Mantronix album with rapper MC Tee, who left the group to enlist in the United States Air Force.

Mantronix&#x27;s 1988 track &quot;King of the Beats&quot; was one of the first songs to sample the Amen break.

===Later era: 1989–1991 ===
==== &quot;This Should Move Ya&quot; ====
Following the departure of MC Tee, rapper Bryce &quot;Luvah&quot; Wilson and Mantronik&#x27;s cousin, D.J. D., joined the group. Mantronik met Wilson, a fellow Sleeping Bag Records label mate, while doing production work for Wilson&#x27;s aborted solo project.

The album spawned two top-10 hits on the British singles chart, &quot;Got to Have Your Love&quot; at No. 4, and &quot;Take Your Time (featuring vocalist Wondress)&quot; at No. 10. In the United States, the album reached No. 61 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

In a 1991 interview, Kurtis Mantronik commented on the commercial success of &quot;Got to Have Your Love&quot;:

==== &quot;The Incredible Sound Machine&quot; ====
Mantronix&#x27;s final release, with vocalist Jade Trini replacing D.J. D, was &quot;The Incredible Sound Machine&quot; in 1991. Grammy-nominated neo soul singer/songwriter Angie Stone co-wrote seven of the eleven tracks that appeared on &quot;The Incredible Sound Machine&quot;. &quot;The Incredible Sound Machine&quot;, which tended to favor R&amp;B, new jack swing, and dance music over hip hop, was considered both a critical and commercial disappointment.

Shortly after a European tour and promotion related to the release of &quot;The Incredible Sound Machine&quot;, the group disbanded, and Mantronik left the music industry altogether for seven years.

Kurtis Mantronik resurfaced in Europe in the late 1990s, producing house- and techno-music artists, and remains active in pop-oriented electronic music.

=== 2023–present ===
In 2023 Kurtis Mantronik reformed his group Mantronix. He produced and jointly released three hip-hop songs that featured New York hip hop rapper Bruse Wane. The songs &quot;Money Talks&quot;, &quot;Era of the AI&quot;, and &quot;When the Doves Fly&quot; were jointly released by Mantronik under his Mantronix Classics Label; and Bruse Wane&#x27;s Wane Enterprises Label. Mantronik produced directed and edited three music videos for all three songs. They appeared on his Mantronix official YouTube channel. He also began doing production work for Bronx rapper Just-Ice.

<doc id="301839" wikidata="Q183187" url="?curid=301839" title="Fahd of Saudi Arabia">
<text>Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (; 1920, 1921 or 1923 – 1 August 2005) was King and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia from 13 June 1982 until his death in 2005. Prior to his ascension, he was Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia from 1975 to 1982. He was the eighth son of King Abdulaziz, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. 

Fahd was the eldest of the Sudairi Seven, the sons of King Abdulaziz by Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. He served as minister of education from 1953 to 1962 during the reign of King Saud. Afterwards he was minister of interior from 1962 to 1975, at the end of King Saud&#x27;s reign and throughout King Faisal&#x27;s reign. He was appointed crown prince when his half-brother Khalid became king following the assassination of King Faisal in 1975. Fahd was viewed as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the country during King Khalid&#x27;s reign in part due to the latter&#x27;s ill health. 

Upon the death of King Khalid in 1982, Fahd ascended to the throne. He is credited for having introduced the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia in 1992. He suffered a debilitating stroke in 1995, after which he was unable to continue performing his full official duties. His half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah served as &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the kingdom and succeeded Fahd as king upon his death in 2005. With a reign of 23 years, Fahd remains the longest-reigning Saudi king.

==Early life and education==

Fahd bin Abdulaziz was born in the walled town of Riyadh in 1920, 1921 or 1923. He was the eighth son of King Abdulaziz, and his eldest son by Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Fahd and his six full brothers are known as the Sudairi Seven. Fahd was Hassa&#x27;s second son; his elder half-brother Abdullah bin Muhammad was his mother&#x27;s only son from her previous marriage to Prince Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman, Fahd&#x27;s paternal uncle.

Fahd&#x27;s education took place at the Princes&#x27; School in Riyadh, a school established by King Abdulaziz specifically for the education of members of the House of Saud. He received education for four years as a result of his mother&#x27;s urging. While at the Princes&#x27; School, Fahd studied under tutors including Sheikh Abdul Ghani Khayat. He then went on to receive education at the Religious Knowledge Institute in Mecca.

==Early political roles==
Prince Fahd was made a member of the royal advisory board at his mother&#x27;s urging. In 1945, he traveled on his first state visit to San Francisco for the signing of the Charter of the United Nations. On this trip, he served under Prince Faisal who was at the time Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign minister. Fahd led his first official state visit in 1953, attending the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on behalf of the House of Saud. On 24 December 1953, he was appointed as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first education minister.

Prince Fahd led the Saudi delegation to the League of Arab States in 1959, signifying his increasing prominence in the House of Saud and his being groomed for a more significant role. In 1962, he was given the important post of interior minister. As interior minister, he headed the Saudi delegation at a meeting of Arab Heads of State in Egypt in 1965. At the beginning of King Faisal&#x27;s reign, Prince Fahd became a member of the council which had been established by the king to guide the succession issues. 

On 2 January 1967, Prince Fahd survived an assassination attempt when an explosion occurred in his private office at the ministry. He was not there during the incident, but the explosion injured nearly 40 staff of the ministry. 

Prince Fahd was named second deputy prime minister in 1967 when King Faisal established the office. The post was created upon the request of Crown Prince Khalid due to the fact that he himself did not want to continue to preside over the council of ministers. King Faisal was not very enthusiastic about the appointment of Prince Fahd to the post. Between October 1969 and May 1970, Prince Fahd was on leave which was regarded by Nadav Safran as an indication of major confrontation in the government. One of the reasons for this confrontation was the disagreement between King Faisal and Prince Fahd concerning security policies. King Faisal accused him of being late to implement severe measures to arrest those who had contacts with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP attacked and damaged the Saudi-owned Trans-Arabian Pipeline in the Golan Heights on 31 May 1969 and also was planning a plot against the King. During his absence which was reported by the officials as a medical leave, Prince Fahd stayed in London and then in Spain where he spent the time on gambling and leisure. King Faisal sent him both Omar Al Saqqaf, his envoy, and several letters asking him to return to the country, but Prince Fahd did not follow his request.

Prince Fahd was made the head of the Supreme Council on Petroleum in March 1973 when it was established by King Faisal. However, the relations between King Faisal and Prince Fahd were still strained due to Prince Fahd&#x27;s gambling visits to Monte Carlo, Monaco. In addition, Prince Fahd was not a supporter of the oil embargo which he regarded as a potential threat to the relationships between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America. Because of these and other disagreements, King Faisal had planned to remove Prince Fahd from the post of second deputy prime minister which was not materialized by the king.

==Crown Prince==

After the murder of King Faisal in 1975 and the accession of King Khalid, Fahd was named first deputy prime minister and concurrently crown prince. Besides King Khalid, Prince Fahd had three elder half-brothers living at that time: Muhammad, Nasser and Saad. However, Prince Muhammad had denied appointment by King Faisal as crown prince a decade prior, while Princes Nasser and Saad were both considered unsuitable candidates. By contrast, Prince Fahd had served as minister of education from 1954 to 1962 and minister of interior from 1962 to 1975.

The appointment of Prince Fahd as both crown prince and first deputy prime minister made him a much more powerful figure in contrast to the status of King Khalid when he had been crown prince during King Faisal&#x27;s reign. However, King Khalid had an influence over Fahd&#x27;s activities and limited his powers, probably due to Fahd&#x27;s very clear pro-Western views and hostile approach against Iran and the Shia population of Saudi Arabia. During this period, Crown Prince Fahd was one of the members of the inner family council led by King Khalid, which included Fahd&#x27;s brothers Muhammad, Abdullah, Sultan and Abdul Muhsin and his uncles Ahmed and Musaid.

==Reign==

When King Khalid died on 13 June 1982, Fahd succeeded to the throne being the fifth king of Saudi Arabia. However, the most active period of his life was not his reign, but when he was Crown Prince. King Fahd adopted the title &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; in 1986, replacing &quot;His Majesty&quot;, to signify an Islamic rather than secular authority.

Unlike the reigns of King Faisal and King Khalid, his reign witnessed significant decrease in the oil price which sharply reduced the oil revenues of Saudi Arabia. Due to this, Madawi Al Rasheed described the reign of King Fahd as the era of austerity in contrast to the period of affluence experienced under his two predecessors.

===Foreign policy===

Fearing that the 1979 Revolution in Iran could lead to similar Islamic upheaval in Saudi Arabia, Fahd spent considerable sums, after ascending the throne in 1982, to support Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Baathist Iraq in its war with Iran. In fact, according to United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Fahd told Haig in April 1981 that he had been used as an intermediary by President Jimmy Carter to convey an official U.S. &quot;green light to launch the war against Iran&quot; to Iraq, although there is considerable skepticism about this claim.

Fahd was a supporter of the United Nations. He supported foreign aid and gave 5.5% of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s national income through various funds, especially the Saudi Fund for Development and the OPEC Fund for International Development. He also gave aid to foreign groups such as the Bosnian Muslims in the Yugoslav Wars, as well as the Nicaraguan Contras, providing &quot;a million dollars per month from May to December 1984&quot;. King Fahd was also a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and an opponent of the State of Israel. Towards the beginning of Fahd&#x27;s reign, he was a staunch ally of the United States. However, Fahd distanced himself from the US throughout parts of his reign, declining to allow the US to use Saudi air bases to protect naval convoys after the attack on the USS Stark, and in 1988 agreed to buy between fifty and sixty nuclear-payload-capable CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missiles.

King Fahd developed a peace plan in order to resolve Arab differences particularly between Algeria and Morocco. In 1981, he formulated a peace plan for the Middle East to resolve the Arab–Israeli conflict, which was adopted by the Arab League the following year. The initiative, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for the return of Palestinian territories, was revived in almost the same form at a meeting of the League in 2002. He also actively contributed to the Taif accord in 1989 that ended conflict in Lebanon. In addition, he led the Arab world against the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. He developed a special bond with both Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Egyptian President Hosni Mobarak during his reign. Due to King Fahd&#x27;s support to Hafez al-Assad, Arab countries did not manage to realize their decision to end Syrian presence in Lebanon in the summit of the Arab League held in Casablanca, Morocco, in May 1989.

===Islamic activities===
He supported the conservative Saudi religious establishment, including spending millions of dollars on religious education, strengthened separation of the sexes and power of the religious police, publicly endorsed Sheikh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz&#x27;s warning to young Saudis to avoid the path of evil by not traveling to Europe and the United States. This further distanced him from his inconvenient past.

===Gulf War, 1991===
In 1990, Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, placing the Iraqi army (then the largest in the Middle East) on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. King Fahd agreed to host American-led coalition troops in his Kingdom and later allowed American troops to be based there. This decision brought him considerable criticism and opposition from many Saudi citizens, who objected to the presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil; this was a casus belli against the Saudi royal family prominently cited by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. His decision was also objected to by his full brothers or the Sudairi Seven. Another cause for criticism came when during an event with the British Royal Family, King Fahd was seen wearing a white decoration in the shape of a cross; in 1994 Bin Laden cited this as &quot;abomination&quot; and &quot;clearly infidelity&quot;.

===Reform and industrialization===
King Fahd showed little tolerance for reformists. In 1992, a group of reformists and prominent Saudi intellectuals petitioned King Fahd for wide-ranging reforms, including widening political representation and curbing the royal family&#x27;s wasteful spending. King Fahd first responded by ignoring their requests and when they persisted, reformists were harshly persecuted, imprisoned, and fired from their jobs.

During King Fahd&#x27;s rule, the royal family&#x27;s lavish spending of the country&#x27;s wealth reached its height. In addition, the biggest and most controversial military contract of the century, the Al-Yamamah arms deal was signed on his watch. The contract has cost the Saudi treasury more than $90 billion. These funds were originally allocated to building hospitals, schools, universities, and roads. As a result, Saudi Arabia endured a stagnation in infrastructure development from 1986 until 2005 when the new King, Abdullah, fully came into power.

Like all the countries bordering the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia under King Fahd focused its industrial development on hydrocarbon installations. Up to this day, the country is reliant on imports for nearly all its light and heavy machinery.

King Fahd established a Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs directed by senior family members and technocrats in 1994. The council was planned to function as an ombudsman of Islamic activity concerning educational, economic, and foreign policy matters. The chairman of the council was Prince Sultan. Prince Nayef, Prince Saud Al Faisal and technocrat Mohammed bin Ali Aba Al Khail were appointed to the newly established council. One of the covert purposes of the council was thought to be to reduce the power of the Ulemas Council that had been increasing its power.

===Succession mechanism===
In an effort to institutionalize succession, King Fahd issued a decree on 1 March 1992. The decree expanded the criteria for succession, which had been only seniority and family consensus, and led to speculations. The most significant change by the edict was that the King did acquire the right to appoint or dismiss his heir apparent based on suitability rather than seniority and that the grandsons of Abdulaziz became eligible for the throne.

===Increasing disparity in Saudi society===

With a growing population during King Fahd&#x27;s rule, the already weak local education system saw a lot more strain being put into it. Due to the decline in oil prices during the early years of his reign, previous initiatives by Faisal and Khalid before him to modernise the education system saw significant setback. The local Saudi education system remained better equipped to teach humanities, with Islamic studies getting more preference under increasing pressure from clerics. As a result, a significant proportion of Saudis would end up studying abroad, typically majoring in the sciences and/or management.

Another consequence of this was the formation of two distinct and increasingly polarised spheres amongst university-educated Saudis. Foreign educated returnees from American and European universities typically occupied well-paid jobs in prestigious ministries with high salaries added with the prestige of being the vanguard of the civil service and government-owned corporations keeping the kingdom on its feet. This was due to such graduates having acquired technical and linguistic skills necessary for such jobs. Meanwhile, local educated Saudis, often having graduated from humanities, found themselves working low-ranking, clerical jobs in the civil service with modest salaries. 

Overtime, this lead to growing resentment amongst local graduates. Anti-western rhetoric and a call to return to an ultra-orthodox and more religious lifestyle by Wahhabi clerics grew more popular amongst this segment of Saudi society. This was further worsened by increased competition as oil prices continued to drop and more foreign workers kept being issues visas to work in the kingdom. 

During this period, the phenomenon of having the same family being divided amongst these lines become more common. The archetype of the ultraconservative Saudi man preaching to his family and friends, showing strong distaste for Western culture, listening to religious cassettes and refusing to take pictures would begin to be cultivated. The term &quot;mutawwa&quot;&#x27; would often be used pejoratively by more liberal Saudis to describe such conservative Saudis.

===1995 stroke and aftermath===

King Fahd was a heavy smoker, overweight for much of his adult life, and in his sixties began to suffer from arthritis and severe diabetes. He suffered a debilitating stroke on 29 November 1995 and became noticeably frail, and decided to delegate the running of the Kingdom to Crown Prince Abdullah on 2 January 1996. On 21 February, King Fahd resumed official duties.

After his stroke, King Fahd was partly inactive and had to use a cane and then a wheelchair, though he still attended meetings and received selected visitors. In November 2003, according to government media, King Fahd was quoted as saying to &quot;strike with an iron fist&quot; at terrorists after deadly bombings in Saudi Arabia, although he could hardly utter a word because of his deteriorating health. However, it was Crown Prince Abdullah who took official trips; when King Fahd traveled, it was for vacations, and he was sometimes absent from Saudi Arabia for months at a time. When his oldest son and International Olympic Committee member Prince Faisal bin Fahd died in 1999, the King was in Spain and did not return for the funeral.

In a speech to an Islamic conference on 30 August 2003, King Fahd condemned terrorism and exhorted Muslim clerics to emphasize peace, security, cooperation, justice, and tolerance in their sermons.

==Wealth==
&quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; reported his wealth in 1988 at $18 billion (making him the second-richest person in the world at that time). &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Fahd&#x27;s wealth to be $25 billion in 2002. In addition to residences in Saudi Arabia, he had a palace on Spain&#x27;s Costa del Sol which made Marbella a famous place.

===Recreational activities===
King Fahd was known to enjoy luxurious living abroad and a lavish lifestyle. He visited the ports of the French Riviera in his yacht, the US$100 million Prince Abdulaziz. The ship featured two swimming pools, a ballroom, a gym, a theatre, a portable garden, a hospital with an intensive-care unit and two operating rooms, and four American Stinger missiles. The king also had a personal $US150 million Boeing 747 jet, equipped with his own fountain. In Fahd&#x27;s younger years, he used to engage in activities considered un-Islamic, such as drinking and gambling. Fahd reportedly lost millions of dollars in casinos and started using illegal methods to regain the same amount. When Fahd&#x27;s brothers found out about his habits which were considered a disgrace to the House of Saud, he was immediately summoned to King Faisal&#x27;s palace. Upon arrival, King Faisal slapped him across the face. From then on, Fahd was more circumspect and put a stop to his un-Islamic habits.

==Personal life==

==Death==

King Fahd was admitted to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh on 27 May 2005 in &quot;stable but serious condition&quot; for unspecified medical tests. An official (who insisted on anonymity) told the Associated Press unofficially that the king had died at 07:30 on 1 August 2005 at age 84. Official statement was announced on state television at 10:00 by Information Minister Iyad Madani.

===Funeral===
King Fahd was buried in the last &quot;thawb&quot; (traditional Arab robe) he wore. Fahd&#x27;s body was carried to Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque, and funeral prayers were held at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) on 2 August. The prayers for the late monarch were led by the Kingdom&#x27;s grand mufti, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh.

The King&#x27;s son Abdulaziz carried the body to the mosque and to the Al Oud cemetery, Riyadh, some two kilometres away, a public cemetery where Fahd&#x27;s four predecessors and other members of the Al Saud ruling family are buried.

Arab and Muslim dignitaries who attended the funeral were not present at the burial. Only ruling family members and Saudi citizens were on hand as the body was lowered into the grave.

Muslim leaders offered condolences at the mosque, while other foreign dignitaries and leaders who came after the funeral paid their respects at the royal court.

In accordance with regulations and social traditions, Saudi Arabia declared a national mourning period of three days during which all offices were closed. Government offices remained closed for the rest of the week. The state flag was not lowered (since the flag of Saudi Arabia bears the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith, the flag&#x27;s protocol requires the flag not to be lowered).

After Fahd&#x27;s death, many Arab countries declared mourning periods. Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Syria, Yemen, the Arab League in Cairo, and the Palestinian Authority all declared three-day mourning periods. Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates declared a seven-day mourning period and ordered all flags flown at half-staff. In Jordan, a national three-day mourning period was declared and a 40-day mourning period was decreed at the Royal Court.

<text>Sacramento International Airport is an international airport located in Sacramento, northwest of Downtown Sacramento in Sacramento County, California, United States and covers . It serves the Sacramento Metropolitan Area, and it is run by the Sacramento County Airport System.

The airport is also a gateway to various attractions in Northern and Central California, such as Heavenly Mountain Resort, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite National Park, Old Sacramento State Historic Park history of gold rush, underground tunnels, floods, and fire, etc., California State Capitol, Wine Country, Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area, Cosumnes River Preserve, Hawver Cave with a lake inside, Sutter&#x27;s Mill and Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park and Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta.

== History ==
Sacramento International Airport (SMF) opened on October 21, 1967, as Sacramento Metropolitan Airport (the airfield itself was Sacramento Metropolitan Field), with one 8600-foot runway. The initial runway was on the west side of the airfield and is now named to the headings of 17R/35L. Previously, air service to Sacramento was handled by Sacramento Municipal Airport (SAC), now known as Sacramento Executive Airport. Sacramento Metropolitan was the first purpose-built public-use airport west of the Mississippi when it opened in 1967. All airports under the Sacramento County Airport System (previously the Sacramento County Department of Airports), including SMF, are self-supporting through user fees and rentals. No local, state or federal tax funds are used for operating costs.

The airport initially had five airlines: Pacific Air Lines, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), United Airlines, Western Airlines and West Coast Airlines.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In the 1980s, SMF added: the in-flight catering facility (1980), an FAA Flight Inspection Field Office (1985), a second air cargo facility (1985) and the east runway (1987). The east runway&#x27;s opening was celebrated by the landing of a Concorde SST. America West Airlines, Continental Airlines, Morris Air, Northwest Airlines and American Eagle Airlines joined the original carriers at Sacramento Metropolitan Airport during this time.

In 1998, the consolidated rental car facility and Terminal A (designed by Dreyfuss &amp; Blackford Architects) opened. The consolidated rental car terminal was the first of its kind in the nation and gave all rental car customers a single point of access that could be reached on a single shuttle. This innovation streamlined bus operations to reduce congestion at the terminal and improve air quality while enhancing customer service.

With the opening of the new Terminal A, the airport was renamed Sacramento International Airport, though it did not receive international flights until 2002 when Mexicana started nonstops to Guadalajara. The airport was designated a port of entry on October 5, 2006.

The Sacramento County Airport System launched its website in April 1997.

Southwest Airlines (1991), Alaska Airlines (1993), Horizon Air (1993) and Trans World Airlines (TWA) (1994) were added to the list of carriers at Sacramento. Southwest and Alaska Airlines grew quickly, offsetting the departure of airlines such as American Eagle, Continental and USAir which had acquired PSA.

=== 21st century: New challenges, opportunities and growth ===
September 11 did not deter growth at Sacramento International Airport. Four airlines were soon added to Sacramento International: Continental returned (2000) and Frontier 
Airlines (2002), Mexicana Airlines (2002), Hawaiian Airlines (2002) and Aloha Airlines (2003) initiated service. Mexicana&#x27;s arrival initiated international nonstop flights and necessitated the completion of the International Arrivals Building for federal inspection services.
The Terminal A Parking Garage opened on September 23, 2004. The six-story structure had covered parking, a short walk to the terminal and public art (&quot;Flying Gardens&quot; by Dennis Oppenheim) installed outside the garage, and &quot;Flying Carpet&quot; by Seyed Alavi, installed in the connecting walkway.

In 2006, Sacramento International Airport was one of the first airports in the nation to offer free wireless Internet service (WiFi).

==== Industry churn ====
As the nation&#x27;s economy was taking a hit in 2008, commercial aviation was challenged by reduced passenger numbers and increasing fuel and other costs. The airport was a focus city for ExpressJet which independently operated Embraer ERJ-145s on point-to-point, &quot;hub bypass&quot; routes. In 2008, ExpressJet ended all independent flying and refocused its business on codeshares for major airlines.

Prior to the downturn, new services began and several airlines merged. America West and US Airways merged, Northwest and Delta merged, and United and Continental initiated their merger by the end of 2011. Despite these challenges, Alaska added nonstop flights to Guadalajara, Mexico (now discontinued), and Hawaii (Maui) while Aeromexico&#x27;s (2011) debut reestablished foreign-flag service with daily nonstops to Guadalajara, Mexico. The new Terminal B opened on October 6, 2011, the largest airport terminal in the United States to achieve LEED Silver status.

On June 5, 2008 US Airways began seasonal flights to Charlotte and Philadelphia. Sacramento was the origin for the last scheduled MD-80 flight on Alaska Airlines, Flight 363 from Sacramento to Seattle on August 24, 2008. In the summer of 2010, Delta Air Lines began seasonal flights to Detroit. Continental Airlines, which later merged with United Airlines, previously had seasonal flights to Newark. Sacramento&#x27;s seasonal route operated during the summer and fall. On January 6, 2013, Frontier Airlines ended service to Denver. US Airways previously flew to Las Vegas, but ended service after closing its Las Vegas hub.

Long dominated by Southwest and United (United Express), the intra-California market was joined in 2011 by American (American Eagle Airlines, April 2011) and Delta (Delta Connection) which provide service to and from LAX. Frontier Airlines previously provided service between SMF and Redding.

Sacramento County tried (and failed) to entice Virgin America into adding a flight between SMF and Los Angeles by offering the airline $400,000 to operate out of terminal A or $150,000 to operate in terminal B; other airports were also trying to entice the airline.

==== Recent developments ====
On July 6, 2013, the airport was one of ten airports that hosted flights diverted from San Francisco International Airport after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed short of the runway.

On December 17, 2013, Aeroméxico began seasonal service to Del Bajío International Airport.

On November 18, 2014, United Airlines announced it would suspend service to Washington D.C. from January 6, 2015, to April 6, 2015, citing seasonal demand. On May 4, 2015 Delta Air Lines started service to Seattle–Tacoma with the flights operated by SkyWest Airlines. On December 3, 2014, United Express ended service to Arcata/Eureka and Crescent City. On February 9, 2015, SeaPort Airlines began service to Visalia. On June 18, 2015, JetBlue Airways started seasonal service to Boston. On April 8, 2015, Southwest Airlines started service to Dallas–Love. They also announced (later in the year) service to Boise beginning January 6, 2016. On March 26, 2015, Aeroméxico started service to Mexico City. In the month of May, American Airlines added a fifth flight to Dallas Fort-Worth.

On April 23, 2015, the airport announced that it had posted twelve consecutive months of improved passenger traffic that started in April 2014, and 8.9 million passengers were served in 2014. Passenger growth continued in 2015 and 2016, with 9.6 million passengers served in 2015 and 10.1 million in 2016. In 2017, the airport surpassed its 2007 high of 10.7 million passengers, with 10.9 million passengers. Amongst the 35 largest metropolitan regions in the country, Sacramento has the fewest international flights.

In 2016, American Airlines announced that it would begin flying between Sacramento and Chicago O&#x27;Hare beginning in June with twice daily flights for the summer season and a single nonstop the rest of the year.

In 2017, Southwest added nonstop service to Long Beach and Spokane, Air Canada resumed its nonstop service to Vancouver, and United added nonstop service to Newark.

In 2018, Southwest added nonstop service to Austin, New Orleans, Orlando, San Jose del Cabo, and St. Louis.

By 2019, Southwest added much-awaited service to Honolulu and Kahului, exemplifying the evolution and growth of Sacramento International Airport as well as its burgeoning route network offerings, especially in the 2010s.

On June 1, 2023, Air Canada expanded its service at SMF by adding nonstop service to Toronto year-round.

On June 15, 2023, the Sacramento County Department of Airports announced funding had been secured for the construction of a new air traffic control tower to replace the original tower that had been in place since the airport opened in 1967. The new tower will be constructed at a site located on the north side of the Airport. It will stand 192-feet in height and the current cost estimate is between $60 million and $80 million. Construction is expected to finish by 2026.

=== Solar power ===
In January 2018, Sacramento International Airport&#x27;s solar array was commissioned; it is rated at 7.9 MW and will supply around 30% of the airport&#x27;s electricity needs. The electricity will be purchased by NRG Energy for an agreed period of 25 years. The project was built by Borrego Solar using LG solar panels at a cost of $15 million. The solar power costs 7 cents per kWh as opposed to 9 cents, so the airport expects to save nearly $1 million annually.

=== SMForward and potential new terminal ===

On February 1, 2023, the airport announced a $1.3 Billion dollar expansion that would surpass the Big Build project as the largest expansion in the airport&#x27;s history. Called SMForward, this expansion covers the first 5 years of expansion that will ultimately lead to the completion of the 20 year Master Plan envisioned in 2020. Over the next five years, the airport plans to build complete the following:

* Building modifications that will add three new gates. Two new gates in Concourse B and one new gate in Terminal A. Construction begins in July 2024 and be completed by spring 2025. The projected cost at $16.5 million.
* A new $140 Million pedestrian walkway that will be adjacent to the Automated People Mover (APM) that can be used as an alternative to the APM and can connect passengers to a potential Terminal C. This project is expected to start in the summer of 2024 and complete in the Spring of 2026.
* A concourse expansion that will add another 6 to 8 new gates on the western side of Terminal B. Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2025 and be complete in the first quarter of 2028.
* An expansion of the Terminal A lobby to add a new baggage claim carousel and additional ticketing space. Construction is expected to begin in the winter of 2024 and be complete in the spring of 2027.
* A new 4,500-5,500 space parking garage that will replace a parking lot adjacent to Terminal B. Construction is expected to start in the fall of 2024 and be complete by the fourth quarter of 2026.
* A $55 Million consolidated transportation ground transportation center that will allow ride-share services, taxis, and shuttles to serve both Terminals. Construction is expected to start in the summer of 2026 and be complete by the summer of 2027.
* A $390 Million rental car facility south of the parking garage adjacent to Terminal A. This will allow passengers to walk from either Terminal to access the rental car service. Construction is expected to start in the fall of 2025 and be complete by N/A.

The current version of the 2020 Master Plan calls for SMF to expand and add up to 18 more new gates to existing Terminals A and B, including the proposed six to eight gates proposed with SMForward, or to construct a new Terminal C that would contain 12 gates. At buildout, SMF is expected to have 50 gates over two or three Terminals. Future expansion plans include an extension of the Green Line to the airport, connecting passengers to Downtown Sacramento and a long-standing proposal to extend one of the airport&#x27;s runways to 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) to support long-haul international flights, as well as the relocation of certain key taxiways.

In mid-2024, construction began on the pedestrian walkway connecting Terminal B to Concourse B. Preparation for the new parking garage to the west of Terminal B also started, with the current Daily B parking lot being closed to passengers.

== Facilities ==

Sacramento International Airport covers and has two parallel runways:
* 17L/35R: , concrete
* 17R/35L: , concrete

The runways were redesignated 17/35 from 16/34 on May 20, 2020.

The west runway, 17R/35L, was closed from April 2019 to October 23, 2019, for a renovation which replaced the asphalt with concrete.

When winds are from the south (about 70% of the year), the airfield operates in &quot;South Flow&quot;, with arrivals and departures on runways 17R and 17L. Arrivals from the south fly past the west side of the airport before turning 180 degrees and landing on 17L or 17R. This is done so that arriving aircraft clear departing aircraft, which generally turn southeast after departing.

During the other 30% of the year (typically between the fall and spring), the airfield operates in &quot;North Flow&quot;, with arrivals and departures on runways 35L and 35R. As in South Flow, departing aircraft generally turn east to southeast immediately after taking off, so arrivals from the north pass west of the airport before turning north to land. Residences near SMF are typically south and east of the airport, so North Flow is preferred at night (between 2145 and 0745 local time), conditions permitting, to route flights over agricultural land.

== Terminals ==

The airport has two terminals, Terminal A, with 13 gates; and Terminal B, with 19 gates; totaling 32 gates. The old Terminal B had 14 gates. 8 airlines operate out of Terminal B and 4 airlines operate out of Terminal A. All indoor public areas have free wi-fi (wireless Internet) provided by the Sacramento County Airport System.

Dreyfuss + Blackford Architecture has been the Architect of Record for SMF since its inception. The original Terminal B (1967) and Terminal A (1998) were designed by Dreyfuss + Blackford, and they served as the local architect for the new Central Terminal B (landside building, 2011) with Corgan Associates and Fentress Architects.

A Hyatt Place hotel is planned to be built between the two current terminals. Previously, the onsite Host Hotel was demolished in 2008 during Terminal B construction. An in-terminal hotel was proposed for Terminal B, but plans were temporarily dropped during the economic downturn of 2008, although subsequent economic regeneration and aviation growth have since revitalized such plans.

Sacramento County Airport System has rolled out an advertising campaign dubbed &quot;Easy as SMF&quot; to tout the convenience of flying through SMF for residents on the eastern edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. Due to the Terminal B rebuild, until recently SMF charged some of the highest fees for airlines, which discouraged some carriers from operating through SMF, although SMF has since regained its reputation as a relatively budget-friendly airport, with extensive service by low-cost carriers, such as Frontier and Spirit Airlines. The Oakland and San Francisco airports attract Sacramento-area residents seeking lower fares and more destinations.

=== Terminal A ===

Air Canada, American, Delta, and United operate out of the thirteen gates in Terminal A.

Terminal A opened in 1998 with of floor space and 12 gates, able to accommodate expansion to 22 gates. The food court in Terminal A was remodeled in 2014–15 in an effort to bring a similar customer experience with unique-to-Sacramento restaurants as provided in Terminal B. Also, the airport re-added another gate back into its Terminal A and opened on March 18, 2021, the new gate A13 to a total back to 13 gates. Future expansion at Terminal A may include conversion to an airside concourse and the addition of a second automated people mover.

In 2024, a pair of new escalators were added to Terminal A. They connect the second floor to baggage claim and are adjacent to the exit of the sterile area.

=== Terminal B ===
Aeromexico, Alaska, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and Volaris are located in the nineteen gates in Terminal B.

The old Terminal B was built in 1967 as the main terminal building for the new Sacramento Metropolitan Airport with 14 gates before being demolished in 2012. The newer and bigger rebuilt Terminal B was completed and opened in 2011 with 19 gates, but the original plan was supposed to be 22 gates in total due to the high costs. Dreyfuss + Blackford, the original architects, also designed a renovation and expansion completed in 1999. By that time, Terminal A was complete and frequent travelers described the 1967 Terminal B as &quot;often overcrowded with waiting travelers.&quot;

==== Expansion project ====

On June 7, 2006, plans were announced to replace Terminal B with a brand new terminal by the year 2012. In 2008, the Sacramento County Airport System broke ground on the largest capital improvement project in the history of the County of Sacramento: &quot;The Big Build.&quot; The expanded Terminal B was designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. in association with Fentress Architects. The landside (pre-security) portion of Terminal B was built by the joint venture of Austin Commercial, LP and Walsh Construction, and the glass and aluminum facade was constructed by AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum). The airside gates and people mover were built by Turner Construction. The $1.03 billion terminal modernization project replaced the airport&#x27;s original, aging Terminal B to meet the rising demand for passenger services and improved the airport&#x27;s ability to attract new carriers and routes.

The Central Terminal B complex is three times the size of the original Terminal B with the two parts of the complex – airside and landside – connected by the SMF Automated People Mover. The capacity of Terminal B is 16 million passengers per year, which is not expected to be reached until late in the 2020s. Approximately half of the $1 billion cost of the new terminal comes from a new ticket surcharge of $4.50 per passenger and parking fees.

Airport officials held a press conference on July 15, 2011, at the California State Fair, announcing the terminal would open on October 6, 2011. This was many months ahead of schedule compared to the original projected opening in 2012.
d
The new Central Terminal B became fully operational on October 6, 2011. Salvage and deconstruction of the International Arrivals Building and demolition of the original Terminal B was completed November 2012. &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; named Terminal B one of the &quot;Coolest New Airport Terminals&quot; in 2012.

The airport&#x27;s first waiter-serviced restaurants were introduced to the new Terminal B when it opened. These two restaurants are Esquire Grill by famous restaurateur Randy Paragary, a trendy and upscale option, and Cafeteria 15L, a low-cost and budget-inspired restaurant with fast food. Other Sacramento favorites held concession stands in the terminal, creating an entirely new Farm To Fork vibe in the airport which Northern California is so renowned for.

The Terminal B lobby prominently features the 2011 artwork &quot;Leap&quot; by Lawrence Argent, consisting of a long red aluminum rabbit leaping into a large granite suitcase, resulting in the unofficial nickname &quot;the Hare-port.&quot; In total, 14 artists were commissioned at a sum cost of $6 million to create artworks for the new Terminal B, including the mixed media wood-and-crystal sculpture &quot;Acorn Steam&quot; by Donald Lipski (named as an anagram of &quot;Sacramento&quot;), the interactive &quot;Your Words are Music to My Ears&quot; by the collaboration Living Lenses, consisting of artists Po Shu Wang and Louise Bertelsen, a large wooden sculpture portrait entitled &quot;The Baggage Handlers&quot; by Christian Moeller, and a painted steel-and-glass house entitled &quot;The House Will Not Pass for Any Color but Its Own&quot; by Mildred Howard.

*From 1957-2024, 364,078,377 passengers (enplaned+deplaned) have passed through Sacramento Int&#x27;l Airport, annual average of 5,354,094 passengers per year.

== Ground transportation ==

=== Road ===
The airport is accessed via Airport Boulevard directly from Interstate 5 at exit 528. The following can be reached via I-5 within 10 miles (16.09 km) of the airport: Interstate 80, CA-113, U.S. Route 50 and CA-99. A new entryway into the airport, which involves extending Elkhorn Boulevard from its former western terminus at Power Line Road to the Crossfield Drive/Airport Boulevard interchange, provides a direct connection from the airport to CA-99 at exit 307. The one-mile (1.6 km) extension project, which broke ground on April 29, 2023, was expected to be completed by the end of 2023, but was pushed back to 2024. Construction of the extension was eventually completed and was officially opened to traffic on May 21, 2024.

=== Public transit ===
Yolobus bus No. 42A connects the airport to Sacramento, Woodland and Davis. Sacramento Regional Transit bus Express No. 142 and Yolobus bus No. 42B connect directly from downtown Sacramento to SMF.

====Rail====
The Sacramento Regional Transit District will provide a future light rail link, an extension of the Green Line, to the airport. Environmental evaluation, clearance and construction for the Green Line was projected to be complete by 2018, but the project was never completed and had been delayed for the past few years.

Both Altamont Corridor Express and Amtrak California &quot;San Joaquins&quot; services are expected to terminate at a nearby planned Natomas/Airport station where bus bridges will complete the journey to the airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On the afternoon of Thursday, August 26, 2010, JetBlue Flight 262, an Airbus A320 arriving from Long Beach blew four tires upon landing, creating a fire around the plane and causing passengers to evacuate. Out of the 84 passengers and crew, seven sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. A JetBlue spokesman said that the flight reported an issue with the brakes. The subsequent NTSB investigation showed the first officer had inadvertently engaged the parking brake while engaging the speed brake at an altitude of about above sea level. The subsequent alert via Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring was also canceled by the first officer as part of his routine to preempt the alert associated with disconnecting the autopilot in preparation for landing.
* At about 6:30 PM on Tuesday, December 27, 2011, Seattle-bound Southwest Airlines Flight 2287 aborted take-off due to two blown-out tires. The plane reportedly made a hard landing; all 130 passengers aboard survived.
* Shortly before 6:00 PM on Wednesday, October 15, 2014, a pilot on an in-bound FedEx Express McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 noticed a possible engine fire on one of the engines, with smoke showing. The aircraft declared an emergency and landed successfully. Emergency services responded to the incident and determined that the on-board extinguishers had successfully extinguished the fire. Maintenance crews determined the aircraft could safely be towed to the cargo ramp for inspection and repairs.
* On Wednesday, November 25, 2015, around 5:45 pm, United Airlines Flight 2005 from Sacramento to Denver,, an Airbus A320 with 114 people on board, was forced to turn around after an engine was damaged by a bird strike. About 10 minutes into the flight, the bird strike and subsequent explosion in the engine forced the plane to return to the airport. It landed at about 6:30 p.m., with no injuries reported. The airliner was taken out of service to make repairs to the engine.
* On Tuesday, June 7, 2022, at 1:31 PM, A Fedex McDonnell Douglas MD-10, registration N306FE performing flight FedEx 463 from Sacramento, to Memphis, was en-route at 31,000 feet, when the crew decided to divert to Tulsa due to a fire indication in the cargo bay. On approach, the crew reported an additional cargo fire alert in the aft cargo area. The crew requested runway 18L and landed safely about 18 minutes after leaving FL310. The tower reported seeing no smoke from the aircraft. Emergency services reported a heat signature prompting the crew to evacuate the aircraft. Both runways at Tulsa were closed for about 30 minutes while emergency services put the fire out.
* On Tuesday, Jan 10, 2023, at about 6pm, Southwest Airlines Flight 1096 from Sacramento to Burbank experienced a bird strike on the left engine just a few minutes after takeoff. The crew declared an emergency and returned back to Sacramento. On the ground, an Alert 2 was declared and emergency vehicles were deployed. After circling to burn fuel, the aircraft made an uneventful landing back on runway 17L. The flight was carrying passengers, including the UC Davis men&#x27;s basketball team.

<doc id="301844" wikidata="Q3244998" url="?curid=301844" title="Willie D">
<text>William James Dennis (born November 1, 1966) is an American rapper from Houston, Texas. He emerged as a member of the hip hop group Geto Boys, which he formed in 1986 alongside fellow Houston rappers Bushwick Bill and Scarface. He signed with the regionally-based label Rap-A-Lot Records to release his albums &quot;Controversy&quot; (1989) and &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Out Lika Soldier&quot; (1992), the latter of which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

As an online broadcaster, he has been outspoken on political and social issues in Houston. His YouTube channel, created in 2011, has gained one million subscribers as of 2024.

== Early life ==
Willie took up boxing at the age of 11. In 1985, he became the Golden Gloves Champion for the State of Texas. Rather than become a professional boxer, he decided to become a rap music MC. He attended Forest Brook High School but in 1984, two months prior to his scheduled graduation, he was expelled for fighting. He never returned to school.

== Career ==
His reputation reached J Prince, founder of Rap-A-Lot Records. At the time Prince was looking to revamp the Geto Boys and knew that Willie D would be a key factor in the group&#x27;s success. Once Willie D was on board, Scarface was added to complete the group.

Considered the classic line up, Willie D, Bushwick Bill, and Scarface first emerged as the Geto Boys in 1989 with their gold record, &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot;. The record contained the songs &quot;Gangster of Love,&quot; &quot;Do It Like a G.O.,&quot; &quot;Size Ain&#x27;t Shit,&quot; and &quot;Read These Nikes,&quot; all penned by Willie D. Willie went on to record a string of critical and commercially successful solo and group albums including the Geto Boys&#x27; &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot; (platinum), which featured the single &quot;Mind Playing Tricks on Me,&quot; co-written by Willie D.

In 2009, Willie D was featured on a song called &quot;Down South Hustlaz&quot;, along with Young Buck, Trae, Bun B, and Rick Ross.

He was featured on a track on &quot;Mike E. Clark&#x27;s Extra Pop Emporium&quot; along with &quot;Insane Clown Posse&quot; and &quot;Twiztid&quot; called Scrubstitute Teachers. In April 2012, he released &quot;Hoodiez&quot; featuring Scarface, D-Boi and Propain. The song quickly went viral and became an internet hit. It is a tribute to slain teenager Trayvon Martin who was shot by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman.

== Family ==

Willie D&#x27;s mother, Marvelous Dennis, who later became Marvelous Basey through marriage (died February 14, 1994), was born in Houston, Texas. She named him after his maternal grandfather, Willie Dennis. She was a cafeteria cook for the Houston Independent School District (HISD) for several years. His father, Alfred Deboest (died May 17, 1998), was from Lake Charles, Louisiana. He was a carpenter and construction worker by trade.

Willie D was raised by his mother in Houston after his parents separated when he was four-years old. He has stated in interviews that both his parents were alcoholics and that his mother was physically and verbally abusive. Although he rarely saw his dad while growing up, when it was discovered that his father had lung cancer, Willie D took him in to live with him before he succumbed to the disease. Furthermore, despite a troubled relationship with his mother, in 1991 he took his first large paycheck from his music royalties and purchased a four-bedroom house for her while he was still living in an apartment.

On September 3, 1994, he married Bridget Bonier, who is a mechanical engineer, in a private ceremony on a yacht in Clear Lake City, Texas. They have two children, a daughter, Caen (pronounced Cain), who was born April 26, 1995, and a son, Blake, born July 8, 1999. They were divorced in 2010. Willie D has four siblings, Karen Williams (half), Warren Vann (half), Ernestine Dennis, and Isaac Dennis (half).

== Boxing career ==
Willie D began boxing at the age of 11, and won the Golden Gloves for the state of Texas in 1985. He went on to choose a career as a rapper over turning professional, but he eventually returned to boxing during the 1990s. He won his first professional fight in 1992, knocking out Melle Mel at a charity boxing show by accident after the two bumped heads in the first round. Willie D had two more fights between 1999 and 2000, beating Charles Aguilera by TKO in October 1999 and John Tarmon by KO in June 2000, and drew against John Washington on August 24, 2000. In Willie D&#x27;s last professional fight, he lost to Yameen Muhammad by TKO in October 2000.

== Legal issues ==
In 1984 after turning 18, Dennis and Ronald Hope were arrested for holding up a gas station and were held for several months awaiting trial. A 1992 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article stated that Dennis did six months in jail for aggravated robbery. Dennis was still in attendance at Forest Brook High School prior to his 1986 expulsion.

Dennis was sentenced to deferred adjudication in 1994 for an alleged theft of service concerning a car repair bill.

Dennis was arrested by FBI agents on May 13, 2009, on federal wire fraud charges, stemming from his purported sales of Apple iPhones through a company known as Texas One Wireless after luring potential buyers off Ebay (which he had used to build a reputation as a reliable seller); victims would pay for the electronics, after which all contact would cease and their products would fail to be delivered. The total amount defrauded was alleged to be $194,087.17 (according to authorities investigation the 35 claims of fraud related to the case). Willie D was sentenced to a year in federal prison in December 2010 after pleading guilty to all charges. He was given BOP#99063-179 and spent his sentence at FCI Beaumont and FDC Houston.

== Cryptocurrency==
Willie D partnered with Saitama Inu token. This token was later found to be a fraud, resulting in first-ever criminal charges against financial services firms for market manipulation and “wash trading” in the cryptocurrency industry.

<text>Three Times Dope was an American hip hop/rap group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania consisting of EST ([[Robert Waller (musician)|Robert Waller]]), Chuck Nice (Walter Griggs) and Woody Wood (Duerwood Beale). 3xD, as they were called for short, were a part of the Hilltop Hustlers Crew (which also included Steady B, Cool C, Da Youngsta&#x27;s and others). At first, they recorded under the name 3-D.

==Career==
Their debut LP, &quot;Original Stylin&quot;&#x27; was well-received, peaking at #122 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and the group became well known for the terminology they created, such as &quot;Acknickulous&quot; and &quot;The Giddy Up&quot;.

3xD&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Live from Acknickulous Land&quot; was an attempt at a more serious work. Despite spawning two minor hits, it failed to chart on the Billboard 200. It did, however, peak at #30 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Album chart.

3xD later became closely associated with rapper/producer Kwamé. Their third album, &quot;Da Sequel&quot;, was not released until 1998.

EST would eventually go on to become an award-winning songwriter for top-tier acts, such as Britney Spears with an unreleased song called &quot;Giving It Up For Love&quot; in 2004 but most notably a Grammy nomination in 2005 for Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;Cater 2 U&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Alexeievna (; – ), born Princess Louise of Baden (), was Empress of Russia during her marriage to Emperor Alexander I.

==Princess of Baden==

Elizabeth Alexeievna was born in Karlsruhe, on as Princess Louise Maria Auguste of Baden of the House of Zähringen. She was the third of seven children of Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden, and his wife, Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. At birth, the child was so small and weak that doctors feared that she would not live.

Louise grew up in a close, warm family environment. She would remain particularly attached to her mother, with whom she maintained an intimate correspondence until her death (the Margravine of Baden outlived her daughter). She received a thoughtful education at the Baden court. She spoke and wrote both in French and German; studied history, geography, philosophy, and French and German literature. Thanks to the close proximity between Baden and France, she was well acquainted with French culture and refinements, as was the custom of that era. Because her grandfather, the reigning margrave of Baden, was not rich, the family lived modestly by royal standards.

Catherine the Great was looking for a bride for her eldest grandson, the future Alexander I, and set her eyes on the princesses of Baden who were the nieces of Queen Frederica Louisa of Prussia and the deceased Grand Duchess Natalia Alexeievna (Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt) who had been the first spouse of Tsesarevich Paul. Thus, an alliance to Prussia and several German royal houses they were closely related to would be a beneficial outcome. After favorable impressions, Catherine invited Princess Louise and her younger sister Frederica, who later became Queen of Sweden, to Russia. In the autumn of 1792, the two sisters arrived in St. Petersburg.

The Empress was delighted by Louise, finding her a model of beauty, charm, and honesty. Louise herself was attracted to Alexander; he was tall and handsome. At first, Alexander was shy with his future bride — very young and inexperienced, he did not know how to treat her — and she mistook his reserve for dislike. However, the young couple soon grew fond of each other. &quot;You tell me that I hold the happiness of a certain person in my hands&quot;, she wrote to Alexander. &quot;If that is true, then his happiness is assured forever… this person loves me tenderly, and I love him in return, and that will be my happiness… you can be certain that I love you more than I ever can say&quot;, she added. They were engaged in May 1793.

The Princess learned Russian, converted to the Orthodox Church, took the title of Grand Duchess of Russia and traded the name Louise Maria Auguste for Elizabeth Alexeievna. The wedding took place on 28 September 1793. &quot;It was a marriage between Psyche and Cupid&quot;, Catherine wrote to the Prince of Ligne. Elizabeth was only fourteen, her husband a year older.

==Grand Duchess of Russia==
Very young when she was married, shy, and naïve, Elizabeth Alexeievna was ill-prepared for her new position. She was overwhelmed by the splendor of the Russian court and frightened by the vicious intrigues waged there with cold calculation. She was appalled by the intense sexual intrigues that flourished all around her in a court where adultery was an accepted form of entertainment. The Empress herself set the example for the licentious ways of the court. Catherine&#x27;s lover, Platon Zubov, even tried to seduce Elizabeth Alexeievna.

The Grand Duchess felt lonely and homesick, particularly after her sister Frederica returned to Baden. Elizabeth was abandoned in an alien world where she could never be herself, even among her servants and ladies-in-waiting. The relationship with Alexander was her only source of solace. &quot;Without my husband, who alone makes me happy, I should have died a thousand deaths&quot;

The first years of the marriage were relatively happy, but the Grand Duchess disappointed Catherine II, who did not live to see a son be born to the young couple. The death of Catherine in November 1796 brought Elizabeth&#x27;s father-in-law Paul I to the Russian throne. During the years of his reign, Elizabeth avoided Paul&#x27;s court. She utterly disliked her father-in-law and disapproved of the injustices of his government and the bluntness of his character.

The first cracks in Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage began to appear. She did not find fulfillment for her romantic nature in a husband who neglected her. Elizabeth looked for emotional solace elsewhere. She first found refuge for her loneliness in a close intimate friendship with the beautiful Countess Golovina. Later, she started a romantic liaison with Alexander&#x27;s best friend, the dashing and clever Polish prince, Adam Czartoryski. Their relationship lasted for three years.

After more than five years of a childless marriage, on 29 May 1799, Elizabeth gave birth to a daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna. At court, some attributed the paternity to the Polish prince. The child had black hair and dark eyes. At the baptism, Tsar Paul I did not fail to express his amazement that the two blonde and blue-eyed parents had a dark-haired child. Elizabeth Alexeievna soon lost both her lover and her daughter. Adam Czartoryski was sent on a diplomatic mission, and Elizabeth&#x27;s baby daughter did not live long. &quot;As of this morning, I no longer have a child, she is dead&quot; she wrote to her mother on 27 July 1800. &quot;Not an hour of the day passes without my thinking of her, and certainly not a day without my giving her bitter tears. It cannot be otherwise so long as I live, even if she were to be replaced by two dozen children.&quot;

==Personality and appearance==

Elizabeth Alexeievna was distinguished by a soft, melodious voice and a beautiful oval face with delicate features; a Greek profile, large almond-shaped blue eyes and curly ash blond hair, which she usually left floating on her shoulders. With an elegant figure, regal carriage, and a beautiful angelic face, she was regarded by contemporaries as one of the most beautiful women in Europe and probably the most beautiful consort at that time. Charming, generous and intellectual, Elizabeth Alexeievna loved literature and the arts. She took music lessons from Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson (1768–after 1824). Unfortunately, she possessed a shy, withdrawn personality which failed to endear her to either the Russian court or her in-laws. She preferred simplicity and solitude to the pomp and ceremony of life at court.

Her marriage also failed to bring her fulfillment. Although Elizabeth Alexeievna loved her husband, and encouraged him in many personal and political crises, Alexander neglected her. Their relationship was harmonious, but emotionally distant, with each engaging in love affairs outside their marriage.

==Russian Empress==
The eccentricities of Paul I led to a plot to overthrow him and place Alexander on the Russian throne. Elizabeth was well aware of this scheme and on the night of Paul&#x27;s assassination, she was with her husband giving him support.

Once Alexander became emperor, Elizabeth Alexeievna encouraged him to leave behind the trauma of Paul I&#x27;s murder and dedicate himself to serve Russia. As Empress Consort, she took part in court life and the duties of representation, but the first female rank in the empire was reserved for her mother-in-law Empress Maria Feodorovna. During official events, Maria walked next to the Emperor while Elizabeth was forced to walk alone behind them.

Alexander treated his wife indifferently, he was polite toward her in public ceremonies and made an effort to have his meals in her company. Elizabeth was said to be too soft and placid to keep a hold on a restless and soul tortured man such as her husband. In 1803, Alexander began a love affair that would continue for more than fifteen years with the Polish Princess Maria Naryshkina, wife of Prince Dmitri Naryshkin. Maria Naryshkina flaunted her liaison at court in a tasteless, blatant fashion.

Elizabeth, for her part, found solace in her relationship with Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who had returned to Russia at Alexander&#x27;s ascension to the throne. This liaison ended when she started a love affair with a handsome staff captain, Alexis Okhotnikov. All the correspondence between Elizabeth and Alexis Okhotnikov, and some of her diaries were destroyed by Emperor Nicholas I after her death.

The affair with Okhotnikov had a tragic end. The staff captain, who suffered from tuberculosis, retired due to his worsened health and died in 1807. It was apparently rumored later that Alexander or his brother Grand Duke Constantine had ordered him killed; in the early twentieth century Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich turned those rumors into an elaborate legend for his biography of Elizabeth Alexeievna, although the chapter on Okhotnikov was not published at the time due to Nicholas II&#x27;s personal intervention, and his other studies of that period.

On 16 November 1806, Elizabeth gave birth to a second daughter. There were rumors that the newborn, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Alexandrovna was not a child of Alexander but of Okhotnikov. After his death, Elizabeth Alexeievna felt more abandoned than ever and poured out all her affection on her daughter Elizabeth, &quot;Lisinka&quot;. Fifteen months later, the little girl died suddenly of an infection blamed on teething. &quot;Now,&quot; wrote Elizabeth to her mother, &quot;I am not longer good for anything in this world, my soul has no more strength to recover from this last blow.&quot;

The death of their daughter temporarily brought Alexander and Elizabeth closer. Although Elizabeth Alexeievna was not yet thirty years old, neither she nor Alexander had further hopes of a family and they would have no more children.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Elizabeth Alexeievna was a reliable supporter of her husband&#x27;s policies as she had been in other personal and political crises. After the fall of Napoleon, she joined her husband and many of the crowned heads of Europe in the Congress of Vienna (1814), where she was reunited with her old paramour, Adam Czartoryski. He was still in love with her and forgave her past infidelity with Okhotnikov. Their reunion was short-lived.

==Last years and death==

Once she reached forty, she left behind any romantic pretensions. Her husband also experienced a personal transformation that drove the couple closer than they ever were. In 1818, Alexander, immersed in religious mysticism, broke his long relationship with Maria Naryshkina. From then on, the husband and wife started to spend more time together. The Empress sympathized deeply with him and Alexander found her supportive when he lost his beloved natural daughter Sophia. The marked reconciliation between the Emperor and the Empress caused general surprise. &quot;I am reduced to thinking of myself sometimes as Alexander&#x27;s mistress, or as if we had been married secretly...&quot; Elizabeth wrote to her mother.

By 1825, Elizabeth Alexeievna&#x27;s health was frail; she suffered from a lung condition and a nervous indisposition. The doctors recommended her to take a rest in a temperate climate and suggested the southern city of Taganrog by the Sea of Azov. With no comfortable palace, the imperial couple were established in a modest house in Taganrog by 5 October. They were happy together living in intimate simplicity. On 17 November 1825 Alexander returned to Taganrog from visiting Crimea with a cold, which developed into typhus, from which he died that December in the arms of his wife. Elizabeth was stricken by her loss, writing &quot;I do not understand myself, I do not understand my destiny... What am I to do with my will, which was entirely subjected to him, with my life, which I loved to devote to him?&quot; 

The now Dowager Tsarina was too frail to come back to St. Petersburg for the funeral. When Elizabeth Alexeievna finally started her return journey to the capital, she felt so sick that she had to stop at Belyov, Tula Governorate on the road to St. Petersburg, just a few hours before she was to meet her mother-in-law, who was coming south to greet her. In the early hours of 16 May 1826, towards 4.30 am, when her lady&#x27;s maid went to check on the Empress, she found her dead in bed. Elizabeth Alexeievna had died of heart failure.

Three days after her husband&#x27;s death Elizabeth had written her mother, &quot;Do not worry too much about me, but if I dared, I would like to follow the one who has been my very life.&quot;

==Children==
Alexander I and Elizabeth Alexeievna had two daughters, both of whom died in early childhood. Their common sorrow drew husband and wife closer together for a brief time.

<doc id="301851" wikidata="Q917528" url="?curid=301851" title="Spokane International Airport">
<text>Spokane International Airport is a commercial airport in Spokane, Washington, United States, located approximately west-southwest of Downtown Spokane. It is the primary airport serving the Inland Northwest, which consists of 30 counties and includes areas such as Spokane, the Tri-Cities, both in Eastern Washington, and Coeur d&#x27;Alene in North Idaho. The airport&#x27;s code, GEG, is derived from its former name, Geiger Field, which honored Major Harold Geiger (1884–1927).

As of 2015, Spokane International Airport (GEG) ranks as the 70th-busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger enplanements. At 4,264,875 total passengers served in 2024, it is the second busiest airport in Washington. GEG is served by seven airlines with non-stop service to more than 20 destinations in the continental US.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

Excluding military airfields, general aviation, and cargo airports, GEG Airport, at , is the largest commercial/public airport in all of Washington state in terms of land area.

==History==

Known as Sunset Field before 1941, it was purchased from the county by the War Department and renamed Geiger Field (hence the IATA code GEG) after Major Harold Geiger, an Army aviation pioneer who died in a crash in 1927.

During World War II, Geiger Field was a major training base by Second Air Force as a group training airfield for B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombardment units, with new aircraft being obtained from Boeing near Seattle. It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and Felts Field were auxiliaries.

In 1943, General Hap Arnold established the first formal fire protection training course at Geiger Field, Washington. It was used until 1946.

Geiger Field was served by a rail connection to the Great Northern Railway.

Geiger was closed in late 1945 and turned over to War Assets Administration (WAA), then transferred to Spokane County and developed into a commercial airport. The airport hosted USAF Air Defense Command interceptor units during the Cold War for air defense of Hanford Nuclear Reservation and Grand Coulee Dam. Built in 1942 as the Spokane Air Depot, Fairchild Air Force Base is four miles (7 km) to the west.

It became Spokane&#x27;s municipal airport in 1946, replacing Felts Field, and received its present name in 1960, after the City of Spokane was allotted Spokane Geiger Field by the Surplus Property Act and Air Canada started service to Calgary. In November 1972, the 4702d Defense Wing moved to the airfield. It was still used by the Air Force into the early 1960s, with the 84th Fighter Group operating Convair F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. The airport code is still GEG, for Geiger Field.
The current Concourse A and B complex opened in 1965, designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.

Occasional non-stop flights to southern California since the 1970s have been among the first to be suspended during economic downturns.

===Expansion from the 1970s===

A second level was added to Concourse A and Concourse B in 1974.

The airport has a Master Plan, which includes a third runway and gates added to Concourse C.

A new control tower has been built south of the airport, replacing the one near Concourse C. The new control tower is the tallest one in the State. The Terminal, Rotunda, and Concourse C Enhancement Project (TRACE) was recently completed, designed by Bernardo/Wills Architects, P.C. The project, which concluded in November 2006, added retail space and expanded security checkpoints in the airport&#x27;s three concourses, and gave the Rotunda an aesthetic renovation. In 2010, 2000 feet was added to Runway 3–21 and parallel taxiways &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;G&#x27;, enabling heavier aircraft departures in summer months.

By 2023, the airport plans to add new gates, centralized security and expanded baggage claim space as it looks to add more direct flights, including to the east coast, to capitalize on and accommodate growing passenger and cargo traffic; the Spokane market has been hosting big events and attracting business to the area.

=== Terminal renovation and expansion (TREX) program ===

On October 20, 2022, the airport broke ground on the first phase of the project which includes expansion of Concourse C. The $150 million addition will add 144,000 square feet, 6 new gates and modernization of the existing terminal. The first portion of the expanded concourse, which includes three gates at the west end, opened in June 2024. The remainder of the project is planned to begin construction in late 2024 and be completed the following year.

The second phase of the TREX program is focused on creating a centralized TSA screening checkpoint and baggage claim, as well as an improved operations center. This central connection will also allow easier navigation between the A/B and C concourses. As of January 2023, the 145,000 square foot Central Hall is estimated to cost $179 million and has a planned construction timeline of 2025 to 2027. Other projects planned in the TREX program include relocation of the rental car facilities, and renovation of the A/B concourse.

==Facilities==

===Airfield===
The airport covers and operates two paved runways:

*Runway 3/21: , asphalt/concrete
*Runway 8/26: , asphalt

===Tower===

It is believed that the tower is the only federally-run air traffic control tower named for any single person. That honor was bestowed in 2010 on Ray Daves, the World War II radioman who survived Pearl Harbor and Midway and went on to serve as an air traffic controller in Spokane after the war until the 1970s.

===Terminals===
The passenger terminal facility at Spokane International Airport has three main structures; Concourse A and B in the center, Concourse C to the southwest, and the Ground Transportation Center to the north. The three structures are immediately adjacent and connected, however the two concourse structures are not linked with an airside connector on the sterile side; as such, connecting passengers need to transit between Concourse A-B and Concourse C through the landside, non-sterile circulation.

====Concourse A/B====

The 1965 Concourse A/B complex includes the two concourses linked by a central rotunda area with dining and shopping vendors. The rotunda is supported entirely along its perimeter and features no obstructions. Concourse A houses 5 gates (11-15), while Concourse B houses 8 gates (1–8).

The Concourse A-B complex originally opened on April 1, 1965, and was designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon. The new terminal cost a reported and was dedicated on May 8, 1965, in a ceremony attended by Senator Warren Magnuson and Civil Aeronautics Board chair Alan Boyd. Designed in the Neo-Expressionism style, the building&#x27;s architecture prominently features exposed concrete as well as distinct sculpted and monolithic architectural shapes and forms.

As the airport has continued to incrementally expand, some of the original architectural intent of the Concourse A-B complex has been lost. While several expansions to the concourse extended the building&#x27;s original architectural style, other additions have altered it. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B to allow for the implementation of passenger boarding bridge access to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the same curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C to the ends of the concourse building further altered the architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also replaced many of Concourse A-B complex&#x27;s original sculpted forms and monolithic materials with more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, many of the original architectural elements remain integral to the space (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture.

Under the proposed Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program to accommodate projected growth, the separate baggage claim areas in Concourse A-B and Concourse C would be consolidated into a single baggage claim with five carousels, and A-B would receive a renovation. Ultimately, operations at A-B would wind down under long-term plans to construct a new terminal in 2030, at the earliest.

Southwest Airlines is the current primary occupant operating in and out of Concourse A. Delta and United Airlines both operate in and out of Concourse B. American Airlines operated in and out of Concourse B before relocating to Concourse C in March 2016.

====Concourse C====

Concourse C houses 9 gates, both upper (30-32) and lower (21a, 21b, 22-26). The lower level gates house regional turboprop aircraft, while the upper-level gates house narrow-body aircraft. The current iteration of Concourse C opened in 2000 after a $20 million redevelopment and expansion project, designed by Bernardo-Wills Architects. The project, which broke ground in 1998 added to the concourse including a new baggage claim and two-story passenger facility. The concourse was remodeled into service and operations functions. The new Concourse C has a more contemporary architectural style, contrasting the appearance of the Concourse A and B complex, by employing a large use of metal cladding and large curtain window walls on its exterior building envelope. However, it draws inspiration from its neo-expressionist neighbor by architecturally expressing a modular, repetitive, and exposed structural grid through its façade and interior lobby areas.

Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary carrier Horizon Air were the primary occupants operating in and out of Concourse C after Frontier Airlines ceased operations to Spokane in January 2015. However, that changed once American Airlines relocated to Concourse C in March 2016. Alaska and American operate in and out of the upper-level gates, while Horizon operates in and out of the lower level gates.

In October 2022, the airport broke ground on Phase 1 of the Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program which includes expansion of Concourse C. The concourse is currently under construction and expected to reopen in late 2025.

Spokane Transit operates four stops at Spokane International Airport, with bus routes 60 and 63. The airport is also served by the WSDOT&#x27;s Travel Washington Gold Line, Northwestern Trailways, Wheatland Express, Queen City Shuttle, and Special Mobility Service.

A consolidated rental car facility is located adjacent to the Ground Transportation Center on the north end of the main terminal. The consolidated facility opened in November 2008, replacing several satellite operations, and is intended to meet passenger growth at the airport for 20 years after its opening.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On March 10, 1961, a U.S. Air Force F-106 Delta Dart crashed west of Medical Lake while attempting to return to Geiger Field, killing its pilot.
*Six months later on September 14, 1961, a USAF F-106 crashed on approach to Geiger Field, killing its pilot.
* On February 18, 1972, a Beechcraft Model 99A, Cascade Airways Flight 325, operating Seattle-Walla Walla-Pullman-Spokane, crashed in fog at 9:42 pm PST during its instrument approach to Spokane International Airport, and came to rest in a muddy field less than southwest of the runway. Two passengers and two crew were aboard, and all survived with minor injuries. The pilot walked from the crash site to a nearby service station to report it. The crash site was about from the Medical Lake exit (#272) of Interstate 90 and the landing gear of the plane was extended. Due to fog, the flight had stopped in Pasco rather than Walla Walla.
* On January 20, 1981, a Beechcraft Model 99A, Cascade Airways Flight 201, crashed into a hill from the runway. The accident was caused by an incorrect distance measuring equipment frequency and premature descent to minimum descent altitude. Of the nine on board, seven were killed (including both pilots), and the surviving two passengers were seriously injured. The airline ceased operations about five years later.
*On March 18, 1994, a Douglas DC-3C of Salair crashed shortly after take-off on a cargo flight to Portland, killing both pilots. The starboard engine failed shortly after take-off; it had previously been in long-term storage and had been overhauled the previous year and fitted to the aircraft on February 21, replacing an engine that developed a misfire and loss of power. It had accumulated 15 hours flight time at the time of the accident. The aircraft was destroyed in the subsequent fire.
*On January 4, 1996, a Convair CV-440, operated by Salair on a positioning flight, lost power in both engines at 500 feet on an ILS approach to runway 3 due to fuel starvation and false fuel readings and darkness. The plane performed a forced landing, struck a berm in a field and was substantially damaged. Both occupants survived, but the aircraft was written off.

This included a catalog of downloadable software applications, email hosting, instant messaging, web proxies and a cloud service for the entire personal data on the device. The original Hiptop hardware was designed by Danger and manufactured by Flextronics. The Hiptop II, 3, Sidekick iD, Sidekick 2008 and Sidekick LX (2009) were all manufactured by Sharp Corporation in Japan and designed, respectively, by Danger and then Danger in partnership with Sharp. All versions of the Hiptop were developed in close partnership with T-Mobile, although carrier-specific features were either removed or added for each carrier, such as the addition of MMS for SunCom and Telstra Hiptop 2 users, where the feature was not available on T-Mobile USA devices until the Sidekick LX in 2007.

The Hiptop/Sidekick became incredibly popular in the U.S. and has been considered to be iconic in the mobile devices market.

== Hardware and releases ==
Screens on all Sidekick devices (excluding the Slide and 4G models) rotate 180 degrees &#x27;up&#x27; to the open position on a patented hinge pin to 
reveal the qwerty keyboard. There are two buttons on the left side of the device (&quot;menu&quot; and &quot;jump&quot;) and also two on the right (&quot;back&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot;). On all Hiptops except the original, the left side houses a directional pad and on the right, a track ball (excluding the original Hiptop) The Hiptop 2 and Slide&#x27;s directional pad contains internal multicolored LEDs used in ringers and notifications, while the 3, 2008, LX, and 2009 track ball contains internal multicolored LEDs that provide the same function. The right side also has two phone buttons: send call (also page-down) and end call (also page-up). The top of the unit has two application-specific shoulder buttons. The bottom has volume controls and a power button. The Hiptop line is designed to be held horizontally with both hands, allowing typing with two thumbs, similar to a Game Boy Advance or a console video game controller.

=== Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick (Danger/Flextronics) ===

Released on October 1, 2002, the original Hiptop was unique compared to all other hardware versions. All the units, from the beginning, have featured &quot;Menu&quot;, &quot;Back&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot; and other keys accessible even when the unit was closed. The Hiptop also featured a speaker which is used for device sounds but not telephone. Along the top edge of the phone bezel is an infrared transceiver. The headset jack serves a dual purpose, as it is also used for the accessory camera. A later revision of the Hiptop upgraded its screen from a monochrome LCD to a color LCD viewable with or without the backlight on (unique to Hiptop models until the LX). It is slightly bigger than any later Hiptop.

The Hiptop was sold by T-Mobile in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Austria. In the United States, its initial price was $200 and then $40 per month. SunCom and Edge Wireless used to sell the device in some parts of the United States, and Fido was the exclusive Hiptop carrier in Canada until sales were discontinued after Fido was bought by Rogers Communications, at the end of the Hiptop 2&#x27;s life. The discontinuation was mainly because the Hiptop was a competitor to Rogers&#x27; BlackBerry business.

In Germany, the Hiptop service was also offered from 2003 by E-Plus which included a flat rate tariff. The Hiptop was also sold in Singapore by Starhub in 2004.

=== Hiptop2/T-Mobile Sidekick II (Danger/Sharp) ===

Released in 2004, the Hiptop2 was introduced with Danger moving the D-Pad (directional-pad) to the left side of the Hiptop (from the inside where it was previously found), along with top-left and top-right shoulder dials, volume up/down and power on bottom of phone. The Hiptop2 also features a VGA camera, and the addition of page-up/page-down buttons on the top and bottom of its scroll wheel. The line-by-line scrolling feature is notable to the Hiptop brand of products and is not a feature of most other multi-function cell phones. The line-by-line (ability to scroll one line at a time rather than just page by page) scrolling feature is consistent in all applications, as are the &quot;Jump&quot; and all other hardware buttons.

The Hiptop2 has two speakers; the phone speaker built into the D-pad, and a speaker on the back of the unit (near the VGA camera) for sounds, alerts and speaker phone calls. The microphone is located near the end-call button; on right side of the phone there is a power jack, a mini-USB port (usable only by developers, not for the general public) and hands-free headset jack.

Another important feature of the Hiptop2 is the ability to easily view the screen even without a backlight. All units until the LX model had this feature. Most other manufacturers utilized an LCD screen that was not visible without backlight. Hiptop and Palm Treo units (Treo 600 and later) utilized a transflective liquid crystal display that worked with and without the backlight, making the IM, mail, and all other messages readable even in bright sunlight, and without picking the unit up.

The dimensions of the Hiptop2 are 133 mm x 64 mm x 21 mm.

On October 9, 2006, the Australian Hiptop2 was released through Telstra. The Australian version is practically the same as the Sidekick II in the U.S. but re-constructed for the Australian audience it has MSN Messenger built-in as the default messenger and Yahoo! Messenger which is downloadable from the catalog (the US version has Yahoo and AOL Instant Messenger).

There are also two limited edition variants of the T-Mobile USA Sidekick II: Juicy Couture Edition (Pink) and Mister Cartoon Edition (Black). These are different case colors with the same hardware and operating systems.

=== Hiptop3/T-Mobile Sidekick 3 (Danger/Sharp) ===

Released July 10, 2006, the Hiptop3 manufactured by Sharp was smaller than previous versions, measuring 130 mm wide x 59 mm high x 22 mm thick. All features, including the line-by-line scroll feature remained the same. Software remained basically the same, but with the addition of more applications.

The industrial design was changed as well as a new color scheme to a dark gray shell with silver trim and gloss black buttons. The scroll wheel was replaced by a multicolor LED-lit six-direction trackball replacing the D-pad as the indicator light. The keyboard was also changed to a rigid plastic keyboard differing from the rubber keyboard of previous models known to peel away from the unit (although easily replaceable).

New features were introduced including a removable 3.7v 1500 mAh battery, a miniSD slot capable of up to 2 GB of flash memory storage, a 1.3-megapixel camera capable of 1280 x 1024 resolution, an improvement from the sub-megapixel VGA 640 x 480 camera, and a built-in 1/16&quot; audio jack for the newly included MP3 playback software. The MiniUSB functionality was changed from allowing access to the Hiptop&#x27;s internal communications to only allowing access to the MiniSD card over a USB v1.1 port. The built-in storage allows for end-users to store files for .mp3, .wav, and .aac playback, camera, user customizable themes and other catalog application&#x27;s uses.

The T-Mobile USA Sidekick 3 was made available in three limited edition models which only differed in cosmetic color changes:

* Diane von Fürstenberg — Black with pink lips; released October 30, 2006
* Lifted Research Group — Green with tree logos
* Dwyane Wade — White and gold with a basketball texture; released February 1, 2007, to coincide with the NBA All-Star Game of February 17, 2007

=== T-Mobile Sidekick iD (Danger/Sharp) ===
The Sidekick iD is a smaller version of the Sidekick 3. It was released April 13, 2007. The Sidekick iD was aimed at younger, less affluent customers. To reduce the cost of the Sidekick iD, the creators, (Sharp), removed some of the features of the Sidekick 3, including the 1.3-megapixel camera, the Bluetooth capability, and its media player.

Although many of the &quot;fun&quot; features were taken out, Danger and Sharp did keep some of the features previously seen on the Sidekick 1, 2 and 3. This included the Sidekick-patented swivel screen, the hidden keyboard, and the trackball. However, a new feature were removable colored &quot;bumpers&quot;, allowing the appearance of the Sidekick to be easily changed.

=== T-Mobile Sidekick LX (Danger/Sharp) ===

The Sidekick LX (PV-250) was released on October 17, 2007, for existing T-Mobile customers via the Internet and five special locations. A week later, on October 24, 2007, the LX was released to new T-Mobile subscribers. The Sidekick LX is available in two different colors, Midnight Blue and Espresso Brown. In addition to the two color selections, the LX includes a wider, higher-resolution screen, blue LED mood lights on all four corners which coordinate to the user&#x27;s settings, downloadable music and backgrounds, a lighter weight, MMS messaging, and a Micro SD card slot with a 128 MB card included (over the Sidekick 3&#x27;s 64 MB MiniSD card), and an updated operating system. On July 16, 2008, T-Mobile released a limited edition Tony Hawk Edition Sidekick LX, which includes video recording. Despite production models being made for testing, ultimately the LX was never released in Australia due to a lack of compatibility with Telstra&#x27;s 3G 850Mhz network, however Telstra went ahead with selling the Slide after the Hiptop3; the Hiptop3 is now phased out. A Midnight Blue Sidekick LX was featured in the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.

In late 2010, Mobilicity began selling the Sidekick LX 2009 as the Mobiflip. In early 2011, US regional carrier Cincinnati Bell began selling the Sidekick LX 2009 as the Sharp Jump.

=== Motorola Q700 (Sidekick Slide) (Danger/Motorola) ===

In Australia it is marketed as the Hiptop Slide; in the U.S., it was marketed as the Sidekick Slide. It was first released on November 5, 2007, through Telstra in Australia. T-Mobile USA release followed two days later, on November 7, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidekick/Hiptop Slide and LX Release Date and Information&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released in the UK and Germany by T-Mobile (as opposed to the Sidekick LX only being released by T-Mobile USA). The Sidekick/Hiptop Slide offers the same features and services as every other Danger device and an update to Danger&#x27;s latest OS version (4.0). Like the LX, this Sidekick for T-Mobile USA adds the Multimedia Messaging application and provides support for T-Mobile MyFaves plans.

The T-Mobile Sidekick Slide, although less expensive than the LX, provides various hardware upgrades. These upgrades include 128 MB RAM and 225 MHz TI OMAP 850 processor, as opposed to the Sidekick 3 and LX&#x27;s 64 MB RAM and 200 MHz OMAP 331 processor, and a second speaker which is located on the back of the device, as opposed to the Hiptop 3 and LX&#x27;s reliance on the D-pad speaker for both calls and music playback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidekick/Hiptop Slide Hardware Specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

T-Mobile USA suspended sales of the Sidekick Slide on Friday evening, November 16, 2007, after Motorola confirmed that some devices inadvertently powered off when the slide door on the front side of the phone was opened or closed. Sidekick Slide owners that reported the power issue received a free exchange to a blue Sidekick LX with free express shipping.

On November 21, 2007, Motorola stated the failures were triggered by poor battery contacts; sliding the screen out to type on the keyboard sometimes loosened the contact and forced the device to shut off momentarily.

On December 6, 2007, the Sidekick Slide was once again available for purchase.

On May 16, 2008, a new version of the Sidekick Slide was released, named the Sidekick Slide Scarlet.

The Sidekick Slide was officially discontinued on August 8, 2008. It was available for sale again on December 12, 2008, however, T-Mobile has once again discontinued the Sidekick Slide.

On October 1, 2009, Telstra officially discontinued the Hiptop service plans and phones. All remaining customers who contracts are still under contract are not affected, however the service and phone is no longer available for sale, and will not be offered for sale again.

=== T-Mobile Sidekick 2008 (Danger/Sharp) ===
On August 1, 2008 T-Mobile released the Sidekick 2008 right before the Slide was discontinued. This has improved features such as a high resolution 2-megapixel camera and video functionality high quality AIM. It also went back to the swivel Qwerty design, including changeable face/backplates. The Sidekick 2008 is available only in certain T-mobile stores. The Sidekick 2008 features were reviewed by gizmodo, PC Magazine and in a cnet video review.

=== T-Mobile Sidekick LX 2009 (Danger/Sharp) ===
The 2009 edition of the Sidekick LX (PV-300), which was known during the development phase as the &quot;Sidekick Blade&quot; or the &quot;Sidekick 2009&quot;, was released on May 13, 2009, after a pre-order period beginning on April 17.

The new handset supports 3G and HSDPA, and makes various changes to the hardware, including a 3.2 inch F-WVGA display with 854×480 resolution and a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus and flash. However, most of the known changes involve software and improved functionality for social networking applications. Support for Facebook, Twitter and MySpace is now native to the system, allowing the handset to pass along notifications in the status bar as it does with instant messaging, e-mail and so forth. YouTube streaming playback is also supported on the system through Flash Lite.

The Sidekick LX 2009 offered synchronization with Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange, through a download via the applications catalog. The highest-profile addition to the handset was Bing (then called &quot;Live Search&quot;), was added and integrated with the new GPS functionality; the mapping software previously relied on cell-tower triangulation (a far less accurate process). The application included turn-by-turn navigation.

=== Danger platform discontinuation ===
T-Mobile announced on July 2, 2010, that the Sidekick LX 09 and Sidekick 2008 would no longer be available through T-Mobile.
Danger notified its development community via their Danger Developer Zone forums that it would no longer accept submissions for its application store, called the Catalog, on September 21, 2010. The development of applications for the Sidekick platform was also halted on September 21, 2010.
This was followed by the closure of the Danger Developer Zone forums and related archives September 30, 2010. However the Canadian company Mobilicity later began selling the Sidekick LX (2009) under the name Mobiflip.

=== Mobilicity Mobiflip / Sharp Jump / Sharp PV300GR (Sharp) ===
While the T-Mobile Sidekick LX 2009 was no longer sold from July 2, 2010, onwards, modified versions of the device have been available for sale since. In Canada, carrier Mobilicity began selling the device under the name &quot;Mobiflip&quot; and the model number PV300G in late December 2010. In the United States, regional carrier Cincinnati Bell began selling the &quot;Sharp Jump&quot;, model number PV300GC, in early 2011. Both devices have a modified version of the Danger OS installed, although any mention of Danger has been removed. This modified OS is independent of any backend service, and the original Danger Web browser, Instant Messaging and Email applications have been removed. The Web browser was replaced with Opera Mini whereas the Instant Messaging clients were replaced with one universal client which also allows the user to connect to an IM service through an XMPP server. There is no email client installed, and there is no Catalog service available.

The Mobiflip can be unlocked for voice service worldwide, but will not work for data due to the lack of an option to change the network APN. The Sharp Jump is different as it is possible to change the network APN, and will work with voice and data anywhere in the world provided the phone is unlocked and a compatible GSM or UMTS network is available.

=== T-Mobile Sidekick 4G (Android/Samsung) ===
In April 2011, T-Mobile revived the Sidekick brand for a new 4G HSPA+-compatible Android smartphone developed by Samsung, known as the Sidekick 4G, based on the Galaxy S. It incorporates features from the original series, including the keyboard, 3.2-megapixel camera (minus LED flash), and the four-button layout, and adds a new Android-powered interface incorporating elements from the Hiptop&#x27;s operating system. It should not be confused for a Danger device, to which these have no relation other than the T-Mobile exclusive &quot;Sidekick&quot; branding.

== Software ==

The Hiptop operating system, referred to as DangerOS, is one of very few Java-based operating systems. Even the device drivers were developed in Java. A large part of DangerOS&#x27;s architecture was used later to create the Android operating system. For Hiptop development, Danger has its own proprietary APIs, which are a subset of J2SE with their own extensions. Danger introduced support for Java ME, the Java language optimized for mobile devices, to its OS with the release of OS 2.3.

Each Sidekick had an IM client (with AIM, Yahoo Messenger, and MSN Messenger); an Email client with an included T-Mail account; a pre-installed game (Rockets and Rocks or Bob&#x27;s Journey); an organizer with planner, a calendar, and calculator; an SMS and phone app; a Download Fun catalog (also called Catalog on Hiptop devices); and later devices had a variety of social network apps accessed from a section called Communities. Devices released in Europe also had a WAP browser (Wapaka) developed by the French company Digital Airways.

A cloud service backed up all personal data like settings, planner, notes, calendar, photos and all contacts. It was accessible and also editable on a web interface. A factory reset or new device was able to restore all personal data by signing in with username and password.

To aid third-party software design, Danger released a comprehensive software development kit (SDK) that contained a Hiptop simulator, development installation utilities, and Danger API information. The SDK was available without charge from Danger&#x27;s development website.

There was no way to add applications to the standard Hiptop software on the device without the use of the Catalog.

Application developers can bypass this functionality by using the included programs in the Danger Hiptop SDK to install user-written applications to the Hiptop device directly. To do this, you had to apply for a special software key known as a Danger Developer Key. The Danger Developer Key is a special security certificate that is provided by Danger that enables the device to be used as a Development Device. This will allow the installation of user-written applications to the device, but will void any software warranty provided by Danger and/or your wireless carrier. Any applicable hardware warranties should still apply.

While DangerOS uses .jar files for applications, they are uploaded to the device in special files called &quot;bundles&quot;. Bundle files have the extension &#x27;.bndl&#x27;. Each bundle file is linked to a specific operating system version and build number. For example, a bundle file for v3.4/155053 (T-Mobile Sidekick 3) would be denied installation on a v3.3/149695 device (T-Mobile Sidekick iD). Installation of bundles require a developer key to be installed on your device if you are using a Production OS. Internal OS builds do not require developer keys.

The Sidekick LX 2009 model runs DangerOS 5.0 which is based on NetBSD.

== 2009 data service outage ==

On October 2, 2009, Microsoft (the owner of Danger, Inc.) lost the ability to access user data for T-Mobile US Sidekick subscribers temporarily. Subscriber data loss included contacts, notes, calendars and photos. Some data was restored within 14 days of the outage, but most of the data was restored between October 8 and the end of November. Early reports stating T-Mobile and Microsoft had lost all customer data as a result of a server failure at Microsoft proved to be untrue.

Sidekick user data is stored at Danger facilities, under the ownership of Microsoft. Unsubstantiated reports suggest Microsoft vendor Hitachi, Danger&#x27;s storage area network (SAN) provider may have had a part in the temporary data loss. Lawsuits against Microsoft claim that Microsoft had inadequate backups or an insufficient disaster recovery plan. A litigation against Microsoft and others was settled in 2011.

As a result of the outage, T-Mobile suspended sales of all Sidekicks and Sidekick Data Plans until the outage was resolved. Sales and new activations resumed on November 16, 2009.

== Danger cloud service discontinuation ==
On February 28, 2011, Engadget reported Microsoft would discontinue Danger&#x27;s cloud service on May 31, 2011. After that date, Sidekicks no longer had access to any data services, though voice service still functioned.

In Australia, the Telstra Hiptop service was continued for existing customers after May 31, 2011, when the T-Mobile USA Sidekick service was shut down. Then, it was announced that the Hiptop service for Telstra customers was to be discontinued on October 4, 2011. Selected affected customers received a free Samsung Galaxy 551 to replace their Hiptop devices. After the Telstra shutdown, no known carriers worldwide offered any form of Danger data service.

== Usage by the deaf and hard-of-hearing ==
When the Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick was initially released in late 2002, it was the only cellular phone to factory integrate an instant messaging client, specifically AOL Instant Messenger. This text-based communications medium, along with on-device email and a full QWERTY keyboard, made it popular with the deaf community, providing a telecommunications tool for use both inside and outside the home. Almost immediately it began replacing the dominant wireless devices used by the Deaf at that time, namely the Motorola T-900, PageWriter, and TimePort, as well as the early RIM and BlackBerry e-mail pagers manufactured by Research In Motion.

The Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick&#x27;s importance to the Deaf was further solidified in March 2003 when it became the first cellular phone capable of placing unassisted TDD and Relay Operator calls through the phone&#x27;s web browser using a system developed by Jon B. Sharpe at Lormar Logic Company. Lormar Logic enhanced the TDD/Relay Operator system in August 2003 by developing a means for the deaf to place calls through AOL Instant Messenger.

MCI Relay followed two months later with a Relay Operator system accessible through telnet. MCI Relay and Hamilton Relay both released AOL Instant Messenger relay systems in July of the following year. By 2005, at least four Relay Operator providers (Hamilton, MCI, Sprint, Sorenson, and i711) were providing direct Relay Operator access from the Sidekick using either one of the instant messenger clients or through a free download from the Catalog, and two companies (Lormar Logic and i711) were providing direct TDD access. The software for these is provided at no additional charge in addition to the normal data plan. The free Lormar Logic service also provides the Deaf with direct encrypted calling to the United States Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. The i711 client provides extra services to the Deaf at an additional fee (such as AAA roadside services, and finding Open Captioned movies, etc.).

Access to direct TDD and relay operator communications has allowed the Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick and similar devices to, in many cases, replace the use of standard TDD machines, and its dominance is clearly illustrated by the evolution of its own sign in American Sign Language, made using both hands to mimic the opening of the rotating screen.

T-Mobile&#x27;s decision to offer a &quot;data only&quot; wireless plan, thereby eliminating charges for unusable voice minutes, also played a role in the device&#x27;s dominance in the deaf community. Additionally, some local deaf non-profit groups in the U.S. will either pay all or part of the cost of the device/monthly service fees for the user to keep them &quot;connected&quot;. Other groups have set up discount programs, where Deaf users receive a discount on the cost of the device and monthly service fee based on the number of members in the group.

<text>Larry King (born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger; November 19, 1933 – January 23, 2021) was an American author, radio host and television host. His awards and nominations include two Peabodys, an Emmy, and 10 Cable ACE Awards. King was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 32nd Annual News and Documentary Emmys. During his career, King conducted over 50,000 interviews on radio and television.

King was born and raised in New York City to Jewish parents who immigrated to the United States from what is now Belarus in the 1920s. He studied at Lafayette High School, a public high school in Brooklyn. He was a WMBM radio interviewer in the Miami area in the 1950s and 1960s and beginning in 1978, gained national prominence as host of &quot;The Larry King Show&quot;, an all-night nationwide call-in radio program heard over the Mutual Broadcasting System.

From 1985 to 2010, he hosted the nightly interview television program &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on CNN. King hosted &quot;Larry King Now&quot; from 2012 to 2020, which aired on Hulu, Ora TV, and RT America. He hosted &quot;Politicking with Larry King&quot;, a weekly political talk show, on the same three channels from 2013 to 2020. King also appeared in television series and films, usually playing himself. He remained active until his death in 2021.

On January 2, 2021, King was hospitalized with COVID-19 at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. King recovered from the virus, but died on January 23 from sepsis at the age of 87.

== Early life and education ==
King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York City, on November 19, 1933. His parents were Orthodox Jews who immigrated to the United States from Soviet Belarus in the 1920s.
He was one of two sons of Jennie (née Gitlitz), a garment worker who was born in Minsk in the Russian Empire in present-day Belarus, and Aaron Edward Zeiger, a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker who was born in Pinsk (also in modern-day Belarus). During his early childhood, the family lived at 208 Howard Avenue, a rowhouse in a section of the borough alternatively characterized as part of Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Brownsville or Ocean Hill.

King attended Lafayette High School, a public high school in Brooklyn. When King was nine years old, his father died of a heart attack. This resulted in King, his mother, and brother going on government welfare. King was greatly affected by his father&#x27;s death, and subsequently lost interest in his schoolwork. Throughout King&#x27;s adolescence, his family lived at 2136 83rd Street in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.

After graduating from high school, King worked to help support his mother. From an early age, he desired to work in radio broadcasting.

== Career ==
=== Miami radio and television ===
A CBS production supervisor, James F. Sirmons, suggested he go to Florida, which was a growing media market with openings for inexperienced broadcasters. King went to Miami. After initial setbacks, he gained his first job in radio at a small station, WAHR (now WMBM), in Miami Beach, hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks. When one of the station&#x27;s announcers abruptly quit, King was put on the air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, working as the disc jockey from 9 a.m. to noon. He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $50 a week.

He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager declared that Zeiger was too difficult to remember, saying it was &quot;too German, too Jewish and not showbusiness enough&quot;. Minutes before airtime, Larry chose the surname &quot;King&quot;, which was inspired from a &quot;Miami Herald&quot; advertisement he saw for King&#x27;s Wholesale Liquor. Within two years, he legally changed his name to Larry King.

King began to conduct interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD from Pumpernik&#x27;s Restaurant in Miami Beach. He would interview whoever walked in. His first interview was with a waiter at the restaurant. 

Two days later, singer Bobby Darin, in Miami for a concert that evening, walked into Pumpernik&#x27;s having heard King&#x27;s radio show; Darin became King&#x27;s first celebrity interview guest.

King&#x27;s Miami radio show brought him local attention. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted &quot;Miami Undercover&quot;, airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on Miami television station WPST-TV.

King credited his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason, whose national television variety show was being taped in Miami Beach, beginning in 1964. &quot;That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami,&quot; King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters&#x27; Hall of Fame. &quot;He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn&#x27;t like the set, so we broke into the general manager&#x27;s office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine.&quot;

During this period, WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season. 

On December 20, 1971, he was dismissed by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator following his arrest for grand larceny by a former business partner, Louis Wolfson. Other staff covered the Dolphins&#x27; games into their 24–3 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl VI. King also lost his weekly column at the &quot;Miami Beach Sun&quot; newspaper. The charges were later dropped. King was later rehired by WIOD. For several years during the 1970s, he hosted a sports talk-show called &quot;Sports-a-la-King&quot;, featuring guests and callers.

=== &quot;The Larry King Show&quot; ===


On January 30, 1978, King began hosting a nightly coast-to-coast radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, inheriting the talk show slot that had begun with Herb Jepko in late 1975, then followed by &quot;Long John&quot; Nebel in 1977. King&#x27;s Mutual show rapidly developed a devoted audience, called &quot;King-aholics&quot;.

&quot;The Larry King Show&quot; was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time. King would interview a guest for the first hour, with callers asking questions that continued the interview for the next two hours. At 3 a.m., the &quot;Open Phone America&quot; segment began, where he allowed callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him, until the end of the program when he expressed his own political opinions. Many stations in the western time zones carried the &quot;Open Phone America&quot; portion of the show live, followed by the guest interview on tape delay.

Some of King&#x27;s regular callers used pseudonyms or were given nicknames by King, such as &quot;The Numbers Guy&quot;, &quot;The Chair&quot;, &quot;The Portland Laugher&quot;, &quot;The Miami Derelict&quot;, and &quot;The Scandal Scooper&quot;. At the beginning, the show had 28 affiliates, but eventually rose to over 500. King occasionally entertained the audience by telling amusing stories from his youth or early broadcasting career.

Wishing to reduce his workload, King began hosting a shorter, daytime version of the show in 1993. Jim Bohannon, King&#x27;s primary fill-in host, took over the late night time slot. After 16 years on Mutual, King decided to retire from the program. The final broadcast of &quot;The Larry King Show&quot; was heard on May 27, 1994; Mutual gave King&#x27;s afternoon slot to David Brenner and Mutual&#x27;s affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of King&#x27;s new CNN evening television program. After Westwood One dissolved Mutual in 1999, the radio simulcast of the CNN show continued until December 31, 2009.

===&quot;Larry King Live&quot;===

&quot;Larry King Live&quot; began on CNN in June 1985. King hosted a broad range of guests, from figures such as UFO conspiracy theorists and alleged psychics, to prominent politicians and entertainment industry figures, often giving their first or only interview on breaking news stories on his show. After broadcasting his CNN show from 9 to 10 p.m., King then traveled to the studios of the Mutual Broadcasting System to do his radio show, when both shows still aired.

Two of his best-remembered interviews involved political figures. In 1992, billionaire Ross Perot announced his presidential bid on the show. In 1993, a debate between Al Gore and Perot became CNN&#x27;s most-watched segment until 2015.

Unlike many interviewers, King had a direct, non-confrontational approach. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions made him attractive to important figures who wanted to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics. King said that when interviewing authors, he did not read their books in advance, so that he would not know more than his audience. Throughout his career, King interviewed many of the leading figures of his time. According to CNN, King conducted more than 30,000 interviews in his career.

An avid sports fan, King wrote a regular column for &quot;The Sporting News&quot; during the 1980s. King also wrote a regular column in &quot;USA Today&quot; for almost 20 years, from shortly after that first national newspaper&#x27;s debut in Baltimore–Washington in 1982 until September 2001. The column consisted of short &quot;plugs, superlatives and dropped names&quot; but was dropped when the newspaper redesigned its &quot;Life&quot; section. The column was resurrected in blog form in November 2008 and on Twitter in April 2009.

During his career, King conducted more than 60,000 interviews. CNN&#x27;s Larry King Live became &quot;the longest-running television show hosted by the same person, on the same network and in the same time slot&quot;, and was recognized for it by the Guinness Book of World Records. He retired in 2010 after taping 6,000 episodes of the show.

==== Departure ====
On June 29, 2010, King announced that after 25 years, he would be stepping down as the show&#x27;s host. However, he stated that he would remain with CNN to host occasional specials. The announcement came in the wake of speculation that CNN had approached Piers Morgan, the British television personality and journalist, as King&#x27;s primetime replacement, which was confirmed that September.

The final edition of &quot;Larry King Live&quot; aired on December 16, 2010. The show concluded with his last thoughts and a thank you to his audience for watching and supporting him over the years. The concluding words of Larry King on the show were, &quot;I... I, I don&#x27;t know what to say except to you, my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long.&quot;

On February 17, 2012, CNN announced that he would no longer host specials.

=== Shows on Ora TV ===

In March 2012, King co-founded Ora TV, a production company, with his wife Shawn Southwick-King and Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim. On January 16, 2013, Ora TV celebrated their 100th episode of &quot;Larry King Now&quot;. In September 2017, King&#x27;s agent stated that King &quot;looks forward to working for another 60 years.&quot;

Ora TV signed a multi-year deal with Hulu to exclusively carry King&#x27;s new talk-oriented web series, &quot;Larry King Now&quot;, beginning July 17. On October 23, 2012, King hosted the third-party presidential debate on Ora TV, featuring Jill Stein, Rocky Anderson, Virgil Goode, and Gary Johnson.

In May 2013, the Russian government-owned RT America network announced that they struck a deal with Ora TV to host the &quot;Larry King Now&quot; show on its network. King said in an advertisement on RT America: &quot;I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power, instead of speaking on their behalf.&quot; The show continued to be available on Hulu.com and Ora.tv.

When criticized for doing business with a Russian-owned TV network in 2014, King responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t work for RT&quot;, commenting that his podcasts, &quot;Larry King Now&quot; and &quot;Politicking&quot;, are licensed for a fee to RT America by New York-based Ora TV. &quot;It&#x27;s a deal made between the companies ... They just license our shows. If they took something out, I would never do it. It would be bad if they tried to edit out things. I wouldn&#x27;t put up with it.&quot;

===Other ventures===
King remained active as a writer and television personality thereafter.

King guest starred in episodes of &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot; and &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, had cameos in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Bee Movie&quot;, and voiced Doris the Ugly Stepsister in &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and its sequels. He also played himself in &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; and appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Law and Order: Trial by Jury&quot;.

King hosted the educational television series &quot;In View with Larry King&quot; from 2013 to 2015, which was carried on cable television networks including Fox Business Network and Discovery and produced by The Profiles Series production company.

King and his wife Shawn appeared on &quot;WWE Raw&quot; in October 2012, participating in a storyline involving professional wrestlers The Miz and Kofi Kingston.

King became a very active user on the social-networking site Twitter, where he posted thoughts and commented on a wide variety of subjects. King stated, &quot;I love tweeting, I think it&#x27;s a different world we&#x27;ve entered. When people were calling in, they were calling into the show and now on Twitter, I&#x27;m giving out thoughts, opinions. The whole concept has changed.&quot;

After 2011, he also made various television infomercials, often appearing as a &quot;host&quot; discussing products like omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplement OmegaXL with guests, in an interview style reminiscent of his past television programs.

&quot;ProPublica&quot; reported that in 2019 King had been manipulated into starring in a fake interview with a Russian journalist containing disinformation about Chinese dissident Guo Wengui, which was subsequently spread by Chinese government associated social media accounts.

== Charitable works ==
Following his 1987 heart attack, King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation, a non-profit organization which paid for life-saving cardiac procedures for people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.

On August 30, 2010, King served as the host of Chabad&#x27;s 30th annual &quot;To Life&quot; telethon, in Los Angeles.

He donated to the Beverly Hills 9/11 Memorial Garden, where his name is on the monument.

== Personal life ==
King resided in Beverly Hills, California. A lifelong Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers fan, he was frequently seen behind home plate at the team&#x27;s games. He was part of an investment group that attempted to bring a Major League Baseball franchise to Buffalo, New York, in 1990. He lost $2.8 million to Bernie Madoff.

In 2009, 2011, and several times in 2015, King said that he would like to be cryonically suspended. He discussed the issue with his family two years before his death, and &quot;after much consideration,&quot; he decided that he did not want to undergo the procedure.

In the early 1980s, King took human growth hormone daily.

After describing himself as a Jewish agnostic in 2005, he stated that he was fully atheist in 2015. In 2017, he told &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;I love being Jewish, am proud of my Jewishness, and I love Israel&quot;.

In 2019, King sued Nate Holzapfel, a &quot;Shark Tank&quot; contestant and entrepreneur, alleging that he had misrepresented himself and his reasons for filming a short interview with King. The interview had been edited without King&#x27;s permission to make it appear that Holzapfel had appeared on &quot;Larry King Now&quot;. A default judgment was entered in King&#x27;s favor, and he was awarded fees and $250,000 in damages.

===Marriages and children===
King was married eight times to seven women. 

King married high school sweetheart Freda Miller in 1952, at the age of 19. That union ended the following year at the behest of their parents, who reportedly had the marriage annulled. 

King was married to Annette Kaye, who gave birth to his son, Larry Jr., in November 1961. King did not meet Larry Jr. until the latter was in his 30s.

In 1961, King married his third wife, Playboy Bunny Alene Akins, at one of the magazine&#x27;s eponymous nightclubs. He adopted Akins&#x27; son Andy in 1962; the couple divorced the following year. 

In 1963, King married his fourth wife, Mary Francis &quot;Mickey&quot; Sutphin, who divorced him in 1967. 

King remarried Akins in 1969; the couple had a daughter, Chaia, before divorcing again in 1972. In 1997, Dove Books published a book written by King and Chaia, &quot;Daddy Day, Daughter Day&quot;. Aimed at young children, it tells each of their accounts of his divorce from Akins.

On September 25, 1976, King married his fifth wife, mathematics teacher and production assistant Sharon Lepore. The couple divorced in 1983.

On August 1, 1989, King proposed to businesswoman Julie Alexander on their first date. Alexander became King&#x27;s sixth wife on October 7, 1989, when the two were married in Washington, D.C. They lived in different cities, with Alexander in Philadelphia and King in Washington, D.C., where he worked. The couple separated in 1990 and divorced in 1992. 

King became engaged to actress Deanna Lund in 1995 after five weeks of dating, but they did not marry.

In 1997, King married his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick, a singer, actress, and TV host who is the sister of musician Paul Engemann. The couple wed in King&#x27;s Los Angeles hospital room three days before he underwent heart surgery to clear an occluded blood vessel. The couple had two children: Chance, born March 1999, and Cannon, born May 2000. King was stepfather to Arena Football League quarterback Danny Southwick. On King and Southwick&#x27;s 10th anniversary in September 2007, Southwick joked that she was &quot;the only [wife] to have lasted into the two digits&quot;. The couple filed for divorce in 2010, but later reconciled only to file for divorce again on August 20, 2019. King and Southwick were estranged and going through divorce proceedings at the time of King&#x27;s death in 2021.

At the time of his death, King had five children, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. His children with Alene Atkins, Andy and Chaia, died within weeks of each other in August 2020. Andy died at 65 from a heart attack, and Chaia died at 51 from lung cancer.

=== Estate ===
At the time of his death, in February 2021, it was reported that his estranged wife Shawn Southwick had gone to court to contest King&#x27;s 2019 handwritten will, which had left his estate (valued at $2 million) to his five surviving children. Southwick alleged that her stepson, Larry King Jr., exerted undue influence over his father towards the end of his life, and that the handwritten will conflicted with a will King signed in 2015 in which Southwick was named executor of his estate. This does not include more valuable &quot;assets that were held in trusts&quot;. Southwick ultimately reached a settlement with King&#x27;s business management firm, Blouin &amp; Company, and its executives in court in 2024.

== Health problems and death==
On February 24, 1987, King suffered a major heart attack before a successful quintuple-bypass surgery. Following this, he wrote two books about living with heart disease. &quot;Mr. King, You&#x27;re Having a Heart Attack: How a Heart Attack and Bypass Surgery Changed My Life&quot; (1989, ), which was written with New York&#x27;s &quot;Newsday&quot; science editor B. D. Colen, and &quot;Taking On Heart Disease: Famous Personalities Recall How They Triumphed over the Nation&#x27;s #1 Killer and How You Can, Too&quot; (2004, ), which features the experience of various celebrities with cardiovascular disease, including Peggy Fleming and Regis Philbin. King quit smoking after the heart attack, having smoked three packs of cigarettes a day until then.

King related his heart attack experience in an interview in the 2014 British documentary film &quot;The Widowmaker&quot;, which advocates for coronary calcium scanning to motivate preventive cardiology and highlights the financial conflicts of interest in the widespread use of coronary stents. He received annual chest X-rays to monitor his heart condition. During his 2017 examination, doctors discovered a malignant tumor in his lung. It was then successfully removed with surgery.

On April 23, 2019, King underwent a scheduled angioplasty and also had stents inserted. It was erroneously reported that he had another heart attack along with heart failure; these claims were later retracted. He returned to &quot;Politicking with Larry King&quot; on August 15. On November 27, he said he had a stroke in March, and was in a coma &quot;for weeks&quot;. He later admitted he had contemplated suicide following the stroke, telling Los Angeles television station KTLA, &quot;I thought I was just going to bite the bullet. I didn&#x27;t want to live this way.&quot;

On January 2, 2021, it was reported that King had been admitted to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles due to severe COVID-19 infection, but had moved out of the ICU. Three weeks later, at the age of 87, King died of sepsis due to the prior health issues (such as a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to bacterial infection), though he had survived the virus. His estranged wife, Shawn Southwick-King, told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that King died from a sepsis infection, which was unrelated to COVID-19.

<text>Maria Antonovna Naryshkina (Russian: Мария Антоновна Нарышкина; 1779–1854), born Princess Maria Czetwertyńska-Światopełk, was a Polish noblewoman who was the mistress of Tsar Alexander I of Russia for 19 years.

== Early life ==
Born into the House of Światopełk-Czetwertyński, she was the daughter of the Polish prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk and his wife, Tekla von Kampenhausen (1750–1791).

== Biography ==
In 1795, she married Dmitry Lvovich Naryshkin (1758–1838), a hofmeister. In 1799, with her spouse&#x27;s approval, she entered into a relationship with Alexander, who became tsar in 1801. She was well-liked by Alexander&#x27;s family, except by his consort, the empress Elizabeth Alexeievna.

She is described as fascinating and charming, with the ability to attract people, and called &quot;The Aspasia of the North&quot;. Phillip Vigel wrote that she had beauty &quot;so perfect that it seemed impossible&quot;. In 1803, she made an attempt to have Alexander divorce his spouse and marry her, but she failed. She accompanied the tsar to the Vienna Congress in 1815, which gave him bad publicity.

She had at least four illegitimate daughters by Alexander. Three of them (two named Yelizaveta and one named Zinaida) died in infancy, and the other, Sofia, lived to aged 16. She also had a son, Emanuel, who wasn&#x27;t admitted by her husband and was possibly also the tsar&#x27;s child.

Her children were:
*Marina Naryshkina (1798 – 11 August 1871)
*Yelizaveta Naryshkina (born and died 1803) 
*Yelizaveta Naryshkina (born and died 1804) 
*Zinaida Naryshkina (1806 – 18 May 1810)
*Sofia Naryshkina (1808 – 18 June 1824) 
*Emanuel Naryshkin (30 July 1813 – 31 December 1901)

Alexander was persuaded to leave her in 1818 and went back to his wife, Elizabeth. He continued to talk of her as his family.

<text>Capital gain is an economic concept defined as the profit earned on the sale of an asset which has increased in value over the holding period. An asset may include tangible property, a car, a business, or intangible property such as shares.

A capital gain is only possible when the selling price of the asset is greater than the original purchase price. In the event that the purchase price exceeds the sale price, a capital loss occurs. Capital gains are often subject to taxation, of which rates and exemptions may differ between countries. The history of capital gain originates at the birth of the modern economic system and its evolution has been described as complex and multidimensional by a variety of economic thinkers. The concept of capital gain may be considered comparable with other key economic concepts such as profit and rate of return; however, its distinguishing feature is that individuals, not just businesses, can accrue capital gains through everyday and disposal of assets.

The history of capital gain in human development includes conceptualizations from pre-1865 slave capital in the United States, to the development of property rights in France in 1789, and even other developments much earlier. The official beginning of a practical application of capital gain occurred with the development of the Babylonian&#x27;s financial system circa 2000 B.C. This system introduced treasuries where citizens could deposit silver and gold for safekeeping, and also transact with other members of the economy. As such, this allowed the Babylonians to calculate costs, sale prices and profits, and hence capital gains.

== Calculation ==
Capital gain is generally calculated through taking the sale price of an asset and subtracting its base cost and any incurred expenses. The resulting value will be the capital gain, or capital loss if negative. In reality, many governments provide supplementary methods of calculating capital gains for both individuals and businesses. These methods can provide taxation relief through lowering the calculated capital gain value.

=== Australia ===
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) lists three methods of calculating capital gain for Australian citizens and businesses, each one designed to lower the final resulting value of the eligible party&#x27;s gain. The first is the discount method, whereby eligible individuals or super funds may reduce their stated capital gain value by 50% or 33.33% respectively. The second is the indexation method, which allows individuals and firms to apply an index factor to increase the base cost of the asset, thereby decreasing the final capital gain value. The third is the ‘other’ method, and involves use of the general capital gain formula whereby the base costs of the asset are subtracted from its final sale price.

=== Canada ===
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) includes several unique guidelines for calculating individual or business capital gain. The CRA states that individuals may exclude from their capital gains calculation the following types of donations: “shares in the capital stock of a mutual fund corporation… prescribed debt obligations that are not linked notes, ecologically sensitive land… (or) a share, debt obligation, or right listed on a designated stock exchange”. Note that for the exclusion to be approved the donation must be to a qualified donee, and also that capital losses arising from such donations are not eligible to be excluded from an individual&#x27;s reporting. The CRA states that following a capital gain, individuals may be able to either claim a reserve or claim a capital gains deduction. Individuals are eligible to claim a reserve when the capital gain does not occur as one lump-sum payment but rather a series of payments over time. In order to calculate the reserve, Canadian individuals must calculate their capital gain via the regular sale price minus cost price method, and subsequently subtract the amount of approved reserve for the year. A capital gains deduction is the second form of capital gain calculation which the CRA offers. It is “a deduction that you can claim against taxable capital gains you realized from the disposition of certain capital properties”. Only residents from Canada throughout the previous year are eligible to claim the deduction, and only certain capital gains are eligible for the deduction to be applied.

=== Germany ===
The German tax office levies different capital gains tax based on the asset you sold and the holding period. Taxpayers in Germany, pay a flat 25% (2024) capital gains tax on their profits from selling the stocks plus solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (2024). If the individual is a church member, they also pay church tax. In the end the total capital gains tax is 27.82% in Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, and 27.99% in all other federal states. Taxes on the sale of real estate are completely different from that of stocks. If you hold the property for more than ten years, you can sell it tax-free in Germany. Similarly, you can sell the property tax-free if you lived in it yourself for at least two years. However, you pay taxes based on your personal tax rate if you don&#x27;t meet any of the tax-free criteria.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, capital gains are computed by subtracting the asset’s adjusted cost (including any allowable improvement expenses) from its disposal proceeds under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The tax rate applied depends on the type of asset, its acquisition date, and the holding period. For example, listed securities acquired on or after 1 July 2024 are generally subject to a flat 15% tax. While prior to that, shorter holding periods attracting higher rates and longer holdings sometimes qualifying for reduced rates or exemptions. Likewise, gains on immovable property are taxed on a sliding scale—short-term gains incur higher rates, while those from assets held over a longer period benefit from progressively lower rates or full exemptions.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) office lists certain assets which are eligible to be considered as capital gains. These include “most personal possessions worth  £6,000 or more, apart from your car”, property that is not considered your primary dwelling, your main dwelling if it exceeds a certain size or has been used for business, any shares that are not in an individual savings account or personal equity plan, and any business assets. HMRC also lists certain assets which are exempt from accruing capital gains, including any gains made from individual savings accounts or personal equity plans, “UK government gilts and Premium Bonds”, and any winnings from lottery, betting or pools. HMRC states that only gains made above an individual&#x27;s allowance are eligible to be taxed, and no tax is payable for individuals who accrue gains which are under their Capital Gains Tax allowance. In order to calculate an individual&#x27;s capital gain, HMRC requires calculation of the gains for each asset in the relevant 12-month period, which are then summed together and finally reduced by the amount of allowable losses deduction. HMRC also states that when reporting a loss, “the amount is deducted from the gains you made in the same tax year”.

=== United States ===
The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also provides guidelines on calculating capital gains. The IRS defines a capital gain or loss as “the difference between the adjusted basis in the asset and the amount you realized from the sale”. Capital gains are also further defined as either short term or long term. Short term capital gains occur when you hold the base asset for less than one year, while long term capital gains occur when the asset is held for over one year. Ownership dates are to be counted from the day after the date which the asset was acquired, through to the day which the asset is sold.

== Taxation of gains ==

There are typically significant differences in the taxation of capital gains earned by individuals and corporations, and the OECD recognizes three simple categories of individual capital income which are taxed by its member nations around the world. These include dividend income, interest income, and capital gains realized through property and shares. The OECD average dividend tax rate is 41.8%, whereby dividends are often taxed at both the corporate and individual level and categorized as corporate income first and personal income second. However, certain countries such as Australia, Chile, Mexico, and New Zealand employ imputation tax systems which allow corporations to redeem imputation credits for tax paid at the corporate level, thus reducing their tax burden. The OECD average interest income tax rate is 27%, and almost all OECD countries excluding Chile, Estonia, Israel, and Mexico tax an individual&#x27;s total nominal interest income.

== Eligible assets ==
Capital gain can only be earned on the profitable sale of assets. A former Chief Accountant of the Securities Exchange Commission defined an asset as: “Cash, contractual claims to cash or services, and items that can be sold separately for cash”. Practical applications of this definition primarily include stocks and real estate.
=== Stocks ===
A capital gain may be earned through the sale of financial assets such as stocks. When one sells a stock, they would subtract the cost price from the sale price to calculate their capital gain or loss.

==== Disposition effect ====
The disposition effect is a theory which links human psychology to capital gain in stocks and examines how humans make choices under the threat of a potential capital loss. It reveals a pattern of irrationality within human behaviour, in which stocks which have potential to accrue a capital gain are sold too early, while stocks which are clear losers are held on for too long, thus creating greater capital losses than necessary.

==== Expected capital gain asset pricing model ====
This asset pricing model details how the expectations of future capital gains in the stock market are a key driver of actual stock price movements. In general, “asset price boom and bust cycles… are fueled by the belief-updating dynamics of investors”, and thereby the optimism regarding future capital gains in a particular stock will often be the cause of the eventual increase in the stock&#x27;s price.

==== Lock-in effect ====
The lock-in effect proposes that rather than realize capital gains on stocks, investors should instead revert to short-selling substitute securities. Provided that “tax-exempt perfect substitute securities exist”, investors should never realize their capital gains on stocks because it is possible to reduce the risk from a large position in a stock by “costlessly short selling a perfect substitute”.

=== Real estate ===
A capital gain may be earned through the sale of physical assets such as houses, apartments or land. In most countries however, the sale of a primary dwelling or Primary residence is exempt from capital gains tax. For example, the Australian Taxation Office offers a full exemption of capital gains tax on the sale of a primary home, provided the individual or couple meets certain eligibility criteria.

==== Efficiency in the real estate markets ====
The interlink between psychology and capital gain is also frequently seen in stocks, a concept which is similarly explored by Dusansky &amp; Koç. Since houses are not only consumption but often investment expenditures for families, expectations of capital gains through investing in the house as an asset rather than a consumption good has a strong influence on actual housing prices and demand. As stated by Dusansky &amp; Koç, “an increase in housing prices increases the demand for owner-occupied housing services. Thus, housing’s role as investment asset with its potential for capital gains dominates its role as consumption good”.

=== Bonds ===
A capital gain may be earned through the sale of intangible financial assets such as bonds. The capital gain would be achieved when the selling price of the bond is higher than the cost price, and the capital loss would occur if the selling price of the bond is lower than the cost price.

==== Exemptions ====
Some government departments, such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) do not classify gains arising from the profitable sale of a bond as a capital gain. If an individual redeems a bond for more than, or less than, the price they paid for the bond, the ATO states that this profit is “not treated as a capital gain” and that the profit should simply be included in the individual&#x27;s tax return. Similarly, if an individual sells a bond to another individual for more than, or less than, the price they paid for the bond, the ATO states that “this profit is not treated as a capital gain” and that the profit should simply be included in the individual&#x27;s tax return. However, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does consider profits from the redemption or sale of a bond as a capital gain. Bond capital gains are calculated in the same method as other capital gains, whereby “the difference between the adjusted basis in the asset and the amount you realized from the sale is a capital gain or a capital loss”. In Pakistan, assets held for personally use, except from jewelry, artwork, and collectibles, are exempt while calculating capital gains.

<doc id="301873" wikidata="Q5366160" url="?curid=301873" title="Scrapple">
<text>Scrapple, also known by the Pennsylvania Dutch name ( in English; compare Panhas), is a traditional mush of fried pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices. 

Scrapple and are commonly considered an ethnic food of the Pennsylvania Dutch, including the Mennonites and Amish. Scraps of meat left over from butchering not otherwise used or sold were made into scrapple to avoid waste. 

More broadly, scrapple is primarily eaten in the southern Mid-Atlantic areas of the United States (Delaware, Maryland, South Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.).

==Composition==
Scrapple is typically made of hog offal, such as the head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning vary based on the region and the cook&#x27;s taste.

A few manufacturers have introduced beef and turkey varieties and color the loaf to retain the traditional coloration derived from the original pork liver base.

Due to its composition, it is often jokingly described as being made from &quot;everything but the oink&quot;.

==Preparation==

Scrapple is fully cooked when purchased. It is then typically cut into slices and pan-fried until brown to form a crust. It is sometimes first coated with flour. It may be fried in butter or oil and is sometimes deep-fried. Scrapple can also be broiled.

Scrapple is usually eaten as a breakfast side dish. It can be served plain or with either sweet or savory condiments: apple butter, ketchup, jelly, maple syrup, honey, or mustard.

==History and regional popularity==
Etymologically, &quot;scrapple&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;scrap&quot;, a reference to its composition.

The roots of the culinary traditions that led to the development of scrapple in America have been traced back to pre-Roman Europe. The more immediate culinary ancestor of scrapple was the Low German dish called , which was adapted to make use of locally available ingredients, and it is still called &quot;Pannhaas&quot;, &quot;panhoss&quot;, &quot;ponhoss&quot;, or &quot;pannhas&quot; in parts of Pennsylvania. The first recipes were created by German colonists who settled near Philadelphia and Chester County, Pennsylvania, in the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, scrapple is strongly associated with areas surrounding Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.; Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Southern New York, and the Delmarva Peninsula. Its popularity on the Delmarva Peninsula is celebrated the second weekend of October during the annual &quot;Apple Scrapple Festival&quot; in Bridgeville, Delaware.

The two largest brands of scrapple in Philadelphia are Habbersett and Rapa, controlling approximately half and one-quarter of the market, respectively. Rapa accounts for about three-quarters of the Baltimore market.
The title of jazz artist Charlie Parker&#x27;s 1947 composition &quot;Scrapple from the Apple&quot; is inspired by the food scrapple, in the Big Apple (New York City).

In the Poconos, kosher scrapple is made using chicken.

<text>The Venice Biennale ( ; ) is an international cultural exhibition hosted annually in Venice, Italy, by the Biennale Foundation. It focuses on contemporary art, and includes events for art, contemporary dance, architecture, cinema, and theatre. Two main components of the festival are known as the Art Biennale () and the Architecture Biennale (), which are held in alternating years (hence the name). The others, , Venice Film Festival, and Venice Dance Biennaleare held annually. The main exhibition is held in Castello and has around 30 permanent pavilions built by different countries.

The Biennale has been organised every year since 1895, which makes it the oldest of its kind. Since 2021, the Art Biennale has taken place in even years and the Architecture Biennale in odd years.

== History ==
===1895–1947===

On 19 April 1893, the Venetian City Council passed a resolution to set up an biennial exhibition of Italian Art (&quot;Esposizione biennale artistica nazionale&quot;) to celebrate the silver anniversary of King Umberto I and Margherita of Savoy.

A year later, the council decreed &quot;to adopt a &#x27;by invitation&#x27; system; to reserve a section of the Exhibition for foreign artists too; to admit works by uninvited Italian artists, as selected by a jury.&quot;

The first , &quot;I Esposizione Internazionale d&#x27;Arte della Città di Venezia (1st International Art Exhibition of the City of Venice)&quot; (although originally scheduled for 22 April 1894) was opened on 30 April 1895, by the Italian King and Queen, Umberto I and Margherita di Savoia. The first exhibition was seen by 224,000 visitors. The exhibition took place in the Giardini.

The event became increasingly international in the first decades of the 20th century: from 1907 on, several countries installed national pavilions at the exhibition, with the first being from Belgium. In 1910 the first internationally well-known artists were displayed: a room dedicated to Gustav Klimt, a one-man show for Renoir, a retrospective of Courbet. A work by Picasso &quot;Family of Saltimbanques&quot; was removed from the Spanish salon in the central Palazzo because it was feared that its novelty might shock the public. By 1914 seven pavilions had been established: Belgium (1907), Hungary (1909), Germany (1909), Great Britain (1909), France (1912), and Russia (1914).

During World War I, the 1916 and 1918 events were cancelled. In 1920 the post of mayor of Venice and president of the Biennale was split. The new secretary general, Vittorio Pica brought about the first presence of avant-garde art, notably Impressionists and Post-Impressionists.

1922 saw an exhibition of sculpture by African artists. Between the two World Wars, many important modern artists had their work exhibited there. In 1928 the Istituto Storico d&#x27;Arte Contemporanea (Historical Institute of Contemporary Art) opened, which was the first nucleus of archival collections of the Biennale. In 1930 its name was changed into Historical Archive of Contemporary Art.

In 1930, the Biennale was transformed into an Ente Autonomo (Autonomous Board) by Royal Decree with law no. 33 of 13 January 1930. Subsequently, the control of the Biennale passed from the Venice city council to the national Fascist government under Benito Mussolini. This brought on a restructuring, an associated financial boost, as well as a new president, Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata. Three entirely new events were established, including the Biennale Musica in 1930, also referred to as International Festival of Contemporary Music; the Venice Film Festival in 1932, which they claim as the first film festival in history, also referred to as Venice International Film Festival; and the Biennale Theatro in 1934, also referred to as International Theatre Festival.

In 1933 the Biennale organized an exhibition of Italian art abroad. From 1938, Grand Prizes were awarded in the art exhibition section.

During World War II, the activities of the Biennale were interrupted: 1942 saw the last edition of the events. The Film Festival restarted in 1946, the Music and Theatre festivals were resumed in 1947, and the Art Exhibition in 1948.

===1948–1973===

The Art Biennale was resumed in 1948 with a major exhibition of a recapitulatory nature. The Secretary General, art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini, started with the Impressionists and many protagonists of contemporary art including Chagall, Klee, Braque, Delvaux, Ensor, and Magritte, as well as a retrospective of Picasso&#x27;s work. Peggy Guggenheim was invited to exhibit her collection, later to be permanently housed at Ca&#x27; Venier dei Leoni.

1949 saw the beginning of renewed attention to avant-garde movements in European—and later worldwide—movements in contemporary art. Abstract expressionism was introduced in the 1950s, and the Biennale is credited with importing Pop Art into the canon of art history by awarding the top prize to Robert Rauschenberg in 1964. From 1948 to 1972, Italian architect Carlo Scarpa did a series of remarkable interventions in the Biennale&#x27;s exhibition spaces.

In 1954 the island San Giorgio Maggiore provided the venue for the first Japanese Noh theatre shows in Europe. 1956 saw the selection of films following an artistic selection and no longer based upon the designation of the participating country. The 1957 Golden Lion went to Satyajit Ray&#x27;s Aparajito which introduced Indian cinema to the West.

1962 included Arte Informale at the Art Exhibition with Jean Fautrier, Hans Hartung, Emilio Vedova, and Pietro Consagra. The 1964 Art Exhibition introduced continental Europe to Pop Art (The Independent Group had been founded in Britain in 1952). The American Robert Rauschenberg was the first American artist to win the Gran Premio, and the youngest to date.

The student protests of 1968 also marked a crisis for the Biennale. Student protests hindered the opening of the Biennale. A resulting period of institutional changes opened and ending with a new Statute in 1973. In 1969, following the protests, the Grand Prizes were abandoned. These resumed in 1980 for the Mostra del Cinema and in 1986 for the Art Exhibition.

In 1972, for the first time, a theme was adopted by the Biennale, called &quot;Opera o comportamento&quot; (&quot;Work or Behaviour&quot;).

Starting from 1973 the Music Festival was no longer held annually. During the year in which the Mostra del Cinema was not held, there was a series of &quot;Giornate del cinema italiano&quot; (Days of Italian Cinema) promoted by sectorial bodies in campo Santa Margherita, in Venice.

===1974–1998===
1973 saw the start of the five-year presidency of Carlo Ripa di Meana. The International Art Exhibition was not held (until it was resumed in 1976). Theatre and cinema events were held in October 1974 and 1975 under the title &quot;Libertà per il Cile&quot; (Freedom for Chile)—a major cultural protest against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.

On 15 November 1977, the so-called &quot;Dissident Biennale&quot; (in reference to the dissident movement in the USSR) opened. Because of the ensuing controversies within the Italian left wing parties, president Ripa di Meana resigned at the end of the year.

In 1978 the new presidency of Giuseppe Galasso (1978-1983) began. The principle was laid down whereby each of the artistic sectors was to have a permanent director to organise its activity.

In 1980, the Architecture section of the Biennale was set up. The director, Paolo Portoghesi, opened the Corderie dell&#x27;Arsenale to the public for the first time. At the Mostra del Cinema, the awards were brought back into being (between 1969 and 1979, the editions were non-competitive). In 1980, Achille Bonito Oliva and Harald Szeemann introduced &quot;Aperto&quot;, a section of the exhibition designed to explore emerging art. Italian art historian Giovanni Carandente directed the 1988 and 1990 editions. A three-year gap was left afterwards to make sure that the 1995 edition would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Biennale.

The 1993 edition was directed by Achille Bonito Oliva. In 1995, Jean Clair was appointed to be the Biennale&#x27;s first non-Italian director of visual arts while Germano Celant served as director in 1997.

For the Centenary in 1995, the Biennale promoted events in every sector of its activity: the 34th Festival del Teatro, the 46th art exhibition, the 46th Festival di Musica, the 52nd Mostra del Cinema.

===1999–present===
The 48th and 49th editions, in 1999 and 2001, were directed by Harald Szeemann. These editions had a larger representation of artists from Asia and Eastern Europe and young artists and expanded the show into several newly restored spaces of the Arsenale.

In 1999 a new sector was created for live shows: DMT (Dance Music Theatre).

The 50th edition, 2003, directed by Francesco Bonami, had a record number of seven co-curators involved, including Hans Ulrich Obrist, Catherine David, Igor Zabel, Hou Hanru and Massimiliano Gioni.

The 51st edition of the Biennale opened in June 2005, curated, for the first time by two women, Maria de Corral and Rosa Martinez. De Corral organized &quot;The Experience of Art&quot; which included 41 artists, from past masters to younger figures. Rosa Martinez took over the Arsenale with &quot;Always a Little Further.&quot; Drawing on &quot;the myth of the romantic traveler&quot; her exhibition involved 49 artists, ranging from the elegant to the profane.

In 2007, Robert Storr became the first director from the United States to curate the Biennale (the 52nd), with a show entitled &quot;Think with the Senses – Feel with the Mind. Art in the Present Tense&quot;.

Swedish curator Daniel Birnbaum was artistic director of the 2009 edition entitled &quot;Fare Mondi // Making Worlds&quot;.

The 2011 edition was curated by Swiss curator Bice Curiger entitled &quot;ILLUMInazioni – ILLUMInations&quot;.

The Biennale in 2013 was curated by the Italian Massimiliano Gioni. His title and theme, &quot;Il Palazzo Enciclopedico / The Encyclopedic Palace&quot;, was adopted from an architectural model by the self-taught Italian-American artist Marino Auriti. Auriti&#x27;s work, The Encyclopedic Palace of the World was lent by the American Folk Art Museum and exhibited in the first room of the Arsenale for the duration of the biennale. For Gioni, Auriti&#x27;s work, &quot;meant to house all worldly knowledge, bringing together the greatest discoveries of the human race, from the wheel to the satellite,&quot; provided an analogous figure for the &quot;biennale model itself...based on the impossible desire to concentrate the infinite worlds of contemporary art in a single place: a task that now seems as dizzyingly absurd as Auriti&#x27;s dream.&quot;

Curator Okwui Enwezor was responsible for the 2015 edition. He was the first African-born curator of the biennial. As a catalyst for imagining different ways of imagining multiple desires and futures Enwezor commissioned special projects and programs throughout the Biennale in the Giardini. This included a Creative Time Summit, &quot;e-flux journal&quot;″s SUPERCOMMUNITY, Gulf Labor Coalition, The Invisible Borders Trans-African Project and Abounaddara.

The 2017 Biennale, titled &quot;Viva Arte Viva&quot;, was directed by French curator Christine Macel who called it an &quot;exhibition inspired by humanism&quot;. German artist Franz Erhard Walther won the Golden Lion for best artist in the central pavilion, while Carolee Schneemann was awarded a posthumous Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement.

The 2019 Biennale, titled &quot;May You Live In Interesting Times&quot;, was directed by American-born curator Ralph Rugoff.

The 2022 edition, curated by Italian curator Cecilia Alemani, was entitled &quot;The Milk of Dreams&quot; after a book by British-born Mexican surrealist painter Leonora Carrington.

The Biennale has an attendance to date of over 500,000 visitors.

In February 2024, thousands of artists and cultural workers, including Jesse Darling, Joanna Piotrowska, Nan Goldin, Michael Rakowitz and Leila Sansour, signed a petition calling for Israel to be excluded from the Venice Biennale due to Israel&#x27;s military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Biennale rejected the petition, saying it would &quot;not take into consideration any petition or call to exclude&quot; countries recognized by Italy. Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said that: &quot;Israel not only has the right to express its art, but it has the duty to bear witness to its people precisely at a time like this when it has been ruthlessly struck by merciless terrorists. The Venice Art Biennale will always be a space of freedom, encounter and dialogue and not a space of censorship and intolerance.&quot;

On 13 February 2024, the Holy See Press Office announced that Pope Francis would attend the Venice Biennale. He visited the Pavilion of the Holy See in the Prison Giudecca on Sunday 28 April 2024. This was the first time a pope has visited the international exhibition.

== Organization ==

The main exhibition held in Castello, in the halls of the Arsenale and Biennale Gardens, alternates between art and architecture (hence the name &quot;biennale&quot;; &quot;biennial&quot;). The other events hosted by the Foundationspanning theatre, music, and danceare held annually in various parts of Venice, whereas the Venice Film Festival takes place at the Lido.

===Art Biennale===
The Art Biennale (La Biennale d&#x27;Arte di Venezia) is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most important contemporary visual art exhibitions. So-called because it is held biannually, it is the original biennale on which others in the world have been modeled. The exhibition space spans over 7,000 square meters, and artists from over 75 countries are represented in the collective exhibition spaces as well as in the national pavilions.

Until 2019, the Art Biennale used to take place in odd years and the Architecture Biennale in even years, but after the COVID-19 pandemic forced a postponement, the Art Biennale now takes place in even years (2022, 2024) and the Architecture Biennale in odd years (2021, 2023).

===Architecture Biennale===
The Architecture Biennale (La Biennale d&#x27;Architettura di Venezia) is held in odd-numbered years. Similarly to the Art Biennale, the exhibition is based one main exhibition in the arsenale halls, as well as national exhibitions hosted in the pavilions of the arsenale and Biennale gardens.

==Role in the art market==
When the Venice Biennale was founded in 1895, one of its main goals was to establish a new market for contemporary art. Between 1942 and 1968 a sales office assisted artists in finding clients and selling their work, a service for which it charged 10% commission. Sales remained an intrinsic part of the biennale until 1968, when a sales ban was enacted. An important practical reason why the focus on non-commodities has failed to decouple Venice from the market is that the biennale itself lacks the funds to produce, ship and install these large-scale works. Therefore, the financial involvement of dealers is widely regarded as indispensable; as they regularly front the funding for production of ambitious projects. Furthermore, every other year the Venice Biennale coincides with nearby Art Basel, the world&#x27;s prime commercial fair for modern and contemporary art. Numerous galleries with artists on show in Venice usually bring work by the same artists to Basel.

==Central Pavilion and Arsenale==
The formal Biennale is based at a park, the Giardini. The Giardini includes a large exhibition hall that houses a themed exhibition curated by the Biennale&#x27;s director.

Initiated in 1980, the Aperto began as a fringe event for younger artists and artists of a national origin not represented by the permanent national pavilions. This is usually staged in the Arsenale and has become part of the formal biennale programme. In 1995 there was no Aperto so a number of participating countries hired venues to show exhibitions of emerging artists. From 1999, both the international exhibition and the Aperto were held as one exhibition, held both at the Central Pavilion and the Arsenale. Also in 1999, a $1 million renovation transformed the Arsenale area into a cluster of renovated shipyards, sheds and warehouses, more than doubling the Arsenale&#x27;s exhibition space of previous years.

A special edition of the 54th Biennale was held at Padiglione Italia of &quot;Torino Esposizioni – Sala Nervi&quot; (December 2011 – February 2012) for the 150th Anniversary of Italian Unification. The event was directed by Vittorio Sgarbi.

==National pavilions==

The Giardini houses 30 permanent national pavilions. Alongside the Central Pavilion, built in 1894 and later restructured and extended several times, the Giardini are occupied by a further 29 permanent pavilions built at different periods by the various countries participating in the Biennale. The first nation to build a pavilion was Belgium in 1907, followed by Germany, Britain and Hungary in 1909. The pavilions are the property of the individual countries and are managed by their ministries of culture. 

Countries not owning a pavilion in the Giardini are exhibited in other venues across Venice. The number of countries represented is still growing. In 2005, China was showing for the first time, followed by the African Pavilion and Mexico (2007), the United Arab Emirates (2009), and India (2011).

The assignment of the permanent pavilions was largely dictated by the international politics of the 1930s and the Cold War. There is no single format to how each country manages their pavilion, established and emerging countries represented at the biennial maintain and fund their pavilions in different ways. While pavilions are usually government-funded, private money plays an increasingly large role; in 2015, the pavilions of Iraq, Ukraine and Syria were completely privately funded. The pavilion for Great Britain is always managed by the British Council while the United States assigns the responsibility to a public gallery chosen by the Department of State which, since 1985, has been the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The countries at the Arsenale that request a temporary exhibition space pay a hire fee per square meter.
In 2011, the countries were Albania, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechia and Slovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela, Wales, and Zimbabwe. In addition to this there are two collective pavilions: Central Asia Pavilion and Istituto Italo-Latino Americano. In 2013, eleven new participant countries developed national pavilions for the Biennale: Angola, Bosnia and Herzegowina, the Bahamas, Bahrain, the Ivory Coast, Kosovo, Kuwait, the Maldives, Paraguay, Tuvalu, and the Holy See. In 2015, five new participant countries developed pavilions for the Biennale: Grenada, Republic of Mozambique, Republic of Seychelles, Mauritius and Mongolia. In 2017, three countries participated in the Art Biennale for the first time: Antigua and Barbuda, Kiribati, and Nigeria. In 2019, four countries participated in the Art Biennale for the first time: Ghana, Madagascar, Malaysia, and Pakistan.

The pavilions also used the Architecture Biennale.

As well as the national pavilions there are countless &quot;unofficial pavilions&quot; that spring up every year. In 2009 there were pavilions such as the Gabon Pavilion and a Peckham pavilion. In 2017 The Diaspora Pavilion bought together 19 artists from complex, multinational backgrounds to challenge the prevalence of the nation state at the Biennale.

The Internet Pavilion () was founded in 2009 as a platform for activists and artists working in new media. Subsequent editions were held since, 2013, in conjunction with the biennale.

==Awards==

The Venice Biennale has awarded prizes to the artists participating at the Exhibition since the first edition back in 1895. Grand Prizes were established in 1938 and ran until 1968 when they were abolished due to the protest movement. Prizes were taken up again in 1986. The selections are made by the Board of la Biennale di Venezia, following the proposal of the curator of the International Exhibition.

Also upon the recommendation of the curator, the Biennale names the five members of its international jury, which is charged with awarding prizes to the national pavilions. The international jury awards the Golden Lion for best national participation, the Golden Lion for best participant in the international exhibition, and the Silver Lion for a &quot;promising young participant&quot; in the show. It may also designate one special mention to national participants, and a maximum of two special mentions to artists in the international exhibition.

==Collateral events==
In conjunction with the primary international exhibition and national pavilions, many local and international galleries, museums, foundations, and nonprofits stage independent exhibitions throughout the city of Venice. The curator of the international exhibition chooses a number of these exhibitions to be included as Collateral Events in the Biennale program. While these exhibitions are not organized by the Biennale, exhibitions chosen as Collateral Events are promoted by the Biennale as an additional component of the event.

==Management==
===Legal structure===
The offices of the Biennale are at Ca&#x27; Giustinian in the sestiere San Marco.

On 26 July 1973, Italian Parliament approved the Organization&#x27;s new statute for the Biennale. A &quot;democratic&quot; Board was set up. It included 19 members made up of representatives from the Government, the most important local organizations, major trade unions, and a representative of the staff. The Board was to elect the President and nominate the Sectorial Directors – one each for Visual arts, Cinema, Music, and Theatre.

In 1998 the Biennale was transformed into a legal personality in private law and renamed &quot;Società di Cultura La Biennale di Venezia&quot;. The company structure – Board of directors, Scientific committee, Board of auditors and assembly of private backers – has a duration of four years. The areas of activity became six (Architecture, Visual arts, Cinema, Theatre, Music, Dance), in collaboration with the ASAC (the Historical Archives). The President is nominated by the Minister for Cultural Affairs. The Board of directors consists of the President, the Mayor of Venice, and three members nominated by Veneto regional government and private backers. Dance was added to the others.

On 15 January 2004, the Biennale was transformed into a foundation.

<text>Abraham Harold Maslow ( ; April 1, 1908 – June 8, 1970) was an American psychologist who created Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs in priority, culminating in self-actualization. Maslow was a psychology professor at Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research, and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a &quot;bag of symptoms&quot;. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Maslow as the tenth most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Born in 1908 and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Maslow was the oldest of seven children. His parents were first-generation Jewish immigrants from Kiev, then part of the Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine), who fled from Czarist persecution in the early 20th century. They had decided to live in New York City and in a multiethnic, working-class neighborhood. His parents were poor and not intellectually focused, but they valued education. He had various encounters with antisemitic gangs who would chase and throw rocks at him. Maslow and other young people with his background were struggling to overcome such acts of racism and ethnic prejudice in an attempt to establish an idealistic world based on widespread education and economic justice.

The tension outside his home was also felt within it, as he rarely got along with his mother and eventually developed a strong revulsion towards her. He is quoted as saying, &quot;What I had reacted to was not only her physical appearance, but also her values and world view, her stinginess, her total selfishness, her lack of love for anyone else in the world—even her own husband and children—her narcissism, her Negro prejudice, her exploitation of everyone, her assumption that anyone was wrong who disagreed with her, her lack of friends, her sloppiness and dirtiness...&quot;. He also grew up with few friends other than his cousin Will, and as a result, he &quot;grew up in libraries and among books&quot;. It was here that he developed his love for reading and learning. He went to Boys High School, one of the top high schools in Brooklyn, where his best friend was his cousin Will Maslow. Here, he served as the officer to many academic clubs and became editor of the Latin magazine. He also edited &quot;Principia,&quot; the school&#x27;s physics paper, for a year. He developed other strengths as well: 

===College and university===
Maslow attended the City College of New York after high school. In 1926, he began taking legal studies classes at night in addition to his undergraduate course load. He hated it and almost immediately dropped out. In 1927, he transferred to Cornell but left after just one semester due to poor grades and high costs. He later graduated from City College and went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin (UW) to study psychology. In 1928, he married his first cousin, Bertha, who was still in high school. The pair had met in Brooklyn years earlier.

Maslow&#x27;s psychology training at UW was decidedly experimental-behaviorist. At Wisconsin, he pursued a line of research that included investigating primate dominance behavior and sexuality. Maslow&#x27;s early experience with behaviorism would leave him with a strong positivist mindset. Upon the recommendation of professor Hulsey Cason, Maslow wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on &quot;learning, retention, and reproduction of verbal material&quot;. Maslow regarded the research as embarrassingly trivial, but he completed his thesis in the summer of 1931 and was awarded his master&#x27;s degree in psychology. He was so ashamed of the thesis that he removed it from the psychology library and tore out its catalog listing. However, Cason admired the research enough to urge Maslow to submit it for publication. Maslow&#x27;s thesis was published as two articles in 1934.

===Academic career===
Maslow continued his research on similar themes at Columbia University. There he found another mentor in Alfred Adler, one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s early colleagues. From 1937 to 1951, Maslow was on the faculty of Brooklyn College. His family life and his experiences influenced his psychological ideas. After World War II, Maslow began to question how psychologists had come to their conclusions, and though he did not completely disagree, he had his own ideas on how to understand the human mind. He called his new discipline humanistic psychology. Maslow was already a 33-year-old father and had two children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. He was thus ineligible for the military. However, the horrors of war inspired a vision of peace in him, leading to his groundbreaking psychological studies of self-actualizing. The studies began under the supervision of two mentors, anthropologist Ruth Benedict and Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer, whom he admired both professionally and personally. They accomplished a lot in both realms. Being such &quot;wonderful human beings&quot; also inspired Maslow to take notes about them and their behavior. This would be the basis of his lifelong research and thinking about mental health and human potential.

Maslow extended the subject, borrowing ideas from other psychologists and adding new ones, such as the concepts of a hierarchy of needs, metaneeds, metamotivation, self-actualizing persons, and peak experiences. He was a professor at Brandeis University from 1951 to 1969. He became a resident fellow of the Laughlin Institute in California. In 1967, Maslow had a serious heart attack and knew his time was limited. He considered himself to be a psychological pioneer. He pushed future psychologists by bringing to light different paths to ponder. He built the framework that later allowed other psychologists to conduct more comprehensive studies. Maslow believed that leadership should be non-intervening. Consistent with this approach, he rejected a nomination in 1963 to be the Association for Humanistic Psychology president because he felt the organization should develop an intellectual movement without a leader.

===Death===
While jogging, Maslow had a severe heart attack and died on June 8, 1970, at the age of 62 in Menlo Park, California. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

==Maslow&#x27;s contributions==

===Humanistic psychology===
Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. Humanistic psychology gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals&#x27; achieving them. The most famous of these was client-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers.

The basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple:

* Someone&#x27;s present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future.
* To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative.
* Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person.
* The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.

Humanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud&#x27;s theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined &quot;positive psychology&quot;, is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders. Humanistic psychologists believe that every person has a strong desire to realize their full potential, to reach a level of &quot;self-actualization&quot;. The main point of that new movement, that reached its peak in the 1960s, was to emphasize the positive potential of human beings. Maslow positioned his work as a vital complement to that of Freud:

However, Maslow was highly critical of Freud, since humanistic psychologists did not recognize spirituality as a navigation for our behaviors.

To prove that humans are not blindly reacting to situations, but trying to accomplish something greater, Maslow studied mentally healthy individuals instead of people with serious psychological issues. He focused on self-actualizing people. Self-actualizing people indicate a &quot;coherent personality syndrome&quot; and represent optimal psychological health and functioning.

This informed his theory that a person enjoys &quot;peak experiences&quot;, high points in life when the individual is in harmony with themself and their surroundings. In Maslow&#x27;s view, self-actualized people can have many peak experiences throughout a day while others have those experiences less frequently. He believed that psychedelic drugs like LSD and psilocybin can produce peak experiences in the right people under the right circumstances.

===Peak and plateau experiences===
Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as &quot;peak experiences&quot;, which are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the world, more aware of truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and so on. Self-actualizing people are more likely to have peak experiences. In other words, these &quot;peak experiences&quot; or states of flow are the reflections of the realization of one&#x27;s human potential and represent the height of personality development.

In later writings, Maslow moved to a more inclusive model that allowed for, in addition to intense peak experiences, longer-lasting periods of serene being-cognition that he termed &quot;plateau experiences&quot;. He borrowed this term from the Indian scientist and yoga practitioner, U. A. Asrani, with whom he corresponded. Maslow stated that the shift from the peak to the plateau experience is related to the natural aging process, in which an individual has a shift in life values about what is actually important in one&#x27;s life and what is not important. In spite of the personal significance with the plateau experience, Maslow was not able to conduct a comprehensive study of this phenomenon due to health problems that developed toward the end of his life.

===B-values===
In studying accounts of peak experiences, Maslow identified a manner of thought he called &quot;being-cognition&quot; (or &quot;B-cognition&quot;), which is holistic and accepting, as opposed to the evaluative &quot;deficiency-cognition&quot; (or &quot;D-cognition&quot;), and values he called &quot;Being-values&quot;. He listed the B-values as:
* Truth: honesty; reality; simplicity; richness; oughtness; beauty; pure, clean and unadulterated; completeness; essentiality
* Goodness: rightness; desirability; oughtness; justice; benevolence; honesty
* Beauty: rightness; form; aliveness; simplicity; richness; wholeness; perfection; completion; uniqueness; honesty
* Wholeness: unity; integration; tendency to one-ness; interconnectedness; simplicity; organization; structure; dichotomy-transcendence; order
* Aliveness: process; non-deadness; spontaneity; self-regulation; full-functioning
* Uniqueness: idiosyncrasy; individuality; non-comparability; novelty
* Perfection: necessity; just-right-ness; just-so-ness; inevitability; suitability; justice; completeness; &quot;oughtness&quot;
* Completion: ending; finality; justice; &quot;it&#x27;s finished&quot;; fulfillment; &quot;finis&quot; and &quot;telos&quot;; destiny; fate
* Justice: fairness; orderliness; lawfulness; &quot;oughtness&quot;
* Simplicity: honesty; essentiality; abstract, essential, skeletal structure
* Richness: differentiation, complexity; intricacy
* Effortlessness: ease; lack of strain, striving or difficulty; grace; perfect, beautiful functioning
* Playfulness: fun; joy; amusement; gaiety; humor; exuberance; effortlessness
* Self-sufficiency: autonomy; independence; not-needing-other-than-itself-in-order-to-be-itself; self-determining; environment-transcendence; separateness; living by its own laws

===Hierarchy of needs===

Maslow described human needs as ordered in a prepotent hierarchy—a pressing need would need to be mostly satisfied before someone would give their attention to the next highest need. None of his published works included a visual representation of the hierarchy. The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow&#x27;s needs theory and may give the impression that the hierarchy of needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid—with many needs being present in a person simultaneously.

The hierarchy of human needs model suggests that human needs will only be fulfilled one level at a time.

According to Maslow&#x27;s theory, when a human being ascends the levels of the hierarchy having fulfilled the needs in the hierarchy, one may eventually achieve self-actualization. Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs.

Human needs as identified by Maslow:

* At the bottom of the hierarchy are the &quot;basic needs or physiological needs&quot; of a human being: food, water, sleep, sex, homeostasis, and excretion. 
* The next level is &quot;safety needs: security, order, and stability&quot;. These two steps are important to the physical survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.
* The third level of need is &quot;love and belonging&quot;, which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.
* The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the &quot;esteem&quot; level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.
* Then there is the &quot;cognitive&quot; level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.
* After that is the &quot;aesthetic&quot; level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.
* At the top of the pyramid, &quot;need for self-actualization&quot; occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential. Once a person has reached the self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.

The first four levels are known as &quot;deficit needs&quot; or &quot;D-needs&quot;. This means that if there are not enough of one of those four needs, there will be a need to get it. Getting them brings a feeling of contentment. These needs alone are not motivating.

Maslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied. For example, freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, and freedom to seek new information are a few of the prerequisites. Any blockages of these freedoms could prevent the satisfaction of the basic needs.

Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy is used in higher education for advising students and for student retention as well as a key concept in student development. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy has been subject to internet memes over the past few years, specifically looking at the modern integration of technology in people&#x27;s lives and humorously suggesting that Wi-Fi was among the most basic of human needs.

===Self-actualization===

Maslow defined &quot;self-actualization&quot; as achieving the fullest use of one&#x27;s talents and interests—the need &quot;to become everything that one is capable of becoming&quot;. As implied by its name, self-actualization is highly individualistic and reflects Maslow&#x27;s premise that the self is &quot;sovereign and inviolable&quot; and entitled to &quot;his or her own tastes, opinions, values, etc.&quot; Indeed, some have characterized self-actualization as &quot;healthy narcissism&quot;.

===Qualities of self-actualizing people===
Maslow realized that the self-actualizing individuals he studied had similar personality traits. Maslow selected individuals based on his subjective view of them as self-actualized people. Some of the people he studied included Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Eleanor Roosevelt. In his daily journal (1961–63) Maslow wrote: &quot;Eupsychia club, heroes that I write for, my judges, the ones I want to please: Jefferson, Spinoza, Socrates, Aristotle, James, Bergson, Norman Thomas, Upton Sinclair (both heroes of my youth).&quot; All were &quot;reality centered&quot;, able to differentiate what was fraudulent from what was genuine. They were also &quot;problem centered&quot;, meaning that they treated life&#x27;s difficulties as problems that demanded solutions. These individuals also were comfortable being alone and had healthy personal relationships. They had only a few close friends and family rather than a large number of shallow relationships.

Self-actualizing people tend to focus on problems outside themselves; have a clear sense of what is true and what is false; are spontaneous and creative; and are not bound too strictly by social conventions.

Maslow noticed that self-actualized individuals had a better insight of reality, deeply accepted themselves, others and the world, and also had faced many problems and were known to be impulsive people. These self-actualized individuals were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual development on &quot;potentialities and inner resources&quot;.

According to Maslow, self-actualizing people share the following qualities:
* Truth: honest, reality, beauty, pure, clean and unadulterated completeness
* Goodness: rightness, desirability, uprightness, benevolence, honesty
* Beauty: rightness, form, aliveness, simplicity, richness, wholeness, perfection, completion,
* Wholeness: unity, integration, tendency to oneness, interconnectedness, simplicity, organization, structure, order, not dissociated, synergy
* Dichotomy-transcendence: acceptance, resolution, integration, polarities, opposites, contradictions
* Aliveness: process, not-deadness, spontaneity, self-regulation, full-functioning
* Uniqueness: idiosyncrasy, individuality, non comparability, novelty
* Perfection: nothing superfluous, nothing lacking, everything in its right place, just-rightness, suitability, justice
* Necessity: inevitability: it must be just that way, not changed in any slightest way
* Completion: ending, justice, fulfillment
* Justice: fairness, suitability, disinterestedness, non partiality,
* Order: lawfulness, rightness, perfectly arranged
* Simplicity: abstract, essential skeletal, bluntness
* Richness: differentiation, complexity, intricacy, totality
* Effortlessness: ease; lack of strain, striving, or difficulty
* Playfulness: fun, joy, amusement
* Self-sufficiency: autonomy, independence, self-determining.

Maslow based his theory partially on his own assumptions about human potential and partially on his case studies of historical figures whom he believed to be self-actualized, including Albert Einstein and Henry David Thoreau. Consequently, Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together, these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he establishes meaningful connections to an external reality—an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships—his awareness remains internal and limited.

===Metamotivation===
Maslow used the term metamotivation to describe self-actualized people who are driven by innate forces beyond their basic needs, so that they may explore and reach their full human potential. Maslow&#x27;s theory of motivation gave insight on individuals having the ability to be motivated by a calling, mission or life purpose. It is noted that metamotivation may also be connected to what Maslow called B-(being) creativity, which is a creativity that comes from being motivated by a higher stage of growth. Another type of creativity that was described by Maslow is known as D-(deficiency) creativity, which suggests that creativity results from an individual&#x27;s need to fill a gap that is left by an unsatisfied primary need or the need for assurance and acceptance.

===Methodology===
Maslow based his study on the writings of other psychologists, Albert Einstein, and people he knew who [he felt] clearly met the standard of self-actualization.

Maslow used Einstein&#x27;s writings and accomplishments to exemplify the characteristics of the self-actualized person. Ruth Benedict and Max Wertheimer work was also very influential to Maslow&#x27;s models of self-actualization. In this case, from a quantitative-sciences perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach, which has caused much criticism. First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher. Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces the validity of any data obtained. Therefore, Maslow&#x27;s operational definition of Self-actualization must not be uncritically accepted as quantitative fact.

===Transpersonal psychology===
During the 1960s Maslow founded with Stanislav Grof, Viktor Frankl, James Fadiman, Anthony Sutich, Miles Vich and Michael Murphy, the school of transpersonal psychology. Maslow had concluded that humanistic psychology was incapable of explaining all aspects of human experience. He identified various mystical, ecstatic, or spiritual states known as &quot;peak experiences&quot; as experiences beyond self-actualization. Maslow called these experiences &quot;a fourth force in psychology&quot;, which he named transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology was concerned with the &quot;empirical, scientific study of, and responsible implementation of the finding relevant to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and spiritual states&quot; (Olson &amp; Hergenhahn, 2011).

In 1962 Maslow published a collection of papers on this theme, which developed into his 1968 book &quot;Toward a Psychology of Being&quot;. In this book Maslow stresses the importance of transpersonal psychology to human beings, writing: &quot;without the transpersonal, we get sick, violent, and nihilistic, or else hopeless and apathetic&quot; (Olson &amp; Hergenhahn, 2011). Human beings, he came to believe, need something bigger than themselves that they are connected to in a naturalistic sense, but not in a religious sense: Maslow himself was an atheist and found it difficult to accept religious experience as valid unless placed in a positivistic framework. In fact, Maslow&#x27;s position on God and religion was quite complex. While he rejected organized religion and its beliefs, he wrote extensively on the human being&#x27;s need for the sacred and spoke of God in more philosophical terms, as beauty, truth and goodness, or as a force or a principle.

Awareness of transpersonal psychology became widespread within psychology, and the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot; was founded in 1969, a year after Abraham Maslow became the president of the American Psychological Association. In the United States, transpersonal psychology encouraged recognition for non-western psychologies, philosophies, and religions, and promoted understanding of &quot;higher states of consciousness&quot;, for instance through intense meditation. Transpersonal psychology has been applied in many areas, including transpersonal business studies.

===Positive psychology===
Maslow called his work positive psychology. Since 1968 his work has influenced the development of positive psychotherapy, a transcultural, humanistic based psychodynamic psychotherapy method used in mental health and psychosomatic treatment founded by Nossrat Peseschkian. Since 1999 Maslow&#x27;s work enjoyed a revival of interest and influence among leaders of the positive psychology movement such as Martin Seligman. This movement focuses only on a higher human nature.
Positive psychology spends its research looking at the positive side of things and how they go right rather than the pessimistic side.

=== Psychology of science ===
In 1966, Maslow published a pioneering work in the psychology of science, &quot;The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance&quot;, the first book ever actually titled &#x27;psychology of science&#x27;. In this book Maslow proposed a model of &#x27;characterologically relative&#x27; science, which he characterized as an ardent opposition to the &quot;historically, philosophically, sociologically and psychologically naıve&quot; positivistic reluctance to see science &quot;relative to time, place, and local culture&quot;.

Maslow acknowledged that the book was greatly inspired by Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962), and it offers a psychological reading of Kuhn&#x27;s famous distinction between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; science in the context of his own distinction between &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; science, put forward as part of a larger program for the psychology of science, outlined already in his 1954 &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Motivation and Personality&quot;. Not only that Maslow offered a psychological reading of Kuhn&#x27;s categories of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; science as an aftermath of Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;Structure&quot;, but he also offered a strikingly similar dichotomous structure of science 16 years before the first edition of &quot;Structure&quot;, in his nowadays little known 1946 paper &quot;Means-Centering Versus Problem-Centering in Science&quot; published in the journal &quot;Philosophy of Science&quot;.

===Maslow&#x27;s hammer===
Abraham Maslow is also known for Maslow&#x27;s hammer, popularly phrased as &quot;&quot; from his book &quot;The Psychology of Science&quot;, published in 1966.

=== Maslow and Eugenics ===
Although articulating his beliefs in a more positive manner than many of his contemporaries, Abraham Maslow was a eugenicist for his entire career. Abraham Maslow began his career as a protege of Edward Thorndike, a leading eugenicist. Under the influence of his mentor and financial backer Thorndike, Maslow expressed the belief that IQ tests were an accurate measure of one&#x27;s genetic superiority or inferiority and that intelligence was a genetic, rather than acquired, trait. Maslow expressed particular disdain for the nation of India, believing that the entire nation should be euthanized. Maslow also expressed critical views of Jonas Salk, believing mass vaccination to be interfering with natural selection by allowing &quot;cripples&quot; and &quot;genetically inferior&quot; people to live longer lives and reproduce. Maslow&#x27;s private journals in the late 1960s indicate that he took immense pleasure in seeing drug addicts die from overdoses, believing their deaths to be doing a public service to genetically superior individuals such as himself. He also criticized advances in agriculture for developing the ability to grow more food, believing that famine and starvation were beneficial to society and that those who died of hunger were doing a great service to superior humans.

Like Thorndike, Maslow expressed his belief that eugenics could be a religion of the future. To this end, he blended his earlier work with Thorndike with influences from Aldous Huxley and Alan Watts in order to found what he referred to as his own religion based upon &quot;peak experiences&quot; and the use of psychedelic drugs. Maslow referred to his religion as Eupsychianism. He also expressed a belief in Transhumanism and that psychedelic drugs could help elite humans evolve, not just intellectually or spiritually, but into a new biological species, again showing his lifelong belief that acquired traits could be passed on genetically.

Maslow&#x27;s definition of &quot;human&quot; is key to understanding the contradiction between his more traditional psychological theories and his ardent support for eugenics. According to Maslow, not all people are humans. Drug addicts, mentally ill persons, people with low intelligence and those deemed &quot;surplus&quot; were not, according to Maslow, humans but rather &quot;less-than-humans&quot; or &quot;cripple humans&quot; whose material and intellectual needs were an impediment to the advancement of superior &quot;aggridant humans&quot;. Throughout his life, Maslow also expressed a fondness for Nietzche and his theory of the Übermensch, and Maslow often quoted and paraphrased Nietzche in relation to his theories of &quot;aggridant humans&quot; and &quot;less-than-humans&quot;.

==Criticism==
Maslow&#x27;s ideas have been criticized for their lack of scientific rigor. He was criticized as too soft scientifically by American empiricists. In 2006, author and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers and practicing psychiatrist Sally Satel asserted that, due to lack of empirical support, Maslow&#x27;s ideas have fallen out of fashion and are &quot;no longer taken seriously in the world of academic psychology&quot;. Positive psychology spends much of its research looking for how things go right rather than the more pessimistic view point, how things go wrong.

The hierarchy of needs has furthermore been accused of having a cultural bias—mainly reflecting Western values and ideologies. From the perspective of many cultural psychologists, this concept is considered relative to each culture and society and cannot be universally applied. However, according to the University of Illinois researchers Ed Diener and Louis Tay, who put Maslow&#x27;s ideas to the test with data collected from 60,865 participants in 123 countries around the world over the period of five years (2005-2010), Maslow was essentially right in that there are universal human needs regardless of cultural differences, although the authors claim to have found certain departures from the order of their fulfillment Maslow described. In particular, while they found—clearly in accordance with Maslow—that people tend to achieve basic and safety needs before other needs, as well as that other &quot;higher needs&quot; tend to be fulfilled in a certain order, the order in which they are fulfilled apparently does not strongly influence their subjective well-being (SWB). As put by the authors of the study, humans thus

Maslow, however, would probably not be surprised by these findings, since he clearly and repeatedly emphasized that the need hierarchy is not a rigid fixed order as it is often presented:

Maslow also regarded that the relationship between different human needs and behavior, being in fact often motivated simultaneously by multiple needs, is not a one-to-one correspondence, i.e., that &quot;these needs must be understood not to be exclusive or single determiners of certain kinds of behavior&quot;.

Maslow&#x27;s concept of self-actualizing people was united with Piaget&#x27;s developmental theory to the process of initiation in 1993. Maslow&#x27;s theory of self-actualization has been met with significant resistance. The theory itself is crucial to the humanistic branch of psychology and yet it is widely misunderstood. The concept behind self-actualization is widely misunderstood and subject to frequent scrutiny.

Maslow was criticized for noting too many exceptions to his theory. As he acknowledged these exceptions, he did not do much to account for them. Shortly prior to his death, one problem he tried to resolve was that there are people who have satisfied their deficiency needs but still do not become self-actualized. He never resolved this inconsistency within his theory.

===Bias===
Social psychologist David Myers has pointed out Maslow&#x27;s selection bias, rooted in the choice to study individuals who lived out his own values. If he had studied other historical heroes, such as Napoleon, Alexander the Great, and John D. Rockefeller, his descriptions of self-actualization might have been significantly different.

==Legacy==
Later in life, Maslow was concerned with questions such as, &quot;Why don&#x27;t more people self-actualize if their basic needs are met?
How can we humanistically understand the problem of evil?&quot;

In the spring of 1961, Maslow and Tony Sutich founded the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;, with Miles Vich as editor until 1971. The journal printed its first issue in early 1961 and continues to publish academic papers.

Maslow attended the Association for Humanistic Psychology&#x27;s founding meeting in 1963 where he declined nomination as its president, arguing that the new organization should develop an intellectual movement without a leader which resulted in useful strategy during the field&#x27;s early years.

In 1967, Maslow was named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.
