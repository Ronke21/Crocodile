<text>The Elaine massacre occurred on September 30October 2, 1919, at Hoop Spur in the vicinity of Elaine in rural Phillips County, Arkansas, where African Americans were organizing against peonage and abuses in tenant farming. As many as several hundred African Americans and five white men were killed. Estimates of deaths made in the immediate aftermath of the Elaine Massacre by eyewitnesses range from 50 to &quot;more than a hundred&quot;. Walter Francis White, an NAACP attorney who visited Elaine shortly after the incident, stated &quot;... twenty-five Negroes killed, although some place the Negro fatalities as high as one hundred&quot;. More recent estimates in the 21st century of the number of black people killed during this violence are higher than estimates provided by the eyewitnesses, and have ranged into the hundreds. The white mobs were aided by federal troops (requested by Arkansas governor Charles Hillman Brough) and local terrorist organizations. Gov. Brough led a contingent of 583 US soldiers from Camp Pike, with a 12-gun machine-gun battalion.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Arkansas&quot;, &quot;the Elaine Massacre was by far the deadliest racial confrontation in Arkansas history and possibly the bloodiest racial conflict in the history of the United States&quot;.

After the massacre, state officials concocted an elaborate cover-up, claiming that blacks were planning an insurrection. National newspapers repeated the falsehood that blacks in Arkansas were staging an insurrection. A &quot;New York Times&quot; headline read, &quot;Planned Massacre of Whites Today&quot;, and the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; (the leading newspaper in Arkansas) wrote that Elaine was &quot;a zone of negro insurrection&quot;. Subsequent to this reporting, more than 100 African Americans were indicted, with 12 being sentenced to death by electrocution. After a years-long legal battle by the NAACP, the 12 men were acquitted.

Because of the widespread racial violence during the Red Summer of 1919, the Equal Justice Initiative of Montgomery, Alabama, classified the black deaths at Elaine as lynchings in its 2015 report on the lynching of African Americans in the South.

==Background==

Located in the Arkansas Delta, Phillips County had historically been developed for cotton plantations, and its land was worked by enslaved African-Americans before the Civil War. In the early 20th century the county&#x27;s population was still predominantly black because most freedmen and their descendants had stayed on the land as illiterate farm workers and sharecroppers.

African Americans outnumbered whites in the area around Elaine by a ten-to-one ratio, and by three-to-one in the county overall. White landowners controlled the economy, selling cotton on their own schedule, running high-priced plantation stores where farmers had to buy seed and supplies, and settling accounts with sharecroppers in lump sums, without listing items.

The all-white legislature had disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in the 1890s by creating barriers to voter registration. It excluded them from the political system via the more complicated Election Law of 1891 and a poll tax amendment passed in 1892. The white-dominated legislature enacted Jim Crow laws that established racial segregation and institutionalized efforts to impose white supremacy. The decades around the turn of the century were the period of the highest rate of lynchings across the South.

White landowners often underpaid sharecroppers for their crops and paid when they saw fit. Between the prices of goods purchased from the plantation store and the crop underpayments, many were kept in debt to their landlords.

At the time of settlement, landowners generally never gave an itemized statement to the black sharecroppers of accounts owed, nor details of the money received for cotton and seed. The farmers were disadvantaged as many were illiterate. It was an unwritten law of the cotton country that the sharecroppers could not quit and leave a plantation until their debts were paid. The period of the year around accounts settlement was frequently the time of most lynchings of black people throughout the South, especially if times were poor economically. As an example, many black sharecroppers in Phillips County, whose cotton was sold in October 1918, did not get a settlement before July of the following year. They often amassed considerable debt at the plantation store before that time, as they had to buy supplies, including seed, to start the next season.

Black farmers began to organize in 1919 to try to negotiate better conditions, including fair accounting and timely payment of monies due them by white landowners. Robert L. Hill, a black farmer from Winchester, Arkansas, had founded the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America (PFHUA). He worked with farmers throughout Phillips County. Its purpose was &quot;to obtain better payments for their cotton crops from the white plantation owners who dominated the area during the Jim Crow era. Black sharecroppers were often exploited in their efforts to collect payment for their cotton crops.&quot;

Whites tried to disrupt such organizing and threatened farmers. The PFHUA retained a white law firm based in Little Rock to represent the black farmers in getting fair settlements for their labors during the 1919 cotton harvest. The firm was headed by Ulysses S. Bratton, a native of Searcy County and former assistant federal district attorney.

The postwar summer of 1919, also known as Red Summer, had already been marked by deadly massacres targeting African-Americans in more than three dozen cities across the country, (including Chicago, Knoxville, Washington, D.C., and Omaha, Nebraska) being targeted by white mobs. Competition for jobs and housing in crowded markets following World War I as veterans returned to the work force, stirring racial tensions. Having served their country in the Great War, many African-American veterans were no longer willing to tolerate racial discrimination and were now prepared to use violence in self defense against white mobs and terrorism. In 1919, African-Americans vigorously fought back when their communities came under attack. Labor unrest and strikes took place in several cities as workers tried to organize. Industries often hired blacks as strikebreakers, increasing or creating resentment against them by white workers.

==Events==
The Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America had organized chapters in the Elaine area in 1918–19. On September 29, representatives met with about 100 black farmers at a church near Elaine to discuss how to obtain fairer settlements from landowners. Whites had resisted union organizing by the farmers and often spied on or disrupted such meetings. Approximately 100 African-American farmers, led by Robert L. Hill, the founder of the union, met at a church in Hoop Spur, near Elaine in Phillips County. Union advocates brought armed guards to protect the meeting. When two deputized white men and a black trustee arrived at the church, shots were exchanged. Railroad Policeman W.D. Adkins, employed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad, was killed and the other white man wounded; it was never determined who shot first.

According to &quot;Revolution in the Land: Southern Agriculture in the 20th Century&quot; (2002), in a section called &quot;The Changing Face of Sharecropping and Tenancy&quot;:
The parish sheriff called for a posse to capture suspects in the killing. The county sheriff organized the posse and whites gathered to put down what was rumored as a &quot;black insurrection&quot;. Additional armed white men entered the county from outside to support the hunt and a mob of 500 to 1,000 armed men formed. They attacked black people on sight across the county. Local whites requested help from Arkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough, citing a &quot;Negro uprising&quot;. Sensational newspaper headlines published by the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; and others reported that an &quot;insurrection&quot; was occurring, and that black people had planned to murder white leaders.

Governor Brough contacted the War Department and requested Federal troops. After considerable delay, nearly 600 U.S. troops arrived, finding the area in chaos. White men roamed the area randomly attacking and killing black people. Fighting in the area lasted for three days before the troops ended the violence. The federal troops disarmed both parties and arrested 285 black residents, putting them in stockades for investigation, and according to them, protection, until they were vouched for by their employers.

Although official records of the time count eleven black men and five white men killed, there are estimates from 100 to 237 African Americans killed, and more wounded. At least two and possibly more victims were killed by Federal troops. The exact number of black people killed is unknown because of the wide rural area in which they were attacked.

==Press coverage==
A dispatch from Helena, Arkansas, to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, datelined October 1, said: &quot;Returning members of the posse brought numerous stories and rumors, through all of which ran the belief that the rioting was due to propaganda distributed among the negroes by white men.&quot;

The next day&#x27;s report added:
Additional evidence has been obtained of the activities of propagandists among the negroes, and it is thought that a plot existed for a general uprising against the whites.&quot; A white man had been arrested and was &quot;alleged to have been preaching social equality among the negroes&quot;. Part of the headline was: &quot;Trouble Traced to Socialist Agitators.&quot;

A few days later a Western Newspaper Union dispatch was captioned, &quot;Captive Negro Insurrectionists&quot;.

Arkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough appointed a Committee of Seven to investigate. The group was composed of prominent local white businessmen. Without talking to any of the black farmers, they concluded that the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America was a socialist enterprise and &quot;established for the purpose of banding negroes together for the killing of white people&quot;. This version of events has persisted in many histories of the riot.

==NAACP involvement==
The NAACP promptly released a statement from a contact in Arkansas providing another account of the origins of the violence, noting efforts by Ulysses Simpson Bratton to assist African Americans in peonage:
The whole trouble, as I understand it, started because a Mr. Bratton, a white lawyer from Little Rock, Ark., was employed by sixty or seventy colored families to go to Elaine to represent them in a dispute with the white planters relative to the sale price of cotton.

It referred to a report in &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; of Memphis, Tennessee, on October 3 that quoted Bratton&#x27;s father:

The NAACP sent its Field Secretary, Walter F. White, from New York City to Elaine in October 1919 to investigate events. White was of mixed, majority-European ancestry; blond and blue-eyed, he could pass for white. He was granted credentials from the &quot;Chicago Daily News.&quot; He gained an interview with Governor Charles Hillman Brough, who gave him a letter of recommendation for other meetings with whites, as well as an autographed photograph.

According to his own account, White had been in Phillips County for a brief time when he learned there were rumors floating about him. He quickly took the first train back to Little Rock. The conductor told the young man that he was leaving &quot;just when the fun is going to start&quot;, because they had found out that there was a &quot;damned yellow nigger passing for white and the boys are going to get him.&quot; When White asked what the boys would do to the man, the conductor told White that &quot;when they get through with him he won&#x27;t pass for white no more!&quot; Biographer Kenneth Robert Janken writes of this description: &quot;It is likely that White exaggerated the dramatic manner of his escape, much in the way he did his childhood experiences in the Atlanta riot...surviving documents reveal several inconsistencies between what White wrote at the time and what he later recalled having happened.&quot;

White had time to talk with both black and white residents in Elaine. He reported that local people said that up to 100 blacks had been killed. White published his findings in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Defender,&quot; and &quot;The Nation,&quot; as well as the NAACP&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Crisis.&quot; He &quot;characterized the violence as an extreme response by white landowners to black unionization&quot;.

Governor Brough asked the United States Post Office Department to prohibit the mailing of the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; and &quot;Crisis&quot; to Arkansas, while local officials attempted to enjoin distribution of the &quot;Defender.&quot; Years later, White said in his memoir that people in Elaine told him that up to 200 blacks had been killed.

==Trials==
In October and November 1919, an all-white Arkansas state grand jury returned indictments against 122 blacks. Since most blacks had been disenfranchised by Arkansas&#x27; 1891 Election Law and 1892 poll tax amendment, which created barriers to voter registration, blacks as non-voters were excluded from juries. All-white juries rendered verdicts on the defendants in trials following the Elaine race riot. The only men prosecuted for these events were 122 African Americans, with 73 charged with murder.

Those blacks willing to testify against others and to work without shares for terms as determined by their landlords, were set free. Those who refused to comply with those conditions, or were labeled as ringleaders or were judged unreliable, were indicted. According to the affidavits later supplied by the defendants, many of the prisoners had been beaten, whipped or tortured by electric shocks to extract testimony or confessions. They were threatened with death if they recanted their testimony. A total of 73 suspects were charged with murder; other charges included conspiracy and insurrection.

The trials were held in 1920 in the county courthouse in Elaine, Phillips County. Mobs of armed whites milled around the courthouse. Some of the white audience in the courtroom also carried arms. The lawyers for the defense did not subpoena witnesses for the defense and did not allow their clients to testify.

Twelve of the defendants (who became known as the &quot;Arkansas Twelve&quot; or &quot;Elaine Twelve&quot;) were convicted, most of them as &quot;accomplices&quot;, and sentenced to death in the electric chair by all-white juries for the murder of a white deputy at the Adkins church. Others were convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to prison. The lawyer of one defendant did not interview any witnesses, ask for a change of venue, nor challenge any jurors. The trials of these twelve lasted less than an hour in many cases; the juries took fewer than ten minutes to deliberate before pronouncing each man guilty and sentencing them to death. The &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; applauded the trials as the triumph of the &quot;rule of law&quot;, because none of the defendants were lynched. These men became known as the &quot;Elaine Twelve&quot;.

After those convictions, 36 of the remaining defendants chose to plead guilty to second-degree murder rather than face trial. Sixty-seven other defendants were convicted of various charges and sentenced to terms up to 21 years. When the cases were remanded to the state court, the six &quot;Moore&quot; defendants settled with the lower court on lesser charges and were sentenced to time already served.

==Appeals==
During appeals, the death penalty cases were separated. The NAACP took on the task of organizing the defendants&#x27; appeals. The NAACP assisted the defendants in the appeals process, raising money to hire a defense team, which it helped direct. For a time, the NAACP tried to conceal its role in the appeals, given the hostile reception to its reports on the rioting and the trials. Once it undertook to organize the defense, it went to work vigorously, raising more than $50,000 and hiring Scipio Africanus Jones, a highly respected African-American attorney from Arkansas, and Colonel George W. Murphy, a 79-year-old Confederate veteran and former Attorney General for the State of Arkansas. Moorfield Storey, descended from Boston abolitionists and founding president of the NAACP since 1909, became part of the team when the Moore cases went to the Supreme Court. He had been president of the American Bar Association in 1895.

The defendants&#x27; lawyers obtained reversal of the verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the twelve death penalty cases, known as the &quot;Ware&quot; defendants. The grounds were that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants were guilty of murder in the first or second degree; those cases (known as Ware et al.) were sent back to the lower court for retrial. The lower court retried the defendants beginning on May 3, 1920. On the third day of the trials, Murphy collapsed in the courtroom.

Scipio Jones had to carry most of the responsibility for the remaining trials. The all-white juries quickly convicted the six defendants of second-degree murder and sentenced them to 12 years each in prison. Jones appealed these convictions, which were overturned by the State Supreme Court. It found that the exclusion of blacks from the juries resulted in a lack of due process for the defendants, based on violations of the Fourteenth Amendment (especially Due Process Clause) and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, due to exclusion of blacks from the juries. The lower courts failed to retry the men within the two years required by Arkansas law, and the defense finally gained their release in 1923.

==Moore et al.==
The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld the death sentences of Moore and the other five defendants. It rejected the challenge to the all-white juries as untimely, and found that the mob atmosphere and use of coerced testimony did not deny the defendants the due process of law. Those defendants unsuccessfully petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; from the Arkansas Supreme Court&#x27;s decision.

The defendants next petitioned for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus,&quot; alleging that the proceedings that took place in the Arkansas state court, while ostensibly complying with trial requirements, in fact complied only in form. They argued that the accused had not been adequately defended and were convicted under the pressure of the mob, with blatant disregard for their constitutional rights.

The defendants originally intended to file their petition in Federal district court, but the only sitting judge was assigned to other judicial duties in Minnesota at the time and would not return to Arkansas until after the defendants&#x27; scheduled execution date. Judge John Ellis Martineau of the Pulaski County chancery court issued the writ. Although the writ was later overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court, his action postponed the execution date long enough to permit the defendants to seek &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relief in Federal court.

U.S. District Judge Jacob Trieber issued another writ. The State of Arkansas defended the convictions from a narrowly legalistic position, based on the US Supreme Court&#x27;s earlier decision in &quot;Frank v. Mangum&quot; (1915). It did not dispute the defendants&#x27; evidence of torture used to obtain confessions nor of mob intimidation at the trial, but the state argued that, even if true, these elements did not amount to a denial of due process. The United States district court agreed, denying the writ, but it found there was probable cause for an appeal and allowed the defendants to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot; , the United States Supreme Court vacated these six convictions on the grounds that the mob-dominated atmosphere of the trial and the use of testimony coerced by torture denied the defendants&#x27; due process as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Prominent Little Rock attorney George Rose wrote a letter to outgoing Governor Thomas McRae requesting that he find a way to release the remaining defendants if they agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder. Rose&#x27;s letter was an attempt to prevent Governor-Elect Thomas Jefferson Terral, a known member of the Ku Klux Klan, from getting involved in the matter.

Just hours before Governor McRae left office in 1925, he contacted Scipio Jones to inform him that indefinite furloughs had been issued for the remaining defendants. He freed these six men in 1925 in the closing days of his administration. Jones used the furloughs to obtain release of the prisoners under cover of darkness. He arranged for these men to be quickly escorted out of state to prevent them from being lynched. The NAACP helped them leave the state safely.

==Aftermath==
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision marked the beginning of an era in which the Supreme Court gave closer scrutiny to criminal justice cases and reviewed state actions against the Due Process Clause and the Bill of Rights. A decade later, the Supreme Court reviewed the case of the Scottsboro boys. The victory for the Elaine defendants gave the NAACP greater credibility as the champion of African Americans&#x27; rights. Walter F. White&#x27;s risk-taking investigation and report contributed to his advancing in the organization. He later was selected as executive secretary of the NAACP, essentially the chief operating officer, and served in this position for decades, leading the organization in additional legal challenges and civil rights activism.

&quot;It is documented that five whites, including a soldier died at Elaine, but estimates of African American deaths, made by individuals writing about the Elaine affair between 1919 and 1925, range from 20 to 856; if accurate, these numbers would make it by far the most deadly conflict in the history of the United States. The &quot;Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture&quot; notes that estimates of African-American deaths range into the &quot;hundreds&quot;.

Since the late 20th century, researchers have begun to investigate the Elaine race riot more thoroughly. For decades, the riot and numerous murders were too painful to be discussed openly in the region. The wide-scale violence ended union organizing among black farmers. White oppression continued, threatening every black family. Historian Robert Whitaker says, &quot;As with many racial histories of this kind,&quot; it was &quot;one of those shameful events best not talked about&quot;.

Another reason for silence was that the second Ku Klux Klan began to be active in Arkansas in 1921, concentrating in black-majority areas. It used intimidation and attacks to keep blacks suppressed. Author Richard Wright grew up in Phillips County and discusses it in his autobiography &quot;Black Boy.&quot; He wrote that when he questioned his mother about why their people did not fight back, &quot;the fear that was in her made her slap me into silence&quot;.

A 1961 article, &quot;Underlying Causes of the Elaine Riot&quot;, claimed that blacks were planning an insurrection, based on interviews with whites who had been alive at the time, and that they were fairly treated by planters of the area. It repeated rumors of 1919 that certain planters were targeted for murder. This view has been generally discounted by historians publishing since the late 20th century.

In early 2000, a conference on the Elaine riot was held at the Delta Cultural Center in the county seat of Helena, Arkansas. It was an effort to review the facts but did not result in &quot;closure&quot; for the people of Phillips County. The Associated Press spoke with author Grif Stockley, who has published a book on the riot. He said that in 2000, there were still two versions of the riot, which he characterized as the &quot;white&quot; version, related to their idea that the union planned an attack on whites, and a &quot;black&quot; version, related to farmers&#x27; efforts to gain fair settlements of their crops. Stockley said there &quot;was plenty of evidence to say whites attacked blacks indiscriminately&quot;. Local electoral offices were divided between the races in West Helena and the county.

==Memorial==
In September 2019, 100 years after the event, an Elaine Massacre Memorial was unveiled. A Memorial Willow Tree planted at the memorial in April 2019 had been cut down in August, and a &quot;memorial tag&quot; stolen. Local residents wanted the vandalism investigated as a hate crime, but the case was still unsolved as of 2021.

<text>Michael Dorn (born December 9, 1952) is an American actor best known for his role as the Klingon character Worf in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, appearing in all seven seasons of the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), and later reprising the role in seasons four through seven of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1995–1999) and season three of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023). Dorn has appeared more times as a regular cast member than any other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor in the franchise&#x27;s history, spanning five films and 284 television episodes.

Outside of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Dorn has appeared in the television series &quot;CHiPs&quot; (1979–1982), and has had voice roles as Coldstone and Taurus in the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994–1997), Kalibak in the DC Animated Universe, I.M. Weasel in &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; (1997–2000), Lord Darkar in the Nickelodeon dub of &quot;Winx Club&quot; (2011), and Captain Mozar in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2015–2016). 

Outside of shows and movies, he has had voice roles in several Star Trek-related games, as well as more obscure voice roles such as a major companion Marcus and the main antagonist Frank Horrigan of the action RPG game &quot;Fallout 2&quot; (1998) and a Krogan character in &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; (2010), among many other similar roles.

==Early life==
Dorn was born in Luling, Texas, the son of Allie Lee (née Nauls) and Fentress Dorn Jr. He grew up in Pasadena, California, where he studied radio and television production at Pasadena City College. Following his graduation, he pursued a career in music as a performer with several different rock-music bands, traveling to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles.

==Career==
===Early work===
Dorn first appeared on-screen in &quot;Rocky&quot;, in an uncredited role as Apollo Creed&#x27;s bodyguard. Two years later, he appeared as a guest star on a 1978 episode of the television show &quot;W.E.B.&quot;. Impressed by his work, the show&#x27;s producer introduced Dorn to an agent, through whom he met acting teacher Charles E. Conrad. Dorn studied with Conrad for six months, until he landed a regular role on the crime drama series &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

Dorn&#x27;s most notable role to date is that of the Klingon Starfleet officer Lieutenant (later Lt. Commander) Worf in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Dorn was the last of the main actors to be cast in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and prepared for his audition by isolating himself from the other actors and remaining taciturn through his interview, mimicking the personality of the character. His character proved so popular amongst fans that Dorn was added to the cast of spin-off series &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; in an effort to boost ratings.

Dorn (as Worf) has the record for the most on-screen appearances of any &quot;Star Trek&quot; character. As Worf, he appeared in 175 episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (missing only the episodes &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, &quot;Haven&quot;, and &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;), 102 episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, four &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies, and seven episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, bringing his total to 288 appearances as the character. He also appeared as Worf&#x27;s ancestor, Colonel Worf, in the 1991 film &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; and directed the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episodes &quot;In the Cards&quot;, &quot;Inquisition&quot;, and &quot;When It Rains...&quot;, and the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Two Days and Two Nights&quot;.

He was one of six actors to reprise his role, in voiceover, for the &quot;Star Trek: Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot; virtual reality game. In 2014, he participated in the fan-produced &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Fairest of Them All&quot;, giving his voice to the computer of the Mirror Universe &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

In 2012, Dorn announced a desire to return to his Klingon role in a television series tentatively titled &quot;Star Trek: Captain Worf&quot;. He said: I had come up with the idea because I love [Worf] and I think he&#x27;s a character that hasn&#x27;t been fully developed and hasn&#x27;t been fully realized. Once I started thinking about it, it became obvious to me that I wanted to at least put it out there, which I have, and the response has been pretty amazing. We&#x27;ve been contacted by different individuals–I can&#x27;t say who and all that–about wanting to come on board and be part of this.

In April 2022, it was announced that he would reprise his role as Worf in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, which aired in 2023.

===Other work===
Dorn has appeared in a number of TV shows, films, and video games. He has been the spokesman for Neutrogena T-Gel Shampoo, and has appeared in a Dodge Dart car commercial. He voiced Marcus and Frank Horrigan in &quot;Fallout 2&quot;. He appeared in a 2012 tongue-in-cheek television commercial for Chrysler as &quot;Future Guy&quot;, a time traveler sent from the future to assist development of the 2013 Dodge Dart. He also plays the role of General Thain in the &quot;Castlevania: Hymn of Blood&quot; web series.

Following his &quot;Star Trek&quot; career, he had supporting roles in a number of independent feature films, including &quot;Shadow Hours&quot; (2000), &quot;Lessons for an Assassin&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; trilogy, in which he appeared in a minor role as the Sandman. Dorn reprised his role as Worf for cameo appearances on &quot;Webster&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, the latter with several of his fellow &quot;Next Generation&quot; castmates. He had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Castle&quot;, playing the therapist of NYPD police detective Kate Beckett&#x27;s.

In March 2023, Dorn was announced as the writer for a comic starring Steel (John Henry Irons), whom he voiced in &quot;&quot;. &quot;Steelworks&quot; #1 was published on June 6, 2023, with art by Sami Basri.

Dorn provides the voice of the character Battle Beast in the animated series &quot;Invincible&quot;.

==Personal life==
A member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, Dorn is an accomplished pilot. He has flown with the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds. He has owned several jet aircraft, including a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, which he jokingly refers to as his &quot;starship&quot;, a North American F-86 Sabre, and currently owns a North American Sabreliner. Dorn also serves on several aviation organizations, one of which is the Air Force Aviation Heritage Foundation, where he is on the advisory board. Dorn was interviewed for the &quot;Private Jets&quot; episode of &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; on The History Channel.

Dorn stated in a 2010 interview that he had been diagnosed with an &quot;early early&quot; stage of prostate cancer, which led him to become a vegan.

<text>Yuen Ren Chao (Chinese: 趙元任; 3 November 189225 February 1982), also known as Zhao Yuanren, was a Chinese-American linguist, educator, scholar, poet, and composer, who contributed to the modern study of Chinese phonology and grammar. Chao was born and raised in China, then attended university in the United States, where he earned degrees from Cornell University and Harvard University. A naturally gifted polyglot and linguist, his &quot;Mandarin Primer&quot; was one of the most widely used Mandarin Chinese textbooks in the 20th century. He invented the Gwoyeu Romatzyh romanization scheme, which, unlike pinyin and other romanization systems, transcribes Mandarin Chinese pronunciation without diacritics or numbers to indicate tones.

== Early life and education ==
Chao was born in Tianjin in 1892, though his family&#x27;s ancestral home was in Changzhou, Jiangsu. In 1910, Chao went to the United States with a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study mathematics and physics at Cornell University, where he was a classmate and lifelong friend of Hu Shih (1891–1962), the leader of the New Culture Movement. He then became interested in philosophy; in 1918, he earned a PhD in philosophy from Harvard University with a dissertation entitled &quot;Continuity: Study in Methodology&quot;.

Already in college his interests had turned to music and languages. He spoke German and French fluently and some Japanese, and he had a reading knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin. He was Bertrand Russell&#x27;s interpreter during Russell&#x27;s visit to China in 1920. In &quot;My Linguistic Autobiography&quot;, Chao wrote of his ability to pick up a Chinese dialect quickly, without much effort. Chao possessed a natural gift for hearing fine distinctions in pronunciation that was said to be &quot;legendary for its acuity&quot;, enabling him to record the sounds of various dialects with a high degree of accuracy.

==Career development==
In 1920, Chao returned to China and taught mathematics at Tsinghua University. The next year, he returned to the United States to teach at Harvard University. In 1925, he again returned to China, teaching at Tsinghua, and in 1926 began a survey of the Wu dialects. While at Tsinghua, Chao was considered one of the &#x27;Four Great Teachers / Masters&#x27; of China, alongside Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, and Chen Yinke.

He began to conduct linguistic fieldwork throughout China for the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica from 1928 onwards. During this period of time, he collaborated with Luo Changpei, another leading Chinese linguist of his generation, to translate Bernhard Karlgren&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (published in 1940) into Chinese.

In 1938, he left for the US and resided there afterwards. In 1945, he served as president of the Linguistic Society of America, and in 1966 a special issue of the society&#x27;s journal &quot;Language&quot; was dedicated to him. In 1954, he became an American citizen. In the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research and he also participated in the Macy conferences. From 1947 to 1960, he taught at the University of California at Berkeley, where in 1952, he became Agassiz Professor of Oriental Languages.

==Work==

While in the United States in 1921, Chao recorded Standard Chinese pronunciation gramophone records, which were then distributed nationally, as proposed by Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation.

He is the author of one of the most important standard modern works on Chinese grammar, &quot;A Grammar of Spoken Chinese&quot;, which was translated into Chinese separately by Lü Shuxiang in 1979 and by Ting Pang-hsin in 1980. It was an expansion of the grammar chapters in his earlier textbooks, &quot;Mandarin Primer&quot; and &quot;Cantonese Primer&quot;. He was co-author of the &quot;Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese&quot;, which was the first dictionary to characterize Chinese characters as &quot;bound&quot; or &quot;free&quot;—usable only in polysyllables or permissible as a monosyllabic word, respectively.

Chao invented the General Chinese phonetic system to represent the pronunciations of all major varieties of Chinese simultaneously. It is not specifically a romanization system, but two alternate systems: one uses Chinese characters phonetically as a syllabary, and the other is an alphabetic romanization system with similar sound values and tone spellings to Gwoyeu Romatzyh. On 26 September 1928, Gwoyeu Romatzyh was officially adopted by the Republic of China—led at the time by the Kuomintang (KMT). The corresponding entry in Chao&#x27;s diary, written in GR, reads (&quot;G.R. was officially announced on September 26. Hooray!!!&quot;) Chao also contributed Chao tone letters to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

His translation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, where he tried his best to preserve all the word plays of the original, is considered &quot;a classical piece of verbal art.&quot;

Chao also wrote &quot;Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den&quot;, a Chinese text consisting of 92 characters, each with the syllable in modern Standard Chinese, only varying by tone. When written out using Chinese characters the text can be understood, but it is incomprehensible when read out aloud in Standard Chinese, and therefore also incomprehensible on paper when written in romanized form. This example is often used as an argument against the romanization of Chinese and Classical Chinese, despite how Chao was actually a proponent for romanizing written vernacular Chinese.

His composition &quot;How could I help thinking of her&quot; was a pop hit during the 1930s in China; its lyrics were penned by fellow linguist Liu Bannong.

Chao translated &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; into Chinese by inventing characters to imitate what Rob Gifford describes as the &quot;slithy toves that gyred and gimbled in the wabe of Carroll&#x27;s original&quot;.

== Family and later life ==
In 1920, he married the physician Yang Buwei. The ceremony was simple, as opposed to traditional weddings, attended only by Hu Shih and one other friend. Hu&#x27;s account of it in the newspapers made the couple a model of modern marriage for China&#x27;s New Culture generation.

Yang Buwei published &quot;How to Cook and Eat in Chinese&quot; in 1946, and the book went through many editions. Their daughter Rulan wrote the English text and Mr. Chao developmentally edited the text based on Mrs. Chao&#x27;s developed recipes, as well as her experiences gathering recipes in various areas of China. Among the three of them, they coined the terms &quot;pot sticker&quot; and &quot;stir fry&quot; for the book, terms which are now widely accepted, and the recipes popularized various related techniques. His presentation of his wife&#x27;s recipe for &quot;Stirred Eggs&quot; is a classic of American comic writing.

Both Chao and his wife Yang were known for their good senses of humor, he particularly for his love of subtle jokes and language puns: they published a family history entitled, &quot;Life with Chaos: the autobiography of a Chinese family&quot;. Their first daughter Rulan Chao Pian (1922–2013) was Professor of East Asian Studies and Music at Harvard. Their second daughter Nova Chao (1923–2020) was a Harvard-trained chemist, professor at Central South University and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Their third daughter Lensey was born in 1929; she is a children&#x27;s book author and mathematician.

Late in his life, Chao was invited by Deng Xiaoping to return to China in 1981. Previously at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, he and his wife returned to China in 1973 for the first time since the 1940s. After his wife died in March 1981 he visited China again between May and June. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<doc id="303326" wikidata="Q200814" url="?curid=303326" title="Suitcase">
<text>A suitcase is a form of baggage. It is a rectangular container with a handle and is typically used to carry one&#x27;s clothes and other belongings while traveling. The first suitcases appeared in the late 19th century due to the increased popularity of mass tourism at the time and were meant to hold dress suits. They were originally made using heavier materials such as leather or steel, but, beginning in the 1930s, were constructed with more lightweight materials like plastic and cardboard.

Before the 1970s, the idea of rolling luggage was shunned by the travel industry, who viewed it as much less masculine than traditional luggage. American entrepreneur Bernard Sadow pitched his version of the wheeled suitcase, for which he was granted a patent in 1972, to various department stores before it was picked up and sold at Macy&#x27;s stores starting in 1970. It took several years to become the predominant form of suitcase, and Sadow&#x27;s version was soon superseded by the Rollaboard, a type of wheeled suitcase that was upright rather than flat like Sadow&#x27;s model and invented in 1987 by American pilot Robert Plath. The addition of wheels to the suitcase has since been called one of the most significant innovations in travel.

Smart suitcases with enhanced capabilities such as GPS tracking and device charging were popularized in the 2010s, though explosions of their lithium ion batteries in cargo holds caused them to be banned from being checked by many major airlines in the late 2010s.

== History ==
===12th century to late 19th century: Luggage before the suitcase===

During the Crusades, the first luggage—wheeled containers used to transport weaponry—was developed in 1153. The word &quot;&quot;, derived from the verb &quot;&quot;, was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1596 to mean &quot;denoting inconveniently heavy baggage&quot;. Luggage prior to the invention of the suitcase was mostly wood and leather trunks with an iron base, which were waterproofed using canvas or tree sap. Servants were often made to carry these trunks for their owners, such as for European elites during the Grand Tour in the 18th century, since travel was mostly exclusive to the wealthy.

===Late 19th century to mid-20th century: Beginnings===
As mass tourism increased in popularity and travel became accessible to non-elites due to railways and cruise ships, the need for more practical luggage increased. In the late 19th century, the first luggage known as &quot;suit cases&quot; or &quot;suit-cases&quot;, which were meant to carry dress suits without wrinkling them, came about. The earliest models of suitcases were invented by British businessmen, who used them to carry goods and clothing. They were modeled after trunks and made by stretching leather, rubbery cloth, or wicker over a flat, rigid frame made of wood or steel with leather or brass caps on the corners and a handle on their long side, contrasting them with trunks, which had handles on their two shorter sides. They typically had a compartment for shirts and a hat box on the inside. Suitcases first started being manufactured alongside trunks by luggage companies such as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, which would later be renamed Samsonite. They were initially considered a lesser alternative to trunks, as evidenced by North American travel catalogs from the turn of the 20th century advertising trunks much more prominently than suitcases.

Lightweight suitcases were mostly marketed at first toward women. In 1938, a weight limit of 40 pounds for checked bags was established in the United States, which led to the heavier leather model of suitcase being supplanted by lighter plastic and cardboard suitcases throughout the 1930s and 1940s. German luggage company Rimowa built the first aluminum suitcase, which it started selling in 1950 with a grooved design inspired by the Junkers Ju 52 airplane. In Europe, porters were responsible for carrying train passengers&#x27; suitcases until around the middle of the 20th century, when they became less abundant.

===1970s to 2000s: Wheeled suitcases===
Early patents for a wheeled trunk and a wheeled suitcase came in 1887 and 1945, respectively, and a design for a &quot;portable porter&quot;, a wheeled device that could be attached to a suitcase, was advertised in British newspapers in the 1940s. However, none of these designs originally caught on. During her second world tour in 1928, American artist Anita Willets-Burnham made the first recorded wheeled suitcase, which had two baby carriage wheels attached to it and a telescoping wooden handle. Until the 1970s, wheeled luggage was seen by the travel industry as a niche invention solely for women.

In 1970, Bernard D. Sadow, the then-vice president of Massachusetts luggage company U.S. Luggage, was carrying two heavy 27-inch suitcases at an airport in Puerto Rico on his way back from a family vacation in Aruba when he noticed a worker rolling a heavy machine on a wheeled platform. After remarking to his wife that people needed wheels for their luggage, Sadow returned to his factory in Fall River, Massachusetts and attached casters to a suitcase with a strap that allowed him to tow it behind him. Sadow spent months attempting to sell his wheeled suitcase to various New York City department stores, but was met with resistance. Most department stores, according to him, refused to sell his invention due to a &quot;macho feeling&quot; that men would consider rolling their luggage &quot;wimpy&quot; and that women who travelled would have their husbands around to carry their suitcases for them.

After being turned away by Jack Schwartz, a Macy&#x27;s buyer, a vice president from the company, Jerry Levy, called Sadow back in for a meeting. He instructed Schwartz to buy Sadow&#x27;s suitcases, and Macy&#x27;s began selling them in stores in October 1970, advertising them as &quot;The Luggage That Glides&quot; and showcasing them with mannequins; they rose in popularity soon thereafter. That same year, Sadow applied for a patent for &quot;rolling luggage&quot;, which had rollers on its bottom wall and a flexible transport strap attached near the top, and was granted it as patent number 3,653,474 in 1972. It stated that, due to airplanes replacing trains as the primary mode of long-distance travel, &quot;Baggage-handling has become perhaps the biggest single difficulty encountered by an air passenger.&quot; Macy&#x27;s competitors came together to break the patent about two years after it was granted to Sadow, allowing them to sell their own wheeled luggage, although Sadow&#x27;s model was often wobbly and difficult to maneuver. Sadow later died in 2011.

====1980s to 2000s: Rollaboards and other innovations====
The Rollaboard or roll-aboard (also referred to as a rollerboard, an eggcorn of the term) is an upright wheeled suitcase with two wheels on the bottom and a telescoping handle invented by Robert Plath, a Northwest Airlines 747 pilot, in 1987. He had the idea while at a hotel during a layover in Scandinavia as he watched passengers struggle to get their bags, which were attached by bungee cords, out of luggage trolleys. He designed the prototype for the Rollaboard in his garage, screwing a hard-shell bag to a luggage trolley, and started to get ideas from other crew members while carrying it around. It marked a shift from Sadow&#x27;s model, which rolled flat on four wheels. At first, Plath only sold the Rollaboard to fellow pilots and flight attendants, manufacturing and selling 100 of the bags to various crew members in December 1989.

In 1991, Plath left Northwest Airlines to start the luggage company Travelpro in Deerfield Beach, Florida, which initially only sold the product to other flight crews. He hired a team of sales representatives in 1992, and in the mid-1990s, Travelpro started selling Rollaboards commercially in retail stores, making it a competitor of Samsonite, then the largest American luggage manufacturer. Plath sold Travelpro in 1999. The Rollaboard was widely imitated by other luggage companies starting around 1993, causing Sadow&#x27;s design to quickly be almost entirely replaced. Designer Don Ku from Flushing, Queens invented and patented a suitcase with an extendable handle in 1993. In 2004, Samsonite started selling the first &quot;spinner-style&quot; suitcase, which had four wheels and could be moved and spun in any direction. Durability testing for suitcases also became more rigorous around this time as they became lighter.

===Since 2010s: Smart suitcases===
Smart suitcases—suitcases with built-in technological features—became popular in the 2010s. These features include internal tracking, geolocation, fingerprint scanners, device charging, scales, GPS capabilities, touch switches, remote locking, and computer vision, among others. Companies such as Away, Arlo Skye, and Ovis mostly sell smart luggage. Most smart suitcases are powered by a lithium-ion battery.

After a number of Li-ion batteries in smart suitcases exploded and caught fire in the cargo holds of planes, the International Air Transport Association classified the batteries as &quot;dangerous goods&quot;. It published recommendations to its approximately 275 members, including United, JetBlue, and Virgin Atlantic, to put restrictions on smart suitcases with nonremovable batteries in May 2017. United States–based airlines including American, Alaska, Delta, and others banned smart luggage with nonremovable batteries from being checked in late 2017 and early 2018, while the United Kingdom&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority recommended a similar ban in 2018. Smart suitcase companies such as Bluesmart shut down as a result of these bans.

The first suitcases made of polycarbonate were made in 2000 by the German luggage maker Rimowa. Samsonite made a push toward using materials such as vulcanized fibre and polypropylene in suitcases.

==As a symbol and in popular culture==
Suitcases became culturally significant around the 1920s, when they made appearances in books like the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series and in films like the silent film &quot;The Woman in the Suitcase&quot;. Daniel A. Gross of &quot;Smithsonian&quot; described suitcases at the time as &quot;a literary symbol for both mobility and mystery—perhaps filled with gold, photographs, or simply a stranger&#x27;s possessions&quot;. In the mid-20th century, Mexican laborers who worked in the United States would often return home with suitcases as a status symbol to prove that they had become &quot;cosmopolitan men&quot;. From the 1900s to the 1960s, hotels placed luggage labels on customers&#x27; suitcases to advertise themselves, with illustrations inspired by travel posters of the time.

The supposedly feminine nature of the wheeled suitcase was mocked in the 1984 film &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, where Kathleen Turner&#x27;s character, Joan Wilder, brings her wheeled suitcase to the jungle, which bothers Michael Douglas&#x27;s character, Jack T. Colton, who is attempting to fend off evil. Soo Youn of &quot;National Geographic&quot; included the suitcase, specifically the addition of wheels to it, on his list of inventions that changed travel forever, while &quot;SmarterTravel&quot;″s Caroline Costello listed the wheeled suitcase as one of the best travel inventions of all time. Of the wheeled suitcase, Ian Jack wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;outside the cheap flight, no other modern development has made travel easier&quot;.

<text>Collaboration (from Latin &quot;com-&quot; &quot;with&quot; + &quot;laborare&quot; &quot;to labor&quot;, &quot;to work&quot;) is the process of two or more people, entities or organizations working together to complete a task or achieve a goal. Collaboration is similar to cooperation. The form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group. Teams that work collaboratively often access greater resources, recognition and rewards when facing competition for finite resources.

Structured methods of collaboration encourage introspection of behavior and communication. Such methods aim to increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem-solving. Collaboration is present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a common use of the term. In its applied sense, &quot;[a] collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome&quot;. Trade between nations is a form of collaboration between two societies which produce and exchange different portfolios of goods.

==Historical examples ==
===Trade===
Trade began in prehistoric times and continues because it benefits all of its participants. Prehistoric peoples bartered goods and services with each other without a modern currency. Peter Watson dates the history of long-distance commerce from 150,000 years ago. Trade exists because different communities have a comparative advantage in the production of tradable goods.

===Roman Empire===
The Roman Empire used collaboration through ruling with visible control, which lasted from 31BC until (in the east) 1453CE, across around fifty countries. The growth of trade was supported by the stable administration of the Romans. Evidence shows that the Roman Empire and Julius Caesar were influenced by the Greek writer Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;The Education of Cyrus&quot; on leadership. This says that &#x27;social bonds, not command and control, were to be the primary mechanisms of governance&#x27;. Classics professor Emma Dench notes that the Roman Empire extended its citizenship &quot;to enemies, former enemies of state, to people who&#x27;d helped them. The Romans were incredibly good at co-opting people and ideas.&quot; The Romans created a stable empire that benefitted both ruled and allied countries. Gold and silver were currencies created by the Romans which supported a market economy, leading to trading within the Roman Empire and taxes.

=== Hutterite, Austria (founded 16th century) ===
In Hutterite communities housing units are built and assigned to individual families, but belong to the colony with little personal property. Meals are taken by the entire colony in a common long room.

=== Oneida Community, Oneida, New York (1848) ===
The Oneida Community practiced &quot;Communalism&quot; (in the sense of communal property and possessions) and &quot;Mutual Criticism&quot;, where every member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting. The goal was to remove bad character traits.

=== Kibbutzim (1890) ===
A kibbutz is an Israeli collective community. The movement combines socialism and Zionism seeking a form of practical Labor Zionism. Choosing communal life, and inspired by their own ideology, kibbutz members developed a communal mode of living. The kibbutzim lasted for several generations as utopian communities, although most became capitalist enterprises and regular towns.

=== Manhattan Project ===
The Manhattan Project was a collaborative project during World War II among the Allies that developed the first atomic bomb . It was a collaborative effort by the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

The value of this project as an influence on organized collaboration is attributed to Vannevar Bush. In early 1940, Bush lobbied for the creation of the National Defense Research Committee. Frustrated by previous bureaucratic failures in implementing technology in World War I, Bush sought to organize the scientific power of the United States for greater success.

The project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945: a test detonation of a plutonium implosion bomb on July 16 (the Trinity test) near Alamogordo, New Mexico; an enriched uranium bomb code-named &quot;Little Boy&quot; on August 6 over Hiroshima, Japan; and a second plutonium bomb, code-named &quot;Fat Man&quot; on August 9 over Nagasaki, Japan.

==Contemporary examples==
===Community organization: intentional communities===
The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision. They share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include cohousing, residential land trusts, ecovillages, communes, kibbutzim, ashrams, and housing cooperatives. Typically, new members of an intentional community are selected by the community&#x27;s existing membership, rather than by real estate agents or land owners (if the land is not owned by the community).

===Indigenous collaboration===
Collaboration in indigenous communities, particularly in the Americas, often involves the entire community working toward a common goal in a horizontal structure with flexible leadership. Children in some indigenous American communities collaborate with the adults. Children can be contributors in the process of meeting objectives by taking on tasks that suit their skills.

Indigenous learning techniques comprise Learning by Observing and Pitching In. For example, a study of Mayan fathers and children with traditional Indigenous ways of learning worked together in collaboration more frequently when building a 3D model puzzle than Mayan fathers with western schooling. Also, Chillihuani people of the Andes value work and create work parties in which members of each household in the community participate. Children from indigenous-heritage communities want to help around the house voluntarily.

In the Mazahua Indigenous community of Mexico, school children show initiative and autonomy by contributing in their classroom, completing activities as a whole, assisting and correcting their teacher during lectures when a mistake is made. Fifth and sixth graders in the community work with the teacher installing a classroom window; the installation becomes a class project in which the students participate in the process alongside the teacher. They all work together without needing leadership, and their movements are all in sync and flowing. It is not a process of instruction, but rather a hands-on experience in which students work together as a synchronous group with the teacher, switching roles and sharing tasks. In these communities, collaboration is emphasized, and learners are trusted to take initiative. While one works, the other watches intently and all are allowed to attempt tasks with the more experienced stepping in to complete more complex parts, while others pay close attention.

===Game theory===
Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics, computer science, and economics that looks at situations where multiple players make decisions in an attempt to maximize their returns. The first documented discussion of game theory is in a letter written by James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave in 1713. Antoine Augustin Cournot&#x27;s &quot;Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth&quot; in 1838 provided the first general theory. In 1928 it became a recognized field when John von Neumann published a series of papers. Von Neumann&#x27;s work in game theory culminated in the 1944 book The &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot; by von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern.

===Military-industrial complex===
The term military-industrial complex refers to a close and symbiotic relationship among a nation&#x27;s armed forces, its private industry, and associated political interests. In such a system, the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support, while the defence industry depends on government for revenue.

=== Skunk Works ===
Skunk Works is a term used in engineering and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with advanced or secret projects. One such group was created at Lockheed in 1943. The team developed highly innovative aircraft in short time frames, notably beating its first deadline by 37 days.

===Project management===


As a discipline, project management developed from different fields including construction, engineering and defense. In the United States, the forefather of project management is Henry Gantt, who is known for his use of the &quot;bar&quot; chart as a project management tool, for being an associate of Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s theories of scientific management, and for his study of the management of Navy ship building. His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the work breakdown structure (WBS) and resource allocation.

The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era. Again, in the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad hoc basis using mostly Gantt charts, and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project scheduling models were developed: (1) the &quot;Program Evaluation and Review Technique&quot; or PERT, developed as part of the United States Navy&#x27;s (in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation) Polaris missile submarine program; and (2) the &quot;Critical Path Method&quot; (CPM) developed in a joint venture by both DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plant maintenance projects. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.

In 1969, the Project Management Institute (PMI) was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry. The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the software industry to the construction industry. In 1981, the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become &quot;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot; (PMBOK), standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession. The International Project Management Association (IPMA), founded in Europe in 1967, has undergone a similar development and instituted the IPMA Project Baseline. Both organizations are now participating in the development of a global project management standard.

However, the exorbitant cost overruns and missed deadlines of large-scale infrastructure, military R&amp;D/procurement and utility projects in the US demonstrates that these advances have not been able to overcome the challenges of such projects.

===Academia===
==== Black Mountain College ====
Founded in 1933 by John Andrew Rice, Theodore Dreier and other former faculty of Rollins College, Black Mountain College was experimental by nature and committed to an interdisciplinary approach, attracting a faculty which included leading visual artists, poets and designers.

Operating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget, Black Mountain fostered an informal and collaborative spirit. Innovations, relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain had a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene, high culture and eventually pop culture. Buckminster Fuller met student Kenneth Snelson at Black Mountain, and the result was the first geodesic dome (improvised out of slats in the school&#x27;s back yard); Merce Cunningham formed his dance company; and John Cage staged his first happening.

Black Mountain College was a consciously directed liberal arts school that grew out of the progressive education movement. In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it, and as such an important incubator for the American avant garde.

==== Learning ====

Dr. Wolff-Michael Roth and Stuart Lee of the University of Victoria assert that until the early 1990s the individual was the &#x27;unit of instruction&#x27; and the focus of research. The two observed that researchers and practitioners switched to the idea that &quot;knowing&quot; is better thought of as a cultural practice. Roth and Lee also claim that this led to changes in learning and teaching design in which students were encouraged to share their ways of doing mathematics, history, science, with each other. In other words, that children take part in the construction of consensual domains, and &#x27;participate in the negotiation and institutionalization of ... meaning&#x27;. In effect, they are participating in learning communities.

This analysis does not consider the appearance of Learning communities in the United States in the early 1980s. For example, The Evergreen State College, which is widely considered a pioneer in this area, established an intercollegiate learning community in 1984. In 1985, the college established The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, which focuses on collaborative education approaches, including learning communities as one of its centerpieces. The school later became notorious for less-successful collaborations.

==Occupational examples==
===Arts===

==== Figurative arts ====
The romanticized notion of a lone, genius artist has existed since the time of Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;, published in 1568. Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods, which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes. Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries, but the myth of the lone artist was not widely questioned until the 1960s and 1970s.

Collaborative art groups include:
*Dada (1913)
*Fluxus (1957)
*Situationist International (1957)
*Experiments in Art and Technology (1967)
*Mujeres Muralistas (1973)
*Colab (1977)
*Guerrilla Girls (1985)
*SITO (1993)

====Ballet====
Ballet is a collaborative art form. It entails music, dancers, costumes, a venue, lighting, etc. Hypothetically, one person could control all of this, but most often every work of ballet is the by-product of collaboration. From the earliest formal works of ballet, to the great 19th century masterpieces of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Marius Petipa, to the 20th century masterworks of George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky, to today&#x27;s ballet companies, feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers, composers and costume designers are essential. Within dance as an art form, there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer. The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer, which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret.

==== Music ====
Musical collaboration occurs when musicians in different places or groups work on the piece. Typically, multiple parties are involved (singers, songwriters, lyricists, composers, and producers) and come together to create one work. For example, one specific collaboration from recent times (2015) was the song &quot;FourFiveSeconds&quot;. This single represents a type of collaboration because it was developed by pop idol Rihanna, Paul McCartney (former bassist, composer and vocalist for The Beatles), and rapper/composer Kanye West. Websites and software facilitate musical collaboration over the Internet, resulting in the emergence of online bands.

Several awards exist specifically for collaboration in music:

*Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals—awarded since 1988
*Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals—awarded since 1995
*Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration—awarded since 2002

Collaboration has been a constant feature of electroacoustic music, due to the technology&#x27;s complexity. Embedding technological tools into the process stimulated the emergence of new agents with new expertise: the musical assistant, the technician, the computer music designer, the music mediator (a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years) – aiding with writing, creating new instruments, recording and/or performance. The musical assistant explains developments in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages. Finally, he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts. Examples of collaboration include Pierre Boulez and Andrew Gerzso, Alvise Vidolin and Luigi Nono, Jonathan Harvey and Gilbert Nouno.

===== Classical music =====
Although relatively rare compared with collaboration in popular music, there have been some notable examples of music written collaboratively by classical composers. Perhaps the best-known examples are:

* &quot;Hexameron&quot;, a set of variations for solo piano on a theme from Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;I puritani&quot;. It was written and first performed in 1837. The contributors were Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, Carl Czerny, Sigismond Thalberg, Johann Peter Pixis, and Henri Herz.
* The &quot;F-A-E Sonata&quot;, a sonata for violin and piano, written in 1853 as a gift for the violinist Joseph Joachim. The composers were Albert Dietrich (first movement), Robert Schumann (second and fourth movements), and Johannes Brahms (third movement).

====Entertainment====
Collaboration in entertainment dates from the origin of theatrical productions, millennia ago. It takes the form of writers, directors, actors, producers and other individuals or groups working on the same production. In the twenty-first century, new technology has enhanced collaboration. A system developed by Will Wright for the TV series title &quot;Bar Karma&quot; on CurrentTV facilitates plot collaboration over the Internet. Screenwriter organizations bring together professional and amateur writers and filmmakers.

=== Business ===
Collaboration in business can be found both within and across organizations, and examples range from formalised partnerships, use of coworking spaces where freelancers can work with others in a collaborative environment and crowd funding, to the complexity of a multinational corporation. Inter-organizational collaboration brings participating parties to invest resources, mutually achieve goals, share information, resources, rewards and responsibilities, as well as make joint decisions and solve problems. Collaboration between public, private and voluntary sectors can be effective in tackling complex policy problems, but may be handled more effectively by boundary-spanning teams and networks than by formal organizational structures. In turn, business and management scholars have paid much attention to the importance of both formal and informal mechanisms to support inter-organizational collaboration. They especially point to the role of contractual and relational mechanisms and the inherent tensions between the two. Global manufacturer Unilever offers to collaborate with innovating start-up businesses, and its &quot;Unilever Foundry&quot; refers to over 400 examples of &quot;strategic collaboration&quot; in this field. Collaborative procurement has been commended as a means of achieving financial savings and operational efficiency in the acquisition of common goods and services in the public sector, and producing mutually beneficial results in the private sector. Collaboration allows for better communication within organizations and along supply chains. It is a way of coordinating different ideas from numerous people to generate a wide variety of knowledge. Collaboration with a few selected firms has been shown to positively impact firm performance and innovation outcomes.

Technology has provided the internet, wireless connectivity and collaboration tools such as blogs and wikis, and has as such created the possibility of &quot;mass collaboration&quot;. People are able to rapidly communicate and share ideas, crossing longstanding geographical and cultural boundaries. Social networks permeate business culture where collaborative uses include file sharing and knowledge transfer. According to author Evan Rosen command-and-control organizational structures inhibit collaboration and replacing such structures allows collaboration to flourish.

Studies have found that collaboration can increase achievement and productivity. However, Bill Huber, former chair of the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management (IACCM, now World Commerce &amp; Contracting), notes that not all companies have what he calls &quot;collaborative DNA&quot;. Huber argues that Andrew Cox, formerly of Birmingham Business School and the founder of the International Institute for Advanced Purchasing and Supply (IIAPS), has highlighted the dangers in thinking that collaborative relationships always produce mutually advantageous &quot;win-win&quot; outcomes for both buyers and sellers in commercial relationships. Cox uses case studies which show where competent buyers have used collaboration successful to secure value for money, and other examples where &quot;incompetent buyers&quot; utilizing &quot;what initially appear to be win-win outcomes&quot; subsequently lose out to &quot;more commercially competent suppliers&quot;. In relation to one of his examples, Cox concludes that

A four-year study of interorganizational collaboration in a mental health setting found that successful collaboration can be rapidly derailed through external policy steering, particularly where it undermines relations built on trust. Collaboration is also threatened by opportunism from the business partners and the possibility of coordination failures that can derail the efforts of even well-intentioned parties.

Margarita Leib, a professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, wrote about how individuals working together sometimes promote dishonest behavior that prioritizes profit, like what Volkswagen did to fake vehicle emission levels. This often begins with one person lying, which incentivizes or pressures everyone else to escalate in response.

===Education===

In recent years, co-teaching has become more common, found in US classrooms across all grade levels and content areas. Once regarded as connecting special education and general education teachers, it is now more generally defined as &quot;…two professionals delivering substantive instruction to a diverse group of students in a single physical space.&quot;

As American classrooms have become increasingly diverse, so have the challenges for educators. Due to the diverse needs of students with designated special needs, English language learners (ELL), and students of varied academic levels, teachers have developed new approaches that provide additional student support. In practice, students remain in the classroom and receive instruction by both their general teacher and special education teachers.

In the 1996 report &quot;What Matters Most: Teaching for America&#x27;s Future&quot; economic success could be enhanced if students developed the capacity to learn how to &quot;manage teams… and…work together successfully in teams&quot;.

Teachers increasingly use collaborative software to establish virtual learning environments (VLEs). This allows them to share learning materials and feedback with both students and in some cases, parents. Approaches include:

* 21st century skills
* Collaborative partnerships
* Collaborative Partnerships: Business/Industry-Education
* Learning circle

==== Writing ====
Writers, both in fiction and non-fiction, may cooperate on a one-time or long-term basis. It can be as simple as dual-authorship or as complex as commons-based peer production. Tools include Usenet, e-mail lists, blogs and Wikis while &#x27;brick and mortar&#x27; examples include monographs (books) and periodicals such as newspapers, journals and magazines. One approach is for an author to publish early drafts/chapters of a work on the Internet and solicit suggestions from the world at large. This approach helped ensure that the technical aspects of the novel &quot;The Martian&quot; were as accurate as possible.

The science fiction author Frederik Pohl was noted for his longtime collaborations with Cyril Kornbluth and Jack Williamson.

=== Technical communication ===
Collaboration in technical communication (also commonly referred to as technical writing) has become increasingly important in the creation and dissemination of technical documents in multiple technical and occupational fields, including: computer hardware and software, medicine, engineering, robotics, aeronautics, biotechnology, information technology, and finance. Collaboration in technical communication allows for greater flexibility, productivity and innovation for technical writers and the companies they work for, resulting in technical documents that are more comprehensive and accurate than documents produced by individuals. Technical communication collaboration typically occurs on shared document work-spaces (such as Google Docs), through social media sites, videoconferencing, SMS and IM, and on cloud-based authoring platforms.

===Science===
Scientific collaboration rapidly advanced throughout the twentieth century as measured by the increasing numbers of coauthors on published papers. Wagner and Leydesdorff found international collaborations to have doubled from 1990 to 2005. While collaborative authorships within nations has also risen, this has done so at a slower rate and is not cited as frequently. Notable examples of scientific collaboration include CERN, the International Space Station, the ITER nuclear fusion experiment, and the European Union&#x27;s Human Brain Project.

===Medicine===
Collaboration in health care is defined as health care professionals assuming complementary roles and cooperatively working together, sharing responsibility for problem-solving and making decisions to formulate and carry out plans for patient care. Collaboration between physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals increases team members&#x27; awareness of each other&#x27;s type of knowledge and skills, leading to continued improvement in decision making. A collaborative plan is filed with each state board of medicine where the PA works. This plan formally delineates the scope of practice approved by the physician.

==== Collaboration between stakeholders in health and social care ====
Welfare services, including healthcare systems, have become more specialised over time and are provided by an increasing number of departments and organisations. One disadvantage from this development is fragmented supply of health and social services, which hampers integration of services resulting in suboptimal care, higher cost due to overlaps and poor quality of care.

The current system, in which care is fragmented and delivered by several different stakeholders, increases the need of all relevant stakeholders to coordinate and collaborate both within and between organisations in order to deliver services tailored to people&#x27;s needs.

This need of increased collaboration between stakeholders corresponds with the principles of people-centered care.

===Technology===


Collaboration in technology encompasses a broad range of tools that enable groups of people to work together including social networking, instant messaging, team spaces, web sharing, audio conferencing, video, and telephony. Many large companies adopt collaboration platforms to allow employees, customers and partners to intelligently connect and interact.

Enterprise collaboration tools focus on encouraging collective intelligence and staff collaboration at the organization level, or with partners. These include features such as staff networking, expert recommendations, information sharing, expertise location, peer feedback, and real-time collaboration. At the personal level, this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages. Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration is web conferencing, but the term can encompass IP telephony, instant messaging, and rich video interaction with telepresence, as well.

The effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors:
* Communication
* Content management
* Workflow

==== The Internet ====
The Internet&#x27;s low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier. Not only can a group cheaply communicate, but the wide reach of the Internet allows groups to easily form, particularly among dispersed, niche participants. An example of this is the free software movement in software development which produced GNU and Linux from scratch and has taken over development of Mozilla and OpenOffice.org (formerly known as Netscape Communicator and StarOffice).

With the recent development of social media platforms, there has been a constant and quick growth in the use of the Internet for communication and collaboration between people. The 2.0 version of the internet has become a tool for collaborative projects, blogs, online communities, social networks, group games. An example of how social media aids in more effective collaboration is seen via the business environment. Communication and collaboration create new hierarchies and wider networks for employees and partners of organisations. Additionally, it also enables businesses to broaden their marketing strategies by collaborating with influencers of those social media platforms.

==== Commons-based peer production ====
Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated (usually with the aid of the internet) into large, meaningful projects, mostly without hierarchical organization or financial compensation. He compares this to firm production (where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom) and market-based production (when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job).

Examples of products created by means of commons-based peer production include Linux, a computer operating system; Slashdot, a news and announcements website; Kuro5hin, a discussion site for technology and culture; Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia; and Clickworkers, a collaborative scientific work. Another example is Socialtext, a software solution that uses tools such as wikis and weblogs and helps companies to create a collaborative work environment.

==== Massively distributed collaboration ====
The term massively distributed collaboration was coined by Mitchell Kapor, in a presentation at UC Berkeley on 2005-11-09, to describe an emerging activity of wikis and electronic mailing lists and blogs and other content-creating virtual communities online.

==In war==
Wartime collaboration refers to cooperating with the enemy or enemies of one&#x27;s own country. Examples include:
* Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy
* Collaboration with Imperial Japan
* Collaboration with the Islamic State
* Collaboration with Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine

<text>Slip-ons are typically low, lace-less shoes. The style which is most commonly seen, known as a loafer, slippers, or penny loafers in American culture, has a moccasin construction. One of the first designs was introduced in London by Wildsmith Shoes, called the Wildsmith Loafer. They began as casual shoes, but have increased in popularity to the point of being worn in America with business suits. Another design was introduced as Aurlandskoen (the Aurland Shoe) in Norway (early 20th century). 

A less casual, earlier type of slip-on is made with side goring (sometimes called a &quot;dress loafer&quot;). Made in the same shape as lace-up Oxfords, but lacking the laces, these shoes have elasticated inserts on the side which allow the shoe to be easily removed but remain snug when worn. This cut has its greatest popularity in Britain.

==Loafers==

===History===
A bespoke shoe company based in London that was established in 1847 developed the first loafer as a country house shoe for the landed gentry and the royal family. The &quot;Wildsmith Loafer&quot; made by Raymond Lewis Wildsmith of Wildsmith Shoes, was designed for King George VI as a casual house shoe. The shoe has subsequently been marketed and sold by other London shoe firms and dubbed &quot;the Harrow&quot;.
Shoemaker Nils Gregoriusson Tveranger (1874–1953) in Aurland, Norway, introduced his first design around 1908. Tveranger obtained protection for the design. N. Tveranger obtained a diploma at the Bergen exhibition in 1910 for his &quot;Aurland shoe&quot;. The first Aurland shoes were also made with laces and a decorative upper side similar to the brogue shoe. Colors were initially natural until approximately 1960 when they were also painted black. At age 13 Tveranger went to North America where he learned the craft of shoemaking and returned to Norway at age 20. Around 1930, Tveranger introduced a new design called the &quot;Aurland moccasin&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Aurland shoe&quot;. This design resembles the moccasins used by the Iroquois as well as the design of moccasin-like shoes traditionally worn by locals in Aurland. These traditional shoes resembled slippers and were useful outdoors in fine weather. In 1936 the local shoe handcraft in Aurland was described as a &quot;very old industry&quot; and shoes were sold in large numbers to foreign visitors. A 1953 catalog listed about 10 shoe factories in the small village of Aurland. When exported to the USA the Aurland shoes were called &quot;Norwegian Moccasins&quot;. The Norwegians began exporting them to the rest of Europe, where they were taken up by visiting Americans, and championed by the American &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Some photographs included with the &quot;Esquire&quot; feature were of Norwegian farmers in a cattle loafing area. The Spaulding family in New Hampshire started making shoes based on this design in the early 1930s, naming them &quot;loafers&quot;, a general term for slip-on shoes which is still in use in America. In 1934, G.H. Bass (a bootmaker in Wilton, Maine) started making loafers under the name &quot;Weejuns&quot; (sounding like Nor&quot;wegians&quot;). The distinctive addition was a strip of leather across the saddle with a diamond cut-out. Initially only worn in the summer at home, the shoe grew in popularity in America to become a significant part of men&#x27;s casual shoe wardrobe; in Europe, the style has never reached the same degree of ubiquity.

The term &quot;penny loafer&quot; has uncertain beginnings. One explanation is when American prep school students in the 1950s, wishing to make a fashion statement, took to inserting a penny into the diamond-shaped slit on their Weejuns. Either way, the name &quot;penny loafer&quot; came to be applied to this style of slip-on and has since stuck.

In the mid-1950s, further continental influences brought a more elegant image to light, lower-cut slip-ons, which moved from purely casual use to being paired with suits in the 1960s (but still only in America). In 1966, Italian designer Gucci made the further step of adding a metal strap across the front in the shape of a horse&#x27;s snaffle bit. These &quot;Gucci loafers&quot; (now a general term referring to shoes of this style by any manufacturer) also spread over the Atlantic and were worn by 1970s businessmen, becoming almost a Wall Street uniform, reaching widespread use by the 1980s.

At the start of the twenty-first century, a revival of penny loafers, whose popularity had peaked during the mid- to late 1960s and again during the early 1980s to early 1990s, occurred, with the shoe appearing in a more rugged version, closer to the original concept, as either moccasins, or espadrilles, both of these styles being very low or flat without heels. This resurgence was most noticeable at college campuses across America.

Another variation on the basic style is the tassel loafer, which emerged in the 1950s. Again, though casual, their gradual acceptance among the American East Coast prep school culture as equivalent to brogues (wingtips), has led to them being worn there with suits, where they gained an association with business and legal classes.

=== Types of loafer ===
===Use===
In the United States and some European countries, such as Italy, the loafer enjoys general use as a casual and informal shoe worn for work and leisure, though lace-ups are still preferred for more formal situations. The general popularity of brown over black extends to loafers, sometimes using exotic leathers such as suede and cordovan. Since the early 1980s, socks have been optional while wearing loafers.

Though originally men&#x27;s shoes, some styles of loafers, such as casual tassel and penny loafers, are also worn by women. Women&#x27;s loafers tend to have shorter toes and are worn with a variety of outfits from shorts, jeans, slacks, and capris to dresses and skirts.

==Gored shoes==
In an evolution entirely different from the loafer, Chelsea boots were invented by J. Sparkes Hall for Queen Victoria in 1836. The stretchable rubber produces a comfortable shoe combining the convenience of laceless shoes with the profile of lace-ups. Its feminine image was soon lost and was dubbed &quot;Congress gaiter&quot; and &quot;Boston boot&quot; in America. Rare even in Britain, its country of origin, it is still the only style of slip-on worn with a suit in some of the highly conservative working environments in the City of London. With such a background, their use mimics that of Oxfords, so they are worn in brown with broguing as a country shoe, or in plainer, black styles with suits.

== In popular culture ==
Michael Jackson wore penny loafers during his performances, and it became one of his most iconic styles while performing. His moonwalk, toe stand, and other moves were mostly performed in penny loafers.

<doc id="303338" wikidata="Q204864" url="?curid=303338" title="Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein">
<text>Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein (Victoria Louise Sophia Augusta Amelia Helena; 3 May 1870 – 13 March 1948), informally known by her family as &quot;Thora&quot;, was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. From July 1917, she was addressed simply as Princess Helena Victoria.

==Early life==
Princess Helena Victoria (always known to her family as &quot;Thora&quot;) was born at Frogmore House, near Windsor Castle. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, the third son of Christian, Duke of Augustenburg and Countess Louise Sophie Danneskiold-Samsøe. Her mother was Princess Helena, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her parents resided in Britain from marriage.

She was baptised in the private chapel at Windsor Castle on 20 June 1870. Her godparents were Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Louise, Prince Arthur, Prince Leopold, Prince Valdemar of Denmark, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Louise Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Caroline Amelie of Schleswig-Holstein (the latter two represented by the Duchess of Roxburghe). 

She was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her maternal aunt Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg and also at the wedding of her cousins the Duke and Duchess of York (future George V and Queen Mary) in 1893.

She spent most of her childhood at Cumberland Lodge, her father&#x27;s residence as Ranger of Windsor Great Park. Known to her family as &quot;Thora&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Snipe&quot;, in reference to her sharp facial features, formally she used the names &quot;Helena Victoria&quot; from among her string of six given names.

==First World War==
In July 1917, King George V changed the name of the British royal family to the House of Windsor. He also relinquished, on behalf of himself and his numerous cousins who were British subjects, the use of their German titles, styles, and surnames. Princess Helena Victoria and her younger sister, Princess Marie Louise, thereupon ceased to use the territorial designation &quot;of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg&quot;. Instead, they became known simply as &quot;Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria&quot; and &quot;Her Highness Princess Marie Louise&quot;. Although the two had borne German titles, their upbringing and domicile were entirely English.

==Later life==
Princess Helena Victoria never married. She followed her mother&#x27;s example in working for various charitable organizations, most notably YMCA, Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) and Princess Christian&#x27;s Nursing Home at Windsor. During World War I, she founded the YWCA Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Force. As its president, she visited British troops in France and obtained the permission of the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, to arrange entertainments for them. Between the world wars, she and her sister, Princess Marie Louise, were enthusiastic patrons of music at Schomberg House, their London residence. It was reported in one publication in 1924 that &#x27;Princess Helena Victoria has always been, together with her sister Princess Marie Louise, one of the hardest working of all our princesses.&#x27; After a German air raid damaged the house in 1940, the two princesses moved to Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square.

In ill health and a wheelchair user after World War II, Princess Helena Victoria made one of her last major appearances at the 20 November 1947 wedding of her first cousin twice removed Princess Elizabeth, to Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark. 

Princess Helena Victoria died at Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square on 13 March 1948. She died at the age of 77, the same age at which her mother, Princess Helena, had also died. The Princess&#x27;s funeral took place at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor on Wednesday 17 March 1948 at 11:30am. Her coffin was draped in the Union Jack with a wreath of daffodils and spring flowers from her sister Princess Marie Louise and a wreath of yellow roses and mauve tulips from King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Amongst the mourners were her sister Princess Marie Louise, George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Mary was represented by Captain the Lord Claud Hamilton. Other royal mourners included Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke, David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven, Lady Patricia Ramsay and her son Captain Alexander Ramsay. Music included a setting of Psalm 121 &#x27;I will lift up mine eyes&#x27;, and the hymns &#x27;Rock of Ages&#x27; and &#x27;God be in my head&#x27;. Her coffin was later buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, Windsor Great Park. No orders for court mourning were issued but the King and Queen, and members of their Households, observed family mourning for one week. Probate of the Princess&#x27;s estate was granted in London on 20 May 1948 and it was valued at £52,435 (£1.3 million at 2022 conversion rates).

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
* 3 May 1870 – 14 July 1917: &quot;Her Highness&quot; Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein
* 14 July 1917 – 13 March 1948: &quot;Her Highness&quot; Princess Helena Victoria

As a male-line granddaughter of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Princess Helena Victoria would have been styled &quot;Serene Highness&quot; (&quot;Durchlaucht&quot;). In May 1866, Queen Victoria had conferred the higher style of &quot;Highness&quot; upon any children to be born of the marriage of Princess Helena and Prince Christian, although the children were to remain Prince or Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. In June 1917, a notice appeared in the Court Circular that a Royal Warrant was to be prepared by George V dispensing with his cousins&#x27; use of the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg&quot; part of their titles. However no warrant was issued, nor were they formally granted the titles of Princesses of Great Britain and Ireland nor of the United Kingdom.

<text>The Delta Cultural Center in downtown Helena, Arkansas, is a cultural center and museum of the Department of Arkansas Heritage. It is dedicated to preserving and interpreting the culture of the Arkansas Delta. They also partner with other cultural organizations to interpret different cultural elements.

The center consists of three buildings:

*A Visitors Center which houses an interactive exhibition of Delta music including the King Biscuit Blues Festival and the broadcast facilities for King Biscuit Time which is the longest running blues radio program in the nation.
*The Train Depot, a former Union Pacific station, at Natchez and Missouri Street, houses exhibits on the American Civil War in Helena including the 1863 Battle of Helena, Union occupation of the area, slave experiences, and women in Civil War Helena. The Train Depot also has exhibits on the history of the Mississippi River including the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and exhibits on Delta agriculture and Native American history. This c. 1915 Craftsman/Classical Revival building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

*The Moore-Hornor House, at 323 Beech Street, is a red brick Greek Revival/Italianate-style home built in 1859, and is also listed on the National Register. The back yard of the home saw fierce hand-to-hand fighting during the Battle of Helena in the Civil War.

<doc id="303345" wikidata="Q862318" url="?curid=303345" title="Ukkusiksalik National Park">
<text>Ukkusiksalik National Park () is a national park in Nunavut, Canada. It covers of tundra and coastal mudflats south of the Arctic Circle and the hamlet of Naujaat (formerly Repulse Bay), from Hudson Bay&#x27;s Roes Welcome Sound towards the western Barrenlands and the source of Brown River. The park surrounds Wager Bay, a -long inlet on the Hudson Bay. Although the smallest of Nunavut&#x27;s four national parks, it is the sixth largest in Canada. Its name relates to steatite found there: &quot;Ukkusiksalik&quot; means &quot;where there is material for the stone pot&quot; (from &quot;ukkusik&quot;, meaning &quot;pot&quot; or &quot;saucepan&quot; like qulliq).

In addition to a reversing waterfall and over 500 archeological sites, including an old Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) trading post, the region is home to such species as polar bears, grizzly bears, Arctic wolf, barren-ground caribou, seals and peregrine falcons. Vegetation in the park is typical low tundra, with dwarf birch, willow and mountain avens. Scattered patches of boreal forest can be encountered in river valleys.

The park is uninhabited now, but the Inuit lived there from the 11th century to the 1960s. Remains of fox traps, tent rings, and food caches have been discovered in the area. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had an operating trading post in the area from 1925 to 1947.

The park was created on August 23, 2003, becoming Canada&#x27;s 41st national park, and the fourth in Nunavut. It can be reached from the nearest communities of Baker Lake or Naujaat by plane or boat.

==History==
Little is written about Wager Bay&#x27;s early history, as until the 19th century the area was inhabited by Inuit who traditionally passed down their history by word-of-mouth.

There is, however, a remarkable quantity of stone relics, mainly tent rings from Thule people, inuksuit, caches, and shelters which provide evidence that the coast of Wager Bay has been inhabited for thousands of years. About 500 archaeological sites have been identified in recent years as well from Dorset culture (500 BC - 1000 AD), as from Thule culture (1000 - 1800 AD) and the last two centuries.

Barrenland Inuit (or Caribou Inuit) were not a homogeneous tribe, but families of quite diverse groups:

*&quot;Ukkusiksalingmiut&quot; from Back River and Hayes River regions
*&quot;Aivilingmiut&quot; from the Naujaat region
*&quot;Qairnirmiut&quot; from Baker Lake and Chesterfield Inlet regions
*&quot;Netsilik Inuit (Natsilingmiut)&quot; from around Kugaaruk and Taloyoak

===First Europeans===

In 1742, Christopher Middleton on his sailing ship &quot;Furnace&quot; was the first European to enter the fjord, which he could not leave for several weeks because of ice flow.

He named the bay after Sir Charles Wager, First Lord of the British Admiralty, and an inlet where he anchored &quot;Douglas Harbour&quot; after James and Henry Douglas, sponsors of his expedition. The Savage Islands nearby he named after &quot;savage Eskimos&quot; he met there.

Middleton was not successful in his search for the Northwest Passage, and neither was William Moore with his sloop &quot;Discovery&quot; five years later. As the region was too remote and thought to be useless, the bay was not again recorded or visited by Europeans for more than a century. In the 1860s, American explorer Charles Francis Hall&#x27;s two-masted ship &quot;Monticello&quot; reached Roes Welcome Sound in 1864 while searching for John Franklin&#x27;s lost Northwest Passage expedition of 1845 and had to overwinter at the mouth of Wager Bay.

In 1879, another American expedition led by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka searching for John Franklin passed nearby Wager Bay by land. The region eventually became recognized when the fur trade started there at the end of the 19th century.

===Early 20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Canadian government showed an interest in the Wager Bay region and sent geologist Albert Peter Low on &quot;Neptune&quot; in order to establish Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over the Arctic north.

At nearly the same time, in 1900, the American whaler George G. Cleveland, working alone, established a whaling station near the entrance of the bay, that operated for the next four years. Despite his closure of the station, Scottish whalers for some time tried their luck to hunt marine mammals in the Wager area. Large iron harpoon heads and other remnants are still found on the Savage Islands.

In 1910, the Royal North-West Mounted Police (RNWMP, precursor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) set up a police post at Wager Bay coast, near the Savage Islands. A police boat wreck in a small inlet on the southeast shore of Wager Bay is testimony to the brief presence of police there.
In 1915, George Cleveland set up a temporary—and the region&#x27;s first—trading post, near the mouth of Wager Bay. In 1919, Cleveland, now working for the HBC, again set up a trading post in the mouth of Wager Bay. It was transferring building materials for the establishment of the Repulse Bay HBC post. Situated at a favorable location at the northern end of Roes Welcome Sound, this post became important for the company&#x27;s intention to expand their business towards the north.

Alongside these local activities, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, during the first years of the 20th century, made a great effort to get the fur trade under control. They started to build up a large and dense network of posts from the barren lands of northwest Hudson Bay to the northern coast of the continent. According to those plans, a post at the outermost edge of Wager Bay should play a key role. That new post was meant to include the Ukkusiksalingmiut area to the Back River estuary, to the northwest, into the company&#x27;s strategy, thereby, if ever possible, preventing commercial activities of competitors, Revillon Frères, operating from their Baker Lake base. In the late summer of 1925, the two-masted schooner &quot;Fort Chesterfield&quot; entered the channel, and, following the advice of local Inuit, found a well-protected inlet in &quot;Tusjujak&quot; (now &quot;Ford Lake&quot;, named after J. L. Ford, post manager in 1929) to establish their strategic station.

During the first years, things went quite well. Besides offering usual supply goods, the post supported the Inuit in general, and gave, as far as possible, medical assistance. Thus, it became a meeting point that allowed Inuit from distant camps to exchange news as well. In December 1929, twenty-two Inuit families were counted, 107 persons in total, camping in their igloos nearby. Soon later, fur trade stopped booming. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company changed their major post into an outpost in 1933 and entrusted an Inuk, Iqungajuq (Wager-Dick), with its management. He thereby got the chance to start his own business in the fur trade. Wager-Dick and his family lived in the post buildings and ran the outpost until 1946. The company was eventually successful with its strategy towards its competitor and bought Revillon Frères in 1936.

Catholic missionaries, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who passed by in those years set up a small mission on one of Savage Islands, but never had great success and withdrew, when the activities of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ended by mid-1940s and the Inuit had migrated into communities.

Some 30 years later, from 1979 to 1981, Inuit from Rankin Inlet tried to revive their former homeland, but without success. The area is presently unoccupied by people, except for occasional visitors and local Inuit who hunt in the area.

Declared a national park on August 23, 2003, Ukkusiksalik became Canada&#x27;s 41st national park.

==Landscape==
At Hudson Bay&#x27;s northwest corner, some northeast of Chesterfield Inlet, near the Capes Fullerton and Kendall, is the entrance of Roes Welcome Sound, which extends northwards between the Barrenlands of the Kivalliq Region (meaning: border of the land) and Southampton Island to Repulse Bay, where there is a settlement of that name, situated at the Arctic circle. Wager Bay is an inlet of Roes Welcome Sound, pretty much in its geographical center, near Cape Dobbs.

Wager Bay is the core of the national park. Its entrance is a rather narrow bottleneck, it is more than long and approximately wide at its narrowest spot. The tides rise and fall up to and currents are extraordinary and cause large accumulations of ice masses during most of the year, often preventing the passage of watercraft. During early summer the rising flood water washes large quantities of drifting ice and icebergs into the bay. These accumulate during ebb tide, close the bottleneck like a cork and may stay for hours or even days.

In some places, Wager Bay is more than deep. The fjord is up to wide and almost long, extending northwest into Kivalliq-Barrenlands. It reaches latitude 66°, therefore some from the Arctic Circle.

Even at its western end, tides are impressive, between Wager Bay and the wide Ford Lake (Tusjujak in Inuktitut), so-called &quot;Reversing Falls&quot; occur. In Canada, only three of those phenomena are known, Reversing Falls in New Brunswick and Barrier Inlet, Hudson Strait, Nunavut are the others. The strongest ones are in Norway, east of Bodø, Nordland. They are called Saltstraumen and considered world&#x27;s strongest tidal currents.

The soil of the area is characteristic of the Canadian Shield.

==Climate==

The prevailing climate is arctic-maritime; relatively little precipitation, low temperatures, and strong winds. It has North America&#x27;s highest wind chill and largest snowdrifts. Due to this, the National Park is considered to be &quot;high arctic&quot;.

A remarkable feature is that at the south shore of Wager Bay a steep mountain range, gorged by former glaciers, strongly influences the weather. Due to its proximity to Hudson Bay, drops in temperature and strong fog are normal during summertime, as blizzards are during early autumn. The bay is not completely free of ice before the end of July, although temperatures may range from cool to very warm between May and September.

==Fauna==

According to actual zoological research, there are sixteen species of mammals in the park. At Wager Bay&#x27;s south shore is a large polar bear denning area. Therefore, in July and at the beginning of August, polar bears can be observed, from a boat, on floes, on islands or swimming from close up. Peary caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;) and curious Arctic ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus parryii&quot;) come close to Sila Lodge. More rarely seen are the shy lemmings (&quot;Lemmus sibiricus&quot;). Due to their camouflage, Arctic foxes (&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot;) and Arctic hares (&quot;Lepus arcticus&quot;), are not easily spotted but are most likely seen when fleeing. Other animals seen occasionally include Arctic wolves (&quot;Canis lupus arctos&quot;), muskoxen (&quot;Ovibos moschatus&quot;), snowshoe hares (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;) and wolverines (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;).

Several species of marine mammals can be seen in the park&#x27;s area: ringed seals (&quot;Phoca hispida&quot;) and bearded seals (&quot;Erignathus barbatus&quot;) live there in large numbers, and from time to time a walrus (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus&quot;), common seal (harbour seal, &quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;), a beluga (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;), a narwhal (&quot;Monodon monoceros&quot;), or a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) may appear in Wager Bay.

Only four species of fish have been reported: Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;), lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush&quot;), lumpfish (&quot;Cyclopterus lumpus&quot;) and ninespine stickleback (&quot;Pungitius pungitius&quot;).

==Tourism==

Usually, the park can only be visited during a very few summer weeks, from the beginning of July until the beginning of August. Before that, Wager Bay has too much ice to be visited by boat, and in the autumn the Inuit say: &quot;During summertime, you may watch polar bears. Afterwards, they will watch you!&quot;

The place can be reached by a hired plane – usually one would depart from Baker Lake, about away, where scheduled flights arrive from Rankin Inlet. One can also approach by motorboat from Repulse Bay, where Parks Canada runs a station, but due to possible problems with ice this might take longer and therefore will only be considered by explorers or movie teams who have to bring a lot of equipment.

The only air strip in the park is at the Sila River on Wager Bay&#x27;s north coast. In 1987, Inuit from the area built &quot;Sila Lodge&quot; at this location. The lodge was opened for a few weeks during the summertime to allow nature enthusiasts to stay in the area. Due to the high expenses of the flights, the lodge has been little used since 2002. From Sila Lodge, guided tours were offered, for instance boating tours to the Wager Bay islands, or to Ford Lake across the reversing falls, to the former Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company outpost, or walks to the surrounding area, where one would find impressive relics of earlier settlements, such as tent rings, qarmaq and inuksuk. The site can be used as a starting point for backpacking trips, but with suitable precautions taken for polar bears in the area.

<text>In geotechnical engineering, soil structure describes the arrangement of the solid parts of the soil and of the pore space located between them. It is determined by how individual soil granules clump, bind together, and aggregate, resulting in the arrangement of soil pores between them. Soil has a major influence on water and air movement, biological activity, root growth and seedling emergence. There are several different types of soil structure. It is inherently a dynamic and complex system that is affected by different factors.

== Overview ==
Soil structure describes the arrangement of the solid parts of the soil and of the pore spaces located between them (Marshall &amp; Holmes, 1979). Aggregation is the result of the interaction of soil particles through rearrangement, flocculation and cementation. It is enhanced by: the precipitation of oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and silicates; the products of biological activity (such as biofilms, fungal hyphae and glycoproteins); ionic bridging between negatively charged particles (both clay minerals and organic compounds) by multivalent cations; and interactions between organic compounds (hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic bonding).

The quality of soil structure will decline under most forms of cultivation—the associated mechanical mixing of the soil compacts and shears aggregates and fills pore spaces; it also exposes organic matter to a greater rate of decay and oxidation. A further consequence of continued cultivation and traffic is the development of compacted, impermeable layers or &#x27;pans&#x27; within the profile.

The decline of soil structure under irrigation is usually related to the breakdown of aggregates and dispersion of clay material as a result of rapid wetting. This is particularly so if soils are sodic; that is, having a high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of the cations attached to the clays. High sodium levels (compared to high calcium levels) cause particles to repel one another when wet, and the associated aggregates to disaggregate and disperse. The ESP will increase if irrigation causes salty water (even of low concentration) to gain access to the soil.

A wide range of practices are undertaken to preserve and improve soil structure. For example, the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation advocates: increasing organic content by incorporating pasture phases into cropping rotations; reducing or eliminating tillage and cultivation in cropping and pasture activities; avoiding soil disturbance during periods of excessive dry or wet when soils may accordingly tend to shatter or smear; and ensuring sufficient ground cover to protect the soil from raindrop impact. In irrigated agriculture, it may be recommended to: apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) to displace sodium cations with calcium and so reduce ESP or sodicity, avoid rapid wetting, and avoid disturbing soils when too wet or dry.

==Types==

The main types of soil structures are:
* Platy – The units are flat and platelike. They are generally oriented horizontally.
* Prismatic – The individual units are bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces. Units are distinctly longer vertically, and the faces are typically casts or molds of adjoining units. Vertices are angular or subrounded; the tops of the prisms are somewhat indistinct and normally flat.
* Columnar – The units are similar to prisms and bounded by flat or slightly rounded vertical faces. The tops of columns, in contrast to those of prisms, are very distinct and normally rounded.
* Blocky – The units are blocklike or polyhedral. They are bounded by flat or slightly rounded surfaces that are casts of the faces of surrounding peds. Typically, blocky structural units are nearly equidimensional but grade to prisms and plates. The structure is described as angular blocky if the faces intersect at relatively sharp angles and as subangular blocky if the faces are a mixture of rounded and plane faces and the corners are mostly rounded.
* Granular – The units are approximately spherical or polyhedral. They are bounded by curved or very irregular faces that are not casts of adjoining peds.
* Wedge – The units are approximately elliptical with interlocking lenses that terminate in acute angles. They are commonly bounded by small slickensides.
* Lenticular —The units are overlapping lenses parallel to the soil surface. They are thickest in the middle and thin towards the edges. Lenticular structure is commonly associated with moist soils, texture classes high in silt or very fine sand (e.g., silt loam), and high potential for frost action.

===Platy===

In platy structure, the units are flat and platelike. They are generally oriented horizontally. A special form, lenticular platy structure, is recognized for plates that are thickest in the middle and thin toward the edges. Platy structure is usually found in subsurface soils that have been subject to leaching or compaction by animals or machinery. The plates can be separated with a little effort by prying the horizontal layers with a pen knife. Platy structure tends to impede the downward movement of water and plant roots through the soil.

They are found most frequently in the C, E, Bs and K horizons as well as in sesquioxides (very old soils that are rich in iron and magnesium).

===Prismatic===

In the prismatic structure, the individual units are bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces. Units are distinctly longer vertically, and the faces are typically casts or molds of adjoining units. Vertices are angular or subrounded; the tops of the prisms are somewhat indistinct and normally flat. Prismatic structures are characteristic of the B horizons or subsoils. The vertical cracks result from freezing and thawing and wetting and drying as well as the downward movement of water and roots.

===Columnar===

In the columnar structure, the units are similar to prisms and are bounded by flat or slightly rounded vertical faces. The tops of columns, in contrast to those of prisms, are very distinct and normally rounded. Columnar structure is common in the subsoil of sodium affected soils and soils rich in swelling clays such as the smectites and the kandite Halloysite. Columnar structure is very dense and it is very difficult for plant roots to penetrate these layers. Techniques such as deep plowing have helped to restore some degree of fertility to these soils.

===Blocky===

In blocky structure, the structural units are blocklike or polyhedral. They are bounded by flat or slightly rounded surfaces that are casts of the faces of surrounding peds. Typically, blocky structural units are nearly equidimensional but grade to prisms and to plates. The structure is described as angular blocky if the faces intersect at relatively sharp angles; as subangular blocky if the faces are a mixture of rounded and plane faces and the corners are mostly rounded. Blocky structures are common in subsoil but also occur in surface soils that have a high clay content. The strongest blocky structure is formed as a result of swelling and shrinking of the clay minerals which produce cracks. Sometimes the surface of dried-up sloughs and ponds shows characteristic cracking and peeling due to clays.

===Granular===

In the granular structure, the structural units are approximately spherical or polyhedral and are bounded by curved or very irregular faces that are not casts of adjoining peds. In other words, they look like cookie crumbs. Granular structure is common in the surface soils of rich grasslands and highly amended garden soils with high organic matter content. Soil mineral particles are both separated and bridged by organic matter breakdown products, and soil biota exudates, making the soil easy to work. Cultivation, earthworms, frost action and rodents mix the soil and decrease the size of the peds. This structure allows for good porosity and easy movement of air and water. This combination of ease in tillage, good moisture and air handling capabilities, and good structure for planting and germination, are definitive of the phrase &quot;good tilth&quot;.

==Improvement==
The benefits of improving soil structure for the growth of plants, particularly in an agricultural setting, include: reduced erosion due to greater soil aggregate strength and decreased overland flow; improved root penetration and access to soil moisture and nutrients; improved emergence of seedlings due to reduced crusting of the surface; and greater water infiltration, retention and availability due to improved porosity.

Productivity from irrigated no-tillage or minimum tillage soil management in horticulture usually decreases over time due to degradation of the soil structure, inhibiting root growth and water retention. There are a few exceptions, why such exceptional fields retain structure is unknown, but it is associated with high organic matter. Improving soil structure in such settings can increase yields significantly. The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation suggests that in cropping systems, wheat yields can be increased by 10 kg/ha for every extra millimetre of rain that is able to infiltrate due to soil structure.

==Hardsetting soil==
Hardsetting soils lose their structure when wet and then set hard as they dry out to form a structureless mass that is very difficult to cultivate. They can only be tilled when their moisture content is within a limited range. When they are tilled the result is often a very cloddy surface (poor tilth). As they dry out the high soil strength often restricts seedling and root growth. Infiltration rates are low and runoff of rain and irrigation limits the productivity of many hardsetting soils.

===Definition===

Hardsetting has been defined this way: &quot;A hardsetting soil is one that sets to an almost homogeneous mass on drying. It may have occasional cracks, typically at a spacing of &gt;0.1 m. Air dry hardset soil is hard and brittle, and it is not possible to push a forefinger into the profile face. Typically, it has a tensile strength of 90 kN–2. Soils that crust are not necessarily hardsetting since a hardsetting horizon is thicker than a crust. (In cultivated soils the thickness of the hardsetting horizon is frequently equal to or greater than that of the cultivated layer.) Hardsetting soil is not permanently cemented and is soft when wet. The clods in a hardsetting horizon that has been cultivated will partially or totally disintegrate upon wetting. If the soil has been sufficiently wetted, it will revert to its hardset state on drying. This can happen after flood irrigation or a single intense rainfall event.&quot;

== Soil structure dynamics ==
Soil structure is inherently a and complex system that is affected by different factors such as tillage, wheel traffic, roots, biological activities in soil, rainfall events, wind erosion, shrinking, swelling, freezing and thawing. In turn, reciprocally soil structure interacts and affects the root growth and function, soil fauna and biota, water and solute transport processes, gas exchange, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, traffic bearing capacity, and many other aspects in relation with soil. Ignoring soil structure or viewing it as &quot;static&quot; can lead to poor predictions of soil properties and might significantly affect the soil management.

<text>(also spelled ) is the contraction of an old Lakota word, &#x27;, meaning &#x27;wants to be like a woman&#x27;. Historically, the&#x27; have in some cases been considered a social category of male-bodied individuals who adopt the clothing, work, and mannerisms that Lakota culture usually considers feminine. However, in contemporary Lakota culture, &#x27; is usually used to refer to a [[homosexual]] man, regardless of whether that man is in other ways gender non-conforming. Contemporary&#x27; may or may not consider themselves part of the more mainstream gay, LGBT, or pan-Indian two-spirit communities. Historically, sometimes the direction to adopt the social and spiritual aspects of this role has come in a series of dreams. 

While historical accounts of their status vary, most accounts treated the &#x27; as regular members of the community, and not in any way marginalized for their status. Other accounts held the&#x27; as sacred, occupying a liminal, third-gender role in the culture, and born to fulfill ceremonial roles that could not be filled by either men or women. In contemporary Lakota communities, attitudes toward the &quot;&quot; vary from accepting to homophobic.

==Etymology==
Beatrice Medicine writes: In my childhood, we were aware of this social category, which was referred to as &quot;winkte&quot;. Linguistic analysis of this Lakota word is:
:&quot;win&quot; – &quot;woman&quot;
:&quot;kte&quot; – &quot;to be like&quot;
:&quot;kte&quot; – &quot;to kill&quot; (a deeper structural form)
:&quot;The common vernacular usage was &quot;winkte&quot; &quot;wants to be like a woman.&quot;

:We, as children, were instructed, &quot;There are these individuals – in all cases males (&quot;wicasa&quot;). They are different. They are &quot;winkte&quot;. Don&#x27;t make fun of them. They are also Lakota,&quot; said our parents and grandparents.

<doc id="303354" wikidata="Q16959693" url="?curid=303354" title="Loss of clerical state">
<text>In the canon law of the Catholic Church, the loss of clerical state (commonly referred to as laicization, dismissal, defrocking, and degradation) is the removal of a bishop, priest, or deacon from the status of being a member of the clergy.

The term &quot;defrocking&quot; originated in the ritual removal of vestments as a penalty against clergy that was eventually codified within the &quot;Roman Pontifical&quot;. Contemporary Latin Catholic canon law does not contain such a ritual, leading some to consider it an inaccurate description of laicization. However, others consider &quot;defrocking&quot; a synonym to laicization that is especially popular in English. While the ritual removal of the vestments no longer exists, canon law still prohibits the wear of a clerical collar by laicized priests.

In the Catholic Church, a bishop, priest, or deacon may be &quot;dismissed from the clerical state&quot; as a penalty for certain grave offences, or by a papal decree granted for grave reasons. This may be because of a serious criminal conviction, heresy, or similar matter. Removal from the clerical state is sometimes imposed as a punishment (), or it may be granted as a favour () at the cleric&#x27;s own request. A Catholic cleric may voluntarily request to be removed from the clerical state for a grave, personal reason. Voluntary requests were, as of the 1990s, believed to be by far the most common means of this loss, and most common within this category was the intention to marry, as most Latin Church clergy must as a rule be celibate. Canon law was amended in March 2019 to allow dismissal from their community, though not dismissal from the clerical state, for religious who are members of, and desert, a religious community. This policy has been in force since 10 April 2019.

== Consequences ==
Laicization involves cessation of all the rights of the clerical state. It also terminates all obligations of the clerical state, except for the obligation of celibacy. Dispensation from the obligation of celibacy can only be granted by the pope, except in ordinations that have been declared invalid, in which case no dispensation is necessary. Because the sacramental character of ordination makes it indelible, the cleric maintains the power of orders. He is, however, forbidden to exercise it, except to give sacramental absolution to someone in danger of death. He also automatically loses his offices, roles and delegated powers.

Normally, the same rescript grants both laicization and dispensation from the obligation of celibacy. The person to whom it is granted is not permitted to separate the two, accepting the dispensation while rejecting the laicization, or accepting the laicization while rejecting the dispensation. While married deacons whose wives die are sometimes permitted to marry again, and married ministers of a non-Catholic confession who become Catholics are sometimes permitted to be ordained and minister in the Catholic Church, grants of dispensation from the obligation of celibacy without simultaneous laicization are very rare.

A laicized cleric loses rights to such things as clerical garb and titles (such as &quot;Father&quot;). He is freed from obligations such as recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, but like any member of the laity is encouraged, though not obliged, to continue to recite it. The rescript of laicization for a deacon normally contains no special limitations, but that for a priest does prohibit him from delivering a homily (the sermon preached at Mass after proclamation of the Gospel reading, not preaching in general), acting as extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, having a directive office in the pastoral field, or having any function in a seminary or similar institution. It imposes restrictions also regarding the holding of teaching or administration posts in schools and universities. Some of these limitations may be relaxed according to the judgment of the local bishop including the teaching of theology in schools or universities (both Catholic and non-Catholic), maintaining contact with the parish where the priest used to serve, and administering the Eucharist.

A cleric dismissed from the clerical state cannot be reinstated in the sacred ministry without the consent of the pope.

New regulations issued in 2009 regarding priests who abandon their ministry for more than five years and whose behavior is a cause of serious scandal have made it easier for bishops to secure this removal of clerical status from such priests even against the priests&#x27; wishes. In the two years 2011 and 2012, nearly 400 Catholic priests were removed from the clerical state, with a peak of 260 in 2011, and nearly half of these being imposed as a penalty.

== Difference from suspension ==
The removal from the clerical state differs from suspension. The latter is a censure prohibiting certain acts by a cleric, whether the acts are of a religious character deriving from his ordination (&quot;acts of the power of orders&quot;) or are exercises of his power of governance or of rights and functions attached to the office he holds. As a censure, suspension is meant to cease when the censured person shows repentance. Removal from the clerical state, on the contrary, is a permanent measure, whereby for a sufficient reason a cleric is from then on juridically treated as a layman.

==Notable historical examples==
At Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s insistence, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord requested laicization in 1802, in order to marry his long-time lover Catherine Grand (née Worlée). Talleyrand was already excommunicated for his part in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Pope Pius VII reluctantly lifted the excommunication and gave him &quot;permission to wear secular clothing&quot;, which permission the French Conseil d&#x27;État interpreted as a laicization. Talleyrand married Worlée, then divorced in 1815, and lived on as a layman, but on his deathbed in 1838 he signed a document of reconciliation with the Church, prepared by future bishop Félix Dupanloup. Dupanloup then administered the last rites to Talleyrand.

Bishop of San Pedro Fernando Lugo requested laicization in Paraguay in 2005 to allow him to run for President of Paraguay. The Church at first refused, going so far as to suspend him as bishop when he ran for office anyway, but eventually granted lay status in 2008 after he was elected.

In September 2018, Pope Francis ordered the laicization of a Chilean priest convicted in 2011 of the sexual abuse of minors. He had previously been sentenced to a life of prayer and penance.

===Cases of bishops===
The laicization of bishops is unusual. In 2009, the church laicized Emmanuel Milingo, a former exorcist, faith healer, and archbishop of Lusaka, Zambia, who had already been excommunicated from the church three years earlier. Milingo had threatened to form a breakaway church without a rule of priestly celibacy, and had himself married. Raymond Lahey, the former bishop of Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada, was laicized in 2012, a year after he pleaded guilty in Canadian civil court to importing child pornography. Józef Wesołowski, a Polish archbishop who had been a nuncio (papal ambassador), was dismissed from the clerical state in 2014 on grounds of sexual abuse of minors. The Vatican had made criminal charges against Wesołowski related to his abuse of minors and planned to try him, but Wesołowski died in 2015 before a trial could be held.

Theodore Edgar McCarrick, a former cardinal and the former Archbishop of Washington, D.C., was dismissed from the clerical state in February 2019. McCarrick is the highest-ranked church official to date to be dismissed over the ongoing sexual abuse scandals in the Church.

Roger Vangheluwe, who served as the Bishop of Bruges until 2010, was laicized on March 11, 2024, after new elements regarding the prolonged abuse of his nephew came to light. Vangheluwe abused his nephew from the age of 5, at least for a period of 13 years. The statute of limitations in Belgium meant he could not be prosecuted anymore when the case came to light in 2010.

<doc id="303356" wikidata="Q1544261" url="?curid=303356" title="Totally disconnected space">
<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a totally disconnected space is a topological space that has only singletons as connected subsets. In every topological space, the singletons (and, when it is considered connected, the empty set) are connected; in a totally disconnected space, these are the &quot;only&quot; connected subsets.

An important example of a totally disconnected space is the Cantor set, which is homeomorphic to the set of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers. Another example, playing a key role in algebraic number theory, is the field of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers.

==Definition==
A topological space formula_1 is totally disconnected if the connected components in formula_1 are the one-point sets. Analogously, a topological space formula_1 is totally path-disconnected if all path-components in formula_1 are the one-point sets.

Another closely related notion is that of a totally separated space, i.e. a space where quasicomponents are singletons. That is, a topological space 
formula_1 is totally separated if for every formula_6, the intersection of all clopen neighborhoods of formula_7 is the singleton formula_8. Equivalently, for each pair of distinct points formula_9, there is a pair of disjoint open neighborhoods formula_10 of formula_11 such that formula_12.

Every totally separated space is evidently totally disconnected but the converse is false even for metric spaces. For instance, take formula_1 to be the Cantor&#x27;s teepee, which is the Knaster–Kuratowski fan with the apex removed. Then formula_1 is totally disconnected but its quasicomponents are not singletons. For locally compact Hausdorff spaces the two notions (totally disconnected and totally separated) are equivalent.

Confusingly, in the literature (for instance) totally disconnected spaces are sometimes called hereditarily disconnected, while the terminology totally disconnected is used for totally separated spaces.

==Examples==
The following are examples of totally disconnected spaces:
*Discrete spaces
* The rational numbers
* The irrational numbers
* The &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers; more generally, all profinite groups are totally disconnected.
* The Cantor set and the Cantor space
* The Baire space
* The Sorgenfrey line
* Every Hausdorff space of small inductive dimension 0 is totally disconnected
* The Erdős space ℓ&quot;2&quot;formula_15 is a totally disconnected Hausdorff space that does not have small inductive dimension 0.
* Extremally disconnected Hausdorff spaces
* Stone spaces
* The Knaster–Kuratowski fan provides an example of a connected space, such that the removal of a single point produces a totally disconnected space.

==Properties==
*Subspaces, products, and coproducts of totally disconnected spaces are totally disconnected.
*Totally disconnected spaces are T1 spaces, since singletons are closed. 
*Continuous images of totally disconnected spaces are not necessarily totally disconnected, in fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
*A locally compact Hausdorff space has small inductive dimension 0 if and only if it is totally disconnected.
*Every totally disconnected compact metric space is homeomorphic to a subset of a countable product of discrete spaces.
*It is in general not true that every open set in a totally disconnected space is also closed.
*It is in general not true that the closure of every open set in a totally disconnected space is open, i.e. not every totally disconnected Hausdorff space is extremally disconnected.

==Constructing a totally disconnected quotient space of any given space==
Let formula_1 be an arbitrary topological space. Let formula_17 if and only if formula_18 (where formula_19 denotes the largest connected subset containing formula_7). This is obviously an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the connected components of formula_1. Endow formula_22 with the quotient topology, i.e. the finest topology making the map formula_23 continuous. With a little bit of effort we can see that formula_22 is totally disconnected. 

In fact this space is not only &quot;some&quot; totally disconnected quotient but in a certain sense the &quot;biggest&quot;: The following universal property holds: For any totally disconnected space formula_25 and any continuous map formula_26, there exists a &quot;unique&quot; continuous map formula_27 with formula_28.

<text>Philibert de l&#x27;Orme () (3-9 June 1514 – 8 January 1570) was a French architect and writer, and one of the great masters of French Renaissance architecture. His surname is also written De l&#x27;Orme, de L&#x27;Orme, or Delorme.

==Biography==
===Early career===

Philbert de l&#x27;Orme was born between 3 and 9 June 1514 in Lyon. His father was Jehan de L&#x27;Orme, a master mason and entrepreneur, who, in the 1530s, employed three hundred workers and built prestigious buildings for the elite of the city. When Philibert was nineteen he departed Lyon for Italy, where he remained for three years, working on building projects for Pope Paul III. In Rome he was introduced to Cardinal Jean du Bellay, the Ambassador of King François I to the Vatican, who became his protector and client. Du Bellay was also the patron of his friend Francois Rabelais. In about 1540 de l&#x27;Orme moved to Paris, and was soon occupied with royal projects.

===Royal architect of Henry II (1548-1559)===

On April 3, 1548 he was a named architect of the King by Henry II. For a period of eleven years, he supervised all of the King&#x27;s architectural projects, with the exception of changes to the Louvre, which were planned by another royal architect, Pierre Lescot. His major projects included the Château de St Maur-des-Fossés, the Château d&#x27;Anet, the Château de Chenonceau in the Loire Valley; the royal Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne; the Château de Vincennes, and major modifications to the Palace of Fontainebleau.

He also made a reputation as a writer and theorist, and as an innovator in building techniques. He invented a new system for making the essential wooden frameworks for constructing stone buildings, called &quot;charpente à petits bois&quot;, which was quicker and less expensive than previous methods and used much less wood. He demonstrated it before the King in 1555, and put it to work in construction at the new royal Château de Montceaux and at the royal hunting lodge in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

===Out of favor - architectural theorist (1559-1563)===
The death of Henry II of France on July 10, 1559 suddenly left him without a patron and at the mercy of rival architects who resented his success and his style. Two days later, on 10 July, he was dismissed from his official posts, and replaced by an Italian artist and architect, Francesco Primaticcio, whose work was much in fashion. He had joined a religious order, and decided to turn his attention to meditation, scholarship and writing. He made another trip to Rome to inspect the new works of Michelangelo. Beginning in 1565 wrote the first volume of a work on architectural theory, which was scientific and philosophical. It was published in 1567, and was followed by new editions after his death in 1576, 1626 and 1648.

===Royal architect again (1563-1570)===
Under Charles IX and Catherine de Medici, he returned to royal favor. He was employed on the enlargement of the Chateau of Saint Maur (1563) and, along with Jean Bullant, on additions to the Tuileries Palace (1564). He died in Paris in 1570, while this project was underway.

===Reputation===

In the 17th century, during the period of Louis XIV style that followed his death, his reputation suffered. The grand stairway that he built at the Tuileries Palace was demolished in 1664, as was his Château de Saint-Léger in 1668, to make way for classical structures. In 1683, he was denounced by François Blondel of the Royal Academy for his &quot;villainous Gothic ornaments&quot; and his &quot;petty manner&quot;. Nonetheless, his two major theoretical works on construction and design continued to be important textbooks, and were regularly republished and read.

His reputation rose again in the 18th century, through the writings of Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville, who wrote in 1787 that he had &quot;abandoned the Gothic covering in order to redress French architecture in the style Ancient Greece.&quot; D&#x27;Argenville wrote the first biography and catalog of works. Though few of his building survived to be studied carefully, later important academic works on de l&#x27;Orme were written in the 19th and 20th centuries by art historians including H. Clouzot and Anthony Blunt.

One of De l&#x27;Orme&#x27;s primary accomplishments was to change the way architects trained and studied. He insisted that architects needed formal education in classical architecture, as well as in geometry and astronomy and the sciences, but also needed practical experience in construction. He himself was an accomplished scholar of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, as well as a humanist scholar. He argued that architects needed to be able to design and manage every aspect of the building, from the volumes to the &quot;lambris&quot; to adding up the cost, making detailed three-dimensional drawings of vaults, judging if wood was dry enough, and knowing to stop digging the foundation when the first sand was encountered. He had scorn for those architects who could design a facade but had no knowledge actual construction. His opponents scorned him for his background as the son of a masonry contractor. He was referred to by Bernard Palissy as &quot;The god of the stone masons&quot;, which deeply offended him.

His other major accomplishment was to resist the tendency to simply copy Italian architectural styles; he traveled and studied in Italy, and borrowed much, but he always added a distinctly French look to each of his projects.

==Works attributed to de l&#x27;Orme==
The first major building of de l&#x27;Orme was the Château of Saint Maur (1541), built for the Cardinal Jean du Bellay, whom de l&#x27;Orme had met during his time in Rome. Its plan showed the influence of the Italian villas; and, like the Italian buildings, it was decorated with frescoes.

Much of his work has disappeared, but his fame remains. He was an ardent humanist and student of the antique, he yet vindicated resolutely the French tradition in opposition to Italian tendencies; he was a man of independent mind and a vigorous originality. His masterpiece was the Château d&#x27;Anet (1552–1559), built for Diane de Poitiers, the plans of which are preserved in Jacques Androuet du Cerceau&#x27;s &quot;Plus excellens bastimens de France&quot;, though only part of the building remains. His designs for the Tuileries (also given by Androuet du Cerceau), begun by Catherine de&#x27; Medici in 1565, were magnificent. His work is also seen at Chenonceau and other famous &quot;châteaux&quot;; and his tomb of Francis I at Saint Denis Basilica remains a perfect specimen of his art.

The most easily viewed work of de l&#x27;Orme in Paris is the court facade of the Chateau d&#x27;Anet, which was moved to Paris after a major portion of the chateau was demolished, to illustrate for students the major works of the French Renaissance. It is attached to the front wall of the chapel of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and is visible from Rue Bonaparte.

<text>Margaret of Navarre (, , ) (c. 1135 – 12 August 1183) was Queen of Sicily as the wife of William I (1154–1166) and the regent during the minority of her son, William II.

==Queen consort==
Margaret was the daughter of King García Ramírez of Navarre and Marguerite de l&#x27;Aigle. She was married at a young age to William I of Sicily, in 1149, the fourth son of Roger II of Sicily. According to the Palermitan archivist Isidoro La Lumia, she was, in her later years, &quot;bella ancora, superba, leggiera&quot; (&quot;still beautiful, proud, light&quot;).

During the reign of her husband, Margaret was largely ignored by William who spent much of his time away from court - often frequenting his many personal harems. However, she is considered to have been a stronger, more apt administrator than her husband, and several times convinced him to act where he was determined to be passive. She worked closely with Maio of Bari, the king&#x27;s &quot;ammiratus ammiratorum&quot;, and they were often allied in trying to subvert opponents of the monarchy, though she was once detained with two of three sons by Matthew Bonnellus during a revolt, during which her eldest son was killed in a mass.

==Regent==
It was William&#x27;s will that his eldest son succeed him and his second son receive the principality of Capua. This was done and, on the day of William II&#x27;s coronation, Margaret declared a general amnesty throughout the realm, which covered rebellious barons such as Tancred nephew of her husband. The new regent also revoked her late husband&#x27;s least popular act: the imposition of redemption money on rebellious cities. Margaret&#x27;s first order of business was to appoint a strong hand to the vacant position of admiral (Maio having died). She promoted the caïd Peter, a Moslem convert and a eunuch, much to the annoyance of many a highborn nobleman or palace intimate.

The queen mother was distrustful of the native-born aristocracy and wrote a letter to her cousin, Rothrud, Archbishop of Rouen, asking him to send one of her French relatives, on her mother&#x27;s side, to help her govern. Her cousin Gilbert, Count of Gravina, already present in the south, was an enemy of Peter&#x27;s and, according to Hugo Falcandus, strongly opposed to his cousin&#x27;s government.

It was in this breakdown of relations between court and nobility that Peter defected to Tunisia and reconverted to Islam. With this, Margaret was forced to declare her traitorous cousin Gilbert catapan of Apulia and Campania and send him to the peninsula to prepare for the coming invasion of Frederick Barbarossa. At this juncture, the queen mother&#x27;s popularity, secured by such populist early acts as mentioned above, had abated considerably and she was known in the street as &quot;the Spanish woman.&quot;

After the departure of Gilbert to Apulia, Margaret&#x27;s brother Rodrigo arrived in Palermo. Rodrigo, whom bade change his name to Henry, was commonly thought to be a bastard son of Margaret de l&#x27;Aigle and King García never recognised him. He was destined to be a divisive and dangerous figure in the future of his nephew&#x27;s reign. For now, however, Margaret moved him off to Apulia with the title of Count of Montescaglioso. Happily for her, a more favourable familial arrival occurred nearly simultaneously. Rothrude of Rouen had sent word of her plea to Stephen du Perche, another cousin. Stephen was then setting off on Crusade with a retinue of thirty seven knights. He decided to stop off in Palermo first. There he was persuaded to remain and was appointed chancellor in November 1166. Peter of Blois, his younger brother William, and Walter Ophamil were among the knights, and Peter and Walter served as tutors of William II.

In 1167, Margaret did her best to send aid (in the form of money) to the besieged Pope Alexander III in Rome, then opposing their common enemy, the Emperor Barbarossa. In Autumn of that year, however, she made a horrible blunder. She appointed Stephen to the vacant archbishopric of Palermo. With that, not only the nobility, but also the clergy, now despised the queen mother regent, beloved nevertheless of the populace. Her brother Henry arrived in Sicily at the same time and bred new trouble by accusing the queen mother of being under the spell of her lover Richard, Count of Molise. The allegations, concocted by his friends, were, unsurprisingly, completely false. His friends soon convinced him to point the finger at the incestuous Stephen du Perche, equally innocent as Richard of Molise. Around Henry arose a great conspiracy, but Stephen was too quick and the danger was diffused and Margaret eventually convinced (i.e. bribed) Henry to leave Sicily for Spain. Margaret called Stephen &quot;her brother&quot;, spoke of him too familiarly and looked at him hungrily, which led to suspicions that they had affection.

In 1168, events concerning the rebellious vassals who opposed the Navarrese and French courtiers came to a head. It was also rumored that William was murdered and Stephen du Perche planned to have his brother to marry Princess Constance aunt of William who was confined to Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo as a nun from childhood due to a prediction that &quot;her marriage would destroy Sicily&quot; to claim the throne, despite the existence of Henry brother of William. Stephen was forced to go. Then Gilbert of Gravina was banished as well. In 1169, Peter of Blois also left.

Margaret was now left without any familial relations to save her son and ward in Sicily: the government had been torn from her hands. She protested her cousin&#x27;s deposition from the archdiocese and sent letters to the pope and to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, to beg their assistance in reinstating her favourite, but she received none from Alexander and little of actual value from Thomas. Her de facto regency ends here, though she was regent de jure until her son&#x27;s coming of age in 1171.

==Legacy==

Margaret lived until 1183, endowing as her legacy a Benedictine abbey at the site of Santa Maria in Maniace, constructed by Giorgio Maniace over a century prior, and a church at San Marco d&#x27;Alunzio, Robert Guiscard&#x27;s first castle in Sicily. She is buried in Monreale Cathedral in Palermo.

Interesting is her correspondence with Thomas Becket. Thomas wrote to her &quot;we owe you a debt of gratitude&quot; for her support of him against King Henry II of England. Thomas also wrote to Richard Palmer, bishop of Syracuse, petitioning him, an opponent of any other candidate for the Palermitan see besides himself, to work for the cause of the queen mother and Stephen. More interesting than either of these interchanges, however, is the golden pendant now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It bears the inscription and an effigy of Margaret and Bishop Reginald of Bath.

In a perception based on earlier historiography, John Julius Norwich spoke of her &quot;total unfitness to govern,&quot; but the success of Stephen during his short tenure is undeniable and she is primarily blamed for her refusal to see the disaffection her relatives caused the local nobility. Jacqueline Alio, her biographer, gives Margaret credit for competent rule in trying circumstances, identifying her as the greatest Sicilian queen of the Norman-Swabian era. In the first biography of this queen, Alio describes her as &quot;the most powerful woman in Europe for five eventful years&quot; and &quot;the most important woman of medieval Sicily&quot;. Alio also infers that Margaret and Constance, who would also become the queen regent, as sisters-in-law, knew each other, and young Constance had imitated the style of leadership of Margaret, so there might be a sisterhood between them if tenuous. (However, after the death of Henry the youngest son of Margaret in 1172, as the sole heir to William from then on, Constance remained confined to her monastery for the remainder of the lifetime of Margaret, whether out of the will of the latter or not.)

==Family==
Margaret and William had: 
*Roger IV, Duke of Apulia, predeceased his father 
*Robert, Prince of Capua, predeceased his father 
*William II of Sicily, the successor

<text>In mathematics, a quintic function is a function of the form

:formula_1

where , , , , and are members of a field, typically the rational numbers, the real numbers or the complex numbers, and is nonzero. In other words, a quintic function is defined by a polynomial of degree five.

Because they have an odd degree, normal quintic functions appear similar to normal cubic functions when graphed, except they may possess one additional local maximum and one additional local minimum. The derivative of a quintic function is a quartic function.

Setting and assuming produces a quintic equation of the form:
:formula_2 
Solving quintic equations in terms of radicals (&quot;n&quot;th roots) was a major problem in algebra from the 16th century, when cubic and quartic equations were solved, until the first half of the 19th century, when the impossibility of such a general solution was proved with the Abel–Ruffini theorem.

==Finding roots of a quintic equation==

Finding the roots (zeros) of a given polynomial has been a prominent mathematical problem.

Solving linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic equations in terms of radicals and elementary arithmetic operations on the coefficients can always be done, no matter whether the roots are rational or irrational, real or complex; there are formulas that yield the required solutions. However, there is no algebraic expression (that is, in terms of radicals) for the solutions of general quintic equations over the rationals; this statement is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem, first asserted in 1799 and completely proven in 1824. This result also holds for equations of higher degree. An example of a quintic whose roots cannot be expressed in terms of radicals is .

Numerical approximations of quintics roots can be computed with root-finding algorithms for polynomials. Although some quintics may be solved in terms of radicals, the solution is generally too complicated to be used in practice.

==Solvable quintics==

Some quintic equations can be solved in terms of radicals. These include the quintic equations defined by a polynomial that is reducible, such as . For example, it has been shown that

:formula_3

has solutions in radicals if and only if it has an integer solution or &quot;r&quot; is one of ±15, ±22440, or ±2759640, in which cases the polynomial is reducible.

As solving reducible quintic equations reduces immediately to solving polynomials of lower degree, only irreducible quintic equations are considered in the remainder of this section, and the term &quot;quintic&quot; will refer only to irreducible quintics. A solvable quintic is thus an irreducible quintic polynomial whose roots may be expressed in terms of radicals.

To characterize solvable quintics, and more generally solvable polynomials of higher degree, Évariste Galois developed techniques which gave rise to group theory and Galois theory. Applying these techniques, Arthur Cayley found a general criterion for determining whether any given quintic is solvable. This criterion is the following.

Given the equation
:formula_4
the Tschirnhaus transformation , which depresses the quintic (that is, removes the term of degree four), gives the equation

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

Both quintics are solvable by radicals if and only if either they are factorisable in equations of lower degrees with rational coefficients or the polynomial , named , has a rational root in , where

:formula_7

and

:formula_8
Cayley&#x27;s result allows us to test if a quintic is solvable. If it is the case, finding its roots is a more difficult problem, which consists of expressing the roots in terms of radicals involving the coefficients of the quintic and the rational root of Cayley&#x27;s resolvent.

In 1888, George Paxton Young described how to solve a solvable quintic equation, without providing an explicit formula; in 2004, Daniel Lazard wrote out a three-page formula.

===Quintics in Bring–Jerrard form===

There are several parametric representations of solvable quintics of the form , called the Bring–Jerrard form.

During the second half of the 19th century, John Stuart Glashan, George Paxton Young, and Carl Runge gave such a parameterization: an irreducible quintic with rational coefficients in Bring–Jerrard form
is solvable if and only if either or it may be written
:formula_9
where and are rational.

In 1994, Blair Spearman and Kenneth S. Williams gave an alternative,
:formula_10

The relationship between the 1885 and 1994 parameterizations can be seen by defining the expression
:formula_11
where . Using the negative case of the square root yields, after scaling variables, the first parametrization while the positive case gives the second.

The substitution , in the Spearman–Williams parameterization allows one to not exclude the special case , giving the following result:

If and are rational numbers, the equation is solvable by radicals if either its left-hand side is a product of polynomials of degree less than 5 with rational coefficients or there exist two rational numbers &quot;ℓ&quot; and such that
:formula_12

===Roots of a solvable quintic===
A polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is a solvable group. In the case of irreducible quintics, the Galois group is a subgroup of the symmetric group of all permutations of a five element set, which is solvable if and only if it is a subgroup of the group , of order , generated by the cyclic permutations and .

If the quintic is solvable, one of the solutions may be represented by an algebraic expression involving a fifth root and at most two square roots, generally nested. The other solutions may then be obtained either by changing the fifth root or by multiplying all the occurrences of the fifth root by the same power of a primitive 5th root of unity, such as
:formula_13

In fact, all four primitive fifth roots of unity may be obtained by changing the signs of the square roots appropriately; namely, the expression
:formula_14
where formula_15, yields the four distinct primitive fifth roots of unity.

It follows that one may need four different square roots for writing all the roots of a solvable quintic. Even for the first root that involves at most two square roots, the expression of the solutions in terms of radicals is usually highly complicated. However, when no square root is needed, the form of the first solution may be rather simple, as for the equation , for which the only real solution is

: formula_16

An example of a more complicated (although small enough to be written here) solution is the unique real root of . Let , , and , where is the golden ratio. Then the only real solution is given by

: formula_17

or, equivalently, by

:formula_18

where the are the four roots of the quartic equation

:formula_19

More generally, if an equation of prime degree with rational coefficients is solvable in radicals, then one can define an auxiliary equation of degree , also with rational coefficients, such that each root of is the sum of -th roots of the roots of . These -th roots were introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and their products by are commonly called Lagrange resolvents. The computation of and its roots can be used to solve . However these -th roots may not be computed independently (this would provide roots instead of ). Thus a correct solution needs to express all these -roots in term of one of them. Galois theory shows that this is always theoretically possible, even if the resulting formula may be too large to be of any use.

It is possible that some of the roots of are rational (as in the first example of this section) or some are zero. In these cases, the formula for the roots is much simpler, as for the solvable de Moivre quintic

:formula_20

where the auxiliary equation has two zero roots and reduces, by factoring them out, to the quadratic equation

:formula_21

such that the five roots of the de Moivre quintic are given by

:formula_22

where &quot;yi&quot; is any root of the auxiliary quadratic equation and &quot;ω&quot; is any of the four primitive 5th roots of unity. This can be easily generalized to construct a solvable septic and other odd degrees, not necessarily prime.

===Other solvable quintics===

There are infinitely many solvable quintics in Bring–Jerrard form which have been parameterized in a preceding section.

Up to the scaling of the variable, there are exactly five solvable quintics of the shape formula_23, which are (where &quot;s&quot; is a scaling factor):
:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28

Paxton Young (1888) gave a number of examples of solvable quintics:

An infinite sequence of solvable quintics may be constructed, whose roots are sums of th roots of unity, with being a prime number:

There are also two parameterized families of solvable quintics:
The Kondo–Brumer quintic,

:formula_29

and the family depending on the parameters formula_30
:formula_31

where

::formula_32
::formula_33
::formula_34

===&quot;Casus irreducibilis&quot;===

Analogously to cubic equations, there are solvable quintics which have five real roots all of whose solutions in radicals involve roots of complex numbers. This is &quot;casus irreducibilis&quot; for the quintic, which is discussed in Dummit. Indeed, if an irreducible quintic has all roots real, no root can be expressed purely in terms of real radicals (as is true for all polynomial degrees that are not powers of 2).

==Beyond radicals==

About 1835, Jerrard demonstrated that quintics can be solved by using ultraradicals (also known as Bring radicals), the unique real root of for real numbers . In 1858, Charles Hermite showed that the Bring radical could be characterized in terms of the Jacobi theta functions and their associated elliptic modular functions, using an approach similar to the more familiar approach of solving cubic equations by means of trigonometric functions. At around the same time, Leopold Kronecker, using group theory, developed a simpler way of deriving Hermite&#x27;s result, as had Francesco Brioschi. Later, Felix Klein came up with a method that relates the symmetries of the icosahedron, Galois theory, and the elliptic modular functions that are featured in Hermite&#x27;s solution, giving an explanation for why they should appear at all, and developed his own solution in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. Similar phenomena occur in degree (septic equations) and , as studied by Klein and discussed in .

===Solving with Bring radicals===
A Tschirnhaus transformation, which may be computed by solving a quartic equation, reduces the general quintic equation of the form 
:formula_35 
to the Bring–Jerrard normal form .

The roots of this equation cannot be expressed by radicals. However, in 1858, Charles Hermite published the first known solution of this equation in terms of elliptic functions.
At around the same time Francesco Brioschi 
and Leopold Kronecker
came upon equivalent solutions.

See Bring radical for details on these solutions and some related ones.

==Application to celestial mechanics==
Solving for the locations of the Lagrangian points of an astronomical orbit in which the masses of both objects are non-negligible involves solving a quintic.

More precisely, the locations of &quot;L&quot;2 and &quot;L&quot;1 are the solutions to the following equations, where the gravitational forces of two masses on a third (for example, Sun and Earth on satellites such as Gaia and the James Webb Space Telescope at &quot;L&quot;2 and SOHO at &quot;L&quot;1) provide the satellite&#x27;s centripetal force necessary to be in a synchronous orbit with Earth around the Sun:

: formula_36

The ± sign corresponds to &quot;L&quot;2 and &quot;L&quot;1, respectively; &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, &quot;ω&quot; the angular velocity, &quot;r&quot; the distance of the satellite to Earth, &quot;R&quot; the distance Sun to Earth (that is, the semi-major axis of Earth&#x27;s orbit), and &quot;m&quot;, &quot;ME&quot;, and &quot;MS&quot; are the respective masses of satellite, Earth, and Sun.

Using Kepler&#x27;s Third Law formula_37 and rearranging all terms yields the quintic

: formula_38

with:
:formula_39

Solving these two quintics yields for &quot;L&quot;2 and for &quot;L&quot;1. The Sun–Earth Lagrangian points &quot;L&quot;2 and &quot;L&quot;1 are usually given as 1.5 million km from Earth.

If the mass of the smaller object (&quot;M&quot;E) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (&quot;M&quot;S), then the quintic equation can be greatly reduced and L1 and L2 are at approximately the radius of the Hill sphere, given by:

: formula_40

That also yields for satellites at L1 and L2 in the Sun-Earth system.

<text>Paul Creston (born Giuseppe Guttoveggio; October 10, 1906 – August 24, 1985) was an American composer of classical music. He composed six symphonies and several concertante works for violin, piano, akkordion marimba and saxophone. 

==Biography==
Born in New York City to Sicilian immigrants, Creston was self-taught as a composer. His work tends to be fairly conservative in style, with a strong rhythmic element. His pieces include six symphonies; a number of concertos including two violin concertos, a marimba concerto, (premiered by Ruth Stuber), a piano concerto, premiered by Earl Wild, concerto for two pianos and orchestra, an accordion concerto, and a concerto for alto saxophone dedicated to Cecil Leeson). He composed a fantasia for trombone and orchestra (composed for and premiered by Robert Marsteller). For alto saxophone, he wrote also a Rapsodie for Jean-Marie Londeix; a suite (1935) and a sonata (Op. 19, 1939), dedicated to Leeson. The sonata was arranged by Marco Ciccone for saxophone and orchestra in 2008. Creston composed a suite for organ, Op. 70. Several of his works were inspired by the poetry of Walt Whitman.

Creston died in Poway, California, a suburb of San Diego.

Creston was one of the most performed American composers of the 1940s and 1950s. Several of his works have become staples of the wind band repertoire. &quot;Zanoni&quot;, &quot;Prelude and Dance&quot; and the &quot;Celebration Overture&quot; have been and still are on several state lists for contests across the USA.

Creston was also a notable teacher, whose students included the composers Irwin Swack, John Corigliano, Alvin Singleton, Elliott Schwartz, Frank Felice, Charles Roland Berry; accordionist/composer William Schimmel; and the jazz musicians Rusty Dedrick and Charlie Queener. List of music students by teacher: C to F §Paul Creston He wrote the theoretical books &quot;Principles of Rhythm&quot; (1964) and &quot;Rational Metric Notation&quot; (1979).

<doc id="303373" wikidata="Q543198" url="?curid=303373" title="Lili St. Cyr">
<text>Marie Frances Van Schaack (June 3, 1917 – January 29, 1999), known professionally as Lili St. Cyr, was a prominent American burlesque dancer and stripper.

== Early years ==
St. Cyr was born Marie Frances Van Schaack in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 3, 1917, the daughter of Idella Marian Van Shaack (née Peeza) and Edward Van Shaack, her first husband. She had two half-siblings, a sister and a brother, from her mother&#x27;s second marriage, and two half-sisters, Idella Ruth and Rosemary, from the third, to John Blackadder. Idella, born in 1924, had some minor roles in films under the name Barbara Moffett before marrying Louis Marx, a millionaire toy manufacturer. Rosemary, born in 1925 and also a burlesque dancer and stripper (under the stage name Dardy Orlando), married Harold Minsky. Marie was raised by her maternal grandmother, but visited regularly with Idella and Rosemary. In 2004, Rosemary appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

Having taken ballet lessons throughout her youth, she began to dance professionally as a chorus line member at the Florentine Gardens in Hollywood. St. Cyr had to beg her manager at a club to let her do a solo act. From her self-choreographed act, she eventually landed a bit part at a club called the Music Box in San Francisco, with the Duncan Sisters. It was here that she found a dancer&#x27;s salary was only a small fraction of the featured star&#x27;s salary: the difference was that the featured star was nude.

== Burlesque career ==
In the 1940s and most of the 1950s, St. Cyr, Gypsy Rose Lee and Ann Corio were the most recognized acts in striptease. St. Cyr&#x27;s stage name is a patronymic of the child-saint Saint Quiricus (Cyriacus), which she first used when booked as a nude performer in Las Vegas.

St. Cyr&#x27;s reputation in the burlesque and stripping world was that of a quality and high-class performer, unlike others such as Rose La Rose, who flashed her pubic hair. Two years after she started her career as a chorus line dancer, her stripping debut was at the Music Box, in an Ivan Fehnova production. The producer had not even seen her perform—her striking looks won him over. The act was a disaster, but instead of firing her, Fehnova put together a new act. At the end of the dance, a stagehand pulled a fishing line attached to St. Cyr&#x27;s G-string, which flew into the balcony as the lights went dim. This act was known as &quot;The Flying G&quot;, and such creative shows became St. Cyr&#x27;s trademark.

Over the ensuing years and in a variety of different venues, many of St. Cyr&#x27;s acts were memorable, with names like &quot;The Wolf Woman&quot;, &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;, &quot;The Ballet Dancer&quot;, &quot;In a Persian Harem&quot;, &quot;The Chinese Virgin&quot;, as well as &quot;Suicide&quot; (where she tried to woo a straying lover by revealing her body), and &quot;Jungle Goddess&quot; (in which she appeared to make love to a parrot). Props were integral to many of the women&#x27;s acts. Lili was known not only for her bathtub, but elaborate sets of vanities, mirrors, and hat racks. She variously performed as Cinderella, a matador, Salome, a bride, a suicide, Cleopatra, and Dorina Grey.

===Montreal===
St. Cyr&#x27;s work from 1944 to 1951 at Montreal&#x27;s Gayety Theatre led author and filmmaker William Weintraub to later describe her as &quot;Montreal&#x27;s most famous woman, the city&#x27;s femme fatale...&quot;. Quebec&#x27;s Catholic clergy condemned her act, declaring that whenever she dances &quot;the theater is made to stink with the foul odor of sexual frenzy.&quot; The clergy&#x27;s outcry was echoed by the Public Morality Committee. St. Cyr was arrested and charged with behavior that was &quot;immoral, obscene and indecent.&quot; She was acquitted, but the public authorities eventually closed down the Gayety Theatre.

In 1982, St. Cyr wrote a French autobiography, &quot;Ma Vie de Stripteaseuse&quot;. (Éditions Quebecor). In the book, she declared her appreciation for the Gayety Theatre and her love for the city of Montreal.

===Hollywood: nightclubs, films and photographs===
While performing in 1947 (1951?) at Ciro&#x27;s nightclub in Hollywood (billed as the &quot;Anatomic Bomb&quot;), St. Cyr was arrested by police and taken to court by a customer who considered her act lewd and lascivious. In December 1951, Herman Hover, owner of Ciro&#x27;s, was involved with St. Cyr&#x27;s indecent exposure case. She was accompanied by Armando Orsini, her husband. Represented by the infamous Hollywood attorney Jerry Giesler in court, St. Cyr insisted to the jury that her act was refined and elegant. As St. Cyr pointed out, what she did was slip off her dress, try on a hat, slip off her brassiere (G-string and brassiere of pink net underneath), and slip into a négligée. Then, undressing discreetly behind her maid, she stepped into a bubble bath, splashed around, and emerged, more or less dressed. After her appearance as a witness, as a newspaper account of the time put it, &quot;The defense rested, as did everyone else.&quot; After just 80 minutes of deliberation by the jury, St. Cyr was acquitted.

While St. Cyr starred in several movies, an acting career never really materialized. In 1953, with the help of Howard Hughes, St. Cyr landed her first acting job in a major motion picture in the &quot;Son of Sinbad&quot;. The film, described by one critic as &quot;a voyeur&#x27;s delight&quot;, has St. Cyr as a principal member of a Baghdad harem populated with dozens of nubile starlets. The film was condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. In 1958, St. Cyr also had roles in &quot;Josette from New Orleans&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/josette&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the movie version of Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;. In this film, St. Cyr plays Jersey Lili, a stripper in a Honolulu night-club and girlfriend of a soldier who boasts to his pals that he has her picture painted inside his groundsheet. Heavy editing of St. Cyr&#x27;s night-club routine by censors resulted in choppy editing, compromising the film&#x27;s quality. St. Cyr&#x27;s movie career was short lived, and typically she settled for playing a secondary role as a stripper, or playing herself. Her dancing is featured prominently in two Irving Klaw films, &quot;Varietease&quot; and &quot;Teaserama&quot;. St. Cyr starred in &quot;Runaway Girl&quot; (1965).

St. Cyr was also known for her pin-up photography, especially for photos taken by Bruno Bernard, known professionally as &quot;Bernard of Hollywood&quot;, a premier glamor photographer of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Era. Bernard said that she was his favorite model and referred to her as his muse.

=== Retirement ===
St. Cyr depleted the wealth she accumulated during her heyday. While interviewing her for his 1957 program, Mike Wallace stated she earned over $100,000 annually. St. Cyr retired from the stage in the 1970s, and began a lingerie business that she retained an interest in until her death. Similar to Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood, the Undie World of Lili St. Cyr designs offered costuming for strippers in addition to lingerie for personal use. Her catalogs featured photos or drawings of her modeling each article, lavishly detailed descriptions, and hand-selected fabrics. Her marketing for &quot;Scantie-Panties&quot; advertised them as &quot;perfect for street wear, stage or photography.&quot; Her later years were &quot;quiet—just her and some cats in a modest Hollywood apartment.&quot;

==Personal life==
Though less prominent toward the end of her life, her name came up regularly in 1950s tabloids: stories of her many husbands, brawls over her, and her attempted suicides. St. Cyr was married six times. Her best-known husbands were the motorcycle speedway rider Cordy Milne, musical-comedy actor and former ballet dancer Paul Valentine, restaurateur Armando Orsini, and actor Ted Jordan.

== Death ==
St. Cyr died in Los Angeles, California, on January 29, 1999, aged 81. She never had children, and told Mike Wallace in an October 5, 1957, interview that had she wanted them she would have adopted.

== Legacy and cultural references ==
Following her death and a renewed interest in burlesque, especially in Bettie Page, legions of new fans rediscovered some of the dancers in Irving Klaw&#x27;s photos and movies. In 2001, A&amp;E produced a special on burlesque that included a segment on St. Cyr.

St. Cyr is referenced in two songs that were both stage and movie musicals. In the song &quot;Zip&quot; from the 1940 musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, the singer (reporter/would-be stripper Melba Snyder) rhetorically asks at the climax of the song &quot;Who the hell is Lili St. Cyr?&quot; [i.e., what has she got that I don&#x27;t have?] In the 1975 musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, the final line of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It, Be It&quot; (sung by the character Janet Weiss, as played by Susan Sarandon) is &quot;God bless Lili St. Cyr!&quot;

In 1981, actress Cassandra Peterson became famous for her character Elvira, who achieved her trademark cleavage wearing a Lili St. Cyr deep plunge bra.

In 1989, one of St. Cyr&#x27;s husbands, Ted Jordan, wrote a biography of Marilyn Monroe entitled &quot;Norma Jean: My Secret Life with Marilyn Monroe&quot; (New York, William Morrow and Company, 1989), in which Jordan claimed that St. Cyr and Monroe had an affair. The claim is both widely disparaged by Monroe&#x27;s biographers and widely upheld by St. Cyr&#x27;s. Liza Dawson, editor for William Morrow, publisher of the Jordan book, makes a related claim in an interview with &quot;Newsday&quot; in 1989. Dawson stated that &quot;Marilyn very much patterned herself on Lili St. Cyr—her way of dressing, of talking, her whole persona. Norma Jean was a mousy, brown-haired girl with a high squeaky voice, and it was from Lili St. Cyr that she learned how to become a sex goddess.&quot;

<text>Christiane Maria Heideh Amanpour (; ; born 12 January 1958) is a British-Iranian journalist, Liberal activist, and television host. Amanpour is the Chief International Anchor for CNN and host of CNN International&#x27;s nightly interview program &quot;Amanpour&quot; and CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Amanpour Hour&quot; on Saturdays. She also hosts &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot; on PBS.

==Early life and education==
Amanpour was born in the West London suburb of Ealing, the daughter of Mohammad Taghi Amanpour (Iranian) and Anne Patricia Hill (British). She was baptised at the Church of Saint Benedict in Ealing and was raised in Tehran until the age of eleven. Her father was Shia Muslim and her mother was Roman Catholic.

Her father worked as an airline executive for Iran Air and later lost his job and fortune after the Iran Revolution in 1979. After completing the more significant part of her primary school education in Iran, her parents sent her to private boarding schools in England when she was 11. 

She first attended the Convent of the Holy Cross, an all-girls preparatory school in Chalfont Saint Peter, Buckinghamshire, and then, at the age of 16, she attended New Hall School, a Roman Catholic school in Chelmsford, Essex. 

After finishing her education in England, Amanpour returned to Iran. Due to the Iranian Revolution, she and her family moved in 1979 to the United States where she studied journalism at the University of Rhode Island. During her time there, she worked in the news department at WBRU-FM in Providence, Rhode Island. She also worked for NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence as an electronic graphics designer. 

In 1983, Amanpour graduated from the university &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. On 23 October 2007, she received the Commander badge (No. 3) of the Order of the British Empire for her journalism work.

== Career ==

=== 1983–2010: Cable News Network (CNN)===
In 1983, Amanpour was hired by CNN on the foreign desk in Atlanta, Georgia, as an entry-level desk assistant. During her early years as a correspondent, she was given her first major assignment covering the Iran–Iraq War, followed by a transfer in 1986 to Eastern Europe to report on the fall of European communism. In 1989, she was assigned to work in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, where she reported on the democratic revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe at the time. By 1990, she served as a correspondent for CNN&#x27;s New York bureau.

Following Iraq&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait in 1990, Amanpour&#x27;s reports of the Persian Gulf War brought her wide notice. Thereafter, she reported from the Bosnian war and other conflict zones. While in Bosnia, she interviewed Serb general Ratko Mladic, who would later be convicted of genocide. Because of her emotional delivery from Sarajevo during the Siege of Sarajevo, viewers and critics questioned her professional objectivity, claiming that many of her reports were unjustified and favored the Bosnian Muslims, to which she replied:
Amanpour gained a reputation for being fearless during the Gulf and Bosnian wars for reporting from conflict areas.

From 1992 to 2010, Amanpour was CNN&#x27;s chief international correspondent. From 2009 to 2010, she was the anchor of &quot;Amanpour&quot;, a daily CNN interview program. Amanpour has reported on major crises from many of the world&#x27;s hotspots, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Balkans and from the United States during Hurricane Katrina. She has secured exclusive interviews with world leaders from the Middle East to Europe, Africa and beyond, including Iranian presidents Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan, Sudan, and Syria, among others. After 9/11, she was the first international correspondent to interview British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Other interviewees have included Hillary Clinton, Nicolás Maduro, Hassan Rouhani, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, John Kerry, the Dalai Lama, Robert Mugabe and Moammar Gadhafi.

She has also conducted interviews with Constantine II of Greece, Reza Pahlavi, Ameera al-Taweel and actors Angelina Jolie, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.

From 1996 to 2005, she was contracted by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; creator Don Hewitt to file four to five in-depth international news reports a year as a special contributor. These reports garnered her a Peabody Award in 1998 (she had earlier been awarded one in 1993). Hewitt&#x27;s successor Jeff Fager terminated her contract.

====During the Bosnian War====

On 9 October 1994, Stephen Kinzer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Amanpour&#x27;s general coverage of the Bosnian War. Kinzer quoted a colleague&#x27;s description of Amanpour as she reported on a terrorist bombing in the Markale marketplace of the Bosnian city of Sarajevo:

[Christiane Amanpour] was sitting in Belgrade when that marketplace massacre happened, and she went on air to say that the Serbs had probably done it. There was no way she could have known that. She assumed an omniscience that no journalist has.

Amanpour has responded to the criticism leveled on her reporting from the war in the former Yugoslavia for &quot;lack of neutrality&quot;, stating:

Some people accused me of being pro–Muslim in Bosnia, but I realized that our job is to give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide, you can&#x27;t just be neutral. You can&#x27;t just say, &quot;Well, this little boy was shot in the head and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he argued with his wife.&quot; No, there is no equality, and we had to tell the truth.

In 2019, retired commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Saeed Qassemi spoke of his and his comrades&#x27; participation as combatants in the Bosnian War, with him having been disguised as staff of the Iranian Red Crescent Society. Shortly after, in April 2019, Qassemi claimed that Amanpour had uncovered their deception.

=== 2010–2012: ABC News ===
On 18 March 2010, Amanpour announced she would leave CNN for ABC News, where she would anchor &quot;This Week&quot;. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled to be joining the incredible team at ABC News. Being asked to anchor &quot;This Week&quot; in the superb tradition started by David Brinkley is a tremendous and rare honor, and I look forward to discussing the great domestic and international issues of the day. I leave CNN with the utmost respect, love, and admiration for the company and everyone who works here. This has been my family and shared endeavor for the past 27 years, and I am forever grateful and proud of all that we have accomplished.&quot; She hosted her first broadcast on 1 August 2010.

During her first two months as host, the ratings for &quot;This Week&quot; reached their lowest point since 2003. On 28 February 2011, she interviewed Muammar Gaddafi and his sons Saif al-Islam and Al-Saadi Gaddafi.

On 13 December 2011, ABC announced Amanpour would be leaving her post as anchor of ABC News&#x27; &quot;This Week&quot; on 8 January 2012 and returning to CNN International, where she had previously worked for 27 years and maintained a reporting role at ABC News.

=== 2012–present: Return to CNN ===
A day later on 14 December 2011, in statements by ABC and CNN, it was announced that in a &quot;unique arrangement&quot;, Amanpour would begin hosting a program on CNN International in 2012 while continuing at ABC News as a global affairs anchor.

It was later revealed that in the spring of 2012, CNN International would refresh its line-up, putting the interview show &quot;Amanpour&quot; back on air. On-air promotions said she would return to CNN International on 16 April. Her 30-minute New York-recorded show – to be screened twice an evening – would mean that the US parent network&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; interview show would be &quot;bumped&quot; out of its 9:00 p.m. (Central European Time) slot to midnight (CET).

On 9 September 2013, the show and staff were moved to the CNN International office and the show is currently being produced and broadcast from London.

On 7 January 2015, Amanpour made headlines during a &quot;Breaking News&quot; segment on CNN by referring to the Islamic extremists who murdered the 12 journalists at &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; as &quot;activists&quot;: &quot;On this day, these activists found their targets, and their targets were journalists. This was a clear attack on the freedom of expression, on the press, and on satire&quot;.

On 28 January 2019, Christiane Amanpour and Mary Ellen Schmider and Manfred Philipp gave the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
On 12 November 2020, Amanpour compared the Trump administration to the Nazis and Kristallnacht, saying, &quot;It was the Nazis&#x27; warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth.&quot; The Israeli government, along with some Jewish groups, called for Amanpour to apologize for this comparison. Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Omer Yankelevich urged an &quot;immediate and public apology&quot; for &quot;belittling of the immense tragedy of the Holocaust.&quot;

==== Refusal to wear a headscarf ====
In September 2022, Amanpour terminated a scheduled TV interview with President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi in New York City during the seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, following a last–minute demand that she wear a Chador headscarf while filming. Amanpour vehemently responded that she could not agree to the &quot;unprecedented and unexpected condition&quot; and later reflected on the controversial situation, declaring that:

==== Public Broadcasting Service ====

In May 2018, it was announced that Amanpour would permanently replace Charlie Rose on PBS after he was fired due to allegations of sexual misconduct. Her new program, &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot;, premiered on PBS on 10 September 2018. From the time of Charlie Rose&#x27;s departure from PBS until the new show premiered, &quot;Amanpour&quot; was aired on PBS stations, as &quot;Amanpour on PBS&quot;.

In 2020, Christiane Amanpour was doing the PBS daily program, &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot;, from her home in England, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her program continues to be seen on television on PBS at many stations in various areas of the US, including at least four TV stations in the greater Los Angeles region of southern California.

In April 2023, Amanpour misspoke and said that Israeli shooting victims Lucy, Maia and Rina Dee had been killed in a &quot;shootout&quot; instead of a &quot;shooting,&quot; while the family was travelling in a car in the West Bank. Amanpour contacted the father of the family to personally apologise for misspeaking and subsequently did the same on her show.

==Affiliations==
Amanpour is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Center for Public Integrity, the International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation, and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. Since April 2015 she has served as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Freedom of Expression and journalist safety.

==Personal life==

On 9 August 1998, Amanpour married Phillip James Rubin at the Roman Catholic parish of Saint Stephen in Bracciano, Italy. The wedding was officiated by the Catholic priest, Father Ambrose O’Farrell of the Dominican Order. Rubin is of Jewish-American descent and a former United States Assistant Secretary of State and spokesman for the United States Department of State during the Presidency of Bill Clinton and an informal adviser to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to former American President Barack Obama. In July 2009 she appeared in a &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine article entitled &quot;Christiane Amanpour Gets a High-Fashion Makeover&quot;.

She became pregnant at the age of forty–one, and their only son was born in Columbia Hospital for Women on 27 March 2000. Having lived in London since 2000, they moved to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. In May 2013, Rubin announced that the family would return to London to work on several projects, and in October of the same year, Amanpour stated that she and her husband would be relocating to London permanently:

In July 2018, Amanpour and Rubin announced they were divorcing.

Amanpour is a relative by marriage of Commander–General Nader Jahanbani of the Imperial Iranian Air Force of nearly twenty years until he was executed by the Islamic Revolutionaries in 1979, and of his younger brother Khosrow Jahanbani who was married to Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi. Amanpour&#x27;s uncle, Captain Nasrallah Amanpour, was married to the younger sister of Khosrow and Nader.

In June 2021, Amanpour announced that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had &quot;major successful surgery to remove it&quot;, and would undergo several months of chemotherapy.

<text>Khanith (also spelled Khaneeth or Xanith; ) denotes a person assigned male at birth who uses feminine gender expression, including trans women, men who have sex with men, cisgender or Boudi men perceived as feminine. It is generally considered derogatory and misleading.

The term is used in parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is considered a slur in these regions. It is closely related to &quot;mukhannathun&quot; (), meaning &quot;effeminate&quot;.

<text>Trondheim Airport (; ), more commonly known as Værnes, is an international airport serving Trondheim and the surrounding areas in Trøndelag county, Norway. The airport is located in Værnes, a village in Stjørdal Municipality which is located east of Trondheim Municipality. Operated by the state-owned Avinor, it shares facilities with Værnes Air Station of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. In 2018, the airport had 4,441,870 passengers and 58,273 air movements, making it the fourth-busiest in the country. The airport has two terminals; A dates from 1994 and is used for domestic traffic, while B is the renovated former main terminal from 1982, and is used for international traffic. The airport features a main east–west runway, a disused northwest–southeast runway, an integrated railway station and an airport hotel.

The main airlines at the airport are Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Norwegian Air Shuttle and Widerøe, for all of which Værnes is a focus city. The main route is the service to Oslo, operated by Norwegian, SAS, and Widerøe, which is the fourth-busiest route in Europe and there are also some additional domestic services operated by Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Dash 8 and Embraer E2. In addition to Norwegian, SAS and Wizz Air, the airlines airBaltic, Finnair and KLM operates international routes out of Trondheim. Widerøe operates also with Dash 8 aircraft to six airports in Helgeland and Nord-Trøndelag on PSO-routes on behalf of the Norwegian state. In October 2020, Wizz Air had reported Trondheim and Oslo airport as their new bases in Norway, with daily flights from Trondheim to Oslo, Stavanger, Bodø and Tromsø, however the base in Trondheim was shut down in February 2021, resulting in frequency decrease. Some international services to Copenhagen and Stockholm is provided by SAS and to Amsterdam is provided by KLM. The airport also serves charter services, mainly to the Mediterranean. In total, it connects to 15 domestic and 15 international destinations, as well as 18 charter destinations.

Værnes was taken into use by the Royal Norwegian Army in 1887. The first flight was made in 1914, and aerodrome facilities were gradually installed. The first main installations, including three concrete runways, were built during World War II by Luftwaffe. After the war, the Air Force Pilot School moved to Værnes, although in 1954 most of the other air force activities for Central Norway were moved to Ørland Main Air Station. Civilian aviation started in 1951, when half a barracks was taken into use as a terminal, with the whole building being utilized from 1958. Jet aircraft started serving Værnes from 1963, and the second terminal opened in 1965. The third (the current international Terminal B) was opened in 1982, and the fourth, Terminal A, was opened in 1994, along with the train station. From 1956 to 2004, Braathens was one of the largest airlines at the airport.

==Facilities==

Trondheim Airport is a joint military and civilian airport located in the municipality of Stjørdal in Trøndelag, with the northern part of the airport bordering the town of Stjørdalshalsen. To the west, the airport borders the Trondheimsfjord, and to the south the Stjørdal River. Combining the functions as an international, domestic and regional airport, it is located east of Trondheim. Most of the airport area is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, although the civilian facilities and the air traffic control are owned and operated by Avinor, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.

===Terminals===
The civilian sector consists of two terminals—A and B—which combined are , of which is passenger facilities. Terminal A is used for domestic traffic, while Terminal B is used for international services. The check-in facilities for domestic, international and charter are all fitted together at second floor at terminal A. The terminal contains an array of stores and dining places; these include a book store, convenience stores; clothing, crafts and cosmetics; diners, restaurants and pubs; and a duty-free store. The airport also has three automatic teller machines and a Radisson Blu hotel with 180 rooms and 11 conference rooms. Scandic Hell operates another hotel, the 400-room Rica Hell Hotel, within walking distance of the airport. The airport administration is located in Terminal B, while the administration for airlines and handling agents is located in annexes of Terminal A.

The terminal has stands for 24 aircraft, of which eight of sixteen at Terminal A have jetbridges. Four stands (two at each terminal is size code D, large enough for an Airbus A330 or a Boeing 757), while 20 are for size category C (large enough for an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737). Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30–37), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25–29) are used for domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42–49). The Air Force has six stands for military freight planes up to the size of a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy (code F), although one is permanently used for deicing.
===Cargo, general aviation and VIP===
Southeast of Terminal B is a collection of hangars and facilities belonging to various airlines. The largest is a hangar belonging to Scandinavian Airlines, dating from 1979, and a hangar from 1992 which is used by SAS Cargo. The airline also has two smaller buildings, at . This area contains the main gate, which is also used for VIP passengers. There are six additional hangars, used by Helitrans (), built in 1984 and 1991, a hangar belonging to Auticon, a hangar belonging to Hilmar Tollefsen and two smaller hangars, one of which belongs to Værnes flyklubb. Værnes handles the largest amount of general aviation in Central Norway, including executive jets.

===Runway and air control===
The main runway is long, and runs east–west at 09/27. It is wide, plus shoulders of on each side. The runway is equipped with instrument landing system category 1. The main radar, a combined primary and secondary, is placed at Vennafjell, south of the airport. Other radars are located at Kopparen, Tronfjell and Gråkallen. The taxiway runs parallel to the full length of the main runway. It is wide, with wide shoulders on each side. The center-distance between the runway and taxiway is , allowing simultaneous use by code E aircraft (such as Boeing 747). Værnes has a theoretical capacity of 40 air movements per hour, but this is reduced during bad weather, so the airport has a registered capacity of 25.

The airport also has a diagonal runway, which runs 14/32, roughly northwest–southeast. It is long, plus end section of on Runway 14 and on Runway 32. The runway is closed for traffic, in part because of bad asphalt quality. The current control tower is tall and dates from 2005.
===Military===

Værnes Air Station is one of two air stations in Central Norway, the other being Ørland Main Air Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at Værnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Trøndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located on the north side of the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. Værnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the main runway on the east side.

==History==
===Military establishment===

Værnes is first recorded in the tenth century as the seat for one of eight chieftains in Trøndelag. The first military activity in the area was as a base for leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at Værnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp. The first aircraft to use Værnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which took off on 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which Værnes was chosen as the initial station for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922, the grass field serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but an extension was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.
Værnes was surrendered to Luftwaffe on 9 April 1940, during the German occupation of Norway. On 24 April 350 civilians started construction at Værnes, and within a few days 2,000 people were hired. On 28 April, a new wooden runway was completed. The expansion was part of the plans for Festung Norwegen and was used as a bomber base for attacks on Northern Norway. By May, there were 200 aircraft stationed at Værnes. During the war, particularly in April 1940, the airport was subject to several bombings from the Royal Air Force (RAF). In June, work was started to clear the forests near the airport, and graves from the Viking Age were found. Construction was halted for several weeks while German and Norwegian archaeologists conducted research. In July, work started on building concrete runways, and by 1942 all three runways were finished. The east–west was made long, the north–south was made while the northwest–southeast was made long. A number of taxiways were also constructed and a branch line of the railway was built to the hangars. By 1945, Luftwaffe had built about 100 buildings at Værnes. The land expropriated was estimated at between . Luftwaffe had also finished the control tower that had been under construction since 1939.
After the war ended, the airport was initial taken over by the Royal Air Force, but they soon withdrew leaving the Norwegian military in charge. Numerous squadrons, including 332, 331 and 337 were stationed at Værnes in the post-war years. In 1952, the pilot school was moved to Værnes, but in 1954 Ørland Main Air Station became the main air force base in Central Norway, and the majority of the armed air forces (with the exception of the school) moved to Ørland.

===Previous airports===
Civilian aviation in Trøndelag started in 1937, when Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started seaplane services from Ilsvika and Jonsvannet in Trondheim. These were terminated during World War II, but taken up again by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Norwegian Air Force during the summer of 1945. They were terminated in November due to the weather and RAF&#x27;s withdrawal. The following year, DNL started services again, this time from Hommelvik. During winter, the route was not operated. The service was operated with a Short Sandringham flying boat to Oslo and Northern Norway, and a Junkers Ju 52 to Western Norway. The southbound and northbound Sandringhams and the Junkers all met at Hummelvik to exchange passengers. There was only room for two planes at the quay, so the third aircraft had to be anchored in the fjord. In 1947, the airport had 3,500 passengers. On 2 October 1948, the Bukkene Bruse Accident occurred, where a Sandringham aircraft crashed during landing, killing 19 people. In 1949, a reserve airport was built at Skogn, and people were transported from Hommelvik to Skogn along the Nordland Line in case the reserve airport was used. DNL became part of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1951—the last year it used Hommelvik. Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap continued to use Hommelvik for an additional year. Braathens SAFE started their route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Hamar Airport, Stafsberg and Røros Airport on 18 August 1953. However, they chose to operate their de Havilland Herons from Trondheim Airport, Lade, just a few kilometers outside of the city center, in days with clear weather. Braathens SAFE moved all services to Værnes in 1956.

===Civilian establishment===

After World War II, there was only general aviation at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport was used as a pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 1947–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.

The air traffic control at Værnes was established in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over the responsibility for the radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.

Prior to World War II, Heimdal had been proposed as a location for the primary airport for Trondheim. Construction had started with drainage and ground works, but this work was interrupted by the war. Because of the large investments made to Værnes by Luftwaffe, a commission was established in 1947 to look into if Værnes or Lade instead should be selected. The commission was unanimous in recommending Værnes, highlighting that the airport was of a sufficient size to handle all civilian and military needs in the foreseeable future, and emphasized the proximity to the railway and highway. However, the commission recommended that Heimdal and Lade be kept as possibilities for future expansion. When the issue was discussed in Parliament, several members of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications focused on the long distance to Trondheim, but the low investment needs (stipulated to NOK 1.3 million for necessary navigation and air control investments) convinced parliament, who passed legislation in favor of Værnes on 10 June 1952.
In 1956, NATO approved the plans for Værnes to be financed through its infrastructure investment plan, after rejecting proposals for Heimdal. The costs were estimated at NOK 27.4 million and would allow the runway to be extended to support jet aircraft. Such an extension had already been done at Ørland Main Air Station, but NATO wanted to have two military air station of such dimensions in Central Norway. The east–west runway was to be extended to ; initial proposals had called for the extension to occur on the east side, but the Ministry of Defence instead wanted the expansion of the fjord-side to reduce expropriation costs. This called for a complex civil engineering program, as the railway and highway would have to pass under the runway in tunnels and an artificial island would have to be built in the fjord and the mouth of the Stjørdal River be diverted.

SAS moved its seaplane services to Værnes in 1952, and two-year later started flying the route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Trondheim to Bodø Airport using Saab 90 Scandia aircraft. The first terminal was half a barracks located beside a military hangar. In 1956, Braathens SAFE moved its services from Lade to Værnes, making the terminal too small for the needs. The whole barracks was taken into use in 1958, doubling the area. Braathens SAFE initially served flights to Trondheim from Oslo Airport, Fornebu with stop-overs at Hamar Airport, Stafsberg, and from 1957 at Røros Airport, using de Havilland Heron aircraft. Concession for the route from Bergen via the new Ålesund Airport, Vigra to Trondheim was granted to Braathens SAFE from 1958. Braathens SAFE then also started using Fokker F-27 turboprops, at first on the Oslo-route, but later also on the West Coast route. When they were taken fully into use, the service to Hamar was terminated.
In 1957, parliament started a new process to consider Heimdal as the primary airport, in part because the airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration stated that they felt Værnes was insufficient. However, higher costs—due to bad ground conditions and existing infrastructure at Værnes, valuated at NOK 150 million—caused parliament to support Værnes. Construction of the new runway therefore commenced in January 1959, with the work subcontracted to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stjørdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway. Finally, the runway could be built on top, and construction completed on 21 October 1961. In 1963, the airport had 115,000 passengers, increasing to 195,000 the following year. That year, SAS started using the Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft on their route.

Parliament passed legislation for the construction of a new terminal in 1964, which opened on 5 December 1965. the following year, Widerøe started a seaplane route from Værnes to Namsos, Rørvik, Brønnøysund, Sandnessjøen, Mo i Rana and Bodø. To serve the seaplanes, a quay was established at Hell. On 1 July 1968, four airports in Helgeland opened: Namsos Airport, Høknesøra, Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy, Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka and Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvoll. These were served by Widerøe with the land planes de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. From 1 April 1967, Braathens SAFE was permitted to extend their West Coast service north to Bodø and Tromsø. Starting in 1969, Braathens introduced Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft on the Oslo services and Fokker F-28 jet aircraft on the West Coast services. In 1975, a third control tower was built, located right in front of (the yet to be built) Terminal A.
In 1976, charter planes started operating to Trondheim, after a barracks was rebuilt to facilitate a border control. Several plans for a larger terminal were made, but these were delayed. In the late 1970s, the tarmac was expanded and a new taxiway built. Braathens SAFE opened a new hangar in 1979. The third terminal opened as an extension of the old one in May 1982. It was and the old terminal was converted to a cafeteria. Due to a heavy increase in traffic, the new terminal quickly became too small. During 1985 and 1986, a major overhaul of the main runway was made; it was dismantled and a new foundation and surface was laid. A number of new military buildings were constructed, along with six stands for large cargo aircraft and a new fuel system. In 1988, smaller adjustments, including new washrooms and longer baggage belts, were installed at the terminal. From 1986, Braathens SAFE retired its Fokker F-28, and the West Coast route to Molde was subcontracted to Busy Bee, who started to serve Værnes with their Fokker F-27, and later Fokker 50, aircraft. In 1992, SAS Cargo built a facility. After Busy Bee&#x27;s bankruptcy, the regional services were taken over by Norwegian Air Shuttle from 22 January 1993.

===Fourth terminal and deregulation===
The fourth and current domestic terminal was opened on 15 November 1994. With of floor space it had seven gates, of which five had jetbridges. The two remaining gates were fitted with jetbridges in July 2012. Værnes became the first airport in the Nordic countries with a train station in the terminal, when Trondheim Airport Station opened. In March 1996, the old terminal was named Terminal B and all international flights were moved there. A new taxiway, which extended the full length of the runway, was opened in 1999, after more artificial land has been created and a second tunnel built for the highway and railway.
Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998, replacing the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens also saw the opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe in terms of the number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from Værnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion.

By April 2000, the number of services by the main airlines was reduced to less than the level before the opening of Gardermoen, with 75 daily departures. Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Widerøe had 20. Of Braathens&#x27; services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen. This was the last year that SAS used DC-9s to Trondheim, phasing in Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, supplemented by occasional MD-80s. Widerøe had 15 daily flights to STOLports in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord.
In 2002, SAS acquired Braathens, and the two companies coordinated their routes. All flights from Trondheim to Oslo-Gardermoen were taken over by SAS, who increased to 23 departures per day in each direction. This included a 30-minute headway from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 15:30 to 19:00. This made the route Trondheim–Oslo the busiest in the country. The routes northwards were taken over by Braathens, who increased to six daily trips to Bodø with connections northwards. The daily trip with Braathens to Harstad/Narvik was replaced by a two-round trips with SAS Commuter. Braathens retained the routes to the West Coast, with two flights to Ålesund and seven to Bergen. In addition, Norwegian Air Shuttle continued with two flights to Molde. In 2004, SAS and Braathens merged to form SAS Braathens. The airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007.

From 1 September 2002, Norwegian Air Shuttle converted from a regional airline to a low-cost carrier and started competing on the route to Oslo. From 5 May 2003, Norwegian started a daily domestic service to Tromsø, from 17 April 2004, they introduced two weekly services to Prague, Czech Republic, and from 26 June to Dubrovnik, Croatia. From 30 October, Norwegian introduced one weekly flight to Murcia, Spain, from 4 November, they introduced five weekly services to London Stansted Airport, United Kingdom. In 2005, Terminal B received a major upgrade, increasing the passenger area with . The airport was also rebuilt to 100% security control. The terminal received a new border control for flights to countries outside the Schengen Area and a duty-free store for both departing and arriving passengers. A new tall control tower was also built.
From 7 January 2006, Norwegian started a seasonal winter service to Salzburg, Austria; from 7 May 2006, they introduced one weekly service to Nice, France; On 1 April 2008, they started two weekly round trips to Warsaw, Poland; and from 1 June 2008, Norwegian introduced one daily evening flight to Bodø and Tromsø. In 2009, a new indoor parking lot opened, with a capacity of 1,200 cars. It replaced a site with 225 parking places and cost NOK 125 million. The same year saw the opening of the Radisson Blu hotel, costing NOK 220 million, and a new fire station for NOK 80 million. From 31 October 2009, Norwegian started a weekly service to Las Palmas, Spain. On 31 January 2010, SAS operated its last service to Molde. To compensate, the Molde-based Krohn Air was established to start flights between Værnes and Molde Airport, Årø on 3 February, using Dornier 328 aircraft operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia.
On 22 February 2010, Nextjet commenced two daily round trips to Åre Östersund Airport and Stockholm-Bromma Airport in Sweden. This connection ended during that year. Scandinavian already had flights to Stockholm. From 28 March 2010, Norwegian moved its three weekly services to London from Stansted to London Gatwick Airport. From 10 June to 30 August 2010, Icelandair operated two weekly services to their hub Keflavík International Airport using Boeing 757 aircraft.

Among international destinations operating in 2018 but not 2010 are Tallinn, Kraków and Gdańsk.

==Future==
In a master plan from 2006, Avinor has identified several key development issues to increase the capacity of the airport. For Terminal A, the plans call to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway and the outside having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, in part because of the lack of space in the area, although this can partially be fixed by removing the general aviation from the area.

At both ends of the runway, the taxiway ends from the start of the runway, forcing aircraft which need the full length to backtrack. An extension of the taxiways would help with this problem. Both at Terminal A and B, there will be a need for double taxiways. This will result in insufficient space for general aviation at its current location, and this has been proposed moved eastwards past the military installations. Several airlines, in particular Helitrans, has indicated need for more space. Proposals have been made to establish a heliport to allow flight to oil platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf. The military has suggested to fill in a large section of the river delta at the west end of the runway, and move some of the cargo and helicopter operations there, but environmental concerns have been raised by among others Avinor. The cost of establishing access to the artificial land is also high. By 2050, there may be need for a second, parallel runway to meet demand, and initial plans call for a runway which would be used by general aviation, regional airlines and helicopters.

Between 2009 and 2011, Avinor is extending the runway with into the fjord. The masses used for this are coming from the construction of the nearby Gevingåsen Tunnel on the Nordland Line, which will help shorten the travel time of the airport rail link to Trondheim and increase frequency. Once finished, the line may be electrified. Work has commenced on building the E6 northwards to a four-lane highway from Værnes past Stjørdal. This is scheduled for completion in 2013.

In 2016 some politicians suggested a name change to &quot;Hell International Airport&quot;, given that Æ could be less suitable in the name of an international airport with the same problem if using the name of municipality and nearby village of Stjørdal, so using the name of the nearest village Hell, which is easily writable on foreign keyboards, could be a good idea. A web vote on a newspaper site gave support for that. The name has not been changed (as of 2021), but in English the airport mostly call itself &quot;Trondheim Airport&quot;.

== Airlines and destinations ==

===Overview===
Widerøe is a regional airline and uses Dash 8 and Embraer E190 E2 aircraft to operate routes from south to north in Norway. Northwards, Widerøe uses Trondheim Airport as a hub to serve six airports in Nord-Trøndelag and Helgeland on public service obligation contracts with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. Scandinavian Airlines is the airline with the most domestic services to Trondheim. The main route is to its hub at Oslo; additional services are operated to Bergen, Bodø, Stavanger and Tromsø, all with Airbus A320, Embraer E195 and CRJ900 aircraft. Internationally, it provides seasonally weekly flight to Alicante and Split, daily to its hub in Stockholm and 2-3 times daily flights to its hub in Copenhagen. Norwegian Air Shuttle is a low-cost airline which operates the main domestic services to Bergen and Oslo, using Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. It provides a range of international flights. Most operate only a few times a week. Norwegian flies to eleven European destinations in eight countries.

KLM operates three daily flights to its hub at Amsterdam by its regional subsidiary KLM Cityhopper using Embraer E175/E190 and E195 E2 aircraft. Wizz Air operates 2-4 weekly international flights to Gdańsk using Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft. The airport is also served by numerous charter airlines.

Ground handling is provided by Aviator Airport Alliance, Widerøe Ground Handling.

==Accidents and incidents==
* Braathens SAFE Flight 139 occurred on 21 June 1985, when a Boeing 737-200 from Braathens SAFE en route from Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu was hijacked by a drunk student who demanded to talk to the prime minister and minister of justice. The plane landed at Fornebu, and the hijacker eventually surrendered his gun in exchange for more beer. No-one was injured in the incident.
* On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines landing at Værnes en route from Bodø Airport was written off after a hard landing on the runway. This was caused by a high sink rate caused by the pilot interrupting the landing checklist and forgetting to arm the spoilers. No-one was killed in the accident.
* On 14 October 2012 Corendon Airlines Flight 733, a Boeing 737-800 operating between Antalya Airport and Trondheim on a scheduled passenger flight, suffered a hull loss after the plane caught fire during pushback from the gate in Antalya. 27 passengers were injured during the evacuation. The cause was determined to be a short circuit in the captain&#x27;s cockpit panel near an oxygen tank.

<doc id="303386" wikidata="Q8264724" url="?curid=303386" title="Apoplexy">
<text>Apoplexy () refers to the rupture of an internal organ and the associated symptoms. Informally or metaphorically, the term &quot;apoplexy&quot; is associated with being furious, especially as &quot;apoplectic&quot;. Historically, it described what is now known as a hemorrhagic stroke, typically involving a ruptured blood vessel in the brain; modern medicine typically specifies the anatomical location of the bleeding, such as cerebral apoplexy, ovarian apoplexy, or pituitary apoplexy.

==Historical meaning==
From the late 14th to the late 19th century, the diagnosis &quot;apoplexy&quot; referred to any sudden death that began with abrupt loss of consciousness, especially when the victim died within seconds after losing consciousness. The word &quot;apoplexy&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the symptom of sudden loss of consciousness immediately preceding death. Strokes, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and even heart attacks were referred to as apoplexy in the past, because before the advent of biomedical science, the ability to differentiate abnormal conditions and diseased states was limited. Although physiology, as a medical field, dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates, until the late 19th century, physicians often had inadequate or inaccurate understandings of many of the human body&#x27;s normal functions and abnormal presentations. Hence, identifying a specific cause of a symptom or of death often proved difficult or impossible.

==Hemorrhage==
To specify the site of bleeding, the term &quot;apoplexy&quot; is often accompanied by a descriptive adjective. For instance, bleeding within the pituitary gland is termed &quot;pituitary apoplexy&quot;, and bleeding within the adrenal glands is referred to as &quot;adrenal apoplexy&quot;.

Apoplexy also includes hemorrhaging within the gland and accompanying neurological problems, such as confusion, headache, and impairment of consciousness.

Engineered by Delano “Rock” McLaurin and released on March 25, 1979, this song is often cited as the beginning of recorded hip hop music. The title refers to vocalist Tim Washington. A few months later, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; came out, which is widely regarded as the first commercially released hip hop song.

The song was originally the B-side of the 7-inch single, with the A-side &quot;You&#x27;re My Candy Sweet&quot; a mid-tempo disco song. However the song stalled at #67 after 4-weeks on the R&amp;B chart and was replaced the following week with &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot; on the chart. It peaked at #26 on the R&amp;B chart and stayed on for 11 weeks.

==Origins==
The origin of &quot;King Tim III&quot; starts when Bill was in his studio with his co-producer Jerry Thomas or as Bill called him &quot;his right hand man&quot;. Bill said to him &quot;Jerry, look at this album we doing , it&#x27;s the Bad Back Seven album.&quot; Jerry asks him what he want him to do and Curtis says &quot;I don&#x27;t know... let&#x27;s do a rap man!&quot; Jerry said the following sentence, &quot;Do a rap? Hell, we can&#x27;t even talk!&quot; Curtis recalls, &quot;One of the roaders is in the studio with us... Avery, and he said &quot;Hey man, I got a buddy who lives up there in the projects, he&#x27;s a great rapper.&quot;, and I said &quot;Can he rap?&quot; and he said, &quot;Yeah man!&quot; and I said &quot;Bring him in, tomorrow night.&quot; and he brought in Timothy Washington and I had to track him down 8 hours in Venice and everything. I flew him in on the trip and I said &quot;Hey man, go in there and start rapping.&quot; , and he just started rapping... and that&#x27;s how it all came about.&quot;

<text>Puabi (Akkadian: 𒅤𒀜 pu3-AD ), also called Shubad or Shudi-Ad due to a misinterpretation by Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, was an important woman in the Sumerian city of Ur, during the First Dynasty of Ur. Commonly labeled as a &quot;queen&quot;, her status is somewhat in dispute, although several cylinder seals in her tomb, labeled grave PG 800 at the Royal Cemetery at Ur, identify her by the title &quot;nin&quot; or &quot;eresh&quot;, a Sumerian word denoting a queen or a priestess. Puabi&#x27;s seal does not place her in relation to any king or husband, possibly indicating that she ruled in her own right. It has been suggested that she was the second wife of king Meskalamdug. Although little is known about Puabi&#x27;s life, the discovery of Puabi&#x27;s tomb and its death pit reveals important information as well as raises questions about Mesopotamian society and culture.

The meaning of Puabi&#x27;s name is uncertain, though it could perhaps mean &quot;word of my father&quot; or &quot;orchard of my father.&quot;

==Tomb of Puabi==
British archaeologist Leonard Woolley discovered the tomb of Puabi, which was excavated between 1922 and 1934 by a joint team sponsored by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The Woolley team included his wife and fellow archaeologist, Katharine, who drew the detailed diagrams of the site. Puabi&#x27;s tomb was found along with approximately 1,800 other graves at the Royal Cemetery at Ur. Puabi&#x27;s tomb was clearly unique among the other excavations, not only because of the large number of high-quality and well-preserved grave goods, but also because her tomb had been untouched by looters through the millennia. 

=== Objects in the tomb ===
The number of grave goods that Woolley uncovered in Puabi&#x27;s tomb was staggering. They included a heavy, golden headdress made of golden leaves, rings and plates; a superb lyre (see Lyres of Ur) complete with a golden and lapis lazuli-encrusted bearded bull&#x27;s head; a profusion of gold tableware; golden, carnelian, and lapis lazuli cylindrical beads used in extravagant necklaces and belts; a chariot adorned with lioness heads in silver, and an abundance of silver, lapis lazuli, and golden rings and bracelets, as well as her headdress, a belt made of gold rings, carnelian and lapis beads, and other various rings and earrings. Puabi&#x27;s headdress drew inspiration from nature in its floral motifs and is made up of gold ribbons and leaves, lapis and carnelian beads, and gold flowers.

=== The &quot;Death Pit&quot; ===
A number of &quot;death pits&quot; were also found outside of the chambers as well as above Puabi&#x27;s chamber, raising questions about the initial attribution of the death pits to Puabi specifically. The largest and most well-known death pit held 74 attendants, 6 men, and 68 women, all adorned with various gold, silver, and lapis decoration, and one woman who appeared to be more elaborately adorned than the others. She was buried with 52 attendants: servants, guards, lions, a horse, a chariot, and several other bodies—retainers who were suspected by excavator Leonard Woolley to have poisoned themselves (or to have been poisoned by others) to serve their mistress in the next world. In Puabi&#x27;s chamber, the remains of three other women were found, and these personal servants had minor adornments of their own. The pit found above Puabi&#x27;s chamber contained 21 attendants, an elaborate harp or lyre, a chariot, and what was left of a large chest of personal grooming items. Due to the location of the pits and general lack of evidence, it is largely unclear whether the death pits may be directly linked to Puabi.

=== Theories of cause of death ===
Evidence derived from CAT scans through the University of Pennsylvania Museum suggests that some of the sacrifices were likely violent and caused by blunt force trauma. A pointed, weighted tool could explain the shatter patterns on the skulls that resulted in death, while a small hammer-like tool was also found, retrieved, and catalogued by Woolley during his original excavation. The size and weight of the tool fit the damage sustained by the two bodies examined by Aubrey Baadsgaard, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Cinnabar, or mercury vapour residue, was observed as well, and it would have been used to prevent or slow the decomposition of the bodies until the completion of the necessary funerary rites.

==Remains==
Puabi&#x27;s physical remains, including pieces of her badly damaged skull, are kept in the Natural History Museum, London. The excavated finds from Woolley&#x27;s expedition were divided among the British Museum in London, the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia, and the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. Several pieces of the treasure were looted from the National Museum during the Iraq War in 2003. Several of the more spectacular pieces from Puabi&#x27;s grave were featured in a highly successful Art and History Museum tour through the United Kingdom and the United States.

<doc id="303398" wikidata="Q1475294" url="?curid=303398" title="Maximal and minimal elements">
<text>In mathematics, especially in order theory, a maximal element of a subset formula_1 of some preordered set is an element of formula_1 that is not smaller than any other element in formula_1. A minimal element of a subset formula_1 of some preordered set is defined dually as an element of formula_1 that is not greater than any other element in formula_1.

The notions of maximal and minimal elements are weaker than those of greatest element and least element which are also known, respectively, as maximum and minimum. The maximum of a subset formula_1 of a preordered set is an element of formula_1 which is greater than or equal to any other element of formula_9 and the minimum of formula_1 is again defined dually. In the particular case of a partially ordered set, while there can be at most one maximum and at most one minimum there may be multiple maximal or minimal elements. Specializing further to totally ordered sets, the notions of maximal element and maximum coincide, and the notions of minimal element and minimum coincide.

As an example, in the collection
formula_11
ordered by containment, the element {&quot;d&quot;, &quot;o&quot;} is minimal as it contains no sets in the collection, the element {&quot;g&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;d&quot;} is maximal as there are no sets in the collection which contain it, the element {&quot;d&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;g&quot;} is neither, and the element {&quot;o&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;f&quot;} is both minimal and maximal. By contrast, neither a maximum nor a minimum exists for formula_12

Zorn&#x27;s lemma states that every partially ordered set for which every totally ordered subset has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element. This lemma is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem and the axiom of choice and implies major results in other mathematical areas like the Hahn–Banach theorem, the Kirszbraun theorem, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, the existence of a Hamel basis for every vector space, and the existence of an algebraic closure for every field.

== Definition ==

Let formula_13 be a preordered set and let formula_14 is an element formula_15 such that 

:if formula_16 satisfies formula_17 then necessarily formula_18 

Similarly, is an element formula_15 such that 

:if formula_16 satisfies formula_21 then necessarily formula_22 

Equivalently, formula_15 is a minimal element of formula_1 with respect to formula_25 if and only if formula_26 is a maximal element of formula_1 with respect to formula_28 where by definition, formula_29 if and only if formula_30 (for all formula_31).

If the subset formula_1 is not specified then it should be assumed that formula_33 Explicitly, a (respectively, ) is a maximal (resp. minimal) element of formula_34 with respect to formula_35 

If the preordered set formula_13 also happens to be a partially ordered set (or more generally, if the restriction formula_37 is a partially ordered set) then formula_15 is a maximal element of formula_1 if and only if formula_1 contains no element strictly greater than formula_41 explicitly, this means that there does not exist any element formula_16 such that formula_43 and formula_44 
The characterization for minimal elements is obtained by using formula_45 in place of formula_35

== Existence and uniqueness ==
Maximal elements need not exist.

*Example 1: Let formula_47 where formula_48 denotes the real numbers. For all formula_49 formula_50 but formula_51 (that is, formula_43 but not formula_53). 
*Example 2: Let formula_54 where formula_55 denotes the rational numbers and where formula_56 is irrational.

In general formula_25 is only a partial order on formula_12 If formula_26 is a maximal element and formula_60 then it remains possible that neither formula_61 nor formula_22 This leaves open the possibility that there exist more than one maximal elements.

*Example 3: In the fence formula_63 all the formula_64 are minimal and all formula_65 are maximal, as shown in the image.
*Example 4: Let &quot;A&quot; be a set with at least two elements and let formula_66 be the subset of the power set formula_67 consisting of singleton subsets, partially ordered by formula_68 This is the discrete poset where no two elements are comparable and thus every element formula_69 is maximal (and minimal); moreover, for any distinct formula_70 neither formula_71 nor formula_72

== Greatest and least elements ==

For a partially ordered set formula_73 the irreflexive kernel of formula_25 is denoted as formula_75 and is defined by formula_76 if formula_77 and formula_78
For arbitrary members formula_79 exactly one of the following cases applies:
#formula_76;
#formula_81;
#formula_82;
#formula_83 and formula_84 are incomparable.
Given a subset formula_85 and some formula_86
* if case 1 never applies for any formula_87 then formula_83 is a maximal element of formula_9 as defined above; 
* if case 1 and 4 never applies for any formula_87 then formula_83 is called a of formula_12
Thus the definition of a greatest element is stronger than that of a maximal element.

Equivalently, a greatest element of a subset formula_1 can be defined as an element of formula_1 that is greater than every other element of formula_12 
A subset may have at most one greatest element.

The greatest element of formula_9 if it exists, is also a maximal element of formula_9 and the only one.
By contraposition, if formula_1 has several maximal elements, it cannot have a greatest element; see example 3.
If formula_99 satisfies the ascending chain condition, a subset formula_1 of formula_99 has a greatest element if, and only if, it has one maximal element.

When the restriction of formula_25 to formula_1 is a total order (formula_104 in the topmost picture is an example), then the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide. 
This is not a necessary condition: whenever formula_1 has a greatest element, the notions coincide, too, as stated above.
If the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide on every two-element subset formula_1 of formula_107 then formula_25 is a total order on formula_107

Dual to &quot;greatest&quot; is the notion of &quot;least element&quot; that relates to &quot;minimal&quot; in the same way as &quot;greatest&quot; to &quot;maximal&quot;.

== Directed sets ==
In a totally ordered set, the terms maximal element and greatest element coincide, which is why both terms are used interchangeably in fields like analysis where only total orders are considered. This observation applies not only to totally ordered subsets of any partially ordered set, but also to their order theoretic generalization via directed sets. In a directed set, every pair of elements (particularly pairs of incomparable elements) has a common upper bound within the set. If a directed set has a maximal element, it is also its greatest element, and hence its only maximal element. For a directed set without maximal or greatest elements, see examples 1 and 2 above.

Similar conclusions are true for minimal elements.

Further introductory information is found in the article on order theory.

== Properties ==
* Each finite nonempty subset formula_1 has both maximal and minimal elements. An infinite subset need not have any of them, for example, the integers formula_111 with the usual order.
* The set of maximal elements of a subset formula_1 is always an antichain, that is, no two different maximal elements of formula_1 are comparable. The same applies to minimal elements.

== Examples ==
* In Pareto efficiency, a Pareto optimum is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of Pareto improvement, and the set of maximal elements is called the Pareto frontier.
* In decision theory, an admissible decision rule is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of &quot;dominating decision rule.&quot;
* In modern portfolio theory, the set of maximal elements with respect to the product order on risk and return is called the efficient frontier.
* In set theory, a set is finite if and only if every non-empty family of subsets has a minimal element when ordered by the inclusion relation.
* In abstract algebra, the concept of a maximal common divisor is needed to generalize greatest common divisors to number systems in which the common divisors of a set of elements may have more than one maximal element.
* In computational geometry, the maxima of a point set are maximal with respect to the partial order of coordinatewise domination.

===Consumer theory===
In economics, one may relax the axiom of antisymmetry, using preorders (generally total preorders) instead of partial orders; the notion analogous to maximal element is very similar, but different terminology is used, as detailed below.

In consumer theory the consumption space is some set formula_114, usually the positive orthant of some vector space so that each formula_115 represents a quantity of consumption specified for each existing commodity in the
economy. Preferences of a consumer are usually represented by a total preorder formula_116 so that formula_117 and formula_118 reads: formula_83 is at most as preferred as formula_84. When formula_121 and formula_122 it is interpreted that the consumer is indifferent between formula_83 and formula_84 but is no reason to conclude that formula_125 preference relations are never assumed to be antisymmetric. In this context, for any formula_126 an element formula_127 is said to be a maximal element if
formula_128 implies formula_122
where it is interpreted as a consumption bundle that is not dominated by any other bundle in the sense that formula_130 that is formula_118 and not formula_132

It should be remarked that the formal definition looks very much like that of a greatest element for an ordered set. However, when formula_116 is only a preorder, an element formula_83 with the property above behaves very much like a maximal element in an ordering. For instance, a maximal element formula_127 is not unique for formula_122 does not preclude the possibility that formula_118 (while formula_122 and formula_118 do not imply formula_81 but simply indifference formula_141). The notion of greatest element for a preference preorder would be that of most preferred choice. That is, some formula_142 with
formula_128 implies formula_144

An obvious application is to the definition of demand correspondence. Let formula_99 be the class of functionals on formula_114. An element formula_147 is called a price functional or price system and maps every consumption bundle formula_115 into its market value formula_149. The budget correspondence is a correspondence formula_150 mapping any price system and any level of income into a subset
formula_151

The demand correspondence maps any price formula_152 and any level of income formula_26 into the set of formula_116-maximal elements of formula_155.
formula_156

It is called demand correspondence because the theory predicts that for formula_152 and formula_26 given, the rational choice of a consumer formula_159 will be some element formula_160

== Related notions ==
A subset formula_161 of a partially ordered set formula_99 is said to be cofinal if for every formula_163 there exists some formula_164 such that formula_165 Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set with maximal elements must contain all maximal elements.

A subset formula_166 of a partially ordered set formula_99 is said to be a lower set of formula_99 if it is downward closed: if formula_169 and formula_77 then formula_171 Every lower set formula_166 of a finite ordered set formula_99 is equal to the smallest lower set containing all maximal elements of formula_174

<doc id="303402" wikidata="Q336002" url="?curid=303402" title="Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury">
<text>Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury PC, FRS (22 July 1621 – 21 January 1683), was an English statesman and peer. He held senior political office under both the Commonwealth of England and Charles II, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1661 to 1672 and Lord Chancellor from 1672 to 1673. During the Exclusion Crisis, Shaftesbury headed the movement to bar the Catholic heir, James II, from the royal succession, which is often seen as the origin of the Whig party. He was also a patron of the political philosopher John Locke, with whom Shaftesbury collaborated with in writing the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina in 1669.

During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Shaftesbury initially supported the Royalists, before switching to the Parliamentarians in 1644. He served on the English Council of State under the Commonwealth, although he opposed Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s attempt to rule without Parliament during the Rule of the Major-Generals (1655–1657). He backed the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, and was raised to the peerage of England as Lord Ashley by Charles II. 

After the political fall in 1672 of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, Lord Ashley was created Earl of Shaftesbury and became one of five members of the so-called Cabal Ministry. In 1673, it became widely known that Charles&#x27; heir James had secretly converted to Catholicism. Like many English Protestants of the period, Shaftesbury saw Catholicism as closely linked to &quot;arbitrary government&quot;, and thus the prospect of a Catholic monarch as a threat to the rule of Parliament. 

His sponsorship of the Exclusion Bill in 1679 led to two years of political struggle, but ultimately ended in defeat. During the subsequent Tory reaction in 1681, Shaftesbury was arrested for high treason, a prosecution dropped several months later. Fearing re-arrest and execution, in 1682 he went into exile in Amsterdam, where he died in January 1683.

==Biography==

===Early life and first marriage, 1621–1640===

Cooper was the eldest son and successor of Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet, of Rockbourne in Hampshire, and his mother was the former Anne Ashley, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet. He was born on 22 July 1621, at the home of his maternal grandfather Sir Anthony Ashley in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset. He was named Anthony Ashley Cooper because of a promise the couple had made to Sir Anthony. 

Although Sir Anthony Ashley was of minor gentry stock, he had served as Secretary at War in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, and in 1622, two years after the death of his first wife, Sir Anthony Ashley married the 19-year-old Philippa Sheldon (51 years his junior), a relative of George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham, thus cementing relations with the most powerful man at court. 

Cooper&#x27;s father was created a baronet in 1622, and he represented Poole in the parliaments of 1625 and 1628, supporting the attack on Richard Neile, Bishop of Winchester, for his Arminian tendencies. Sir Anthony Ashley insisted that a man with Puritan leanings, Aaron Guerdon, be chosen as Cooper&#x27;s first tutor.

Cooper&#x27;s mother died in 1628. In the following year his father remarried, this time to the widowed Mary Moryson, one of the daughters of wealthy London textile merchant Baptist Hicks and co-heir of his fortune. Through his stepmother, Cooper thus gained an important political connection in the form of her grandson, the future 1st Earl of Essex. Cooper&#x27;s father died in 1630, leaving him a wealthy orphan. Upon his father&#x27;s death, he inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy and was now Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper.

Cooper&#x27;s father had held his lands in knight-service, so Cooper&#x27;s inheritance now came under the authority of the Court of Wards. The trustees whom his father had appointed to administer his estate, his brother-in-law (Anthony Ashley Cooper&#x27;s uncle by marriage) Edward Tooker and his colleague from the House of Commons, Sir Daniel Norton, purchased Cooper&#x27;s wardship from the king, but they remained unable to sell Cooper&#x27;s land without permission of the Court of Wards because, on his death, Sir John Cooper had left some £35,000 in gambling debts. 

The Court of Wards ordered the sale of the best of Sir John&#x27;s lands to pay his debts, with several sales commissioners picking up choice properties at £20,000 less than their market value, a circumstance which led Cooper to hate the Court of Wards as a corrupt institution.

Cooper was sent to live with his father&#x27;s trustee Sir Daniel Norton in Southwick, Hampshire (near Portsmouth). Norton had joined in Sir John Cooper&#x27;s denunciation of Arminianism in the 1628–29 parliament, and Norton chose a man with Puritan leanings named Fletcher as Cooper&#x27;s tutor.

Sir Daniel died in 1636, and Cooper was sent to live with his father&#x27;s other trustee, Edward Tooker, at Maddington, near Salisbury. Here his tutor was a man with an MA from Oriel College, Oxford.

Cooper matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 24 March 1637, aged 15, where he studied under its master, the Regius Professor of Divinity, John Prideaux, a Calvinist with vehemently anti-Arminian tendencies. While there he fomented a minor riot and left without taking a degree. In February 1638, Cooper was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he was exposed to the Puritan preaching of chaplains Edward Reynolds and Joseph Caryl.

On 25 February 1639, aged 19, Cooper married Margaret Coventry, daughter of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry, who was then serving as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal for Charles I. As Cooper was still a minor, the young couple moved into Lord Coventry&#x27;s residences of Durham House in the Strand, and at Canonbury House in Islington.

===Early political career, 1640–1660===

====Parliament, 1640–1642====

In March 1640, while still a minor, Cooper was elected Member of Parliament for the borough of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in the Short Parliament through the influence of Lord Coventry.

In October 1640, with opinion in the country swinging against the king&#x27;s supporters (including Coventry), Cooper was not asked to stand for election for Tewkesbury in the Long Parliament. He contested, and by some accounts, won a by-election to the seat of Downton in Wiltshire, but Denzil Holles, soon to rise to prominence as a leader of the opposition to the King and a personal rival of Sir Anthony, blocked Cooper&#x27;s admission to the Parliament. It was probably feared that Sir Anthony, as a result of his recent marriage to the daughter of the king&#x27;s Lord Keeper, would be too sympathetic to the king.

====Royalist, 1642–1644====
When the Civil War began in 1642, Cooper initially supported the King (somewhat echoing Holles&#x27; concerns). After a period of vacillating, he in summer 1643 at his own expense raised a regiment of foot and a troop of horse for the King, serving as their colonel and captain respectively. Following the Royalist victory at the Battle of Roundway Down on 13 July 1643, Cooper was one of three commissioners appointed to negotiate the surrender of Dorchester, at which he negotiated a deal whereby the town agreed to surrender in exchange for being spared plunder and punishment. However, troops under Prince Maurice soon arrived and plundered Dorchester and Weymouth anyway, leading to heated words between Cooper and Prince Maurice.

William Seymour, Marquess of Hertford, the commander of the Royalist forces in the west, had recommended Cooper be appointed governor of Weymouth and Portland, but Prince Maurice intervened to block the appointment, on grounds of Cooper&#x27;s youth and alleged inexperience. Cooper appealed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Edward Hyde; Hyde arranged a compromise whereby Cooper would be appointed as governor but resign as soon as it was possible to do so without losing face. Cooper was promised that upon resigning as governor, he would be made High Sheriff of Dorset and president of the council of war for Dorset, both of which were offices more prestigious than the governorship. Cooper spent the remainder of 1643 as governor of Weymouth and Portland.

====Parliamentarian and second marriage, 1644–1652====
In early 1644, Cooper resigned all of his posts under the king, and travelled to Hurst Castle, the headquarters of the Parliamentarians. Called before the Committee of Both Kingdoms, on 6 March 1644, he explained that he believed that Charles I was now being influenced by Roman Catholic influences (Catholics were increasingly prominent at Charles&#x27; court, and he had recently signed a truce with Irish Catholic rebels) and that he believed Charles had no intention of &quot;promoting or preserving ... the Protestant religion and the liberties of the kingdom&quot; and that he, therefore, believed the parliamentary cause was just, and he offered to take the Solemn League and Covenant.

In July 1644, the House of Commons gave Cooper permission to leave London, and he soon joined parliamentary forces in Dorset. After he participated in a campaign in August, parliament appointed him to the committee governing the army in Dorset. Cooper participated in fighting throughout 1644. However, in 1645, with the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance, Cooper chose to resign his commissions in the parliamentary army (which was, at any rate, being supplanted by the creation of the New Model Army) to preserve his claim to be the rightful member for Downton. He nevertheless continued to be active in the Dorset committee as a civil member.

It was during this period that Cooper first expressed an interest in overseas plantations, investing in a plantation in the English colony of Barbados in 1646.

Little is known of Cooper&#x27;s activities in the late 1640s. It is often assumed that he supported the Presbyterians against the Independents, and, as such, opposed the regicide of Charles I. Nevertheless, he was willing to work with the new regime, accepting a commission as justice of the peace for Wiltshire and Dorset in February 1649 and acting as High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1647. Furthermore, in February 1650, he not only took the oath of loyalty to the new regime but was a member of a commission that tendered the oath.

Cooper&#x27;s first wife, Margaret, died on 10 July 1649; the couple had had no children. Less than a year later, on 15 April 1650, Cooper remarried, to seventeen-year-old Lady Frances Cecil (1633–1652), daughter of David Cecil, 3rd Earl of Exeter. The couple had two children, one of whom, Anthony, lived to adulthood. Frances died on 31 December 1652, aged only 19.

===Statesman under the Commonwealth of England and the Protectorate, 1652–1660===
On 17 January 1652, the Rump Parliament appointed Cooper to the committee on law reform chaired by Sir Matthew Hale (the so-called Hale Commission, none of whose moderate proposals were ever enacted).

In March 1653, the Rump issued a full pardon for his time as a Royalist, opening the way for his return to public office. Following the dissolution of the Rump in April 1653, Oliver Cromwell and the Army Council nominated Cooper to serve in Barebone&#x27;s Parliament as member for Wiltshire. On 14 July, Cromwell appointed Cooper to the English Council of State, where he was a member of the Committee for the Business of the Law, which was intended to continue the reform work of the Hale Commission. Cooper aligned himself with the moderates in Barebone&#x27;s Parliament, voting against the abolition of tithes. He was one of the members who voted to dissolve Barebone&#x27;s Parliament on 12 December 1653 rather than acquiesce to the abolition of tithes.

When the Instrument of Government gave England a new constitution 4 days later, Cooper was again named to the Council of State. During the elections for the First Protectorate Parliament in summer 1654, Cooper headed a slate of ten candidates who stood in Wiltshire against 10 republican MPs headed by Edmund Ludlow. On the day of the election, so many voters turned up that the poll had to be switched from Wilton to Stonehenge. Cooper&#x27;s slate of candidates prevailed, although Ludlow alleged his party was in the majority. At the same election, Cooper was also elected MP for Tewkesbury and Poole but chose to sit for Wiltshire. Although Cooper was generally supportive of Cromwell during the First Protectorate Parliament (he voted in favour of making Cromwell king in December 1654), he grew worried that Cromwell was growing inclined to rule through the Army rather than through Parliament. This led Cooper to break with Cromwell: in early January 1655, he stopped attending Council and introduced a resolution in parliament making it illegal to collect or pay revenue not authorised by parliament. Cromwell dissolved this parliament on 22 January 1655.

The exiled Charles II, hearing of Cooper&#x27;s break with Cromwell, wrote to Cooper saying that he would pardon Cooper for fighting against the Crown if he would now help to bring about a restoration of the monarchy. Cooper did not respond, nor did he participate in the Penruddock uprising in March 1655.

On 30 August 1655, Cooper married his third wife, Margaret Spencer (1627–1693), daughter of William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton, and sister of Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland.

Cooper was again elected as a member for Wiltshire in the Second Protectorate Parliament, although when the parliament met on 17 September 1656, Cooper was one of 100 members whom the Council of State excluded from the parliament. Cooper was one of 65 excluded members to sign a petition protesting their exclusion that was delivered by Sir George Booth. Cooper eventually took his seat in the parliament on 20 January 1658, after Cromwell accepted an amended version of the Humble Petition and Advice that stipulated that the excluded members could return to parliament. Upon his return to the house, Cooper spoke out against Cromwell&#x27;s Other House.

Cooper was elected to the Third Protectorate Parliament in early 1659 as member for Wiltshire. During the debates in this parliament, Cooper sided with the republicans who opposed the Humble Petition and Advice and insisted that the bill recognising Richard Cromwell as Protector should limit his control over the militia and eliminate the protector&#x27;s ability to veto legislation. Cooper again spoke out against the Other House (consisting of new lords), and in favour of restoring the old House of Lords.

When Richard Cromwell dissolved parliament on 22 April 1659 and recalled the Rump Parliament (dissolved by Oliver Cromwell in 1653), Cooper attempted to revive his claim to sit as member for Downton. He was also re-appointed to the Council of State at this time. Throughout this period, many accused Cooper of harbouring royalist sympathies, but Cooper denied this. In August 1659, Cooper was arrested for complicity in Sir George Booth&#x27;s Presbyterian royalist uprising in Cheshire, but in September the Council found him not guilty of any involvement.

In October 1659, the New Model Army dissolved the Rump Parliament and replaced the Council of State with its own Committee of Safety. Cooper, republicans Sir Arthur Haselrig and Henry Neville and six other members of the Council of State continued to meet in secret, referring to themselves as the rightful Council of State. This secret Council of State came to see Sir George Monck, commander of the forces in Scotland, as the best hope to restore the Rump, and Cooper and Haselrig met with Monck&#x27;s commissioners, urging them to restore the Rump. Cooper was involved in several plots to launch pro-Rump uprisings. This proved unnecessary as, on 23 December 1659, troops resolved to stand by the Rump and the Council of State and disobey the Committee of Safety. The Rump Parliament reassembled on 26 December 1659, and on 2 January 1660, Cooper was elected to the Council of State. On 7 January 1659, a special committee reported back on the disputed 1640 Downton election and Cooper was finally allowed to take his seat as member for Downton.

Upon General Monck&#x27;s march into London, Monck was displeased that the Rump Parliament was not prepared to confirm him as commander-in-chief of the army. At Cooper&#x27;s urging, Monck&#x27;s troops marched into London, and Monck sent parliament a letter insisting that the vacant seats in the Rump Parliament be filled by by-elections. When the Rump insisted on placing restrictions on who could stand in these by-elections, Cooper urged Monck to insist instead on the return of the members of the Long Parliament excluded by Pride&#x27;s Purge, and Monck obliged on 21 February 1660. Two days later, the restored Long Parliament again elected Cooper to the Council of State. On 16 March 1660, the Long Parliament finally voted for its own dissolution.

Beginning in spring 1660, Cooper drew closer to the royalist cause. As late as mid-April, he appears to have favoured only a conditional restoration. In April 1660 he was re-elected MP for Wiltshire in the Convention Parliament. On 25 April he voted in favour of an unconditional restoration. On 8 May, the Convention Parliament appointed Cooper as one of twelve members to travel to The Hague to invite Charles II to return to England.

===Restoration politician, 1660–1683===
Cooper returned to England with Charles in late May. On the recommendation of General Monck and of Cooper&#x27;s wife&#x27;s uncle Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, Charles appointed Cooper to his Privy Council on 27 May 1660. Cooper took advantage of the Declaration of Breda and was formally pardoned for his support of the English Commonwealth on 27 June 1660. During this period, he helped reorganise the Privy Council&#x27;s committee on trade and plantations.

Cooper thus became a spokesman for the government in the Convention Parliament. However, during the debates on the Indemnity and Oblivion Bill, Cooper urged leniency for those who had sided with Parliament during the English Civil Wars or collaborated with the Cromwellian regime. He argued that only those individuals who had personal involvement in the decision to execute Charles I by participating in his trial and execution should be exempt from the general pardon. This view prevailed. After the Indemnity and Oblivion Act became law on 29 August 1660, Cooper sat on the special commission that tried the regicides, and in this capacity took part in sentencing to death several colleagues with whom he had collaborated during the years of the English Interregnum, including Hugh Peters, Thomas Harrison, and Thomas Scot. As a long-time foe of the Court of Wards, during the debate on the Tenures Abolition Bill, Cooper supported continuing the excise imposed by the Long Parliament to compensate the crown for the loss of revenues associated with the abolition of the court.

On 20 April 1661, three days before his coronation at Westminster Abbey, Charles II announced his coronation honours, and in those honours, he created Cooper Baron Ashley, of Wimborne St Giles.

====Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1661–1672====
Following the coronation, the Cavalier Parliament met beginning on 8 May 1661. Lord Ashley took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 May. On 11 May, the king appointed Ashley as his Chancellor of the Exchequer and under-treasurer (Southampton, Ashley&#x27;s uncle by marriage, was at the time Lord High Treasurer).

In 1661–1662, Ashley opposed Charles&#x27; marriage to Catherine of Braganza because the marriage would involve supporting the Portuguese, and Portugal&#x27;s ally France, in Portugal&#x27;s struggle against Spain. Ashley was opposed to a policy that moved England into the French orbit. During this debate, Ashley opposed the policy engineered by Charles&#x27; Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Clarendon, thus beginning what would prove to be a long-running political rivalry with Clarendon.

When the Cavalier Parliament set about enacting the Clarendon Code, Ashley supported a policy of moderation towards Protestant dissenters. In July 1662, Ashley sponsored an amendment to the Act of Uniformity that would have allowed Protestant Nonconformists to allow for late subscription, giving moderate dissenters an additional opportunity to conform. In the latter half of 1662, Ashley joined Sir Henry Bennet, the Earl of Bristol, and Lord Robartes in urging Charles to dispense peaceable Protestant Nonconformists and loyal Catholics from the Act of Uniformity. This led to Charles issuing his first Declaration of Indulgence on 26 December 1662. The Cavalier Parliament forced Charles to withdraw this declaration in February 1663. Ashley then supported Lord Robartes&#x27; Dispensing Bill, which would have dispensed Protestant Nonconformists, but not Catholics, from the Act of Uniformity. During the debate on the Dispensing Bill in the House of Lords, Ashley criticised Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, Charles&#x27; Lord Chancellor, for opposing the royal prerogative to dispense with laws. Clarendon remarked that in his opinion, the declaration was &quot;Ship-Money in religion&quot;. The king looked favourably on Ashley&#x27;s remarks and was displeased by Clarendon&#x27;s.

In May 1663, Ashley was one of eight Lords Proprietors (Lord Clarendon was one of the others) given title to a huge tract of land in North America, which eventually became the Province of Carolina, named in honour of King Charles. Ashley and his assistant John Locke drafted a plan for the colony known as the Grand Model, which included the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina and a framework for settlement and development.

By early 1664, Ashley was a member of the circle of John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, who ranged themselves in opposition to Lord Clarendon.

During the debate on the Conventicle Bill in May 1664, Ashley proposed mitigating the harshness of the penalties initially suggested by the House of Commons.

Throughout late 1664 and 1665, Ashley was increasingly in the royal favour. For example, in August 1665, the king paid a surprise visit to Ashley at Wimborne St Giles, and, during a later visit, introduced Ashley to his illegitimate son James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth.

The Second Anglo–Dutch War began on 4 March 1665 after a Royal Navy squadron seized the Dutch colony of New Netherland. During the parliamentary session of October 1665, Sir George Downing proposed that the use of funds voted to the crown should be restricted to the sole purpose of carrying on the war. Ashley opposed this proposal on the grounds that crown ministers should have flexibility in deciding how to use money received from parliamentary taxation.

During the 1666–1667 parliamentary session Ashley supported the Irish Cattle Bill, introduced by the Duke of Buckingham, which sought to prevent the importation of Irish cattle into England. During the course of this debate, Ashley attacked Charles&#x27; Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. He suggested that Irish peers such as Ormonde should have no precedence over English commoners. The debate over the Irish Cattle Bill marks the first time that Ashley began to break with the court over an issue of policy.

In October 1666, Ashley met John Locke, who would in time become his personal secretary. Ashley had gone to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. There he was impressed with Locke, and persuaded him to become part of his retinue. Locke had been looking for a career, and in spring 1667 moved into Ashley&#x27;s home at Exeter House in London, ostensibly as the household physician. Beginning in 1667, Shaftesbury and Locke worked closely on the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina and its centrepiece, the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina.

When Southampton died in May 1667, Ashley, as under-treasurer, was expected to succeed Southampton as Lord High Treasurer. King Charles, however, decided to replace Southampton with a nine-man Commission of the Treasury, headed by the Duke of Albemarle as First Lord of the Treasury. Ashley was named as one of the nine Treasury Commissioners at this time.

The failures of the English during the Second Anglo-Dutch War led Charles II to lose faith in the Earl of Clarendon, who was dismissed as Lord Chancellor on 31 August 1667. The court then moved to impeach Clarendon, and was supported in this by many of Ashley&#x27;s former political allies (including the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Bristol, and Sir Henry Bennett, who by this point had been created Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington). Ashley, however, refused to join in the fight against Clarendon, opposing a motion to have Clarendon committed to the Tower of London on a charge of treason. In 1667, Ashley was a signatory to &quot;The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa&quot;, a document published in 1667 which led to the creation of the Royal Africa Company. 

After the fall of Lord Clarendon in 1667, Lord Ashley became a prominent member of the Cabal, in which he formed the second &quot;A&quot;. Although the term &quot;Cabal Ministry&quot; is used by historians, in reality, the five members of the Cabal (Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale) never formed a coherent ministerial team. In the period immediately after the fall of Clarendon, the government was dominated by Arlington and Buckingham, and Ashley was out of royal favour and not admitted to the most powerful group of royal advisors, the Privy Council&#x27;s committee on foreign affairs. Nevertheless, Ashley joined Arlington and Buckingham, as well as John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, in introducing government-backed bills in October 1667 and February 1668 to include moderate dissenters within the Church of England. Nothing came of these bills, however. In January 1668, the Privy Council&#x27;s committees were reorganised, but Ashley retained a prominent position on the committee for trade and plantations.

In May 1668, Ashley became ill, apparently with a hydatid cyst. His secretary, John Locke, recommended an operation that almost certainly saved Ashley&#x27;s life and Ashley was grateful to Locke for the rest of his life. As part of the operation, a tube was inserted to drain fluid from the abscess, and after the operation, the physician left the tube in the body, and installed a copper tap to allow for possible future drainage. In later years, this would be the occasion for his Tory enemies to dub him &quot;Tapski&quot;, with the Polish ending because Tories accused him of wanting to make England an elective monarchy like the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1669, Ashley supported Arlington and Buckingham&#x27;s proposal for a political union of England with the Kingdom of Scotland, although this proposal foundered when the Scottish insisted on equal representation with the English in parliament. Ashley probably did not support the Conventicles Act 1670, but he did not sign the formal protest against the passage of the act either.

Ashley, in his role as one of the eight Lords Proprietor of the Province of Carolina, along with his secretary, John Locke, drafted the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which were adopted by the eight Lords Proprietor in March 1669.

By this point, it had become obvious that the queen, Catherine of Braganza, was barren and would never produce an heir, making the king&#x27;s brother, James, Duke of York heir to the throne, which worried Ashley because he suspected that James was a Roman Catholic. Ashley and Buckingham urged Charles to declare his illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth, legitimate, as did Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle. When it became clear that the king would not do so, they urged him to divorce Catherine and remarry. This was the background to the famous Roos divorce case: John Manners, Lord Roos had obtained a separation from bed and board from his wife in 1663, after he discovered she was committing adultery, and he had also been granted a divorce by an ecclesiastical court and had Lady Roos&#x27; children declared illegitimate. In March 1670, Lord Roos asked Parliament to allow him to remarry. The debate on the Roos divorce bill became politically charged because it impacted on whether Parliament could legally allow Charles to remarry. During the debate, Ashley spoke out strongly in favour of the Roos divorce bill, arguing that marriage was a civil contract, not a sacrament. Parliament ultimately gave Lord Roos permission to remarry, but Charles II never attempted to divorce his wife.

Ashley did not know about the Secret Treaty of Dover, arranged by Charles II&#x27;s sister Henrietta Anne Stuart and signed on 22 May 1670, whereby Charles II concluded an alliance with Louis XIV of France against the Dutch Republic. Under the terms of the Secret Treaty of Dover, Charles would receive an annual subsidy from France (to enable him to govern without calling a parliament) in exchange for a promise that he would convert to Catholicism and re-Catholicize England at an unspecified future date. Of the members of the Cabal, only Arlington and Clifford were aware of the Catholic Clauses contained in the Secret Treaty of Dover. For the benefit of Ashley, Buckingham, and Lauderdale, Charles II arranged a mock treaty (&quot;traité simulé&quot;) concluding an alliance with France. Although he was suspicious of France, Ashley was also wary of Dutch commercial competition, and he, therefore, signed the mock Treaty of Dover on 21 December 1670.

Throughout 1671, Ashley argued in favour of reducing the duty on sugar imports, arguing that the duty would have an adverse effect on colonial sugar planters.

In September 1671, Ashley and Clifford oversaw a massive reform of England&#x27;s customs system, whereby customs farmers were replaced with royal commissioners responsible for collecting customs. This change was ultimately to the benefit of the crown, but it caused a short-term loss of revenues that led to the Great Stop of the Exchequer. Ashley was widely blamed for the Great Stop of the Exchequer, although Clifford was the chief advocate of stopping the exchequer and Ashley in fact opposed the move.

In early 1672, with the Third Anglo–Dutch War looming, many in the government feared that Protestant dissenters in England would form a fifth column and support their Dutch co-religionists against England. In an attempt to conciliate the Nonconformists, on 15 March 1672, Charles II issued his Royal Declaration of Indulgence, suspending the penal laws that punished non-attendance at Church of England services. Ashley strongly supported this Declaration.

According to the terms of the Treaty of Dover, England declared war on the Dutch Republic on 7 April 1672, thus launching the Third Anglo-Dutch War. To accompany the commencement of the war, Charles issued a new round of honours, as part of which Ashley was named Earl of Shaftesbury and Baron Cooper on 23 April 1672.

In autumn 1672, Shaftesbury played a key role in setting up the Bahamas Adventurers&#x27; Company.

====Lord Chancellor, 1672–1673====
On 17 November 1672, the king named Shaftesbury Lord Chancellor of England, with Sir John Duncombe replacing Shaftesbury as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Shaftesbury was the last person without any training in the common law to be appointed to that position (until the appointment of Liz Truss in 2016). As Lord Chancellor, he addressed the opening of a new session of the Cavalier Parliament on 4 February 1673, calling on parliament to vote funds sufficient to carry out the war, arguing that the Dutch were the enemy of the monarchy and England&#x27;s only major trade rival, and therefore had to be destroyed (at one point he exclaimed &quot;Delenda est Carthago&quot;); defending the Great Stop of the Exchequer; and arguing in support of the Royal Declaration of Indulgence.

Shaftesbury was not, however, well received by the House of Commons. One of Shaftesbury&#x27;s old Dorset rivals, Colonel Giles Strangways, led an attack on writs of election that Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury had issued to fill 36 vacant seats in the House of Commons; Strangways argued that Shaftesbury was attempting to pack the Commons with his supporters and that only the Speaker of the House could issue writs to fill the vacant seats. The House of Commons agreed with Strangways and declared the elections void and the seats vacant. Furthermore, the Commons attacked the Declaration of Indulgence and demanded its withdrawal. Charles ultimately withdrew the address and cancelled the Declaration of Indulgence.

The Commons then passed an address condemning the growth of popery in England. To shore up the Protestantism of the nation, Parliament passed the Test Act 1673, which became law on 20 March 1673. The Test Act required all holders of civil and military office in England to take communion in the Church of England at least once a year and to make a declaration renouncing the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. Shaftesbury supported the Test Act, and, alongside James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, received the sacrament at St Clement Danes, with John Locke serving as the legal witness for each man&#x27;s conformity with the Test Act. In March 1673, Shaftesbury supported a bill for easing the plight of the Protestant dissenters in England, but nothing came of this bill.

Following the failure of the Declaration of Indulgence and the passage of the Test Act, it was obvious to all that the Cabal Ministry&#x27;s days were numbered. Shaftesbury moved closer to the parliamentary opposition during this period, and became a supporter of ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

The Duke of York failed to take the Anglican sacrament at Easter 1673, further heightening Shaftesbury&#x27;s concern that he was secretly a Catholic. Shaftesbury was initially mollified by the fact that both of the Duke of York&#x27;s daughters, Mary and Anne, were committed Protestants. However, in autumn 1673, the Duke of York married the Catholic Mary of Modena by proxy, thus raising the possibility that James might have a son who would succeed to the throne ahead of Mary and Anne and thus give rise to a succession of Catholic monarchs. York urged the king to prorogue parliament before it could vote on a motion condemning his marriage to Mary of Modena, but Shaftesbury used procedural techniques in the House of Lords to ensure that parliament continued sitting long enough to allow the House of Commons to pass a motion condemning the match. Shaftesbury, Arlington, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, and Henry Coventry all urged Charles II to divorce Catherine of Braganza and remarry a Protestant princess. York began denouncing Shaftesbury to Charles II, and Charles II decided to remove Shaftesbury from his post as Lord Chancellor. On 9 November 1673, Henry Coventry travelled to Exeter House to inform Shaftesbury that he was relieved of his post as Lord Chancellor, but also issuing him a royal pardon for all crimes committed before 5 November 1673.

====Opposition to Catholicism and break with Charles II, 1673–1674====

Following Shaftesbury&#x27;s fall from royal favour, Arlington attempted to effect a reconciliation, in November 1673 convincing the French ambassador to offer Shaftesbury a bribe in exchange for supporting the French party at court. Shaftesbury refused this offer, saying he could never support &quot;an interest that was so apparently destructive to [England&#x27;s] religion and trade&quot;. Instead, he allied himself with the Spanish party at court, and urged peace with the Netherlands. He also continued to urge the king to divorce and remarry.

In the session of the Cavalier Parliament that began on 7 January 1674, Shaftesbury led the charge to keep England free from popery. He coordinated his efforts with a group of other peers who were displeased with the possibility of a Catholic succession; this group met at the home of Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles, and included Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, Thomas Belasyse, 2nd Viscount Fauconberg, James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and George Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. On 8 January 1674, Shaftesbury gave a speech in the House of Lords warning that the 16,000 Catholics living in London were on the verge of rebellion, which caused the Lords to pass an address expelling all Catholics from within 10 miles of London. On 12 January, he introduced a measure that would require every peer, including the Duke of York, to take the Oath of Allegiance renouncing the pope and recognising the royal supremacy in the church (the oath was first required by the Popish Recusants Act 1605). On 24 January, the Earl of Salisbury introduced a bill requiring that any children of the Duke of York should be raised as Protestants. His proposed legislation further provided that neither the king nor any prince of the blood could marry a Catholic without parliamentary consent, on pain of being excluded from the royal succession. Shaftesbury spoke forcefully in favour of Salisbury&#x27;s proposal; he was opposed by the bishops and Lord Finch. By February, the opposition lords were considering accusing the Duke of York of high treason, which resulted in the king proroguing parliament on 24 February to protect his brother.

Shaftesbury&#x27;s actions in the 1674 session further angered Charles II; on 19 May 1674, Shaftesbury was expelled from the Privy Council, and subsequently sacked as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset and ordered to leave London.

====Leader of Opposition to Danby, 1674–1678====

Charles II now turned to Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby. Danby proceeded to freeze out peers who had collaborated during the Cromwellian regime and promoted former royalists. Danby was a champion of the Church of England who favoured strict interpretation of the penal laws against both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists.

On 3 February 1675, Shaftesbury wrote a letter to Carlisle in which he argued that the king needed to dissolve the Cavalier Parliament, which had been elected in early 1661, and call fresh elections. He argued that frequent parliamentary elections were in the best interest of both the crown and the people of England. This letter circulated widely in manuscript form.

The Duke of York was opposed to Danby&#x27;s strict enforcement of the penal laws against Catholics, and by April 1675, he had reached out to Shaftesbury to make a truce between them whereby they would be united in opposition to Danby&#x27;s brand of Anglican royalism. In late April 1675, Danby introduced a Test Oath by which all holding office or seats in either House of Parliament were to declare resistance to the royal power a crime, and promise to abstain from all attempts to alter the government of either church or state. Shaftesbury led the parliamentary opposition to Danby&#x27;s Test Bill, arguing that, under certain circumstances, it was lawful to resist the king&#x27;s ministers, and that, as in the case of the Protestant Reformation, it was sometimes necessary to alter the church so as to restore it.

In spite of Shaftesbury&#x27;s eloquence, his view remained the minority view in the parliament, forcing the king to prorogue parliament on 9 June 1675 to avoid the passage of the bill. The Duke of York, grateful for Shaftesbury&#x27;s assistance in the debate against Danby&#x27;s bill, now attempted to reconcile Shaftesbury with the king, and Shaftesbury was admitted to kiss the king&#x27;s hand on 13 June 1675. This, however, angered Danby, who intervened with the king, and on 24 June, the king again ordered Shaftesbury to leave court.

In 1675, following the death of Sir Giles Strangways, MP for Dorset, Shaftesbury initially endorsed Lord Digby, son of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, for the seat but, upon learning that Digby was a strong supporter of the court, he decided to back Thomas Moore, who was the chief supporter of conventicles in the county. This led to Shaftesbury making an enemy of both Digby and Bristol, who accused him of supporting sedition and faction and wanting a return of the English Commonwealth.

In the summer of 1675, Shaftesbury wrote a 15,000-word pamphlet entitled &quot;A Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend in the Country&quot; denouncing Danby&#x27;s Test Bill. (Shaftesbury&#x27;s secretary, John Locke, appears to have played a role in drafting the &quot;Letter&quot;, although whether solely as amanuensis or in a more active role, perhaps even as ghostwriter, remains unclear.) The &quot;Letter&quot; argued that since the time of the Restoration, &quot;the High Episcopal Man, and the Old Cavalier&quot; (now led by Danby) had conspired to make &quot;the Government absolute and arbitrary.&quot; According to the &quot;Letter&quot;, this (Church) party was attempting to establish divine right monarchy and divine right episcopacy, meaning that neither the king nor the bishops could be constrained by the rule of law. Religion was the overwhelming concern of the Letter, especially the attack upon Protestant freedoms occurring in England. By allying with the monarchy the old Cavaliers would achieve &#x27;the aims of the high church through the Act of Uniformity (1662)&#x27;, threatening dissenters with the Declaration of Indulgence.

Danby&#x27;s Test Oath proposal was merely the latest, most nefarious attempt to introduce divine right monarchy and episcopacy on the country. The Letter went on to describe the debates of the House of Lords during the last session, setting forth the arguments that Shaftesbury and other lords used in opposition to Danby and the bishops. This letter was published anonymously in November 1675, and quickly became a best-seller, in no small part because it was one of the first books ever to inform the public about the debates that occurred within the House of Lords.

Shaftesbury repeated the accusations of the &quot;Letter from a Person of Quality&quot; on the floor of the House of Lords during the parliamentary session of October–November 1675. During the debate on the case of &quot;Shirley v. Fagg&quot;, a jurisdictional dispute about whether the House of Lords could hear appeals from lower courts when the case involved members of the House of Commons, Shaftesbury gave a celebrated speech on 20 October 1675. He argued that Danby and the bishops were attempting to neuter the power of the House of Lords. 

Shaftesbury argued that every king could only rule either through the nobility or through a standing army; thus, this attempt to restrict the power of the nobility was part of a plot to rule the country through a standing army. He argued that the bishops believed that the king was king by divine right, not by law and that, if the bishops&#x27; propositions were taken to their logical conclusion, &quot;our Magna Charta is of no force, our Laws are but Rules amongst our selves during the Kings pleasure&quot; and &quot;All the Properties and Liberties of the People, are to give away, not onley to the interest, but the will and pleasure of the Crown&quot;. Shaftesbury&#x27;s concerns were rooted in his Civil War and Commonwealth experiences, in which he believed that Cromwell&#x27;s reliance upon the army to assert his authority had been tyrannical. Moreover, the use of the army during that period had engendered a &quot;mechanic tyranny&quot; that enabled popular elements (within the army) to pull England towards democratic power: something to be feared and avoided.

On 20 November 1675, Shaftesbury seconded a motion by Charles Mohun, 3rd Baron Mohun of Okehampton calling on the king to end the dispute of &quot;Shirley v. Fagg&quot; by dissolving parliament. This motion, which was supported by the Duke of York and the Catholic peers, was defeated by a vote of 50–48, prompting Shaftesbury and 21 other peers to enter a protest on the grounds that &quot;according to the ancient Lawes and Statutes of this Realm ... there should be frequent and new Parliaments&quot; and that the House of Commons was being unnecessarily obstructionist. Parliament was prorogued on 22 November 1675, with the prorogation saying that parliament would not sit again until 15 February 1677. Shortly thereafter, there appeared a pamphlet entitled &quot;Two Seasonable Discourses Concerning the Present Parliament&quot;, that argued that the king should call a new parliament because a new parliament would vote the king money, preserve the Church of England, introduce religious toleration for the Nonconformists, and deliver Catholics from the penal laws in an exchange for Catholics being deprived of access to court, holding office, and the right to bear arms.

In mid-February 1676, Charles sent his Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Sir Joseph Williamson to tell Shaftesbury to leave town. Shaftesbury refused and continued to receive visits at Exeter House from opposition MPs and other discontented elements. Danby argued that Charles should order Shaftesbury arrested and sent to the Tower of London, but Sir Joseph Williamson refused to sign the warrant. In this period, Shaftesbury relocated from Exeter House to the less expensive Thanet House.

On 24 June 1676, during the election of the Sheriffs of the City of London at the Guildhall, linen draper Francis Jenks gave a sensational speech arguing that two statutes from the reign of Edward III required that parliament sit every year, and that by proroguing the Cavalier Parliament until 15 February 1677 (meaning no session would be held in 1676 at all), the king had inadvertently dissolved parliament and that the Cavalier Parliament was now legally dissolved. Although Buckingham, not Shaftesbury, was behind Jenks&#x27; speech, many suspected Shaftesbury&#x27;s involvement; after Jenks&#x27; speech, Shaftesbury decided to take full advantage of the argument, arranging with his allies for a number of pamphlets arguing the case. One of these pamphlets, &quot;Some considerations upon the question, whether the parliament is dissolved, by its prorogation for 15 months?&quot; argued that parliament had the authority to restrict the royal prerogative and could even &quot;bind, limit, restrain and govern the Descent and Inheritance of the Crown it self.&quot; The Duke of York was furious at the inclusion of this argument; Buckingham told York that Shaftesbury had drafted the controversial passage, but Shaftesbury claimed that the passage was inserted in the pamphlet without his knowledge.

When parliament finally met on 15 February 1677, Buckingham, backed by Shaftesbury, Salisbury, and Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton, introduced a motion declaring that, because of the 15-month prorogation, on the basis of the statutes from the reign of Edward III, no parliament was legally in existence. Parliament not only rejected this argument, but also resolved that the four peers had committed Contempt of Parliament and should apologise. When the four refused, they were committed to the Tower of London. Shaftesbury petitioned for his release, and in June 1677, brought a writ of habeas corpus before the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. The court, however, determined that it lacked jurisdiction because Parliament, a superior court, was currently in session. Charles ordered Buckingham, Salisbury, and Wharton released from the Tower shortly thereafter, but Shaftesbury continued to refuse to apologise. Shaftesbury had grown increasingly suspicious of Charles II. Charles had begun raising an army, ostensibly for war with France, but Shaftesbury worried that Charles was really preparing to abolish parliament and rule the country with a standing army on the model of Louis XIV of France. It was not until 25 February 1678 that Shaftesbury finally apologised to the king and to parliament for his support of the motion in the House of Lords and for bringing a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; against Parliament.

With war with France looming, in March 1678, Shaftesbury, Buckingham, Holles, and Halifax spoke out in favour of immediately declaring war on France. Charles delayed declaring war, however, leading Shaftesbury to support a resolution of the House of Commons providing for immediately disbanding the army that Charles was raising. Charles prorogued parliament on 25 June, but the army was not disbanded, which worried Shaftesbury.

In August and September 1678, Titus Oates made accusations that there was a Popish Plot to assassinate the king, overthrow the government, and massacre English Protestants. It was later revealed that Oates had simply made up most of the details of the plot, and that there was no elaborate Popish Plot. However, when Parliament re-convened on 21 October 1678, Oates had not yet been discredited and the Popish Plot was the major topic of concern. Shaftesbury was a member of all the important committees of the House of Lords designed to combat the Popish Plot. On 2 November 1678, he introduced a motion demanding that the Duke of York be removed from the king&#x27;s presence, although this motion was never voted on. He supported the Test Act 1678, which required that all peers and members of the House of Commons should make a declaration against transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass, effectively excluding all Catholics from Parliament. Oates had accused the queen, Catherine of Braganza, of involvement in the Popish Plot, leading the House of Commons to pass a resolution calling for the queen and her retinue to be removed from court; when the House of Lords rejected this resolution, Shaftesbury entered a formal protest. Shaftesbury was now gaining a great reputation amongst the common people as a Protestant hero. On 9 November 1678, Charles promised that he would sign any bill that would make them safe during the reign of his successor, so long as they did not impeach the right of his successor; this speech was widely misreported as Charles&#x27; having agreed to name the Duke of Monmouth as his successor, leading to celebratory bonfires throughout London, with crowds drinking the health of &quot;the King, the Duke of Monmouth, and Earl of Shaftesbury, as the only three pillars of all safety&quot;. The citizens of London, fearing a Catholic plot on Shaftesbury&#x27;s life, paid for a special guard to protect him.

In December 1678, discussion turned to impeaching the Earl of Danby, and, to protect his minister, Charles II prorogued parliament on 30 December 1678. On 24 January 1679, Charles II finally dissolved the Cavalier Parliament, which had sat for 18 years.

====The Exclusion Crisis and the birth of the Whig Party, 1679–1683====

=====The Habeas Corpus Parliament, 1679=====
In February 1679, elections were held for a new parliament, known to history as the Habeas Corpus Parliament. In preparation for this parliament, Shaftesbury drew up a list of members of the House of Commons in which he estimated that 32% of the members were friends of the court, 61% favoured the opposition, and 7% could go either way. He also drafted a pamphlet that was never published, entitled &quot;The Present State of the Kingdom&quot;: in this pamphlet, Shaftesbury expressed concern about the power of France, the Popish Plot, and the bad influence exerted on the king by Danby, the royal mistress Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth (a Catholic), and the Duke of York, who according to Shaftesbury was now attempting &quot;to introduce a military and arbitrary government in his brother&#x27;s time&quot;. 

The new parliament met on 6 March 1679, and on 25 March, Shaftesbury delivered a dramatic address in the House of Lords in which he warned of the threat of popery and arbitrary government; denounced the royal administration in Scotland under John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, and that in Ireland under James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde; and loudly denounced the policies of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby in England. Shaftesbury supported the House of Commons when it introduced a Bill of Attainder against Danby, and voted in favour of the bill in the House of Lords on 14 April 1679. Shaftesbury attempted to neutralise the influence of the episcopal bench in favour of Danby by introducing a bill moving that the bishops should not be able to sit in the House of Lords during capital trials.

=====Lord President of the Council, 1679=====
Charles II thought that Shaftesbury was mainly angry because he had been out of royal favour for long, and hoped that he could rein Shaftesbury in by naming him Lord President of the Council on 21 April 1679, with a salary of £4,000 a year. Soon, however, Shaftesbury made it clear that he could not be bought off. During meetings of the now-reconstituted Privy Council, Shaftesbury repeatedly argued that the Duke of York must be excluded from the line of succession. He also continued to argue that Charles should remarry a Protestant princess, or legitimise James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. During these meetings, Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex and George Savile, 1st Earl of Halifax argued that the powers of a Catholic successor could be limited, but Shaftesbury argued that that would change &quot;the whole government, and set up a democracy instead of a monarchy&quot;.
On 11 May 1679, Shaftesbury&#x27;s close political ally, William Russell, Lord Russell, introduced an Exclusion Bill in the House of Commons, which would have excluded the Duke of York from the succession. This bill passed first and second reading on 21 May 1679. To stop the Exclusion Bill and the Bill of Attainder directed at Danby, Charles II prorogued the parliament on 27 May 1679 and dissolved it on 3 July 1679, both of which moves infuriated Shaftesbury. As its name implies, the only achievement of the Habeas Corpus Parliament was the passage of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679.

For the time being Shaftesbury retained his position on the Privy Council, and he and the Duke of Monmouth formed an alliance on the Council that was designed to be obstructionist. There were some disagreements between Shaftesbury and Monmouth: for example, Shaftesbury was critical of Monmouth&#x27;s decision to crush a rebellion by Scottish Covenanters quickly at the Battle of Bothwell Brig in June 1679, arguing that the rebellion should have been drawn out to force Charles II to recall parliament.

On 21 August 1679, the king fell ill, leading Essex and Halifax (who feared Monmouth was about to launch a coup) to ask the Duke of York, whom Charles had sent to Brussels in late 1678, to return to England. Charles soon recovered and then ordered both York and Monmouth into exile. When Charles agreed to allow his brother to move from Flanders to Scotland in October 1679, Shaftesbury summoned an extraordinary meeting of the Privy Council to discuss the Duke&#x27;s move, acting on his own authority as Lord President of the Council because the king was at Newmarket at the time. Angered by this insubordination, Charles removed Shaftesbury from the Privy Council on 14 October 1679.

=====The Exclusion Bill Parliament, 1679–1680=====

Elections for a new parliament, which ultimately came to be known as the Exclusion Bill Parliament, were held in summer 1679, but they went badly for the court, so, with parliament scheduled to meet in October 1679, Charles prorogued the parliament until 26 January 1680. Shaftesbury worried that the king might be intending to not meet this new parliament, so he launched a massive petitioning campaign to pressure the king to meet parliament. He wrote to the Duke of Monmouth, telling him that he should return from exile, and on 27 November 1679 Monmouth rode back into London amidst scenes of widespread celebration. On 7 December 1679, a petition signed by Shaftesbury and fifteen other Whig peers calling on Charles to meet parliament, followed up with a 20,000-name petition on 13 January 1680. However, instead of meeting parliament, Charles further prorogued parliament and recalled his brother from Scotland. Shaftesbury now urged his friends on the Privy Council to resign, and four did so.

On 24 March 1680, Shaftesbury told the Privy Council of information he had received that the Irish Catholics were about to launch a rebellion, backed by the French. Several privy councillors, especially Henry Coventry, thought that Shaftesbury was making the entire story up to inflame public opinion, but an investigation was launched. This investigation ultimately resulted in the execution of Oliver Plunkett, Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, on trumped-up charges.

On 26 June 1680, Shaftesbury led a group of fifteen peers and commoners who presented an indictment to the Middlesex grand jury in Westminster Hall, charging the Duke of York with being a popish recusant in violation of the penal laws. Before the grand jury could act, they were dismissed for interfering in matters of state. The next week, Shaftesbury again tried to indict the Duke of York, but again the grand jury was dismissed before it could take any action.

The parliament finally met on 21 October 1680, and on 23 October, Shaftesbury called for a committee to be set up to investigate the Popish Plot. When the Exclusion Bill again came before the House of Lords, Shaftesbury gave an impassioned pro-Exclusion speech on 15 November. The Lords, however, rejected the Exclusion Bill by a vote of 63–30. The Lords now explored alternative ways of limiting the powers of a Catholic successor, but Shaftesbury argued that the only viable alternative to exclusion was calling on the king to remarry. On 23 December 1680, Shaftesbury gave another fiery pro-Exclusion speech in the Lords, in the course of which he attacked the Duke of York, expressed mistrust of Charles II, and urged the parliament to not approve any taxes until &quot;the King shall satisfie the People, that what we give is not to make us Slaves and Papists&quot;. With parliament pursuing the Irish investigation vigorously, and threatening to impeach some of Charles II&#x27;s judges, Charles prorogued parliament on 10 January 1681, and then dissolved it on 18 January, calling for fresh elections for a new parliament, to meet at Oxford on 21 March 1681. On 25 January 1681, Shaftesbury, Essex, and Salisbury presented the king with a petition signed by sixteen peers asking that parliament should be held at Westminster Hall rather than Oxford, but the king remained committed to Oxford.

=====The Oxford Parliament, 1681=====

In February 1681, Shaftesbury and his supporters brought another indictment against York, this time at the Old Bailey, with the grand jury this time finding the bill true, although York&#x27;s counsel was able to pursue procedural delays until the prosecution lapsed.

At the Oxford Parliament, Charles insisted he would listen to any reasonable expedient short of changing the line of succession that would assuage the nation&#x27;s concerns about a Catholic successor. On 24 March 1681, Shaftesbury announced in the House of Lords that he had received an anonymous letter suggesting that the king&#x27;s condition could be met if he were to declare the Duke of Monmouth legitimate. Charles was furious. On 26 March 1681, an Exclusion Bill was introduced in the Oxford Parliament and Charles dissolved parliament. The only issue the Oxford Parliament had resolved had been the case of Edward Fitzharris, who was to be left to the common law, although Shaftesbury and 19 other peers signed a formal protest of this result.

=====Prosecution for high treason, 1681–1682=====

The end of the Oxford Parliament marked the beginning of the so-called Tory Reaction. On 2 July 1681, Shaftesbury was arrested on suspicion of high treason and committed to the Tower of London. He immediately petitioned the Old Bailey on a writ of habeas corpus, but the Old Bailey said it did not have jurisdiction over prisoners in the Tower of London, so Shaftesbury had to wait for the next session of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. Shaftesbury moved for a writ of habeas corpus on 24 October 1681, and his case finally came before a grand jury on 24 November 1681.

The government&#x27;s case against Shaftesbury was particularly weak – most of the witnesses brought forth against Shaftesbury were witnesses whom the government admitted had already perjured themselves, and the documentary evidence was inconclusive. This, combined with the fact that the jury was handpicked by the Whig Sheriff of London, meant the government had little chance of securing a conviction and on 13 February 1682, the case against Shaftesbury was dropped. The announcement prompted great celebrations in London, with crowds yelling &quot;No Popish Successor, No York, A Monmouth&quot; and &quot;God bless the Earl of Shaftesbury&quot;.

=====Attempts at an uprising, 1682=====

In May 1682, Charles II fell ill, and Shaftesbury convened a group including Monmouth, Russell, Ford Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Werke, and Sir Thomas Armstrong to determine what to do if the king died. They determined they would launch a rebellion demanding a parliament to settle the succession. The king recovered, however, and this was not necessary.

At the election of the Sheriffs of London in July 1682, the Tory candidates prevailed. Shaftesbury was worried that these Sheriffs would be able to fill juries with Tory supporters and he was desperately afraid of another prosecution for high treason. Shaftesbury, therefore began discussions with Monmouth, Russell, and Grey to launch coordinated rebellions in different parts of the country. Shaftesbury was much more eager for a rebellion than the other three, and the uprising was postponed several times, to Shaftesbury&#x27;s chagrin.

Following the installation of the new Tory sheriffs on 28 September 1682, Shaftesbury grew desperate. He continued to urge an immediate uprising and also opened discussions with John Wildman about the possibility of assassinating the king and the Duke of York.

=====Flight from England and death, 1682–1683=====

With his plots having proved unsuccessful, Shaftesbury determined to flee the country. He landed at Brielle sometime between 20 and 26 November 1682, reached Rotterdam on 28 November, and finally, arrived in Amsterdam on 2 December 1682.

Shaftesbury&#x27;s health had deteriorated markedly during this voyage. In Amsterdam, he fell ill, and by the end of December, he found it difficult to keep down any food. He drew up a will on 17 January 1683. On 20 January, in a conversation with Robert Ferguson, who had accompanied him to Amsterdam, he professed himself an Arian. He died the next day, on 21 January 1683.

According to the provisions of his will, Shaftesbury&#x27;s body was shipped back to Dorset on 13 February 1683, and he was buried at Wimborne St Giles on 26 February 1683. Shaftesbury&#x27;s son, Lord Ashley, succeeded him as Earl of Shaftesbury.

==Legacy==

In North America, the Cooper River and the Ashley River which merge in Charleston, South Carolina are named in his honour. The Ashley was given its current name by explorer Robert Sandford.

Shaftesbury has been portrayed on screen by Frederick Peisley in &quot;The First Churchills&quot; (1969), by Martin Freeman in &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot;, and by Murray Melvin in &quot;England, My England&quot; (1995).

<doc id="303404" wikidata="Q7434014" url="?curid=303404" title="Scipio Africanus Jones">
<text>Scipio Africanus Jones (August 3, 1863 – March 2, 1943) was an American educator, lawyer, judge, philanthropist, and Republican politician from the state of Arkansas. He was most known for having guided the appeals of the twelve African-American men condemned to death after the Elaine Massacre of October 1919. More than one hundred African Americans were indicted in the aftermath of the riot, although an estimated one hundred to two hundred Black Americans were killed in the county, along with five whites. No whites were prosecuted by the state. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot; (1923) set a precedent of reviewing the conduct of state criminal trials against the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Born into slavery in Smith Township near Tulip in Dallas County in south Arkansas, Jones became a successful and powerful businessman. Jones was the first lawyer in Arkansas to raise the question that African Americans had not been permitted to serve on grand juries and petit juries. In 1915, Jones broke a color barrier when he was appointed to serve as acting judge of the Little Rock police court, presiding over a case in which all the parties were blacks, as were the witnesses and attorneys except the city attorney, who supported having a Negro judge preside at this particular trial. Jones also represented Negro Shriners as part of a successful defense against efforts to keep them from using the name and paraphernalia of the Shriners organization.

==Early life and education==

Jones&#x27; mother, Jemmina Jones, was a 15-year-old slave when her mixed-race son Scipio was born. She had been held by Dr. Adolphus and Carolyn Jones, who assigned her as the companion of their daughter Thresa when the girls were young. Thresa, a year younger, became Jemmina&#x27;s best friend. Thresa&#x27;s parents died when she was 9 years old, and she and her slave were moved to the house of her uncle, Dr. Sanford Reamey. He would later become Scipio&#x27;s father.

Jones attended black schools near his hometown. In 1883, he moved to Little Rock at the age of twenty and took preparatory courses at Philander Smith College. In 1885, Jones earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Shorter College, a historically black college in North Little Rock.

Jones worked as a school teacher in Big Rock District Two from 1885 until 1887. He was a tenant of James Lawson, a white man, a member of a pioneer family of Little Rock. At this time Jones also befriended three prominent black business owners: Ed Wood, Sr., owner of the largest black-owned plantation in the state and the only African American on the local commodities trading floor; John Bush, a powerful black merchant and lumber yard owner; and Chester Keatts. These three initiated Jones into the Prince Hall Freemasonry, a secret fraternal society of prominent African Americans who pooled resources for the ideals of liberty, equality and peace.

Jones offered to work for free as a janitor at the law offices of U.S. District Judge Henry C. Caldwell, Judge T.B. Martin, and Atty. S.A. Kilgore. While there, he began to read law books during his free time. He also became an apprentice under Circuit Judge Robert J. Lea. Jones passed the Arkansas Bar in 1889. When he had begun his studies, Arkansas had no law school for African-American students, and reading law in an established firm was still a common way for men to study the law and prepare for the bar.

==Political life==
Jones joined the Republican Party and unsuccessfully ran for state representative in 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention several times. In 1891, the Democratic-controlled Arkansas General Assembly passed a new election law making voting more complicated and eliminating numerous illiterate voters; together with a poll tax amendment passed in 1892, these measures disenfranchised most blacks in the state and many poor whites. The Republican Party offered Jones the positions of Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia and Ambassador to the Republic of Haiti, but he declined both appointments to concentrate on local affairs.

The Republican Party in the state suffered a substantial loss in voters due to the disfranchisement measures. Jones became involved in the struggle between the Lily Whites and the Black and Tans within the Republican Party. In 1902, Jones helped organize a slate of black Republicans to challenge the Lily Whites and Democrats in the city of Little Rock general election. The struggle reached a breaking point in 1920, when the blacks nominated J.H. Blount, a Negro candidate, for Governor for the first time. In that year, Jones was selected as the Black and Tan contender for the Arkansas Republican National Committee. Four years later, Jones, J. H. Blount, N. R. Parker and J. Hibbler helped organize a Black and Tan protest meeting in Little Rock in which a list of demands for equal political treatment was presented to the Lily Whites. Eventually, a compromise was reached that guaranteed black representation on the Republican State Central Committee.

==Business life==
Jones was a successful and powerful businessman. He was the founder and owner of People&#x27;s Ice &amp; Fuel Company, which had the distinction of being both the only black-owned and black-operated ice manufacturing company and the only black-owned and black-operated fuel company in the U.S. He extended his relationship with Eddie Wood, Sr, and Jon Bush, when they supported his formation of the Arkansas Negro Business League, an affiliate of Booker T. Washington&#x27;s National Negro Business League (NNBL). Additionally, he joined the Prince Hall Masons, with their sponsorship.

During the administration of Mayor Ben D. Brickhouse, the Little Rock Clearing House, composed of representatives from the ten banks of Little Rock, had declined to make a loan to the city. When Brickhouse mentioned this fact to Jones, Jones asked the mayor how much money the city needed. The mayor replied that he needed $75,000; Jones said, &quot;My clients have $120,000 on deposit in the banks of Little Rock and if the Clearing House will not let you have the money, my clients will.&quot; After hearing about the conversation, the Clearing House agreed to lend the city the $75,000.

==Practice of law==
Jones was accepted into the American Bar Association in 1889. Shortly thereafter, he was admitted to practice in the circuit court of Pulaski County, which includes Little Rock. In 1900, he was admitted to the state Supreme Court, followed by the United States District Court (1901), the United States Supreme Court (1905), and the United States Court of Appeals (1914). He served as the first treasurer of the National Negro Bar Association when it was formed in Little Rock in 1910 as an auxiliary of the NNBL.

Jones was the National Attorney General of the Mosaic Templars of America, an organization founded by John E. Bush and Chester W. Keatts, was, at the time, one of the largest African-American fraternal organizations in the nation, and one of the largest black-owned business enterprises. The organization provided burial and life insurance to members; operated a building and loan association, a newspaper, a nursing school, and a hospital; and offered other social programs to the community. Its international headquarters were located in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Jones also served as the attorney, counselor, and legal adviser for several other African-American fraternal organizations, including the International Order of Twelve and Knights and Daughters of Tabor, which also had its headquarters in Arkansas, a few blocks from the Mosaic Templars. He successfully defended the Grand Lodge of the Knights of Pythias when the Arkansas Insurance Commission attempted to put them out of business. Because of his work with African-American fraternal organizations, he was called &quot;the Gibraltar of Negro fraternal beneficiary societies.&quot;

In 1915, when Fred A. Isgrig was judge of the Little Rock police court, Isgrig disqualified himself in a case. City Attorney, Harry C. Hale, nominated Jones to act as judge. As all the parties were blacks, as were the witnesses and attorneys except Hale, Hale thought it proper to have a Negro judge preside at this particular trial. Jones was elected special judge. The election of a Negro justice so angered W. N. Lee, a white lawyer from Little Rock who was originally from Mississippi, that he engaged in fisticuffs with Hale for nominating Jones. He said that he would not live in a state in which white people would elect a Negro. The trial was held about ten o&#x27;clock in the morning and Lee left the state about four o&#x27;clock that afternoon and never returned.

On August 26, 1924, the Pulaski County Democratic convention met in session. The meeting, packed with anti-Klan delegates who listened attentively to many verbal lashings of the secret fraternity, was the first at which a direct attack was ever made by the Democratic party in the county against the Ku Klux Klan, which had been active in the state since 1921. Scathing denunciations of the order were made by the chairman of the convention, Fred A. Isgrig, and the secretary of the County Central Committee, Frank H. Dodge. These were both received with applause. Isgrig traced the history of the Little Rock Klan in politics, describing the fight it had made to obtain control of the school board, the county offices, and the membership of the state legislature allotted to the district. He pointed out further that the election judges and clerks were chosen with the assistance of Klansmen, including C. P. Newton, the Democratic candidate for county judge.

Before adjourning, the convention adopted a resolution, the conclusion of which stated:

Be it ... resolved that we call upon the citizens not only of this county but upon all the counties of the state of Arkansas, to join with us in casting the Ku Klux Klan out of the Democratic party and forcing it to come out in the open, under its own colors as a Ku Klux Klan party, instead of seeking to hide its identity within the folds of the Democratic party.

In 1924, Jones was elected special chancellor in the Pulaski County Chancery Court.

Jones was the first lawyer in Arkansas to raise the question that African Americans had not been permitted to serve on the grand and petit juries, although many were qualified. He contended that this was discrimination on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude, and was prohibited by the US Constitution. Jones raised this question before it was raised in the Carter case of Texas, which was afterwards appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court held that it was a discrimination on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. Many cases were dismissed in Texas in which indictments had been made without Negro persons being on the jury.

Following the Adair case in Georgia, many suits of injunction were brought in other states against the Negro Shriners to keep from using the name and paraphernalia of Shriners. Jones represented the Negro Shriners in such a suit brought in Pulaski County. Chancellor Judge John Martineau held in his favor. Jones also assisted in the trial of the case at Houston, Texas, against the Negro Shriners. The white Shrine Temple had sold its paraphernalia to the Negro Shrine Temple, and then enjoined the Negro Shriners from using the paraphernalia. This case was carried to the U.S. Supreme Court where it ruled that the Negroes had the right to use the paraphernalia on the ground of &quot;estoppel&quot;.

==The Elaine Twelve==
Jones is most famous for his skillful defense of the Elaine 12, twelve black sharecroppers sentenced to death for allegedly being involved in the murder of a white man during the Elaine Massacre in October 1919. The twelve men had been convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury in a series of trials that were said to have lasted approximately 20 minutes.

The plight of the Elaine 12, and 87 other black men who were convicted to prison terms for participation in the riot, quickly made international headlines. Three organizations offered assistance: the Arkansas Conference on Negro Organizations (ACNO), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the National Equal Rights League (NERL). The ACNO and NERL joined to hire Jones as the defense attorney for all 99 of the convicted men. The NAACP hired former state attorney general George W. Murphy as the defense attorney for the Elaine 12. The two attorneys were friends and decided to work together.

When George Murphy died unexpectedly after they had started the retrial of six of the murder defendants in May 1920, after winning an appeal in the Arkansas Supreme Court, Jones took the lead in guiding the appeals process. After much internal debate, the NAACP temporarily retained Jones as their replacement for Murphy, making him briefly the sole attorney for all of the 99 defendants. He successfully continued with the Moore et al. defendants, whose cases were reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Jones is credited with having been the author of the brief used before the Court.

When it was time to argue the Elaine 12 case before the Supreme Court, the NAACP decided to replace Jones with Moorfield Storey of Boston, founding president of the NAACP since 1909, and former assistant U.S. attorney Ulysses S. Bratton of Little Rock. Jones continued to support the cases, and in 1923 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot; that, for the first time, collateral attack through habeas corpus was permissible on a state appellate court decision. It was a landmark precedent that marked the Court&#x27;s review of state criminal cases from the point of view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. During the trials, Jones received frequent lynching threats while in Arkansas. He was said to have shifted his location each night because of the risk to his safety.

New trials were granted to the twelve defendants as the court stated that they had not received due process in the original trials.

Charges were quickly dismissed against six of the defendants. The remaining six were retried, convicted and sentenced to twelve years in prison. Jones successfully lobbied Arkansas Governor Thomas McRae, who had earlier refused to release the defendants, to let men out on indefinite furloughs in 1925. Before leaving office, Governor McRae also pardoned the other 87 Elaine defendants.

This was hours before Governor-elect Tom Jefferson Terral, a Klan member, assumed office. During a speech before one of the largest KKK rallies in Arkansas history the night before his inauguration, Terral vowed to execute the six remaining Elaine defendants as his first official duty in office.

==Later in life==
Jones remained active in Republican politics and continued to press legal challenges to racial discrimination in Arkansas until his death. During World War I, Jones led the Liberty Bond recruitment drive among the African-American community in Arkansas and raised $243,000 in the effort. Jones also served as the head of the Negro State Suffrage League and fought for voting rights for black citizens throughout his life. Jones served as director of the United Charities drive, a predecessor of the United Way of America.

Jones&#x27;s last case was in 1942, when he teamed up with Thurgood Marshall of NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund to sue the Little Rock School District to obtain equal pay for a black school teacher. Though Jones died before the completion of the case, Marshall gained victory in court.

Scipio Jones died in Little Rock and is interred there at Haven of Rest Cemetery.

==Honors and legacy==

<text>In set theory, a universal set is a set which contains all objects, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, it can be proven in multiple ways that a universal set does not exist. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
Many set theories do not allow for the existence of a universal set. There are several different arguments for its non-existence, based on different choices of axioms for set theory.

===Russell&#x27;s paradox===

Russell&#x27;s paradox concerns the impossibility of a set of sets, whose members are all sets that do not contain themselves. If such a set could exist, it could neither contain itself (because its members all do not contain themselves) nor avoid containing itself (because if it did, it should be included as one of its members). This paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in set theories that include either Zermelo&#x27;s axiom of restricted comprehension, or the axiom of regularity and axiom of pairing.

====Regularity and pairing====
In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of regularity and axiom of pairing prevent any set from containing itself. For any set formula_1, the set formula_2 (constructed using pairing) necessarily contains an element disjoint from formula_2, by regularity. Because its only element is formula_1, it must be the case that formula_1 is disjoint from formula_2, and therefore that formula_1 does not contain itself. Because a universal set would necessarily contain itself, it cannot exist under these axioms.

====Comprehension====
Russell&#x27;s paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in set theories that include Zermelo&#x27;s axiom of restricted comprehension.
This axiom states that, for any formula formula_8 and any set formula_1, there exists a set 
formula_10
that contains exactly those elements formula_11 of formula_1 that satisfy formula_13.

If this axiom could be applied to a universal set formula_1, with formula_8 defined as the predicate formula_16,
it would state the existence of Russell&#x27;s paradoxical set, giving a contradiction.
It was this contradiction that led the axiom of comprehension to be stated in its restricted form, where it asserts the existence of a subset of a given set rather than the existence of a set of all sets that satisfy a given formula.

When the axiom of restricted comprehension is applied to an arbitrary set formula_1, with the predicate formula_18, it produces the subset of elements of formula_1 that do not contain themselves. It cannot be a member of formula_1, because if it were it would be included as a member of itself, by its definition, contradicting the fact that it cannot contain itself. In this way, it is possible to construct a witness to the non-universality of formula_1, even in versions of set theory that allow sets to contain themselves. This indeed holds even with predicative comprehension and over intuitionistic logic.

===Cantor&#x27;s theorem===

Another difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the power set of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist. However, this conflicts with Cantor&#x27;s theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be consistent (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set does exist (and formula_22 is true). In these theories, Zermelo&#x27;s axiom of comprehension does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of naive set theory is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a non-well-founded set theory.
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is Willard Van Orman Quine&#x27;s New Foundations. Alonzo Church and Arnold Oberschelp also published work on such set theories. Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine&#x27;s, but this is not possible for Oberschelp&#x27;s, since in it the singleton function is provably a set, which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.

Another example is positive set theory, where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the positive formulas (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===

The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see universal quantifier). One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe and similar large collections as proper classes rather than as sets. Russell&#x27;s paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The category of sets can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.

<text>Tongji (; Tâi-lô: tâng-ki) or Jitong () is a Chinese folk religious practitioner, usually translated as a &quot;spirit medium&quot;, &quot;oracle&quot;, or &quot;shaman&quot;.

&quot;Tong&quot; (Vietnamese: ʔdoŋ; Mon: doŋ) has an Austroasiatic substrate which means &#x27;to dance
under daemonic possession&#x27; is represented phonologically by the character &quot;child; youth; boy servant&quot; and &quot;ji&quot; means &quot;to divine&quot; (cf. &quot;fuji&quot; &quot;divination; planchette writing&quot;). Regional variants include Hokkien &quot;tâng-ki&quot; and Cantonese &quot;gei-tung&quot; or &quot;san-daa&quot; .

A &quot;tongji&quot; or &quot;jitong&quot; is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular shen (chinese deity) or spirit as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a &quot;wu&quot; &quot;shaman; healer; spirit medium&quot; who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a &quot;tongji&quot; who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world.

<text>William &quot;Velvel&quot; Morton Kahan (born June 5, 1933) is a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist, who is a professor emeritus at University of California, Berkeley. He received the Turing Award in 1989 for &quot;his fundamental contributions to numerical analysis.&quot;

==Biography==
Born to a Canadian Jewish family, he attended the University of Toronto, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1954, his master&#x27;s degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in 1958, all in the field of mathematics. Kahan is now emeritus professor of mathematics and of electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) at the University of California, Berkeley.

Kahan was the primary architect behind the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation (and its radix-independent follow-on, IEEE 854). He has been called &quot;The Father of Floating Point&quot;, since he was instrumental in creating the original IEEE 754 specification. Kahan continued his contributions to the IEEE 754 revision that led to the current IEEE 754 standard.

In the 1980s he developed the program &quot;paranoia&quot;, a benchmark that tests for a wide range of potential floating-point bugs. He also developed the Kahan summation algorithm, an important algorithm for minimizing error introduced when adding a sequence of finite-precision floating-point numbers. He coined the term &quot;Table-maker&#x27;s dilemma&quot; for the unknown cost of correctly rounding transcendental functions to some preassigned number of digits.

The Davis–Kahan–Weinberger dilation theorem is one of the landmark results in the dilation theory of Hilbert space operators and has found applications in many different areas.

He is an outspoken advocate of better education of the general computing population about floating-point issues and regularly denounces decisions in the design of computers and programming languages that he believes would impair good floating-point computations.

When Hewlett-Packard (HP) introduced the original HP-35 pocket scientific calculator, its numerical accuracy in evaluating transcendental functions for some arguments was not optimal. HP worked extensively with Kahan to enhance the accuracy of the algorithms, which led to major improvements. This was documented at the time in the &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;.
He also contributed substantially to the design of the algorithms in the HP Voyager series and wrote part of their intermediate and advanced manuals.

Kahan was named an ACM Fellow in 1994, and inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2005.

<doc id="303422" wikidata="Q770064" url="?curid=303422" title="Warren Worthington III">
<text>Warren Kenneth Worthington III is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963). Warren is a founding member of the X-Men, having used the moniker Angel. Later stories would reveal that prior to joining the team, he had acted as a vigilante under the moniker Avenging Angel.

Warren is a mutant, an evolved species of humans who are born with superhuman abilities. The character originally possesses a pair of large feathered wings extending from his back, enabling him to fly. He is the heir of the Worthington family fortune, and this privileged background results in Warren being stereotyped as self-absorbed and unable to deal with hardships during his early years with the X-Men. This personality was ultimately replaced with a more introspective and brooding personality in the late 1980s, when the character was changed into the darker Archangel persona. While Warren&#x27;s wings were originally feathered, his transition to Archangel resulted in metallic wings and newfound powers.

As one of the original X-Men, Warren has had a frequent presence in X-Men-related comic books throughout the years and also appeared occasionally in X-Men animated series and video games. Ben Foster played the role of Warren in the 2006 film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; and Ben Hardy portrayed a younger version in the 2016 film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;.

== Publication history ==
The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-creator Jack Kirby and first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (Sept. 1963) as Angel. Lee made Angel rich and conceited, as well as a winged human to make him the first Marvel character with wings. He appeared as a regular character in that title until it was cancelled with issue #66. The title was revived shortly after, reprinting earlier issues from issue #67 to #93. In 1970 and 1971, a three-part Angel solo feature was published as a back-up strip in &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; #2 and #3 and &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; #30.

Angel appeared in the &quot;X-Men&quot; revamp by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum in 1975 with the introduction of the &quot;All-New, All-Different X-Men&quot; (&quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 May 1975), but left the X-Men title with issue #94. Angel and fellow X-Man Iceman were transitioned into a new series called &quot;The Champions&quot;, which ran from 1975 to 1978. Series creator Tony Isabella had wanted to do a series about Angel and Iceman traveling together on the highway, in the vein of &quot;Route 66&quot;, but the editors told him to make it into a full team book.

Angel returned to the X-Men briefly in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #134, officially returning to the roster in issue #138 before once again leaving in issue #148. Afterwards, the character, along with fellow founding X-Men Beast and Iceman, joined the roster of The Defenders, as part of a short-lived &quot;revamp&quot; of the title, in which the series was renamed &quot;The New Defenders&quot;. Angel would stay with the title, as the group&#x27;s leader, for the book&#x27;s last three years of publication (1983–1986). The series was canceled in 1986 to free up Angel and his fellow X-Men to star in &quot;X-Factor&quot;, which debuted in February. Angel remained in the book until issue #70, which was the last issue before the book was revamped with an all-new roster. During &quot;X-Factor&quot; #16–24, the character is presumed dead after losing his wings and apparently killing himself in a plane crash. Angel was dramatically revamped as a character, given a new costume, blue skin, and metallic wings which could fire blades. He first appeared as Archangel in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #24 (Jan. 1988). According to &quot;X-Factor&quot; writer Louise Simonson and penciler Walt Simonson, the Archangel revamp was motivated in part by their feeling that Angel was a Mary Sue (being wealthy, handsome, and adored by women), and in part by the fact that, due to the inflation of superhero abilities, Angel was underpowered compared to other characters in the Marvel Universe.

Angel was added to the cast of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; title and appeared in that series and its companion series &quot;X-Men&quot; for most of the 1990s. In 1996, Marvel also published a one-shot story simply called &quot;Archangel&quot;, which was written by Peter Milligan. He also appeared alongside Psylocke in a limited series called &quot;Psylocke &amp; Archangel: Crimson Dawn&quot; (August 1997 – November 1997, 4 issues). From 1999 to 2001, Angel also featured in the series &quot;X-Men: The Hidden Years&quot;, which was set in the original X-Men&#x27;s early days.

Under Joe Casey (2001–2002) and Chuck Austen (2002–2004), Angel became leader of the X-Men team that appeared in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. After Chris Claremont replaced Austen on that title, the character went away for several months before reappearing in the pages of another Claremont-written series, &quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 3 2004). He continued to guest-star in the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; title during the events of &quot;World War Hulk&quot; (2007) and then returned to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (2008-2011) while simultaneously appearing in &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 3) (2008-2010), where the character regained his metallic wings and again assumed the codename Archangel, and subsequently in &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; (2010-2011), in which his mind and personality were wiped.

After his personality was stripped, he appeared in a supporting role as one of the students at the &quot;Jean Grey School&quot; in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; (2011–2013). He later joined Magneto&#x27;s more militant X-Men team in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (2016-2017) and an international strike force in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; (2017-2018) after his memory was restored. At the same time, a time-displaced version of Angel&#x27;s younger self was brought to the present and starred in &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; (2012–2017) and &quot;X-Men Blue&quot; (2017-2018), before being returned to his correct time-period in the mini-series &quot;Extermination&quot; (2018).

Angel appeared in &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot; (2019), which detailed the birth of the Krakoan Age. He was made the CXO of Krakoa&#x27;s new X-Corp and appeared in the mini-series &quot;Empyre: X-Men&quot; (2020), &quot;X-Corp&quot; (2021) and &quot;Dark X-Men&quot; (2023). As the Krakoa era came to a close, he was the focus of the 50th anniversary issue of &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; (2024) and appeared in the mini-series &quot;X-Men: Heir of Apocalypse&quot; (2024).

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Angel ===
Warren Worthington III was born in Centerport, New York, to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington II and the grandson of Warren Worthington. He attends Phillips Exeter Academy in his adolescence when his feathered wings begin to grow from his shoulder blades. At first, Warren feels he is a freak and aberration, but he soon learns that he can use his wings to fly and help people. When there is a fire in his dormitory, he borrows some props from the school&#x27;s drama department, dresses up as a heavenly angel, and rescues his friends. He soon learns that he is in fact a mutant. He dons a mask and costume, calls himself the Avenging Angel, and becomes a solo adventurer, before being recruited by Professor Charles Xavier for the X-Men.

Warren&#x27;s status as a wealthy playboy, as well as being an outspoken individual who chafes at the notion of being told what to do, is the subject of much tension within the X-Men. In particular, Warren is in love with Jean Grey, who is in love with Scott Summers, although he ultimately sets aside his love for Jean, coming to terms with the fact that Jean loves Scott. Angel still harbors an unrequited love for Jean even as he begins dating Candy Southern.

While pursuing Sauron in the Savage Land, Angel is attacked by pteranodons and falls to his death. He would have remained dead if not for the &quot;Creator&quot;, who is Magneto without his costume. Magneto provides the necessary medical treatment needed to revive Angel and provides him with a new blue-and-white costume. Unknown to Angel, the costume also has a device installed that lets Magneto gain control over Angel, which he does months later when he makes an attack on the X-Men.

Around this time, Angel publicly reveals himself as a mutant after discovering that his uncle Burt Worthington (who goes by the name of the Dazzler — though he is in no way related to Alison Blaire, a later mutant heroine and brief love interest for Warren in her own comic series who also uses the name) has not only murdered his father, but also poisoned his mother to ensure his inheritance of the Worthington fortune.

When the original X-Men are captured by the mutant island Krakoa, Professor X creates a new team of X-Men to rescue them. When this new team decides to stay on as X-Men, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of Cyclops, leave. He and Iceman go to Los Angeles, where they found the Champions with Hercules, the Black Widow, and the original Ghost Rider. Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops&#x27; subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoins the X-Men. During this time, Angel unsuccessfully pursues pop star Alison Blaire, also known as Dazzler. He grows increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of Wolverine, and quits the team in protest.

He is kidnapped by the Morlock leader Callisto, who intends to force Angel to be her lover. Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Sprite arrive in time to stop Callisto from cutting off Angel&#x27;s wings (believing that without them, Angel will be unable to flee from her). Storm fights and defeats Callisto for the right to be the leader of the Morlocks, effectively freeing Angel in the process.

Shortly thereafter, Angel joins the Defenders, along with Beast, Iceman, and girlfriend Candy Southern. Using Angel&#x27;s New Mexico house as their base, the group has several adventures before most of the group are killed freeing teammate Moondragon from demonic possession.

Angel considers retirement following the collapse of the Defenders, but the discovery of Jean Grey alive changes his mind. Jean Grey is furious at the increase in anti-mutant hysteria in the two years she has been missing, and opposes the X-Men&#x27;s decision to align themselves with the villain Magneto. To appease Jean&#x27;s desire for action, Warren organizes X-Factor. He recruits his old prep school friend Cameron Hodge to run the team, unaware that Cameron hates mutants, particularly Warren. Since Cyclops is married to Madelyne Pryor at the time and reacts coldly to Jean&#x27;s return, Angel takes advantage of Jean&#x27;s need for emotional support and expresses his love for her. This destroys Warren&#x27;s relationship with Candy Southern, after Candy finds Warren consoling Jean.

=== Archangel ===
X-Factor&#x27;s formation begins a period of upheaval in Warren&#x27;s life. Cameron Hodge abuses Warren&#x27;s trust and portrays X-Factor as &quot;mutant hunters&quot; for hire, further fueling anti-mutant sentiment. An altercation with the Brotherhood of Mutants allows Mystique to discover the relationship between the &quot;mutant hunters&quot; and the former X-Men; she exposes Warren as the financial backer for X-Factor, causing a public relations nightmare. Warren&#x27;s wings are mutilated during the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; by the Marauder, Harpoon. When the wings develop gangrene, Cameron Hodge violates Angel&#x27;s wishes and has the crippled wings amputated. Despondent over the loss, Warren escapes the hospital and commandeers his private jet. It explodes in the air as the rest of X-Factor watch helplessly from below. It is ultimately revealed that Hodge sabotaged Warren&#x27;s plane to finish off his nemesis, in an apparent suicide.

Seconds before the explosion, Warren is spirited away by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. Apocalypse offers to restore Angel&#x27;s wings if Angel will serve him as one of his Four Horsemen. Apocalypse subjects Angel to extensive genetic alterations, giving him blue skin and organic metal wings which can cut through almost anything. The wings can fire the metal feathers as projectiles. Apocalypse gives Worthington the title of Death. He makes Worthington the leader of his Horsemen after Worthington beats the others in a fight, and gives him a drug that remove his reservations to follow Apocalypse&#x27;s dark plans. Death is unveiled to X-Factor during their second encounter with the Horsemen, and Warren sadistically exploits the weaknesses of his friends to defeat them in combat. During a later attack on Manhattan, Iceman fakes his own death at Warren&#x27;s hands, hoping that the shock of killing a friend will enable him to break free of the influence of Apocalypse&#x27;s drug. Although freed, Warren refuses to rejoin X-Factor, feeling that he has changed too much psychologically to be a hero.

He seeks out Candy Southern, but finds that she is missing. Warren learns that Candy has been lobotomized to protect Cameron Hodge&#x27;s secrets, including the establishment of the anti-mutant militia &quot;The Right&quot; using funds embezzled from Worthington. In the confrontation that follows, Hodge murders Candy in front of Warren and Warren decapitates Hodge. Changing his codename from &quot;Death&quot; to &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, he later rejoins X-Factor and takes the codename &quot;Archangel&quot; during the events of &quot;Inferno&quot;.

Warren later meets and becomes romantically involved with Charlotte Jones, a New York City Police officer and single mother. It is with Charlotte&#x27;s help that X-Factor frees Warren from the Ravens, a cult of near-immortal psychic vampires. It is during this battle that Warren&#x27;s survival is made public knowledge, allowing him to regain control over his family&#x27;s remaining business holdings and his personal fortune. X-Factor rejoins the X-Men following the defeat of the Shadow King on Muir Island.

=== Angel again ===
After rejoining the X-Men, Archangel&#x27;s brooding behavior lessens, after Jean reveals to Warren that his wings (which Warren believes have a mind of their own) have actually been operating off Warren&#x27;s own unconscious desires for violence. This, combined with Warren&#x27;s accidental decapitation of Mutant Liberation Front member Kamikaze, leads Warren to try to reject the dark cloud that has hung over his head ever since gaining his new wings. His relationship with Charlotte Jones fades as Warren begins dating fellow X-Men member Psylocke. In an attempt to put his dark days behind him, Warren retires his &quot;Death&quot; uniform in favor of the blue/white costume Magneto made for him.

After Psylocke is eviscerated by X-Men prisoner Sabretooth during an escape attempt, Warren and the X-Men track him down and capture him, but not before he is able to badly damage Warren&#x27;s metal wings. Over time, the damage to his wings spreads. Eventually, the metal wings shatter completely, revealing that his feathered wings have been growing back within them and have broken them apart from the inside. This follows a visit from Ozymandias, who tells him that he is indeed one of Apocalypse&#x27;s chosen ones. Reclaiming his original Angel powers, Warren still retains his blue skin color.

Angel is one of several X-Men who are present when Gambit&#x27;s culpability in the events of the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; is made public by Magneto, which turns him against his teammate. Shortly afterwards, with the X-Men broke and their mansion stripped bare by the US Government, Angel volunteers money to help keep the team going, though this requires his reclaiming full control over his family company to do so. Tracking some of his company&#x27;s finances at this time, Warren discovers the former villains the Thunderbolts retrieving a jet that was used by the Champions, but although initially suspicious of the Thunderbolts&#x27; motives, after joining them in a confrontation with Graviton, Warren accepts their genuine desire to reform, leaving them with the jet as he wishes them luck. Angel returns to the X-Men following the events of &quot;&quot;, in which his wings (temporarily) further mutate into wings made of light and he gains talon-like hands and healing powers, which Warren uses to restore the mobility of crippled Horseman of Apocalypse War. Returning to the X-Men, Warren finds his relationship with Psylocke gone, as she has begun dating new X-Men recruit Thunderbird III.

When Rogue leaves the X-Men to join Storm&#x27;s splinter group (X-Treme X-Men), Angel is promoted to head of the X-Men&#x27;s field team. Angel&#x27;s squad fights the anti-mutant group Church of Humanity and Mystique and her newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and tangles with the Vanisher, who has gone into business with several medical companies to create a designer drug that could give humans mutant-like powers. Angel also becomes entangled in a love triangle with rookie X-Men member Paige Guthrie and the mutant prostitute Stacy X. Furthermore, during a battle with Black Tom Cassidy, Angel&#x27;s regression to his pre-&quot;Death&quot; state is complete when he reverts to his normal Caucasian skin color when Cassidy (now turned into a plant-type vampire) attempts to drain Angel&#x27;s life force from him. His healing powers from &quot;The Twelve&quot; also manifest themselves again, in the form of the revelation that Angel&#x27;s blood has miracle healing properties.

=== Decimation ===
Following the death of Jean Grey, Warren and Paige take an extended leave of absence from the team. Warren begins doing overseas charity work at this point, in the form of a charity called &quot;Mutants Sans Frontières&quot; in Zanzibar (a reference to Doctors Without Borders), where he then proceeds to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X&#x27;s newest charges from nearby Genosha. In &quot;Excalibur&quot;, Warren meets up again with Callisto. As Paige reminds Warren of his history with Callisto, Viper attacks, but Warren and Callisto defeat Viper together.

In &quot;Generation M&quot;, Angel fakes having lost his wings to capture the Ghoul, a deranged serial killer who uses his retained mutant powers to murder ex-mutants.

Though not an active member of any team, Warren reunites with the other surviving original X-Men — Cyclops, Iceman, and Beast — in a mission to stop Bishop from recapturing the fugitive mutants known as the 198, though Bishop later joins them in their rescue attempt.

=== World War Hulk ===
Angel joins with Hercules, Namora, and Amadeus Cho to calm down the rampaging Hulk. Afterward, Angel discovers that Amadeus Cho has hacked into Warren&#x27;s bank accounts and stolen several million dollars from him, to help him further aid the Hulk.

=== Messiah Complex ===
Angel is part of the team that investigates the new mutant birth in Alaska. He is later part of the team who is looking for former Acolytes. He is next seen part of the same team, but attacking the Marauders. Warren goes against Mister Sinister, but is easily defeated once Sinister recovers from Emma Frost&#x27;s mental attack. Angel is knocked out, but recovers and is present with the X-teams for the final battle over the fate of the baby.

=== Divided We Stand ===
Angel is later seen flying over San Francisco, going to meet with Hepzibah, Warpath, and Iceman, when he stumbles across an area that looks as if the 1960s never ended. He contacts Scott and Emma, asking them for assistance before suffering the mind-altering effects of the zone, which are revealed to be caused by Martinique Jason. Angel and the three other ensnared X-Men are sent by Martinique to confront Scott and Emma. Emma manages to free them from the illusion and, during the fall-out battle, Angel rescues Mayor Sadie Sinclair. Thankful for the assistance and for the idea of having real superheroes in their city, Mayor Sinclair then talks to Cyclops and Angel about helping them resettle the X-Men in San Francisco.

=== Archangel returns ===
In &quot;X-Force&quot; vol. 3 #4, Warren is brutally attacked by a mind-controlled Wolfsbane. During the attack, Wolfsbane savagely rips Warren&#x27;s feather wings from his back and runs away, taking the wings with her. It is revealed by Elixir that Warren&#x27;s wings, despite appearing fully organic, are actually still techno-organic constructs that he is unable to regenerate. Wolfsbane later delivers them to the Purifiers, who are seeking the Apocalypse Strain, the techno-organics which comprise Warren&#x27;s wings. The Purifiers use the Apocalypse Strain to modify an army of Purifier agents, giving them the same metallic wings that Archangel once had. Meanwhile, although Elixir is able to heal all of Warren&#x27;s injuries, he cannot regrow his wings due to interference from the Apocalypse Strain. Later in the story, Warren is gripped by a series of excruciating seizures that not only mysteriously regenerate his techno-organic wings, but also transform him back into Apocalypse&#x27;s version of Death/Archangel, complete with blue skin and a techno-organic version of his uniform.

X-Force attacks Archangel, who eventually asks for relief from the pain of losing his wings and transforming into Archangel. Archangel escapes, to take revenge on the Purifiers, and at their headquarters he slaughters most of them in a blood-maddened rage. Once the battle is over, he reverts to his normal Caucasian, feather-winged appearance. He comments to Wolverine that he can still feel the metal wings inside him, and that they want to come out again. According to Elixir, Warren&#x27;s transformation is permanent, implying that he is fully capable of transforming back into Archangel again at any time.

In an attempt to understand what was done to both Wolfsbane and Angel, the pair of them are placed in a room together, where Rahne is forced to gaze at Warren. The mere sight of him causes her to become murderous once again, and she attempts to rip the wings from Warren&#x27;s body once more. The sight of a psychotic Wolfsbane, as well as the fear of having his wings torn from his body again, causes a defensive reaction in Warren, reverting him back into his violent Archangel persona.

From then on, Angel takes dual membership with both the X-Men and X-Force, though Cyclops forbids Angel from telling the rest of the team about the return of his Archangel powers. While recruiting a scientist for Beast&#x27;s &quot;Science Squad&quot;, the X-Club, Angel is forced to transform into Archangel to destroy a giant rampaging monster. Beast reacts in anger that Angel has not told him that his &quot;Death&quot; powers have returned, creating tension between the two friends. Angel knows telling Beast would expose the latest incarnation of X-Force and effectively end Cyclops&#x27; latest tenure as leader if the truth about his personal black ops squad became public knowledge.

During the X-Club&#x27;s trip to 1906 to discover the origins of the modern mutant race, Angel transforms into Archangel a number of times to help further their mission.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Wolverine and Archangel interrogate Purifiers member Benedict Ryan on where Jonathan Standish is hiding out.

=== Dark Angel Saga ===
In the &quot;Dark Angel Saga&quot;, the &quot;Archangel&quot; persona of Warren, which was secretly created when he was first transformed by Apocalypse into his Horseman of Death, has finally taken over his mind, and he plans to be the heir to Apocalypse, bringing Ozymandias, Dark Beast, the Final Horsemen, Autumn Rolfson, and her son Genocide as his army to destroy humanity. At the conclusion of the story arc Betsy stabs Archangel in the chest with the Celestial Life Seed, seemingly killing him. In the aftermath of the explosion of Apocalypse&#x27;s citadel, Warren is seen by the members of X-Force walking in the snow. Psylocke, shocked that he is alive and apparently free of Apocalypse, runs up and embraces him. This Warren then reveals he had no idea who Psylocke is and appears to have amnesia. Warren has his normal white skin again but seems to have retained his metallic wings.

=== Death and new personality ===
Following the Dark Angel Saga, it is revealed that Warren had indeed died and his soul departed for the afterlife, with his Celestial-mutated body now hosting an all-new personality with its own soul. He lost leadership of Worthington Industries and became a student in Wolverine&#x27;s new school for mutants.
Although the new entity, who has chosen to retain the same name of Warren Worthington III and the code name of &quot;Angel&quot; is making efforts to be integrated, it is clear that he has no memory at all of the original Warren Worthington&#x27;s friends and acquaintances, as his discussions with Iceman demonstrate and how he turned away former lover Psylocke.

When Wolverine&#x27;s legs were damaged Warren tried to fix them with a &quot;miracle&quot;. When he failed he wanted to try it again but Wolverine wouldn&#x27;t allow him, so he and a few other students went to the casino on Planet Sin. There they took the device that damaged their headmaster&#x27;s legs so it could be used to heal him. While doing so he forged a friendship with Evan, a clone of Apocalypse.

Warren tried to prove that he truly was a real angel by flying to heaven but he failed and accepted the fact that he was mutant. While falling he was saved by Evan and revealed that he could see the essence of people when he looked at them. Evan asked him what he saw when he looked at him and despite seeing only the image of Apocalypse, Warren told him that he could see nothing but goodness in him.

Warren left the school with Bobby and Rachel to help his fellow mutants in the battle against the Avengers. He returned to join the X-Men, the Avengers and Nova against Cyclops, and has since regained all of his memories.

===Warren&#x27;s children/Apocalypse Twins===
In an apocalyptic possible future, an aging Frank Castle warns the present-day Deadpool of the &quot;son of Archangel&quot;. During &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; (2013), it is revealed that while preparing to ascend as Apocalypse during the &quot;Dark Angel Saga&quot;, Warren fathered two children with Pestilence of the Final Horsemen, who appear as Uriel and Elimin, the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror-disciples &quot;Apocalypse Twins&quot;.

=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Angel has mysteriously reverted somehow to his pre-LifeSeed blue-skinned Archangel form, and appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s new Uncanny X-Men to protect mutantkind at all costs. His mind had also changed, having become nothing more than a silent and mindless predator controlled by Psylocke. Under her psychic leash, Archangel became a heavy hitter in Magneto&#x27;s X-Men.

=== Apocalypse Wars ===
Psylocke and Magneto travel to Green Ridge, Colorado to investigate reports of an up-and-coming preacher who looks identical to the original Angel. They discover that he is indeed the Angel who was created by the Celestial LifeSeed and he is attracting a cult of religious fanatics around him. It is revealed that during the 8-month timeskip after the events of Secret Wars, Angel allied himself with Apocalypse&#x27;s son, Genocide and the Clan Akkaba in exchange for their help in controlling his Horseman of Death split-personality, which has revived as it is permanently linked to his own metal wings. Clan Akkaba are constantly harvesting Angel&#x27;s rapidly-regenerating metal wings (to prevent the Death persona from fully possessing Angel) and grafting them into his clones, creating a mindless clone army of blue-skinned Archangels. The silent Archangel who is a member of Magneto&#x27;s team of X-Men was merely the first such clone who retained trace memories of the original Angel and thus managed to escape to join Magneto&#x27;s X-Men. Magneto and Psylocke are captured, but Psylocke easily escapes. She gets into a fight with Fantomex, who was sent by Magneto as back-up with Mystique, who herself freed Magneto. Psylocke in a panic calls for the Archangel who is their teammate, who then telepathically controls the rest of the clone army into destroying the town, but the clones are all killed. In a flashback, it is revealed that Magneto accidentally found Angel&#x27;s unconscious and injured body in a barn during the 8-month timeskip and helped him recover. Magneto at the time gave up on being a hero, as the rest of the X-Men had either disbanded or fled to Limbo, but then was inspired by Angel to restart his own version of the Uncanny X-Men. It is implied that Angel disappeared after that encounter, only to &quot;reappear&quot; as the silent Archangel. In the present, a chastised and repentant Angel explains to Magneto and Psylocke that he and the silent Archangel are ultimately two half-parts of the same one being, so they physically combine into a new blue-skinned persona. This new Archangel being is unsure of who or what he now was, but was determined to find out. He swore off all violence and returned with Magneto&#x27;s X-Men to their base in the Savage Land.

== Powers and abilities ==
=== As Angel ===

Warren&#x27;s primary power is that of natural flight, due to his large feathered wings. His wings have superhuman strength, and they have a very flexible skeletal structure that enables him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing. His bones are hollow, his body processes food much more efficiently than a normal human body and does not store any excess fat, and he possesses a greater proportionate muscle mass than normal. As a result, his strength, speed, agility, flexibility, endurance, reflexes, coordination, balance, eyesight and hearing are at their peak. Elements of his anatomy are comparable to those of birds, especially birds of prey. His eyes can withstand high-speed winds which would damage the average human eye. He can breathe at high velocities or altitudes, and he can cope with the reduced temperatures at high altitudes for prolonged periods of time, giving him a greater-than-normal capacity to endure low temperatures in areas such as the Arctic. The strength in his natural wings can easily break a man&#x27;s arm or leg, or even put someone through a wall.

While he generally flies below the height of clouds, Angel can reach almost twice this height with little effort. At his absolute maximum, he can reach the highest recorded altitude of a bird in flight — about the height of Mount Everest — but he can only remain that high for a few minutes. Although flight is as natural a mode of transportation for Angel as for a bird, he can only fly nonstop under his own power for around half a day.

He has undergone heavy training with Professor X, especially in mastering his flight indoors. He has demonstrated superior agility, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, and balance while flying, and has been shown defeating superbeings much faster than him (like the Human Torch) by dodging them and having them smash against the ground or a wall at full speed.

Angel is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having defeated several of the werewolf-like &quot;homo superior&quot; when Wolverine is defeated. He is trained in hand-to-hand combat at Xavier&#x27;s school; while dating Psylocke, he receives a considerable amount of martial arts instruction. During his years on the team, he is given extensive training from Wolverine, and when he once surprises Wolverine after taking down some men, he says, &quot;My father spoiled me with more than money.&quot; He also receives further instruction from the Black Widow and Hercules during his days with the Champions.

As the result of a secondary mutation which has been shown inconsistently, Angel also develops a healing factor and can heal others by mixing his blood with theirs, provided they have a matching blood type to Warren&#x27;s. His healing blood does not work with Nightcrawler. Although powerful, this mutation varies in potency. At times, he cannot aid the terminally wounded; at others, he can actually raise the recently dead. This secondary mutation suggests that he may be descended from the ancient race of Cheyarafim mutants. He is nearly immune to injury because his healing blood is constantly flowing through him. At its onset, he repairs broken bones in days, but his healing abilities have enhanced since then. In an issue of &quot;X-Force&quot; it is apparent that this healing factor comes from his wings as seen when Warren is savagely attacked and his wings are ripped from his body, his healing factor fails to work, and he instead must be healed by Josh Foley. It is revealed that the Celestial Technology bonded to him by Apocalypse prevents Elixir from regenerating his wings. They eventually regenerate on their own.

Aside from his superhuman powers, the original Warren was a most-highly capable businessman and the new Warren has accordingly retained or &quot;inherited&quot; his position as the primary stockholder and chairman emeritus (former chairman) of the board-of-directors of Worthington Industries.

=== As Archangel ===
Archangel possesses a set of metal techno-organic wings grafted onto him by the genetic engineering of Apocalypse when Apocalypse renames him the Horseman of Death. These wings are composed of a hard, sharp, organic material that resembles the &quot;organic steel&quot; of Colossus&#x27; body. The wings give him the ability to project his metallic feathers out from his wings at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel, tipped with poison.

Archangel does not have complete control over his feathers, which sometimes shoot from his wings against his conscious will in response to his unconscious aggressive drives. The feathers are laced with a neural inhibitor chemical, generated by Archangel&#x27;s body, which induces temporary paralysis.
These wings allow him to fly at speeds much faster than his natural, feathered wings. The edges of these metal wings are also razor sharp, allowing them to be used as weapons.

While he believes he has lost his metal wings when he re-grows his organic ones, the Celestial Technology never leaves his system, and his natural-appearing wings contain the Celestial technology. When implanted into regular human beings, the technology induces a transformation similar to that of Warren&#x27;s. When his feathered wings are severed from his body by Wolfsbane, his metal wings grow back in their place. Furthermore, his skin reverts to blue and his old Archangel costume appears. Warren&#x27;s body returns to normal — the metal wings being replaced with the appearance of his feathered ones — indicating that Warren has the ability to switch between metal and feathered wings and his Angel and Archangel appearances. As Archangel, Warren retains his healing factor. The wings have been shown capable to heal Apocalypse.. In issue 14 of &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot;, Dr. Nemesis questions the rate that they would grow as the biology is different from Colossus&#x27; armor.

After the death of Warren and the Archangel persona via the Life Seed, Angel comes back to life as an amnesiac with healing powers far beyond what he was ever able to originally accomplish, as demonstrated when he resurrects a recently dead dog.

=== Time-displaced Warren Worthington III ===

The time displaced Warren, from All-New X-Men, initially started with feathered wings, but during The Black Vortex saga he was imbued with Cosmic wings. These new wings allow him to travel at faster than light speeds. He can also discharge cosmic blasts that can destroy spaceships. He can feed off cosmic energy, thus survive in outer space and without sustenance. These wings were surgically removed by a younger version of Cable and replaced with wings that Mimic had copied from Angel in their original meeting, allowing him to be returned to the past with no effect on the timeline.

== Reception ==

Lealos of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Warren 1st in their &quot;X-Men: 10 Most Powerful Horsemen Of Apocalypse&quot; list, while Lukkas Shayo included him in their &quot;10 Iconic New York City-Based Marvel Superheroes We Haven&#x27;t Seen In The MCU&quot; list.

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Angel: Revelations&quot; (2008) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Angel: Revelations&quot; #1 was the 106th best selling comic book in May 2008. &quot;Angel: Revelations&quot; #2 was the 125th best selling comic book in June 2008.

James Hunt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Angel: Revelations&quot; #1 a &quot;prodigious talent on display,&quot; saying, &quot;The religious imagery gives the book a consistent motif and the literal &quot;angel&quot; aspect of the character takes a lot more focus that it usually receives when the character is dealt with. Of all the X-Men, Warren probably has the &quot;origin&quot; story that relates itself most directly to the idea of emergent mutant powers being a metaphor for adolescence. Being a Marvel Knights title, it&#x27;s unclear whether this origin is &quot;in-continuity&quot; or not, but ultimately it shouldn&#x27;t matter. If the rest of the series is as good as this opening issue, it&#x27;s going to be an utterly beautiful read and, if you&#x27;re reading this at a time when it&#x27;s too late to start collecting the series, it&#x27;ll almost certainly be worth splashing out for the hardcover just to make sure the format does the story justice. It&#x27;s definitely good to see Marvel happy to put out a series that looks a little more experimental than their usual fare, and if there&#x27;s any justice in the industry it&#x27;ll pay off nicely.&quot; Bryan Joel of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Angel: Revelations&quot; #1 a grade of 8.1 out of 10, writing, &quot;Truthfully, Angel&#x27;s origin probably needed an update. Considering the sort of character he&#x27;s become and the advancements his powers eventually received, the origin doesn&#x27;t really line up. Thankfully, Aguirre-Sacasa seems to agree and has crafted &quot;Revelations&quot; to remedy that. Issue #1 features the basics of Warren immediately pre-power onset, where he&#x27;s attending a private school and worrying about the changes to his body. The script also interjects a couple scenes of more sinister things going on, which elevates this above the level of simple rehash. There almost seems to be more attention paid to religion, a pet theme of Aguirre-Sacasa&#x27;s; the title of this series isn&#x27;t just a play on words. Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m surprisingly interested to see how this all plays out. One of the main selling points, though, is the art by Adam Pollina. Probably most renowned for his extended run on the first volume of &quot;X-Force&quot;, his work in &quot;Revelations&quot; couldn&#x27;t be further from the tradition style seen there. Now he&#x27;s somewhere between Skottie Young and... Salvador Dali, perhaps? But in a good way. I can definitely see how the weird, deformed style will bug some readers, but I think it&#x27;s deeply engaging and gives the whole issue a more spiritual and mystical feel. It might not be exactly in step with an Angel series, but it&#x27;s at least something different and I appreciate that.&quot;

==== &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; (2011) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 was the 161st best selling comic book in March 2011.

Ryan K. Lindsay of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 &quot;as much fun as you want, but as pithy as you expect too,&quot; asserting, &quot;A one-shot should be a comic that stands on its own, and this issue certainly does that. It needs to give you enough narrative meat to feel like the money was well invested, and this issue mostly does that. It should elicit some form of strong reaction from you in the few pages it has, and this issue works hard to make you laugh and is more successful than not. See Namor score some bagels and Googam become a broheim. It&#x27;s not earth shattering but it is solid fun and sometimes that&#x27;s just what you need. Pick up this comic and feel the freedom of old funny done-in-one comics just like they did when you were a kid where the parts add up to greater than the actual whole.&quot; David Brothers of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; ranked &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 10th in their &quot;10 Top Marvel Comics Coming in March 2011,&quot; saying, &quot;One of the best things we don&#x27;t see much of any more is the relationship between the original X-Men. The modern series is all about hard decisions, hard edges, and hard core self protection, but back in the day, they were just a bunch of kids who hung out together. Iceman and Angel in particular were pretty fun together, because one was a goofball and the other was a self-styled ladies man. Brian Clevinger has proven that he can do stories like this, where he takes a slice of time and expands on it in a meaningful way, and Juan Doe is a pretty great artist. Add in GOOM, a classic Marvel villain, and you&#x27;ve got a story that I think is going to be a pretty good read. &quot;X-Men First Class&quot; may be dead in name, but these one-shots are doing a pretty good job of keeping the feeling alive.&quot;

== Other versions ==
=== Time-displaced Warren Worthington III ===
==== All-New X-Men ====

When Beast decides to travel back in time to recruit the original X-Men to stop Scott committing mutant genocide, Angel accompanies his teammates into the future, but initially prefers to return to the past rather than remain in such a twisted present. Even after his teammates vote to remain until they have saved the future, Angel expresses curiosity about what has happened to his own future self, as no reference has been made to his present condition. The next day, the rebirthed Angel finds the younger Angel who asks him why he has metallic wings; the older Angel ignores the question and invites his younger self to go flying. While flying above the skies of New York, the two Angels become caught up in H.Y.D.R.A.&#x27;s attack on Avengers Tower. Together, the two heroes are able to defeat the terrorists and capture Madame Hydra.

==== Joining Cyclops and gaining cosmic wings ====
Frustrated after seeing what will happen to himself in the future, the younger Angel defects from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and joins the older Cyclops&#x27; new team of outlaw X-Men. After the 2013 &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; storyline, the rest of the displaced X-Men also join Cyclops&#x27; team, except for young Cyclops, who joins his father Corsair and the Starjammers. Warren then starts a romantic relationship with X-23. Later, the All-New X-Men accidentally travel to the Ultimate Universe, where Angel and X-23 encounter that universe&#x27;s version of Wolverine&#x27;s son, Jimmy Hudson and the X-Men. During the events of the 2015 storyline &quot;The Black Vortex&quot;, young Warren is imbued with cosmic powers and gains magic wings of light. When asked by X-23 why he risked his life to gain new powers, he said he hoped that changing himself will alter his future and prevent him from being transformed into Archangel.

==== ResurreXion ====
After the X-Men go to war against the Inhumans over the fate of the Terrigen, Angel joins the rest of the time-displaced X-Men in hopes of finally returning them to their own timeline. However they discover that they aren&#x27;t from Earth 616&#x27;s timeline and with no way of figuring out which timeline they&#x27;re from, they become stranded on Earth 616. With this knowledge in mind, Angel and the rest of the time-displaced X-Men leave the main team of X-Men to find their place in the world. Angel joins the rest of the time-displaced X-Men alongside Magneto.

After a series of adventures - which included the discovery that they actually &quot;were&quot; from the true past and the X-Men they had witnessed were actually the disguised Brotherhood of Mutants attempting to change history - the X-Men are forced to return to the past when they are attacked by Ahab, a mutant-hunter from the future, and a younger version of Cable who feels that his future self has lost his way. Part of young-Cable&#x27;s efforts include surgically removing Warren&#x27;s new cosmic wings and replacing them with the wings Mimic copied from Warren in the past. The team eventually return to the past, with Jean planting a psychic block on their memories so that they will forget about their experiences in the future until they catch up with the moment they departed.

=== 1602 ===
In the 1602 timeline, Warren becomes Werner, a young &quot;witchbreed&quot; (as mutants are known in this reality) who hides his mutation using garments sewn by his mother. Unfortunately, he is captured and almost burnt at the stake by the Grand Inquisitor Enrique (a.k.a. Magneto), but rescued at the last moment by Carlos Javier and his students. Safe in England, Werner befriends John Grey unaware that &quot;Master John&quot; is in fact a young woman disguised as a man. This friendship causes jealousy on the part of Scotius Summerisle, who knows of the deception and fears Werner also knows and is trying to court her. They almost come to blows but are reconciled when circumstances lead to Jean&#x27;s death. It then comes to light that Werner is unaware of Master John&#x27;s true gender but states that he &quot;was in love with that young man&quot;.

=== Age of Apocalypse ===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Warren is never remade as Death by Apocalypse, nor does he ever join the X-Men. Instead, as most of New York is destroyed, Angel works with Apocalypse&#x27;s mutant elite, Magneto and his X-Men, and even the Human High Council to maintain and operate a nightclub aptly named Heaven, where humans and mutants can intermingle. When two of his employees, Scarlett MacKenzie and Karma, are apprehended and later killed, Angel finally chooses a side. Strapping himself down with a number of bombs, he attacks Apocalypse&#x27;s citadel in a suicide run. His sacrifice shuts down the protective shields surrounding the citadel, providing the X-Men with a much needed entrance.

=== Earth-5701 ===
In Earth-5701, an Age of Apocalypse-like reality seen in &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; #15, Warren has also been turned into Death and helps Apocalypse conquer the world.

=== Earth X ===
In this alternate universe of &quot;Earth X&quot;, Warren loses his fortune and becomes an authentic angel, who helps anybody who needs him. He joins the New York City Police and his old friend Iceman to protect the world-altering Torch of the city against the forces of Mephisto. Later, he travels with Mister Fantastic and others to the Negative Zone in the search for Paradise.

=== Exiles ===
Archangel appeared in the comic book &quot;Exiles&quot; as a member of Weapon X, a more ruthless version of the self-titled reality hopping team. This Archangel, hailing from Earth-714, appears very much like his Earth-616 counterpart, even wearing a costume very similar to the one the 616-version wears at the time. Of course, this Archangel, since he is selected for Weapon X rather than the Exiles themselves, is more savage, employing the excessive use of automatic weapons. Archangel is, at some point, replaced by a sociopathic version of Ms. Marvel after he is supposedly sent home for completing his number of missions. He is actually placed in the Panoptichron gallery of fallen Exiles. Why he is placed there is unknown, but he is one of only five recruits to return home alive and intact, alongside She-Hulk, Beak, Iron Man, and Daredevil.

=== Marvel Zombies ===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, Angel is infected by the zombies Rogue and Ms. Marvel. He participates in a zombie attack on the castle of Doctor Doom. The zombies have detected unaffected humans inside. He later appears in Marvel Zombies 3 when he attacks Jocasta, Ultron and Machine Man, but he is killed soon after. Angel is also confirmed as one of the few X-Men who attack Juggernaut.

=== Mutant X ===
In the alternate reality represented in the comic book &quot;Mutant X&quot;, Warren Worthington is captured by Apocalypse much like he is in the main Marvel timeline. Instead of blue skin and metallic wings, this version of Warren is given chalk white skin, leathery bat-wings, razor sharp claws and fangs, and the ability to breathe fire. Able to shake off Apocalypse&#x27;s brainwashing, but still affected by the horrors he has endured, he becomes bitter, and often lashes out at his teammates in the superhero team the Six. Though he insists on being called the Fallen, his friends still call him Warren, to his chagrin. The Six is a continuation of the original X-Men legacy, in a reality where Alex Summers was the first X-Man instead of his older brother Scott.

When Madelyne Pryor becomes possessed by the Goblin Force and takes over New York, the Fallen defects from the Six alongside her, and vanishes after her defeat. He next appears allied again with Apocalypse against the threat of the Xavier/Shadow King entity. He is one of the very few surviving heroes after the combined attack of the Goblin Force controlled Beyonder and the revived Dracula. He allies himself with a reformed Six.

He makes one final appearance at the end of the series, when Doctor Strange summons the Fallen, along with Xavier, Reed Richards, and others to help Alex prepare for his battle with the Beyonder.

=== New Exiles ===
On the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the New Exiles face a squad of alternate &quot;core X-Men&quot; who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Warren who is codenamed &quot;Krait&quot; and has many similarities to his Archangel Earth-616 appearance.

=== Shadow-X ===
New Excalibur battles an evil counterpart of Angel, who is a member of the Shadow-X, the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X is possessed by the Shadow King. They are brought to Earth-616 as a result of M-Day. He is later killed by one of the Shadow Captains.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
The Ultimate version of Angel (Warren Worthington III) is one of only a few mutants to identifiably be a mutant at birth. Warren comes from millionaire, mutant-bigoted parents who quickly sign guardianship of him over to Charles Xavier. Warren joins the X-Men taking the code name Angel, though he proves to be an inexperienced and reluctant fighter. There is much controversy over Angel joining the X-Men, as there are many protests of angels being a sign of God; also, Rogue does not like the fact that he has the appearance of an angel. On an unauthorized mission to Genosha, Angel and his teammates attempt to rescue Longshot, an accused murderer who is facing a public execution. During the &quot;Magnetic North&quot; storyline, Dazzler and Warren go to the Triskelion in an attempt to rescue Polaris. After Magneto shuts down the power, Dazzler is impaled by one of Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s claws, leaving her in a coma. Angel faces Professor Xavier and takes responsibility. Under the guise of expulsion, Angel joins Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow as a spy for Xavier.

Warren becomes close friends with Nightcrawler, initially due to the fact that they both have physical mutations. Warren gets over his initial attraction to Storm, and after the events in Genosha, engages in a relationship with Dazzler. After Bishop recruits Dazzler in his new team of X-Men, she makes Angel part of the team (despite Bishop&#x27;s protests). While trying to protect the Morlocks he is shot to death by Mister Sinister. Thanks to Jean Grey, he later returns to life. He is seen as a member of Colossus&#x27; enhanced team, his appearance drastically altered through the use of Banshee, the Ultimate version of Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH), resulting in Warren having a bald eagle-like head and feathered upper torso. The mutation seems to have progressed, as he is now completely feathered and has talons and double-jointed knees.

During the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; event, Warren is brutally killed by Sabertooth.

Angel&#x27;s powers include feathered wings, hollow bone structure, and zero body fat, allowing flight. He also has heightened strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, endurance, and eyesight. He does not appear to have the healing powers of his 616 Universe counterpart.

=== &quot;X-Men: Fairy Tales&quot; ===
In the first issue of &quot;X-Men Fairy Tales&quot;, based on the Japanese story of Momotarō, Archangel appears as a pheasant. He refuses to fly because he is scared of falling and failing, until Cyclops/Hitomi and Beast/Aoi convince him.

He is named Tenshi, meaning &quot;Angel&quot; in Japanese.

=== &quot;What If...?&quot; ===
In &quot;What If Archangel Fell From Grace?&quot;, Archangel is still the Angel of Death and violently murders criminals. He fights Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Beast and flees after injuring Beast and Cyclops. Cameron Hodge and N&#x27;astirh, Master of Demons, hold Candy Southern captive, causing Archangel to exact vengeance. He teams with N&#x27;astirh to create the door to Inferno, but sacrifices himself by merging with the demon to prevent Inferno.

In &quot;What If Angel killed X-Factor and Horsemen?&quot;, Archangel defected back to X-Factor far more quickly than he did in canon, serving as a proactive force that acted against their enemies. However, as Apocalypse&#x27;s philosophies of &#x27;Survival of the Fittest&#x27; became more and more prominent in his mind, Warren killed not only X-Factor&#x27;s enemies, but even went on to kill X-Factor and Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen, justifying his actions by saying that his victims had proved themselves unworthy of survival by trusting him. The issue concluded with Archangel clashing with Apocalypse to determine whether he was worthy of survival, Apocalypse feeling that Archangel had gone too far as he would have judged some of Archangel&#x27;s victims as worth surviving.

=== Prelude to Deadpool Corps ===
In the second issue of &quot;Prelude to Deadpool Corps&quot;, a universe is shown where Angel is an orphaned kid at Professor X Orphanage for troubled kids. At a dance between Professor X&#x27;s and Emma Frost&#x27;s orphanages, Angel teams up with kid versions of Wolverine and Colossus to take on the kid version of Deadpool (named Kidpool).

<text>Pyro is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Known as St. John Allerdyce, Pyro is depicted as a recurring enemy of the X-Men and later becomes an agent of the U.S. government. He was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne and introduced in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #141 (January 1981) as part of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Pyro has the mutant power to control fire. Pyro and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants are the antagonists in the X-Men story &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; as they attempt to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly, which in an alternate timeline leads to a dystopic future where Mutants are hunted, killed or captured by the Sentinel robots. The assassination is thwarted, and at a later date the Brotherhood become agents of the US government in exchange for a full pardon, and the team becomes known as the Freedom Force.

An Americanized version of Pyro named John Allerdyce appeared in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film franchise produced by 20th Century Fox.

As part of the Dawn of X initiative, Pyro subsequently starred in the &quot;Marauders&quot; series in October 2019 alongside Kitty Pryde, Iceman, Emma Frost, Storm and Bishop.

==Fictional character biography==
===St. John Allerdyce===
Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, St. John Allerdyce is a mutant who possesses the elemental power to control fire and flame, though not generate it. As such, he wields a flamethrower to provide heat for him to control. After years of working in Southeast Asia as a journalist and novelist, Pyro met the mutant Mystique, who later recruited him to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as a professional criminal and subversive. With the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he attempted to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly, and first battled the X-Men. With the Brotherhood, he later battled the Avengers, and then the X-Men again. Though he never served under the team&#x27;s original leader, Magneto, Pyro did work with the Brotherhood under the command of several of Magneto&#x27;s subordinates who alternately supervised the group.

Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood later offered the team&#x27;s services to the United States government in exchange for protection and an official pardon for its crimes, and was renamed Freedom Force. As part of their first mission, the team captured Magneto. With Freedom Force, he next captured the Avengers on behalf of the federal government. Later, he clashed with the original X-Factor in seeking to arrest Rusty Collins. With Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and was present at the X-Men&#x27;s apparent demise. With Freedom Force, he battled Cyclops and Marvel Girl, sought to arrest Rusty Collins again, battled the New Mutants, and finally arrested both Rusty and Skids. He and Blob under Spiral&#x27;s orders attempted to capture a young mutant girl named Amanda, but were defeated by Daredevil.

Pyro later teamed with Blob and Avalanche against the Avengers during the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; storyline.

During Freedom Force&#x27;s final mission, the team confronts a group of Iraqi operatives known as Desert Sword in Kuwait. There are fatalities on both sides. Super Sabre is decapitated and Pyro kills Desert Sword operative Veil. Ultimately, Freedom Force is defeated and Pyro and Blob are abandoned in Kuwait and captured. Blob and Pyro are forced to serve as bodyguards to the country&#x27;s military commanders. Later, Toad buys their release. Blob and Pyro join the Toad&#x27;s new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and with them battled X-Force.

Some years later, Pyro contracted the Legacy Virus, a fatal disease affecting mainly mutants. He went to great lengths to find a cure (encountering Cecilia Reyes at one point), several times at the expense of others, but was unsuccessful in his search and succumbed to the virus. This was just after saving Senator Robert Kelly from a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This act of heroism was also instrumental in changing Senator Kelly&#x27;s opinion on mutants as a whole, and led to his decision to work toward peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants.

During the &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline, Pyro is resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene&#x27;s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.

Pyro was confirmed to have remained alive after the events of &quot;Necrosha&quot; as he battled both the original adult Iceman and the time-displaced teenage version in an attack in New York City, the older Bobby Drake confirming to his younger self that Pyro was indeed the original Australian version back from the dead.

Pyro then joined a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Magneto&#x27;s clone Joseph, though Joseph claimed to be Magneto. He briefly battled the X-Men, though when Joseph&#x27;s identity had been revealed, Pyro attempted to defend him against his teammate Juggernaut. Pyro was swiftly knocked unconscious by a punch from Cyclops.

Pyro later travels to Krakoa and reveals that he was used as a lab-rat and was one of the first subjects to be resurrected by the &quot;Five&quot; and because of that he lost all memories of what he did after he was resurrected by Selene. He has since joined Kitty Pryde&#x27;s team of Marauders.

===Simon Lasker===
Introduced in &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; by Marc Guggenheim and Ardian Syaf, Simon Lasker is an American teenage mutant who manifested pyrokinesis by accidentally burning down his high school building and killing everyone inside it. Suddenly appearing before him in the form of Professor X, a somehow-repowered Mesmero brainwashed him into becoming the new Pyro and to join his Brotherhood of Mutants which was secretly funded by anti-mutant activist Lydia Nance.

Pyro&#x27;s first mission with the Brotherhood of Mutants was to kidnap Mayor Bill de Blasio and hold him hostage. The X-Men arrived and defeated the Brotherhood of Mutants who are then arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

As Lydia Nance still had a use for the Brotherhood of Mutants, she orchestrated Mesmero&#x27;s escape from the Box. Mesmero once again lured Pyro and the second Avalanche into helping him out. They were to attack a yacht that was owned by the Heritage Initiative at the time of its fundraiser. The group fought the X-Men alongside the NYPD. The Brotherhood of Mutants got away and fell back to their base. When Mesmero stated that the Brotherhood of Mutants are still under Lydia Nance&#x27;s paycheck, Pyro took his leave since he did not want to work for an anti-mutant activist. Avalanche then demanded from Mesmero to get Pyro&#x27;s cut. After finding the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Pyro revealed his history to the X-Men and wanted to join up with them. While Iceman was wary of this, Rogue vouched for him.

Pyro was revealed to be gay in &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; (vol. 2) #32, in a post-sex scene with Iceman, and withdrawn from the X-Men to help his mother.

==Powers and abilities==
St. John Allerdyce is a mutant who has the Elemental power to manipulate flame by shaping it as he desires, increasing or decreasing its heat, intensity and size. However, as he cannot actually create fire himself, he consequently wears a specially insulated costume with a built-in flamethrower that can throw a stream of flame a maximum distance of . He can Elementally manipulate the flame to do whatever he desires and sometimes induces it to take semi-solid form as an animate flame being. These creations, though capable of movement and of grasping or carrying solid objects, are not alive and do not think or act on their own. The degree of concentration necessary for Pyro to manipulate a flame construct is directly proportional to the construct&#x27;s size, power and flame. Though he cannot be burned by a flame which he is manipulating, Pyro can be harmed by any fire that he does not mentally control. It is generally accepted that he must be able to see a flame to take control of it (hence limiting his mental influence to approximately 100 yards). Any of Pyro&#x27;s fiery creations will immediately revert to ordinary flame if he turns his interest from it. After his return, Allerdyce&#x27;s powers have increased in some ways, showing he can prevent the gunpowder in a loaded pistol from igniting as well as generate fires on his own accord, without need of a heat source or fuel generated ignition point to get malleable combustible substance.

Simon Lasker has the mutant ability to elementally generate, control and manipulate fire; similar to the original Pyro. But unlike Allerdyce, he seems capable of igniting fire on his own and does not require outside sources of existing flame to manipulate.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Pyro is one of the many mutants imprisoned by Mister Sinister after refusing to join his Elite Mutant Force and was apparently experimented on, gaining the ability to generate heat. He was later killed alongside Avalanche, Artemis, Phantazia and Newt during an escape attempt.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot;, Pyro was a member of the mutant supremacist government in Australia. He works alongside the powerful Exodus. He works closely with Vanisher in the oppression of the human population. They gain the attention of the Hulk when his friends, a community of Aboriginal Australians, are harassed. Here Pyro retains his background as a writer and a sentimental side; he briefly crafts a tiny pixie out of the flame from a match, commenting to the Vanisher, &quot;I used to write Gothic romances. I&#x27;ve got more layers than a parfait&quot;.

===Marvel Adventures===
In &quot;Marvel Adventures Spider-Man&quot;, the Human Torch shows up at Midtown High for a demonstration, but loses control of his powers. Spider-Man (then Peter Parker) spots a mysterious figure who turns out to be Pyro, who is manipulating Human Torch out of jealousy that he doesn&#x27;t get credit for being a fire manipulator. Peter knocks him into the school swimming pool, where Human Torch knocks him out.

===Marvel Zombies===
Pyro is shown as a zombie twice in the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; reality. He is seen in the background along with a group of zombies trying to catch Blob. He is also seen fighting the X-Men alongside zombie versions of Freedom Force.

===Ronin===
Pyro works as a murderous mutant ninja for the Japanese-based Hellfire Club. He battles the X-Men alongside fellow ninja Iceman and Avalanche.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #80 Pyro is seen fighting the Friends of Humanity and meeting Nightcrawler. This Pyro is a member of the Ultimate Morlocks, and a supporter of Xavier&#x27;s cause who tells Nightcrawler that he would have liked to have been a member of the X-Men. In issue #82 he is rescued from a Sentinel attack by Bishop and Storm, who recruit him as a member of their new team of X-Men. It is hinted by Bishop that the recruits are &quot;legends&quot; of the future, meaning that Pyro may have much potential. He briefly works undercover in the Mutant Liberation Front, after pretending to defect to their side. Stryfe, the leader of the group, revealed his knowledge of Pyro&#x27;s intentions but allows him to continue watching, but eventually Stryfe abandons most of the Front, including Pyro, at the mercy of some approaching Sentinels. Pyro is later rescued by Beast, and aids the team in defeating the Sentinels.

Bishop dies in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #90 and Xavier returns alive from the future. Pyro moves into the Xavier Institute and becomes one of Xavier&#x27;s X-Men. Pyro begins wondering if he belongs at the Institute and Wolverine assures him that he does.

Pyro has apparently defected from the Xavier Institute to Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants, as he and Mastermind are shown capturing the superhero Valkyrie in &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot; #4. It is as yet unknown how or why Pyro joined Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood. His face is not scarred and he is now immune to flame, despite previous portrayals.

During the confrontation, he and Mastermind find the unconscious Valkyrie. Pyro suggest they &#x27;play&#x27; with her. The woman wakes up, slays Mastermind and despite Pyro&#x27;s claims of innocence, cuts off his hands.

Ultimate Pyro, like his Age of Apocalypse counterpart, can generate flames without the aid of machines. He also is not as resistant to fire, as his face is horribly burned and most of his body is bandaged. At one point, he cauterizes a bullet wound by pressing flames against it. Because he burnt off his nerves, he does not feel pain.

<doc id="303434" wikidata="Q426316" url="?curid=303434" title="United Church of Christ">
<text>The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a socially liberal mainline Protestant Christian denomination based in the United States, with historical and confessional roots in the Congregational, Restorationist, Continental Reformed, and Lutheran traditions, and with approximately 4,600 churches and 712,000 members. The UCC is a historical continuation of the General Council of Congregational Christian churches founded under the influence of New England Puritanism. Moreover, it also subsumed the third largest Calvinist group in the country, the German Reformed. Notably, its modern members have theological and socio-political stances which are often very different from those of its predecessors.

The Evangelical and Reformed Church, General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches, and the Afro-Christian Convention, united on June 25, 1957, to form the UCC. The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches were themselves the result of earlier unions and had their roots in Congregational, Lutheran, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. At the end of 2014, the UCC&#x27;s 5,116 congregations claimed 979,239 members, primarily in the U.S. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 0.4 percent, or 1 million adult adherents, of the U.S. population self-identified with the United Church of Christ.

The UCC maintains full communion with other Protestant denominations, and many of its congregations practice open communion. The denomination emphasizes participation in worldwide interfaith and ecumenical efforts. The national leadership and General Synod of the UCC have historically favored culturally liberal views on social issues, such as civil rights, LGBT rights, women&#x27;s rights, and abortion. UCC congregations are independent in matters of doctrine and ministry and may not necessarily support the national body&#x27;s theological or moral stances. It self-describes as &quot;an extremely pluralistic and diverse denomination&quot;.

==History==
The United Church of Christ was formed when three Protestant churches, the Evangelical and Reformed Church, the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches and the Afro-Christian Convention united on June 25, 1957. The vote on the resolution had no dissenting votes from the delegates gathered. This union adopted an earlier general statement of unity between the two denominations, the 1943 &quot;Basis of Union&quot;. At the time, the UCC claimed about twomillion members.

On January 23, 1959, 30 theologians, pastors, and laymen finished writing the UCC&#x27;s Statement of Faith. The Statement of Faith was written with the intention of including the essential principles while being &quot;broad enough for persons of varying points of view&quot;. It affirms belief in the divinity of Christ and in the Trinitarian concept of God, but it does not explicitly mention the virgin birth of Jesus.

The UCC adopted its constitution and by-laws on July 4, 1961. The Constitution gives autonomy to local churches, and it provides for a representative-type of governance of regional and national church organizations. Prior to the vote, 3,669 out of 4,036 Congregational churches voted to accept it. There were 367 Congregational Christian churches that decided to stay out. Some of those churches challenged it in court, saying that it was contrary to traditional Congregational principles. Their court challenges were unsuccessful. The vote to adopt the Constitution and by-laws was unanimous among the delegates that met in Philadelphia on July 4, 1961.

The Afro-Christian Convention was a long-ignored &quot;Fifth Stream&quot; that had been neglected voice or visibility, resulting in an official apology from the denomination at the 2023 General Synod in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Beliefs==
There is no UCC hierarchy or body that can impose any doctrine or worship format onto the individual congregations within the UCC. While individual congregations are supposed to hold guidance from the general synod &quot;in the highest regard&quot;, the UCC&#x27;s constitution requires that the &quot;autonomy of the Local Church is inherent and modifiable only by its own action&quot;.
Within this locally focused structure, however, there are central beliefs common to the UCC. The UCC often uses four words to describe itself: &quot;Christian, Reformed, Congregational and Evangelical&quot;. While the UCC refers to its &quot;Evangelical&quot; characteristics, it springs from (and is considered part of) mainline Protestantism as opposed to some doctrines in Evangelicalism. The word evangelical, in this case, more closely corresponds with the original Lutheran origins meaning &quot;of the gospel&quot; as opposed to the Evangelical use of the word. UCC is generally theologically liberal, and the denomination notes that the &quot;Bible, though written in specific historical times and places, still speaks to us in our present condition&quot;.

The motto of the United Church of Christ comes from John 17:21: &quot;That they may all be one&quot;. The denomination&#x27;s official literature uses broad doctrinal parameters, emphasizing freedom of individual conscience and local church autonomy.

===Historic confessions===
In the United Church of Christ, creeds, confessions, and affirmations of faith function as &quot;testimonies of faith&quot; around which the church gathers rather than as &quot;tests of faith&quot; rigidly prescribing required doctrinal consent. As expressed in the United Church of Christ constitution:

The United Church of Christ acknowledges as its sole Head, Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. It acknowledges as kindred in Christ all who share in this confession. It looks to the Word of God in the Scriptures, and to the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, to prosper its creative and redemptive work in the world. It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper or Holy Communion.

The denomination, therefore, looks to a number of historic confessions as expressing the common faith around which the church gathers, including:
* The Apostles&#x27; Creed,
* The Nicene Creed,
* The Heidelberg Catechism (inherited from both the German Calvinist and German Evangelical heritages),
* Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism (inherited from the German Evangelical heritage),
* The Kansas City Statement of Faith (a 1913 statement in the Congregationalist tradition),
* The Evangelical Catechism (a 1927 catechism in the German Evangelical tradition), and
* The Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ (written at the founding of the denomination).

===Studies and surveys of beliefs===
In 2001, the Hartford Institute for Religion Research conducted a &quot;Faith Communities Today&quot; (FACT) study that included a survey of United Church of Christ beliefs. Among the results of this were findings that in the UCC, 5.6% of the churches responding to the survey described their members as &quot;very liberal or progressive&quot;, 3.4% as &quot;very conservative&quot;, 22.4% as &quot;somewhat liberal or progressive&quot;, and 23.6% as &quot;somewhat conservative&quot;. Those results suggested a nearly equal balance between liberal and conservative congregations. However, the self-described &quot;moderate&quot; group was the largest at 45%. Other statistics found by the Hartford Institute show that 53.2% of members say &quot;the Bible&quot; is the highest source of authority, 16.1% say the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, 9.2% say &quot;Reason&quot;, 6.3% say &quot;Experience&quot;, and 6.1% say &quot;Creeds&quot;.

David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, who has studied the United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church&#x27;s pronouncements are often more liberal than the views in the pews but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements. Starting in 2003, a task force commissioned by General Synod 24 studied the diverse worship habits of UCC churches. The study can be found online and reflects statistics on attitudes toward worship, baptism, and communion, such as &quot;Laity (70%) and clergy (90%) alike overwhelmingly describe worship &#x27;as an encounter with God that leads to doing God&#x27;s work in the world. &quot;95 percent of our congregations use the Revised Common Lectionary in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching&quot; and &quot;96 percent always or almost always have a sermon, 86 percent have a time with children, 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the Prayer of Our Savior/Lord&#x27;s Prayer.&quot; Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an &quot;entry into the Church Universal&quot; was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as &quot;a meal in which we encounter God&#x27;s living presence&quot;, laity emphasized &quot;a remembrance of Jesus&#x27; last supper, death, and resurrection&quot;.

===Relationships with other denominations===
One of the UCC&#x27;s central beliefs is that it is &quot;called to be a united and uniting church&quot;. Because of this, the UCC is involved in Churches Uniting in Christ, an organization seeking to establish full communion among nine Protestant denominations in America. Currently, the UCC has entered into an ecumenical partnership with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and through &quot;A Formula of Agreement&quot;, signed in 1997, is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Reformed Church in America. Internationally, the UCC has been in full communion with the Union Evangelischer Kirchen (Union of Evangelical Churches) in Germany since 1981. The UEK is an organization of 13 Reformed and United Landeskirchen (regional churches) within the federation of Protestant churches known as the Evangelical Church of Germany.

In 1982, the World Council of Churches (WCC) published &quot;Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry&quot;, a document that has served as a foundation for many ecumenical recognition agreements. As a WCC member church, the United Church of Christ issued a response as part of the process to work toward a statement of common theological perspectives.

On October 17, 2015, representatives of the United Church of Christ and the United Church of Canada came together in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to sign a historic full communion agreement. This agreement was approved at the 30th General Synod of the UCC and the 42nd General Council of the United Church of Canada in the summer of 2015 and signifies the mutual desire of both denominations to work in cooperation and openness in the areas of worship, mission, witness, ministry and the proclamation of a common faith. This agreement will allow the two denominations to recognize the validity of each other&#x27;s sacraments and ordination of ministers and opens up the possibility of ministers being called to serve in congregations of either denomination.

The UCC is a member of Christian Churches Together (CCT), an interdenominational fellowship in the United States aimed at strengthening ties between different branches of Christianity. Through the CCT, the United Church of Christ is in communication with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for cooperation towards shared issues, as well as involvement in theological dialogue.

===Relationships with other religions===
The United Church of Christ facilitates bilateral dialogues with many faith groups, including members of the Jewish and Muslim communities. This includes membership in the National Muslim-Christian Initiative.

==Structure==

Quoting the United Church of Christ Constitution, &quot;The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the local church.&quot; An interplay of wider interdependence with local characterizes the organization of the UCC. Each &quot;setting&quot; of the United Church of Christ relates &quot;covenantally&quot; with other settings, their actions speaking &quot;to but not for&quot; each other.

The &quot;ethos&quot; of United Church of Christ organization is considered &quot;covenantal&quot;. The &quot;structure&quot; of UCC organization is a mixture of the congregational and presbyterian polities of its predecessor denominations. With ultimate authority given to the local church, many see United Church of Christ polity as closer to congregationalism; however, with ordination and pastoral oversight of licensed, commissioned and ordained ministers conducted by Associations, and General Synod representation given to Conferences instead of congregational delegates, certain similarities to presbyterian polity are also visible.

The UCC&#x27;s &quot;Covenantal Polity&quot; is best expressed in Article III of the 1999 revision of the Bylaws and Constitution of the United Church of Christ.

Within the United Church of Christ, the various expressions of the church relate to each other in a covenantal manner. Each expression of the church has responsibilities and rights in relation to the others, to the end that the whole church will seek God&#x27;s will and be faithful to God&#x27;s mission. Decisions are made in consultation and collaboration among the various parts of the structure. As members of the Body of Christ, each expression of the church is called to honor and respect the work and ministry of each other part. Each expression of the church listens, hears, and carefully considers the advice, counsel and requests of others. In this covenant, the various expressions of the United Church of Christ seek to walk together in all God&#x27;s ways.

===Local churches===

The basic unit of the United Church of Christ is the &quot;local church&quot; (also often called the &quot;congregation&quot;). Local churches have the freedom to govern themselves, establishing their own internal organizational structures and theological positions. Thus, local church governance varies widely throughout the denomination. Some congregations, mainly of Congregational or Christian Connection origin, have numerous relatively independent &quot;boards&quot; that oversee different aspects of church life, with annual or more frequent meetings (often conducted after a worship service on a Sunday afternoon) of the entire congregation to elect officers, approve budgets and set congregational policy. Other churches, mainly of Evangelical and Reformed descent, have one central &quot;church council&quot; or &quot;consistory&quot; that handles most or all affairs in a manner somewhat akin to a Presbyterian session, while still holding an annual congregational meeting for the purpose of electing officers and/or ratifying annual budgets. Still others, usually those congregations started after the 1957 merger, have structures incorporating aspects of both, or other alternative organizational structures entirely.

In almost all cases, though, the selection of a minister for the congregation is, in keeping with the Reformed tradition of the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot;, vested in a congregational meeting, held usually after a special &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee searches on the congregation&#x27;s behalf for a candidate. Members of the congregation vote for or against the committee&#x27;s recommended candidate for the pastorate, usually immediately after the candidate has preached a &quot;trial sermon;&quot; candidates are usually presented one at a time and not as a field of several to be selected from. Typically the candidate must secure anywhere from 60 to 90 percent affirmative votes from the membership before the congregation issues a formal call to the candidate; this depends on the provisions in the congregation&#x27;s particular constitution and/or by-laws.

Local churches have, in addition to the freedom to hire ministers and lay staff, the sole power to dismiss them also. However, unlike purely congregational polities, the association has the main authority to ordain clergy and grant membership, or &quot;standing&quot;, to clergy coming to a church from another association or another denomination (this authority is exercised &quot;in cooperation with&quot; the person being ordained/called and the local church that is calling them). Such standing, among other things, permits a minister to participate in the UCC clergy pension and insurance plans. Local churches are usually aided in searching for and calling ordained clergy through a denominationally coordinated &quot;search-and-call&quot; system, usually facilitated by staff at the conference level. However, the local church may, for various reasons, opt not to avail itself of the conference placement system, and is free to do so without fear of retaliation, which would likely occur in synodical or presbyterian polities. However, many UCC congregations have constitutions that mandate that their called pastor be an ordained minister approved by the association, while others require that the call of a pastor be approved by the association committee on ministry. Participation in the search and call process is usually considered a sign of the congregation&#x27;s loyalty to the larger denomination and its work.

At the end of 2008, 5,320 churches were reported to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches were reported to have over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members. The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination&#x27;s declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church&#x27;s size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC&#x27;s congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as might happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure.

===Larger organizations===

====Associations====

Local churches are typically gathered together in regional bodies called &quot;Associations&quot;. Local churches often give financial support to the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy within the bounds of the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association&#x27;s main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers&#x27; standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again with the assistance of the ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC.

Associations meet at least once annually to elect officers and board members and set budgets for the association&#x27;s work; fellowship and informational workshops are often conducted during those meetings, which may take place more frequently according to local custom. In a few instances where there is only one association within a conference, or where the associations within a conference have agreed to dissolve, the Conference (below) assumes the association&#x27;s functions.

====Conferences====

Local churches also are members of larger &quot;Conferences&quot;, of which there are 36 in the United Church of Christ. Some cover an individual state, for example the Michigan Conference. Some states have more than one conference—for example Pennsylvania has four. Some cover more than one state—for example the South West Conference covers Arizona and New Mexico. A conference typically contains multiple associations; if no associations exist within its boundaries, the conference exercises the functions of the association as well. Conferences are supported financially through local churches&#x27; contribution to &quot;Our Church&#x27;s Wider Mission&quot; (formerly &quot;Our Christian World Mission&quot;), the United Church of Christ&#x27;s denominational support system; unlike most associations, they usually have permanent headquarters and professional staff. The primary ecclesiastical function of a conference is to provide the primary support for the search-and-call process by which churches select ordained leadership; the conference minister and/or his or her associates perform this task in coordination with the congregation&#x27;s pulpit search committee (see above) and the association to which the congregation belongs (particularly its ministerial committee). Conferences also provide significant programming resources for their constituent churches, such as Christian education resources and support, interpretation of the larger UCC&#x27;s mission work, and church extension within their bounds (the latter usually conducted in conjunction with the national Local Church Ministries division).

Conferences, like associations, are congregationally representative bodies, with each local church sending ordained and lay delegates. Most current UCC conferences were formed in the several years following the consummation of the national merger in 1961, and in some instances were the unions of former Congregational Christian conferences (led by superintendents) and Evangelical and Reformed synods (led by presidents, some of whom served on only a part-time basis). A few have had territorial adjustments since then; only one conference, the Calvin Synod, composed of Hungarian-heritage Reformed congregations, received exemption from the geographical alignments, with its churches scattered from Connecticut westward to California and southward to Florida. Only one conference has ever withdrawn completely from the denomination: Puerto Rico, expressing disapproval of national UCC tolerance of homosexuality (as well as that of a large number of mainland congregations), departed the denomination in 2006, taking all of its churches.

====General Synod====

The denomination&#x27;s churchwide deliberative body is the &quot;General Synod&quot;, which meets every two years. The General Synod consists of delegates elected from the Conferences (distributed proportionally by conference size) together with the members of the United Church of Christ Board (see below), the officers of the denomination, and representatives of so-called &quot;Historically Underrepresented Groups&quot;, such as the disabled, young adults, racial minorities, and gay and lesbian persons.

While General Synod provides the most visible voice of the &quot;stance of the denomination&quot; on any particular issue, the covenantal polity of the denomination means that General Synod speaks &quot;to&quot; local churches, associations, and conferences, but not &quot;for&quot; them. Thus, the other settings of the church are allowed to hold differing views and practices on all non-constitutional matters.

General Synod considers three kinds of resolutions:
* Pronouncements: A Pronouncement is a statement of Christian conviction on a matter of moral or social principle and has been adopted by a two-thirds vote of a General Synod.
* Proposals for Action: A Proposal for Action is a recommendation for specific directional statements and goals implementing a Pronouncement. A Proposal for Action normally accompanies a Pronouncement. (See link above regarding Pronouncements.)
* Resolutions and Other Formal Motions, which may consist of the following three types:
** &quot;Resolutions of Witness&quot;: A Resolution of Witness is an expression of the General Synod concerning a moral, ethical, or religious matter confronting the church, the nation, or the world, adopted for the guidance of the officers, Associated, or Affiliated Ministries, or other bodies as defined in Article VI of the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ; the consideration of local churches, Associations, Conferences, and other bodies related to the United Church of Christ; and for a Christian witness to the world. It represents agreement by at least two-thirds of the delegates voting that the view expressed is based on Christian conviction and is a part of their witness to Jesus Christ.
** &quot;Prudential Resolutions&quot;: A Prudential Resolution establishes policy, institutes or revises structure or procedures, authorizes programs, approves directions, or requests actions by a majority vote..
** &quot;Other Formal Motions&quot;

====National offices: covenanted, affiliated, and associated ministries====
As agents of the General Synod, the denomination maintains national offices comprising four &quot;covenanted ministries&quot;, one &quot;associated ministry&quot;, and one &quot;affiliated ministry&quot;. The current system of national governance was adopted in 1999 as a restructure of the national setting, consolidating numerous agencies, boards, and &quot;instrumentalities&quot; that the UCC, in the main, had inherited from the Congregational Christian Churches at the time of merger, along with several created during the denomination&#x27;s earlier years.

=====Covenanted ministries=====

These structures carry out the work of the General Synod and support the local churches, associations, and conferences. The head executives of these ministries comprise the five member &quot;Collegium of Officers&quot;, which are the non-hierarchical official officers of the denomination. (The Office of General Ministries is represented by both the General Minister, who serves as President of the denomination, and the Associate General minister). According to the UCC office of communication press release at the time of restructure, &quot;In the new executive arrangement, the five will work together in a Collegium of Officers, meeting as peers. This setting is designed to provide an opportunity for mutual responsibility and reporting, as well as ongoing assessment of UCC programs.&quot; The main offices of the Covenanted ministries are at the &quot;Church House&quot;, the United Church of Christ national headquarters at 700 Prospect Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.
* The Office of General Ministries (OGM) is responsible for administration, common services (technology, physical plant, etc.), covenantal relations (ecumenical relations, formal relations to other settings of the church), financial development, and &quot;proclamation, identity and communication&quot;. On July 3, 2023, the General Synod of the United Church of Christ elected Rev. Karen Georgia Thompson as the first woman, and the first African-American woman, to lead the denomination as General Minister and President. 
* Local Church Ministries (LCM) is responsible for evangelism, stewardship and church finance, worship and education, Pilgrim Press and United Church Resources (the publishing house of the United Church of Christ), and parish life and leadership (authorization, clergy development, seminary relations, parish leadership, etc.). The position of Executive Minister of Local Church Ministries is vacant.
* Wider Church Ministries (WCM) is responsible for partner relations* (relations with churches around the world, missionary work, etc.), local church relations* (as relates to world ministries and missions), global sharing of resources, health and wholeness ministry, and global education and advocacy*. The starred &#x27;*&#x27; ministries are carried out through the Common Global Ministries Board, a joint instrumentality of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), based in Indianapolis, Indiana. WCM is sometimes referred to as the United Church Board for World Ministries, the historic successor to the Congregationalist American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and the E&amp;R affiliated Board of International Missions The current Executive Minister for Wider Church Ministries is the Rev. Rev. Jim Moos.
* Justice and Witness Ministries (JWM) is responsible for ministries related to economic justice, human rights, justice for women and transformation, public life and social policy, and racial justice. In addition to its offices in Cleveland, JWM also maintains an office on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The current Executive Minister for Justice and Witness Ministries is Rev. Traci D. Blackmon. JWM also maintains an office called &quot;Minister for Children, Families and Human Sexuality Advocacy&quot; that promotes the Our Whole Lives sex education curriculum.

=====Affiliated ministry=====
The Pension Boards of the United Church of Christ (PB-UCC) operates the employee benefits systems for all settings of the United Church of Christ, including health, dental, and optical insurance, retirement annuity/pension systems, disability and life insurance, and ministerial assistance programs. The Pension Boards offices are located in New York City, where the headquarters of all UCC national bodies had been located prior to their move to Ohio in the early 1990s.

The Insurance Board is a nonprofit corporation collectively &quot;owned&quot; by the Conferences of the United Church of Christ. It is run by a president/CEO and a 19-member Board, with the full corporate board consisting of Conference, Region and Presbytery ministers as well as laypeople. The IB administers a property insurance, liability insurance, and risk management program serving the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church(USA), and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) churches and related entities.

=====Associated ministry=====
United Church Funds (UCF), formerly known as The United Church Foundation, provides low cost, socially responsible, professionally managed Common Investment Funds (CIFs) and other trustee services to any setting of the United Church of Christ. United Church Funds&#x27; offices are also located in New York City.

==Activities==
===Civil Rights Movement===
Everett Parker of the UCC Office of Communication, at the request of Martin Luther King Jr., organized UCC churches in 1959 against television stations in the Southern United States that were imposing news blackouts of information about the then growing Civil Rights Movement. The UCC later won a lawsuit that resulted in a federal court decision that the broadcast airwaves are public, not private, property. That led toward the proliferation of people of color in television studios and newsrooms.

===Social activism===
The UCC national body has been active in numerous traditionally liberal social causes, including support for abortion rights, the United Farm Workers, and the Wilmington Ten.

====Same-sex marriage====
Churches in the UCC may solemnize same-sex unions. A resolution, &quot;In support of equal marriage rights for all&quot;, was supported by an estimated 80 percent of delegates to the church&#x27;s 2005 General Synod, which made the United Church of Christ the first major Christian deliberative body in the U.S. to endorse &quot;equal marriage rights for all people, regardless of gender&quot;. It now is the second-largest Christian denominational entity in the U.S. to support same-sex marriage, after the Presbyterian Church (USA). The resolution was one of 32 actions by the General Synod and other national bodies, beginning in 1969, to support civil rights for LGBTQ persons and urge their full inclusion in the life of the church. The UCC&#x27;s Open and Affirming movement, funded by the Open and Affirming Coalition, is the largest LGBTQ-welcoming church program in the world with more than 1,100 congregations and 275,000 members.

On April 28, 2014, the UCC filed a lawsuit against North Carolina for not permitting same-sex marriage, the first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans in the US. In the lawsuit, the church argued that prohibiting same-sex marriages violated the freedom of religion as the ban forced ministers supportive of same-sex marriage to not act on their beliefs.

Some UCC congregations do not support same-sex marriage. Opponents included the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico (United Evangelical Church in Puerto Rico), three-fourths of which voted to withdraw from the UCC after the 2005 General Synod vote. The Biblical Witness Fellowship, a small conservative evangelical organization within the denomination, opposes the denomination&#x27;s growing support for same-sex relationships.

====Apology Resolution====
The United Church of Christ was recognized in the to Native Hawaiians. Congress recognized the reconciliation made by the UCC in the Eighteenth General Synod for their actions in overthrowing the Kingdom of Hawaii.

====Statement on the relationship between Israel and Palestinians====
United Church of Christ General Synod 25 passed two resolutions concerning the conflict between Israel and Palestinians in the Middle East. One called for using economic leverage to promote peace in the Middle East, including measures such as government lobbying, selective &quot;investment&quot;, shareholder lobbying, and selective &quot;divestment&quot; from companies that profit from the continuing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The other resolution, named &quot;Tear Down the Wall&quot;, called upon Israel to remove the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank. Opponents of the &quot;Tear Down the Wall&quot; resolution noted that the wall&#x27;s purpose is to prevent terrorist attacks and that the resolution does not call for a stop to these attacks. The Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that the July 2005 UCC resolutions on divestment from Israel were &quot;functionally anti-Semitic&quot;. The Anti-Defamation League stated that those same resolutions were &quot;disappointing and disturbing&quot; and &quot;deeply troubling&quot;. In addition to the concerns raised about the merits of the &quot;economic leverage&quot; resolution, additional concerns were raised about the process in which the General Synod approved the resolution. Michael Downs of the United Church of Christ Pension Boards (who would be charged with implementing any divestment of the UCC&#x27;s Pension Board investments) wrote a letter to UCC President John H. Thomas expressing concern &quot;with the precedent-setting implications of voted actions, integrity of process and trust&quot;.

===Sexuality education===
The United Church of Christ, along with the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), created the Our Whole Lives curriculum (commonly known as OWL), which is a lifespan, comprehensive, inclusive, and developmentally appropriate sexuality education program. The Whole Lives includes modules for grades K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, and for Young Adults and Adults. The Our Whole Lives curricula are secular. Congregations who use this program often also use &quot;Sexuality and Our Faith&quot; for the age level they are offering. Sexuality and Our Faith are separate manuals that bring in the UUA principles and scripture used in the UCC to support its teachings. The curriculum is based on guidelines from the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States.

==== Polyamory ====
In 2021, the UCC and the UUA presented &quot;a study on polyamory by the Canadian Unitarian Council&quot; as a part of its sexual education programs. Prior to the sexuality education series, in 2016, the UCC published differing opinions on polyamory in the &quot;UCC Stillspeaking Daily Devotional&quot;, one in opposition and one in favor of affirming polyamory.

===&quot;God Is Still Speaking&quot; identity campaign===

At the 2003 General Synod, the United Church of Christ began a campaign with &quot;emphasis on expanding the UCC&#x27;s name-brand identity through modern advertising and marketing&quot;. Formally launched during the advent season in 2004, the campaign included a coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with national and local television &quot;brand&quot; advertising, known as the &quot;God is Still Speaking&quot; campaign or &quot;The Stillspeaking Initiative&quot;. The initiative was themed around the quotation &quot;Never place a period where God has placed a comma&quot; attributed to Gracie Allen. Campaign materials, including print and broadcast advertising and merchandise, featured the quote and a large comma with a visual theme in red and black. United Church of Christ congregations were asked to opt into the campaign, signifying their support and willingness to receive training on hospitality and evangelism. An evangelism event was held in Atlanta in August 2005 to promote the campaign. Several renewal groups panned the ad campaign for its efforts to create an ONA/progressive perception of the UCC identity despite its actual majority in centrist/moderate viewpoints. According to John Evans, associate professor of sociology at University of California, San Diego, &quot;The UCC is clearly going after a certain niche in American society who are very progressive and have a particular religious vision that includes inclusiveness...They are becoming the religious brand that is known for this.&quot;

==Criticism==
The church&#x27;s diversity and adherence to covenantal polity (rather than government by regional elders or bishops) give individual congregations a great deal of freedom in the areas of worship, congregational life, and doctrine. Nonetheless, some critics, mainly social and theological conservatives, are vocal about the UCC&#x27;s theology, political identity, and cultural milieu.

===Criticism over same-sex marriage===
Following the decision of General Synod 25 in 2005 to endorse same-sex marriage, the UCC&#x27;s Puerto Rico Conference left the church, citing differences over &quot;the membership and ministry of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Christians&quot;. A number of conservative congregations also ended their affiliation with the denomination after the decision in favor of same-sex marriage.

==Barack Obama and the UCC==
A controversy arose over former U.S. president Barack Obama speaking at UCC gatherings, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found that the UCC had adhered to the prohibition against churches campaigning for political candidates.

In 2007, longtime UCC member Barack Obama (then a Democratic presidential candidate) spoke at the UCC&#x27;s Iowa Conference meeting and at the General Synod 26. A complaint filed with the IRS alleged that the UCC promoted Obama&#x27;s candidacy by having him speak at those meetings.

Barry Lynn, an ordained UCC minister and the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, stated that although he personally would not have invited a presidential candidate to speak at the meetings, he believed &quot;the Internal Revenue Service permits this to happen.&quot; The church had consulted lawyers prior to the event to make sure they were following the law and had instructed those in attendance that no Obama campaign material would be allowed in the meeting. Nevertheless, in February 2008, the IRS sent a letter to the church stating that it was launching an inquiry into the matter.

On February 27, 2008, in an open letter to UCC members, Rev. John H. Thomas announced the creation of The UCC Legal Fund, to aid in the denomination&#x27;s defense against the IRS. While the denomination expected legal expenses to surpass six figures, it halted donations after raising $59,564 in less than a week.

In May 2008, the IRS issued a letter that stated that the UCC had taken appropriate steps and that the denomination&#x27;s tax status was not in jeopardy.

==Membership==
At the time of its formation, the UCC had over 2 million members in nearly 7,000 churches. The denomination has suffered a 44 percent loss in membership since the mid-1960s. By 1980, membership was at about 1.7 million and by the turn of the century had dropped to 1.3 million. In 2006, the UCC had roughly 1.2 million members in 5,452 churches. According to its 2008 annual report, the United Church of Christ had about 1.1 million members in about 5,300 local congregations. However the 2010 annual report showed a decline of 31,000 members and a loss of 33 congregations since then. The decline in number of congregations continued through 2011, as the 2011 Annual Report shows 5,100 member churches. As of the 2014 Annual Yearbook of the UCC, membership is listed as 979,239 members in 5,154 local churches. According to the 2023 report for 2022 statistics, the membership had declined to 712,296 members in 4,603 congregations. In the prior decade, from 2012 to 2022, the denomination had dropped from about 998,906 to 712,296 members, an almost 29% decline in a decade.

Membership is concentrated primarily in the Northeast and Midwest. Pennsylvania, a bastion of the German Reformed tradition, has the largest number of members and churches. As of 2000, the state had over 700 congregations and over 200,000 members. The highest membership rates are in the states of Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, situated in the heartland of the American Congregationalist movement.

The United Church of Christ among Christian churches has a highly educated membership, with 46% of members holding graduate or post-graduate degrees. Only Presbyterians (47%), Episcopalians (56%), and Anglicans (60%) ranked higher. The church also claims a disproportionate share of high-income earners.
