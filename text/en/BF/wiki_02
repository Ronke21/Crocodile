<text>The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN; , &quot;MRC&quot;) is the naval force of Canada. The navy is one of three environmental commands within the Canadian Armed Forces. As of February 2024, the RCN operates 12 s, 12 s, 4 s, 4 s, 8 s, and several auxiliary vessels. The RCN consists of 8,400 Regular Force and 4,100 Primary Reserve sailors, supported by 3,800 civilians. Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee is the commander of the Royal Canadian Navy and chief of the Naval Staff.

Founded in 1910 as the Naval Service of Canada () and given royal sanction on 29 August 1911, the RCN was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Army to form the unified Canadian Armed Forces in 1968, after which it was known as Maritime Command () until 2011.

In 2011, its historical title of &quot;Royal Canadian Navy&quot; was restored. The RCN has served in the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan, and numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations.

==History==

===1910–1968===

Established following the introduction of the &quot;Naval Service Act&quot; by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Naval Service of Canada (NSC) was intended as a distinct naval force for Canada, that, should the need arise, could be placed under British control. The bill received Royal Assent on 4 May 1910. Initially equipped with two former Royal Navy vessels, HMCS &quot;Niobe&quot; and HMCS &quot;Rainbow&quot;, King George V granted permission for the service to be known as the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 August 1911.

During the first years of the First World War, the RCN&#x27;s six-vessel naval force patrolled both the North American west and east coasts to deter the German naval threat, with a seventh ship, HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot;, joining the force in 1915. Just before the end of the war in 1918, the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service was established with the purpose of carrying out anti-submarine operations; however, it was disbanded after the armistice of 11 November.
After the war, the RCN took over certain responsibilities of the Department of Transport&#x27;s Marine Service and slowly started to build its fleet, with the first warships specifically designed for the RCN being commissioned in 1932. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Navy had 11 combat vessels, 145 officers and 1,674 men. During the Second World War, the RCN expanded significantly, ultimately gaining responsibility for the entire Northwest Atlantic theatre of war. During the Battle of the Atlantic, the RCN sank 31 U-boats and sank or captured 42 enemy surface vessels, while completing 25,343 merchant crossings. The navy suffered the loss of 33 ships and 1,797 sailors. To gain experience with the operation of aircraft carriers, RCN personnel crewed two Royal Navy escort carriers from 1944 to 1946: , and .
Starting in May 1944, when Canada began drafting plans to assume a larger role in the Pacific Theatre after achieving victory in Europe, the Canadian government recognized that the RCN would require much larger vessels. Canadian naval staff advocated for HMS &quot;Nabob&quot; and HMS &quot;Puncher&quot; to be given back to the Royal Navy in exchange for two light fleet carriers. The Canadian government agreed to acquire two carriers on loan from the Royal Navy, with an option to purchase them, but they were not ready before the war ended. Postwar budget cuts meant that Canada could only afford to operate one aircraft carrier, instead of two as originally planned. The RCN operated from 1946 to 1948, before exchanging it with the Royal Navy for the slightly larger .

From 1950 to 1955, during and after the Korean War, Canadian destroyers maintained a presence off of the Korean peninsula, engaging in shore bombardments and maritime interdiction. During the Cold War, the Navy developed an anti-submarine capability to counter the growing Soviet naval threat. In November 1956, HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot; was chosen to transport men and supplies to Egypt as part of Canada&#x27;s response to the Suez Crisis. In preparation for use as a transport, the ship&#x27;s weapons were stripped, and her complement was reduced to 600 personnel. The initial plan was to embark the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, but that order was rescinded in December. &quot;Magnificent&quot; waited in Halifax until the end of the month, then sailed for Egypt carrying 406 Canadian troops and their vehicles, four Royal Canadian Air Force de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters, and a single H04S helicopter. She returned to Canada in March 1957. Later in 1957, the RCN paid off HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot; and commissioned , which was better suited for jet aircraft. She flew the McDonnell F2H Banshee fighter jet until 1962, as well as various other anti-submarine aircraft until her decommissioning. In the 1960s, the RCN retired most of its Second World War vessels, and further developed its anti-submarine warfare capabilities by acquiring the Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King, and successfully pioneered the use of large maritime helicopters on small surface vessels.

===1968–present===

From 1964 through 1968, under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, the RCN, Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army were amalgamated to form the Canadian Forces. This process was overseen by then–defence minister Paul Hellyer. The controversial merger resulted in the abolition of the RCN as a separate legal entity. All personnel, ships, and aircraft became part of Maritime Command (MARCOM), an element of the Canadian Armed Forces. The traditional naval uniform was eliminated and all naval personnel were required to wear the new Canadian Armed Forces rifle green uniform, adopted also by former Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army personnel. Ship-borne aircraft continued to be under the command of MARCOM, while shore-based patrol aircraft of the former Royal Canadian Air Force were transferred to MARCOM. In 1975 Air Command was formed and all maritime aircraft were transferred to Air Command&#x27;s Maritime Air Group. The unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968 was the first time that a nation with a modern military combined its formerly separate naval, land and air elements into a single service.

HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was sold off in 1970, shortly after completing a 16-month, $11 million mid-life refit. The 1970s saw the addition of four s, which were later updated to air defence destroyers, and in the late 1980s and 1990s the construction of twelve s and the purchase of the s. In 1990, Canada deployed three warships to support Operation Friction. Later in the decade, ships were deployed to patrol the Adriatic Sea during the Yugoslav Wars and the Kosovo War. More recently, Maritime Command provided vessels to serve as a part of Operation Apollo and to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia.

Following the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; enshrinement in 1969, MARCOM instituted the French Language Unit, which constituted a francophone unit with the navy. The first was . In the 1980s and 1990s, women were also accepted into the fleet, with the submarine service the last to allow them, beginning in 2001.

Some of the changes that had taken place during the unification of the forces began to be undone. In 1985, MARCOM received new black uniforms, differentiating them from the land-based forces. By 1990, the three senior naval officers of MARCOM had recreated the Naval Board. On 16 August 2011, the government restored the historic names of the Canadian Forces&#x27; three environmental commands: Maritime Command became the &quot;Royal Canadian Navy&quot;, Air Command the &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force,&quot; and Land Force Command the &quot;Canadian Army.&quot;

As of August 2015, with the loss of area air defence and (temporarily) resupply capabilities, the RCN was then classified as a Rank 5 navy (offshore regional coastal defence) on the Todd-Lindberg navy classification system of naval strength, dropping from Rank 3 (multiregional power projection) in 2005.

==Structure==
The RCN is headquartered at National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) in Ottawa, Ontario. Since 1968, the RCN has been an environmental command of the Canadian Armed Forces and since 2012 it has been charged with maintaining and generating forces for the Canadian Joint Operations Command.

=== Naval Staff Headquarters ===

The RCN is directed through Naval Staff HQ by the Commander of the RCN, as the Chief of Naval Staff, whose mission is to lead the strategic development and generation of combat capable multi-purpose maritime forces and to provide advice in support of maritime operations.

=== Maritime Forces Atlantic ===
The RCN&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet, known as Canadian Fleet Atlantic is co-located with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), with headquarters at CFB Halifax in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is supported by CFS St. John&#x27;s in Newfoundland. Attached to MARLANT and CFB Halifax is the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s 12 Wing Shearwater, based at Shearwater Heliport, which provides shipborne air support for the Atlantic Fleet. The RCAF&#x27;s 14 Wing Greenwood provides fixed-wing air support for MARLANT through 404 Maritime Patrol and Training Squadron and 405 Maritime Patrol Squadron. Other Atlantic Fleet facilities are CFAD Bedford, an ammunition depot, and two radio stations, Naval Radio Section (NRS) Newport Corner and NRS Mill Cove.

The Atlantic Fleet, with 18 warships and a number of auxiliary vessels, is responsible for Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone on the East Coast, as well as Canada&#x27;s area of responsibility in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Arctic Ocean.

===Maritime Forces Pacific===
The RCN&#x27;s Pacific Fleet, known as Canadian Fleet Pacific is co-located with Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC), with headquarters at CFB Esquimalt in British Columbia, in the Greater Victoria region. MARPAC consists of over 4,000 naval personnel and 2,000 civilian personnel.

Comprising 15 warships and several auxiliary vessels homeported in Esquimalt, the Pacific Fleet is responsible for Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone on the West Coast and Canada&#x27;s area of responsibility in the Pacific Ocean and the western Arctic Ocean. Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Breton provides repair and maintenance services to the Pacific Fleet. The Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron, based at Patricia Bay Heliport but under the control of 12 Wing Shearwater, provides shipborne helicopter support for the Pacific Fleet, while 19 Wing Comox provides fixed-wing maritime air support for MARPAC through 407 Long Range Patrol Squadron. Other Pacific Fleet facilities are CFAD Rocky Point, an ammunition depot, and Naval Radio Section Aldergrove.

=== Canadian Forces Naval Reserve ===

The Canadian Forces Naval Reserve is the Primary Reserve component of the RCN. The primary mission of the NAVRES is to force generate sailors and teams for CAF operations, including: domestic safety operations as well as security and defence missions, while at the same time supporting the Navy&#x27;s efforts in connecting with Canadians through the maintenance of a broad national presence.

==Fleet==
===Warships===

The RCN operates twelve frigates, four patrol submarines, four Arctic and offshore patrol ships, twelve coastal-defence vessels and eight unarmed patrol/training vessels. The surface ships, which carry the designation His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship (HMCS), consist of twelve &quot;Halifax&quot;-class multi-role patrol frigates, twelve coastal defence vessels and four offshore patrol vessels of the . In addition to the surface vessels, the RCN operates four &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines that were acquired from the Royal Navy in 1998. These warships carry the designation His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Submarine. The RCN also maintains and operates , a historic sailing ship launched in 1921 which was commissioned in 1952 as a sail-training ship. Thus, &quot;Oriole&quot; is the oldest commissioned ship in the RCN. The RCN&#x27;s ceremonial flagship is , a which served from 1943 until 1963.

On 19 September 2014, the RCN announced the decommissioning of its two &quot;Protecteur&quot;-class resupply ships, along with two &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. The Naval Tactical Operations Group (NTOG; ), established in 2015, has units based on warships to provide enhanced naval boarding capability.

===Auxiliary vessels===
The RCN operates auxiliary vessels to support the Canadian Forces. These vessels are not warships and do not carry the HMCS designation. Among the auxiliary ships operated by the navy are eight patrol class training tenders, and five harbour tugs. is an interim replenishing vessel serving in the RCN with a mixed naval and civilian crew since January 2018 replacing contracted replenishment oilers until replacements can be commissioned. The Naval Large Tugboat project is intended to secure four new tugs to replace the Glen class and &quot;Firebrand&quot; with vessels with combined tug and firefighting capabilities, and is being conducted with shipbuilder Ocean Industries Inc, with project completion expected in 2024.

===Aircraft===

Since 1975, all aircraft supporting the RCN are operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force through 1 Canadian Air Division, though this will change upon delivery of an Unmanned Aircraft System expected in 2024 or 2025. CP-140 Aurora and CP-140A Arcturus anti-submarine, ship surveillance and maritime patrol aircraft have been operated by squadrons under 14 Wing at CFB Greenwood and 19 Wing at CFB Comox. The CH-148 Cyclone entered operational service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 2018 and conducts anti-submarine warfare (ASW), surveillance, and search and rescue missions from Royal Canadian Navy frigates. In addition, 18 CP-140 Aurora fixed-wing aircraft for land-based anti-submarine warfare and area surveillance (of which 14 are being modernized and retained for active operations), for land-based maritime surveillance. The RCN has some ships assigned with a UAV:
* CU-176 Gargoyle UAV - &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot;-class AOPV
* AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - &quot;Kingston&quot;-class MCDV

===Future procurement===
The following major projects have been announced by the Government of Canada to modernize the Royal Canadian Navy:
* The , begun as the Joint Support Ship Project, is to replace the previous replenishment vessels with two to three new joint support ships, providing support to naval task forces, a limited sealift capability and limited theatre command and control. The JSS project dates back to 2002–2003, and plans were advanced enough at the time to begin construction, though with the change in government in 2006 that project was cancelled and replaced with a less capable and smaller planned acquisition. The RCN decided to move forward with two replenishment ships under JSS, replacing the two &quot;Protecteur&quot;-class AORs. As part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy (NSPS), the ships will be built by Seaspan Marine Corporation at the Vancouver Shipyards facility in North Vancouver, British Columbia. These &quot;Berlin&quot;-class ships will displace approximately 22,250 tonnes in Canadian service. Construction on the first ship began in November 2019, and a contract to build the second ship was awarded to Seaspan in June 2020. They were initially to be named for battles of the War of 1812, with HMCS &quot;Queenston&quot; as the lead ship, followed by HMCS &quot;Châteauguay&quot;, but the vessels were renamed &quot;Protecteur&quot; and &quot;Preserver&quot; respectively in September 2017.

* The , previously referred to as the Arctic Patrol Ship Project (AOPS), announced in 2007, is a program to build six Polar Class 5 Arctic patrol ships capable of operating in ice and to establish the Nanisivik Naval Facility, a deep water port in Arctic Bay, Baffin Island, Nunavut that would support RCN operations in the Northwest Passage and adjacent waters. The lead ship began construction at the Irving Shipyard in Halifax in September 2015. The projected service entry for the lead ship of the class was to be in 2018 (though that date later slipped by three years). In September 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the name of the first ship in the class would be , named in honour of wartime Canadian naval hero Harry DeWolf and that the class would be named the &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot; class. The RCN accepted &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot; in July 2020, and formally commissioned her in June 2021, following post-acceptance sea trials. The sixth and final ship of the class was launched in December 2024.
* The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates underwent a mid-life extension program that began in 2010 and was completed in November 2016, and it was revealed in the October 2011 announcement of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy that the RCN would procure up to 15 vessels under the Canadian Surface Combatant project to replace both the 12 &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates and the (now decommissioned) 4 &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. In October 2018, a consortium led by BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin Canada was selected as the preferred design for the Canadian Surface Combatant project, with a variant of BAE&#x27;s Type 26 frigate (by that stage already ordered by both the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy) chosen as the platform. In June 2024 construction on the new ships commenced, with test module construction. Full construction is anticipated to begin in 2025. The ships will be known as River-class destroyers.
* The Maritime Helicopter Project is an RCAF procurement project that is replacing the CH-124 Sea Kings with 28 CH-148 Cyclone shipborne anti-submarine warfare helicopters to operate from RCN warships. This project was delayed by several years for a variety of developmental challenges. However, deliveries of the Block 1 airframe began in June 2015 and, as of February 2019, seventeen had been delivered. The initial operating capability for the Cyclone was declared in mid-2018. As of May 2021, 23 helicopters had been delivered of which at least 19 were the Block-2 variant.
* In May 2019, it was announced that Saab Skeldar V-200 UAVs would be acquired for the RCN and Canadian special forces. The light UAVs will be capable of operating from both the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates and &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot;-class patrol ships. In addition, in 2024 the Teal 2 small quadcopter for light ISR tasks was acquired, while the RCN ISTAR project is expected to introduce a larger, longer-range UAV. 
* In December 2022, Kraken Robotics Inc. was awarded a prime contract to provide remote minehunting and disposal systems (RMDS) for the Department of National Defence. The acquisition portion of the contract is likely to be signed in January 2023 and run over 24 months. Two classes of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be delivered to the RCN: lightweight AUVs and operator-portable AUVs, both equipped with AquaPix synthetic aperture sonar. The RMDS also includes a number of combat-variant and training-variant mine disposal systems (MDS), a transportable command centre (TCC) and a computer-based trainer (CBT). The capability is intended to be modular, portable, and operable from various platforms or from shore locations.
* The Canadian Patrol Submarine Project (CPSP) was announced on July 10, 2024. Under the project up to 12 submarines are to be acquired for the RCN. The new submarines will have to be capable of operating for over and for a minimum of 21 days of continuous dived operation. Moreover, the subs need to operate drones, underwater crewed systems, and communication systems compatible with ones operated by the US military. Additionally, the subs must be capable of no less than 60 days of self-sustained operations. The first submarine is not expected to be operational until 2037.

==Personnel==
===Commissioned officers===

Commissioned officers of the Canadian Armed Forces have ranks ranging from the NATO standard ranks of OF-1 to OF-9. The only OF-9 position in the Canadian Forces is the Chief of the Defence Staff, who can be from any of the service elements. The highest position occupied in the current RCN structure is OF-8, a vice-admiral who is the Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy and Chief of the Naval Staff. OF-6 (commodore) to OF-9 (admiral) are referred to as flag officers, OF-3 (lieutenant-commander) to OF-5 (captain (N)) are referred to as senior officers, while OF-2 (lieutenant (N)) and OF-1 (sub-lieutenant) are referred to as junior officers. Naval cadets are referred to as subordinate officers. All except subordinate officers of the Canadian Forces receive a commission from the King of Canada as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces. The commissioning scroll issued in recognition of the commission is signed by the Governor General of Canada as the King of Canada&#x27;s representative and countersigned by the serving Minister of National Defence. Subordinate officers are promoted to acting sub-lieutenant upon receiving their commissions.

Naval officers are trained at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, the Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Saint-Jean, Quebec, Naval Officer Training Centre (NOTC) Venture and Naval Fleet School (Pacific) in Esquimalt, British Columbia, and Naval Fleet School (Atlantic) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Some specialized candidates may be commissioned without attending the Royal Military College; the plan is known as Direct-Entry Officer (DEO) Plan. Senior NCOs may also be offered commissions on the basis that their training and experience give them a comparable basis of knowledge; this is referred to as the Commission-from-the-Ranks (CFR) Plan. NCOs who are offered such promotions are typically petty officer 1st class or higher, with 20 or more years of service.

The RCN rank structure is shown below.
Commander-in-Chief


Officers

===Non-commissioned members===
Non-commissioned members of the RCN have pay grades ranging from OR-1 to OR-9. OR-9 (chief petty officer 1st class), OR-8 (chief petty officers 2nd class) and OR-7 (petty officer 1st class) are known as petty officers, and OR-6 (petty officer 2nd class, referred to as senior non-commissioned officer) form the senior cadre of the non-commissioned members of the military. OR-5 (master sailor) and OR-4 (sailor first class) are referred to as junior non-commissioned officers, while OR-3 (sailor second class) and OR-2 (sailor third class) are referred to as junior ranks.

All Regular Force non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces undergo basic training at the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Recruits then attend occupation-specific training at various locations across Canada.

In August 2020, the term &quot;seaman&quot; was replaced with the gender-neutral term &quot;sailor&quot;.

==Traditions==

===Colours===

The RCN was granted the right to use the King&#x27;s Colour in 1925 by King George V. The Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s Colour (also referred to as the &quot;sovereign&#x27;s colour&quot;) for the Navy has been consecrated and presented four times: in 1939 by King George VI in Esquimalt, in 1959 by Queen Elizabeth II in Halifax, in 1979 by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in Halifax and in 2009 by the Governor General and Commander-in-Chief Michaëlle Jean in Halifax. The colour used by the RCN between 1927 and 1936 was never actually presented but went straight into service in both the Atlantic and Pacific commands. Two identical colours were presented, one for the Atlantic fleet and one for the Pacific fleet, in 1926, 1939 and 1959, but only one colour was presented in 1979 and 2009. This colour is maintained in RCN Headquarters in Ottawa and dispatched to ceremonies whenever it is needed. The current colours consist of a ceremonial standard with the Maple Leaf flag in the top left canton, Elizabeth II&#x27;s personal Commonwealth cypher (a capital &quot;E&quot; on a blue background, surrounded by a circlet of gold roses and laurels, surmounted by a crown) and an anchor and naval crown (from the Canadian Naval Ensign) on the lower right fly. These elements are found in the 1979 and 2009 colours. The colours from 1926, 1939 and 1959 consist of a White Ensign with the Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s cypher, surrounded by the Garter and ensigned with the Crown, in the middle. With the Queen&#x27;s death there will eventually a new Colour when a subsequent monarch chooses to bestow one, but there is no regulation that causes the monarch&#x27;s Colour to automatically change upon their death.

The RCN&#x27;s retired colours are laid up at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa.

===Badge===
The first badge of the Royal Canadian Navy was approved on 31 March 1944. The original design included nine maple leaves, representing the then nine provinces of Canada, and a Tudor Crown. After Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, an updated design was approved on 17 July 1952, which had ten maple leaves. On 26 March 1956, St. Edward&#x27;s Crown replaced the Tudor Crown. This badge remained in use until the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces on 1 February 1968.

When the Royal Canadian Navy became the Canadian Forces Maritime Command in 1968, the branch received a new badge. This badge included a flying eagle along with the anchor, representing the air arm of the navy. It also included a motto, &#x27;Ready Aye Ready&#x27;. Following the reinstatement of the Royal Canadian Navy name in 2011, a new badge was approved in 2016.

The current badge of the Royal Canadian Navy consists of:
* St. Edward&#x27;s Crown
* A fouled anchor, within a circlet
* A compartment of maple leaves
* Motto: (Latin for &#x27;Ready aye ready&#x27;)

===Heritage===
The history of RCN is preserved and presented at the Naval Museum of Halifax in Halifax, the Canadian War Museum, the Naval Museum of Alberta, the Naval Museum of Manitoba, the naval museums at Naval Reserve Headquarters in Quebec City and at CFB Esquimalt as well as the Maritime Museum of British Columbia. Several RCN ships and submarines have been preserved including the destroyer HMCS &quot;Haida, the hydrofoil and the submarines and . The corvette is Canada&#x27;s Naval Memorial. The Royal Canadian Navy Monument is on the banks of the Ottawa River in Ottawa. A monument at Point Pleasant Park in Halifax commemorates members of RCN who have died in peacetime and there are valour memorials in Halifax, Quebec City and Esquimalt.

==Memorials==

* &quot;Royal Canadian Naval Association Naval Memorial (1995)&quot; by André Gauthier (sculptor) was erected on the shore of Lake Ontario in Spencer Smith Park in Burlington, Ontario. The high-cast bronze statue depicts a Second World War Canadian sailor in the position of attention saluting his lost shipmates. The model for the statue was a local Sea Cadet wearing Mike Vencel&#x27;s naval service uniform. Engraved on the black granite base are the names of RCN and Canadian Merchant Navy ships sunk during the Second World War.
* A commemorative plaque in SS Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia unveiled in 1967, &quot;When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany in 1914, Canada and Newfoundland&#x27;s participation was virtually unquestioned. With the onset of the Second World War in 1939 Canadians and Newfoundlanders once more rushed to enlist and were a major factor in the Allied victories in both conflicts. During two world wars, the main duty of the RCN was to escort convoys in the Atlantic and guard merchant vessels against the threat of attack by German submarines. In the Second World War, it also escorted ships in the Mediterranean and to Russia and supported the Allied landings in Sicilian, Italian and Normandy campaigns as well as in the Pacific. The Canadian Merchant Navy&#x27;s duties included the transportation of troops and supplies to the Allied armies and food for the United Kingdom, extremely dangerous work which resulted in considerable losses.&quot;
* At the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia. &quot;In memory of 2200 known Canadian Merchant Seamen and 91 Canadian vessels lost by enemy action and those who served in the cause of freedom – World War I 1914–1918; World War II 1939–1945; Korean Conflict 1950–1953&quot;

<text>The Huayan school of Buddhism (, Wade–Giles: &quot;Hua-Yen,&quot; &quot;Flower Garland,&quot; from the Sanskrit &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot;) is a Mahayana Buddhist tradition that developed in China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). The Huayan worldview is based primarily on the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (, &quot;Flower Garland Sutra&quot;) as well as on the works of Huayan patriarchs, like Zhiyan (602–668), Fazang (643–712), Chengguan (738–839), Zongmi (780–841) and Li Tongxuan (635–730).

Another common name for this tradition is the Xianshou school (&quot;Xianshou&quot; being another name for patriarch Fazang). The Huayan School is known as Hwaeom in Korea, Kegon in Japan and Hoa Nghiêm in Vietnam.

The Huayan tradition considers the &quot;Flower Garland Sutra&quot; to be the ultimate teaching of the Buddha. It also draws on other sources, like the &quot;Mahayana Awakening of Faith,&quot; and the Madhyamaka and Yogacara philosophies. Huayan teachings, especially its doctrines of universal interpenetration, nature-origination (which sees all phenomena as arising from a single ontological source), and the omnipresence of Buddhahood, were very influential on Chinese Buddhism and also on the rest of East Asian Buddhism. Huayan thought was especially influential on Chan (Zen) Buddhism, and some scholars even see Huayan as the main Buddhist philosophy behind Zen.

==History==
=== Origins of the Chinese &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; tradition ===
The &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (&quot;The Garland of Buddhas Sutra,&quot; or &quot;The Multitude of Buddhas Sutra&quot;) is a compilation of sutras of various length, some of which originally circulated as independent works before being combined into the &quot;full&quot; &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot;. One of the earliest of these texts, the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot; (&quot;Daśabhūmika&quot;), may date from the first century CE. These various sutras were probably joined shortly before its translation into Chinese, at the beginning of the 5th century CE.

There are various versions of the Chinese &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Huāyán Jīng&quot; 華嚴經, &quot;Splendid Flower Adornment Sutra&quot;)&quot;.&quot; The full sutra was translated into Chinese three times (in versions of 40, 60, and 80 fascicles or )&quot;.&quot; The earliest Chinese texts associated with the &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; are the &quot;Dousha jing&quot; (Taisho 280), produced by Lokaksema (fl. 147–189) in the latter part of the second century CE, and the &quot;Pusa benye jing&quot; (&quot;Book of the Original Acts that Adorn the Bodhisattva&quot;, T. 281), translated by Zhi Qian (fl. ca. 220–257 CE) in the early to mid third century. There is evidence that these smaller or partial &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; sutras circulated on their own as individual scriptures.

As soon as the large &quot;Huāyán Sūtra&quot; appeared in China, an exegetical tradition grew up around the text in order to explain it. The first translation of the larger &quot;Huāyán Sūtra&quot; (in 60 fascicles) is often dated to the Southern Dynasties era (c. 420–589), when a translation team led by Gandharan master Buddhabhadra produced a full Chinese translation of the text. There is also evidence of a &quot;Huāyán Sūtra&quot; tradition in the Northern Dynasties (386-581) era. The &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; teachings are associated with figures like Xuangao (402-444) who led a community with Daorong at Binglingsi cave, and Zhidan (c. 429–490), who argued that only the &quot;Huāyán Sūtra&quot; teaches the &quot;sudden teaching&quot; (while other Mahayana texts teach the gradual teaching).

Xuangao, a disciple of Buddhabhadra, was associated with the teaching of the &quot;Huāyán Samadhi&quot; which is said to have been passed on to him by Buddhabhadra. According to Hamar, Xuangao&#x27;s tradition is a precursor to the Huayan school and may have even composed the apocryphal &quot;Brahma&#x27;s Net Sūtra&quot; &quot;(Fanwang Jing&quot; T1484). Xuangao&#x27;s tradition is also associated with Chinese meditation cave grottoes such as the Yungang Grottoes, Maijishan Grottoes and the Bingling Temple Grottoes.

The origins of some of the teachings of the Huāyán school proper can also be traced back to the Dilun school, which was based on &quot;the Shidijing lun&quot; (十地經論), Vasubandhu&#x27;s commentary to the &quot;Daśabhūmikā-sutra&quot; (which is part of the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;) translated by Bodhiruci and Ratnamati. Dilun figures like Ratnamati&#x27;s disciple Huiguang (468–537) emphasized the study of the entire &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; and Dilun masters likely had their own commentaries on the text (but none have survived in full). Only a few extracts remain, such as parts of Huiguang&#x27;s commentary and parts of Lingyu&#x27;s (518–605).

Lingbian (靈辨, 477–522) was another early figure who studied and commented on the &quot;Avataṃsaka.&quot; He is referred to by Fazang as a great devotee of Manjushri, and 12 fascicles of Lingbian&#x27;s commentary to the &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; survive, being the earliest significant Chinese commentary on the &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; which is extant&quot;.&quot;

===Tang dynasty patriarchs===
The founding of the Huayan school proper is traditionally attributed to a series of five patriarchs who were instrumental in developing the school&#x27;s doctrines during the Tang dynasty (618 to 907). These Huayan &quot;patriarchs&quot; (though they did not call themselves as such) were erudite scholar-practitioners who created a unique tradition of exegesis, study and practice through their writings and oral teachings. They were particularly influenced by the works of the Dilun and Shelun schools of Chinese Yogacara&quot;.&quot;

These five patriarchs are:
# Dushun (, c. 557–640), a monk who was known as a meditator master and who was devoted to the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot;. He wrote several works&quot;,&quot; including the &quot;Discernments of the Huayan Dharmadhātu (Huayan fajie guanmen).&quot;
# Zhiyan (, c. 602–668), was a student of Dushun who is considered to have established most of the main doctrines of Huayan thought and is thus a crucial figure in the foundation of Huayan. Zhiyan also studied with various masters from the Dilun and Shelun schools, which were branches of Chinese Yogacara.
# Fazang (, c. 643–712), who was the Buddhist teacher of the Empress Wu Zetian (684–705) and is often considered the real founder of the school. He wrote numerous works on Huayan thought and practice including several commentaries on the &quot;Avatamsaka.&quot; He also worked on a new translation of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; (in collaboration with various figures, including Śikṣānanda) in 80 fascicles.
# Chengguan (, c. 738–839), though he was not a direct student of Fazang (who died 25 years before Chengguan&#x27;s birth), Chengguan further developed the Huayan teachings in innovative directions in his various commentaries and treatises. He was a student of Fashen (718–778), who was a student of Fazang&#x27;s student Huiyuan. Chengguan&#x27;s voluminous commentary to the new 80 fascicle &quot;Avatamsaka (&quot;the &quot;Da fang-guang fo huayan jing shu,&quot; 大方廣佛華嚴經疏&quot;,&quot; T. 1735), along with his sub-commentary to it (T. 1736), soon became &quot;the&quot; authoritative commentaries to the sutra in East Asia&quot;.&quot;
# Guifeng Zongmi (, c. 780–841), who is also known for also being a patriarch of Chinese Chán and for also writing on Daoism and Confucianism. His writings include works on Chan (such as the influential &quot;Chan Prolegomenon&quot;) and various Huayan commentaries. He was particularly fond of the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, writing a commentary and sub-commentary to it.
While the above list is the most common one, other Huayan patriarchal lists add different figures, such as Nagarjuna, Asvaghosa, Vasubandhu, and the lay master Li Tongxuan (, 635?-730), the author of the &quot;Xin Huayan Jing Lun&quot; (新華嚴經論, &quot;Treatise on the new translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra)&quot;, a popular and lengthy commentary on the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;. Li Tongxuan&#x27;s writings on the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot; were particularly influential on later Chan Buddhists, who often preferred his interpretations.

Another important Huayan figure of the Tang era was Fazang&#x27;s main disciple Huiyuan (慧苑, 673–743) who also wrote a commentary on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra.&quot; Because Huiyuan modified some of Fazang&#x27;s interpretations, he was retroactively sidelined from the Huayan lineage of patriarchs by later figures like Chengguan who criticized some of his doctrinal positions&quot;.&quot; According to Imre Hamar, Huiyuan compared the Daoist teachings on the origination of the world to the Huayan teaching on the dependent arising of the tathagatagarbha. Huiyuan also incorporated Daoism and Confucianism into his panjiao (doctrinal classification) system. Chengguan disagreed with this.

===Liao and Xia developments===
After the time of Zongmi and Li Tongxuan, Chinese Huayan generally stagnated in terms of new developments, and then eventually began to decline. The school, which had been dependent upon the support it received from the government, suffered severely during the Great Buddhist Persecution of the Huichang era (841–845), initiated by Emperor Wuzong of Tang. The school stagnated even further in the conflicts and confusion of the late Tang dynasty and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-979) era.

After the fall of the Tang dynasty several Huayan commentaries were lost. However, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms era, Huayan remained influential, being part of the &quot;Huayan-Chan&quot; lineages influenced by Zongmi which were very popular in the north, especially in the Khitan Liao Empire (916-1125) and the Tangut kingdom (1038-1227) of the Western Xia. Various masters from these non-Chinese kingdoms are known, such as Xianyan (1048-1118) from Kailong temple in Khitan Upper capital, Hengce (1049-1098), Tongli dashi from Yanjing, Daoshen (1056?-1114?), Xianmi Yuantong, from Liao Wutaishan, Zhifu (fl. during the reign of Liao Daozong, 1055–1101).

The Liao and Xia Huayan traditions were more syncretic, adopting elements of Zongmi&#x27;s Heze Chan influenced Huayan, as well as Chinese Esoteric Buddhism (&quot;zhenyan&quot;), Hongzhou Chan, and even Tibetan Buddhism in some cases. Several texts from the Liao Huayan tradition have survived, such as master Daochen&#x27;s (道㲀) Chan influenced &quot;Account of Mirroring Mind&quot; (&quot;Jingxin lu,&quot; 鏡心錄) and his esoteric influenced &quot;Collection of Essentials for Realization of Buddhahood in the Perfect Penetration of the Exoteric and Secret Teachings&quot; (&quot;Xianmi Yuantong chengfo xinyao,&quot; 顯密圓通成佛心要 T no. 1955). Another important Huayan esoteric source of this period is Jueyuan&#x27;s sub-commentary on Yixing’s commentary to the &quot;Mahāvairocana sūtra&quot;.

According to Daochen, the best approach to Buddhahood is the “combined practice of the exoteric and esoteric” (xianmi shuangxiu, 顯密雙修) which is for those of the highest capacity. However, he also recommended that those of &quot;middling and lesser faculties...can choose to practice a single method according to their preference, be it the exoteric or esoteric.” Daochen&#x27;s esoteric teachings focused on the dharani of Cundi which he saw as &quot;the mother of all Buddhas and the life of all bodhisattvas&quot; and also drew on the Mani mantra. The combined use of both of these is found in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha&quot;

&quot;sūtra&quot;.

Another Liao Tangut work which survives from this period is &quot;The Meaning of the Luminous One-Mind of the Ultimate One Vehicle&quot; (&quot;Jiujing yicheng yuan-ming xinyao&quot; 究竟一乘圓明心要) by Tongli Hengce (通理恆策, 1048–1098). The works of the Liao tradition are important because they served as one of the sources of the later Huayan revival during the Song.

=== Song revival ===

After the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, the Huayan lineage experienced a revival in the following Song dynasty (960-1279). Tang era Huayan commentaries which had been dispersed were returned in 1085 by the Goryeo monk Uicheon. Uicheon (義天, 1055–1101) was thus an important figure of this revival period. The chief Chinese Huayan figures of the Song dynasty revival were Changshui Zixuan (子璇, 965–1038), Jinshui Jingyuan (靜源, 1011–1088), and Yihe (義和, c. early twelfth century).

Jingyuan is known for his sub-commentary to Chengguan&#x27;s &quot;Huayan sutra&quot; commentary, while Zixuan is famed for his twenty-fascicle &quot;Notes on the Meaning of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot; (首楞嚴義疏注經). While the Huayan school is generally seen as having been weaker than Chan or Tiantai during the Song, it still enjoyed considerable support from Chinese elites and from Buddhist monastics. Another important figure in the Song revival of Huayan was Guangzhi Bensong (廣智本嵩, fl. 1040), a master from the from Kaifeng. He is well known for his &quot;Thirty gāthās on the Contemplation of the Dharma-realm and Seven syllables of the title of the Huayan&quot; (&quot;Huayan qizi jing ti fajie guan sanshi men song&quot; 華嚴 七字經題法界觀三十門頌, Taisho no. 1885). Some of his other works have survived in Tangut.

New Huayan practice and ritual manuals were also written during the Song, such as Jinshui Jingyuan&#x27;s &quot;Rites on Practicing the Vows of Samantabhadra&quot; (Chinese: 華嚴普賢行願修證儀; Pinyin: &quot;Huáyán Pǔxián Xíngyuàn Xiūzhèng Yí,&quot; Taisho Supplement no. X1473). These rites were influenced by Tiantai school ritual manuals, as well as by earlier Huayan materials. Song era Huayan monks also developed distinctly Huayan forms of &quot;concentration and contemplation&quot; (&quot;zhi guan&quot;), inspired by Tiantai methods as well as the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; and Huayan thought.

Jinshui Jingyuan also helped organize some state recognized Huayan public monasteries, like Huiyin temple. Jingyuan is known for his association with Mount Wutai, which has been a key center for Huayan Buddhism since the Song dynasty.

In the later Song, there were also four great Huayan masters: Daoting, Shihui (1102-1166), Guanfu, and Xidi. During the Yuan dynasty, the Huayan master Purui also wrote various Huayan works.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
During the Ming dynasty, Huayan remained influential. One important event during the early Ming was when the eminent Huayan monk Huijin (1355-1436) was invited by the Xuande Emperor (1399-1435) to the imperial palace to preside over the copying of ornate manuscripts of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot;, &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot;, &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa&quot;, and &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;s.

During the sixteenth century, Beijing was the center of Chinese Buddhist doctrinal study. During the late Ming, Kongyin Zhencheng (1547–1617), Lu&#x27;an (or Lushan) Putai (fl. 1511) of Beijing&#x27;s Da Xinglong monastery and Yu’an Zhengui (born 1558) were some of the most influential scholars of Huayan thought. Huayan philosophy was also influential on some of the most eminent monks of the Ming era, including Zibo Zhenke and Yunqi Zhuhong (1535–1615), both of whom studied and drew on Huayan thought and promoted the unity of practice (Chan and Pure Land) and study. Zhuhong himself was a student of Wuji Mingxin (1512-1574) of Bao&#x27;en monastery, who in turn was a disciple of Lu&#x27;an Putai. Another influential student of Wuji was Xuelang Hong&#x27;en (1545-1608), who became the most famous teacher in Jiangnan and lead revival of Huayan studies during this time. His main students include Yiyu Tongrun (1565-1624), Cangxue Duche (1588-1656), Tairu Minghe (1588-1640) and Gaoyuan Mingyu (fl. 1612).

During the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), Huayan philosophy continued to develop and exert a strong influence on Chinese Buddhism and its other traditions, including Chan and Pure Land. During the Qing, the most influential Huayan figures were Baiting Xufa (柏亭續法 1641-1728) and Datian Tongli (1701-1782). Xufa wrote various works on nianfo, including: &quot;Short Commentary on the Amitabhasutra&quot;, and &quot;Straightforward Commentary on the Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra&quot;”. Another influential figure was the lay scholar Peng Shaosheng (彭紹升, 1740–1796).

Baiting Xufa and Peng Shaosheng were known for their synthesis of Huayan thought with Pure Land practice which is termed &quot;Huayan-Nianfo&quot;. For the scholar monk Xufa, the practice of nianfo (contemplation of the Buddha) was a universal method suitable for everyone which was taught in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; and could lead to an insight into the Huayan teachings of interpenetration. Xufa generally defended the mind-only Pure land view which saw the Pure land and Amitabha Buddha as reflections of the “one true mind” (yixin 一心, zhenxin 真心) or the &quot;one true dharmadhatu.&quot; Similarly, for Peng Shaosheng, Amitabha was synonymous with the Vairocana Buddha of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot;, and the pure land was part of Vairocana&#x27;s Lotus Treasury World. As such, the practice of nianfo and of the methods of the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; would lead to rebirth in the Pure land (which is non-dual with all worlds in the universe) and see Buddha Amitabha (which is equal to seeing all Buddhas).

=== Korean Hwaôm ===
In the 7th century, the Huayan school was transmitted into Silla Korea, where it is known as Hwaôm (). This tradition was transmitted by the monk Uisang (의상대사, 625–702), who had been a student of Zhiyan together with Fazang. After Uisang returned to Korea in 671, established the school and wrote various Hwaôm works, including a popular poem called the &quot;Beopseongge&quot;, also known as the &quot;Diagram of the Realm of Reality,&quot; which encapsulated the Huayan teaching. In this effort, he was greatly aided by the powerful influences of his friend Wonhyo, who also studied and drew on Huayan thought and is considered a key figure of Korean Hwaôm. Wonhyo wrote a partial commentary on the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (the &quot;Hwaŏm-gyŏng so&quot;). Another important Hwaôm figure was Chajang (d. between 650 and 655).

After the passing of these two early monks, the Hwaôm school eventually became the most influential tradition in the Silla Kingdom until the end of the kingdom. Royal support allowed various Hwaôm monasteries to be constructed on all five of Korea&#x27;s sacred mountains, and the tradition became the main force behind the unification of various Korean Buddhist cults, such as those of Manjushri, Maitreya and Amitabha. Important figures include the Silla monk Pŏmsu who introduced the work of Chengguan to Korea in 799, and Sŭngjŏn, a disciple of Uisang. Another important figure associated with Hwaôm was the literatus Ch’oe Ch’iwŏn. He is known for his biographies of Fazang and Uisang, along with other Huayan writings. Towards of the end of Silla, Gwanhye of Hwaeomsa and Master Heuirang (875-927 CE) were the two most important figures. During this period Hwaeomsa and Haeinsa Temples formed two sub-sects of Hwaeom who disputed with each other on matters of doctrine.

The Hwaôm school remained the predominant doctrinal school in the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392). An important figure of this time was Gyunyeo (923–973). He is known for his commentary on Uisang&#x27;s &quot;Diagram of the Realm of Reality.&quot; He also unified the southern and northern factions of Hwaeomsa and Haeinsa. Korean Buddhism declined severely under the Confucian Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910). All schools were forced to merge into one single school, which was dominated by the Seon (Korean Zen) tradition. Within the Seon school, Hwaôm thought would continue to play a strong role until modern times and various Hwaôm commentaries were written in the Joseon era&quot;.&quot;

=== Japanese Kegon ===
Kegon () is the Japanese transmission of Huayan. Huayan studies were founded in Japan in 736 when the scholar-priest Rōben (689–773), originally a monk of the East Asian Yogācāra tradition, invited the Korean monk Shinjō () to give lectures on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; at Kinshōsen Temple (金鐘山寺, also 金鐘寺 &quot;Konshu-ji&quot; or &quot;Kinshō-ji&quot;), the origin of later Tōdai-ji. When the construction of the Tōdai-ji was completed, Rōben became the head of the new Kegon school in Japan and received the support of emperor Shōmu. Kegon would become known as one of the &quot;Nanto Rikushū&quot; (南都六宗) or &quot;Six Buddhist Sects of Nanto&quot;. Rōben&#x27;s disciple Jitchū continued administration of Tōdai-ji and expanded its prestige through the introduction of imported rituals.
Kegon thought would later be further popularized by Myōe (1173–1232), the abbot and founder of Kōzan-ji Kegon temple. Myōe combined the Kegon lineage with Tendai and Shingon esoteric lineages. He was a prolific scholar monk who composed over 50 works. Myōe promoted the practice of the mantra of light (kōmyō shingon) as simple efficacious practice that was available to all, lay and monastic. He also promoted the idea that this mantra could lead to rebirth in Amitabha&#x27;s pure land, thus providing a Kegon alternative to popular Japanese Pure Land methods.

Over time, Kegon incorporated esoteric rituals from Shingon, with which it shared a cordial relationship. Its practice continues to this day, and includes a few temples overseas.

Another important Kegon figure was Gyōnen (1240–1321), who was a great scholar (who studied numerous schools including Madhyamaka, Shingon, and Risshu Vinaya) and led a revival of the Kegon school in the late Kamakura era. He was also known as a great historian of Japanese Buddhism and as a great Pure Land thinker. His Pure Land thought is most systematically expressed in his &quot;Jōdo hōmon genrushō&quot; (淨土法門源流章, T 2687:84) and it was influenced by various figures of his day, such as the Jodo monk Chōsai, and the Sanron figure Shinkū Shōnin, as well as by his understanding of Huayan thought.

In the Tokugawa period, another Kegon scholarly revival occurred under the Kegon monk Hōtan (1657-1738. a.k.a. Sōshun, Genko Dōjin) and his disciple Fujaku (1707-1781).

=== Modern Era ===

During the Republican Period (1912–1949), various monks were known for their focus on Huayan teaching and practice. Key Huayan figures of this era include Cizhou (1877–1958), Zhiguang (1889–1963), Changxing, Yingci, Yang Wenhui, Yuexia, Shouye, and Kefa. Some of these figures were part of a network of Huayan study and practice.

In 1914, Huayan University, the first modern Buddhist monastic school, was founded in Shanghai to further systematize Huayan teaching and teach monastics. It helped to expand the Huayan tradition into the rest of into East Asia, Taiwan, and the West. The university managed to foster a network of educated monks who focused on Huayan Buddhism during the 20th century. Through this network, the lineage of the Huayan tradition was transmitted to many monks, which helped to preserve the lineage down to the modern day via new Huayan-centred organizations that these monks would later found.

Several new Huayan Buddhist organizations have been established since the latter half of the 20th century. In contemporary times, the largest and oldest of the Huayan-centered organizations in Taiwan is the Huayan Lotus Society (Huayan Lianshe 華嚴蓮社), which was founded in 1952 by the monk Zhiguang and his disciple Nanting, who were both part of the network fostered by the Huayan University. Since its founding, the Huayan Lotus Society has been centered on the study and practice of the Huayan Sutra. It hosts a full recitation of the sutra twice each year, during the third and tenth months of the lunar calendar. Each year during the eleventh lunar month, the society also hosts a seven-day Huayan Buddha retreat (Huayan foqi 華嚴佛七), during which participants chant the names of the buddhas and bodhisattvas in the text. The society emphasizes the study of the Huayan Sutra by hosting regular lectures on it. In recent decades, these lectures have occurred on a weekly basis.

Like other Taiwanese Buddhist organization&#x27;s, the Society has also diversified its propagation and educational activities over the years. It produces its own periodical and runs its own press. It also now runs a variety of educational programs, including a kindergarten, a vocational college, and short-term courses in Buddhism for college and primary-school students, and offers scholarships. One example is their founding of the Huayan Buddhist College (Huayan Zhuanzong Xueyuan 華嚴專宗學院) in 1975. They have also established branch temples overseas, most notably in California&#x27;s San Francisco Bay Area. In 1989, they expanded their outreach to the United States of America by formally establishing the Huayan Lotus Society of the United States (Meiguo Huayan Lianshe 美國華嚴蓮社). Like the parent organization in Taiwan, this branch holds weekly lectures on the Huayan Sutra and several annual Huayan Dharma Assemblies where it is chanted. It also holds monthly memorial services for the society&#x27;s spiritual forebears.

In Mainland China, Huayan teachings began to be more widely re-propagated after the end of the Cultural Revolution. Various monks from the network of monks fostered by the original Huayan University, such as Zhenchan (真禪) and Mengcan (夢參), were the driving factors behind the re-propagation as they travelled widely throughout China as well as other countries such as the United States and lectured on Huayan teachings. In 1996, one of Mengcan&#x27;s tonsured disciples, the monk Jimeng (繼夢), also known as Haiyun (海雲), founded the Huayan Studies Association (Huayan Xuehui 華嚴學會) in Taipei, which was followed in 1999 by the founding of the larger Caotangshan Great Huayan Temple (Caotangshan Da Huayansi 草堂山大華嚴寺). This temple hosts many Huayan-related
activities, including a weekly Huayan Assembly. Since 2000, the
association has grown internationally, with branches in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

=== Influence ===
The doctrines of the Huayan school ended up having profound impact on the philosophical attitudes of East Asian Buddhism. According to Wei Daoru their theory of perfect interfusion was &quot;gradually accepted by all Buddhist traditions and it eventually permeated all aspects of Chinese Buddhism.&quot; Huayan even is seen by some scholars as the main philosophy behind Chan Buddhism.

Huayan thought had a noticeable impact on East Asian Esoteric Buddhism. Kukai (774-835) was deeply knowledgeable of Huayan thought and he saw Huayan as the highest exoteric view. Some of Kukai&#x27;s ideas, such as his view of Buddhahood in this body, was also influenced by Huayan ideas.

During the post-Tang era, Huayan (along with Chan) thought also influenced the Tiantai school. Tiantai school figures who were influenced by Huayan and Chan were called the &quot;off mountain&quot; (&quot;shanwai&quot;) faction, and a debate ensued between them and the &quot;home mountain&quot; (&quot;shanjia&quot;) faction.

Huayan thought was also an important source for the Pure Land doctrine of the Yuzu Nembutsu sect of Ryōnin (1072–1132). Likewise, Huayan thought was important to some Chinese Pure Land thinkers, such as the Ming exegete Yunqi Zuhong (1535–1615) and the modern lay scholar Yang Wenhui (1837–1911).

==== On Chan ====
Chinese Chán was profoundly influenced by Huayan, though Chán also defined itself by distinguishing itself from Huayan. Guifeng Zongmi, the Fifth Patriarch of the Huayan school, occupies a prominent position in the history of Chán. Mazu Daoyi, the founder of the influential Hongzhou school of Chan, was influenced by Huayan teachings, like the identity of principle and phenomena. He also sometimes quoted from Huayan sources in his sermons, like Dushun&#x27;s &quot;Fajie guanmen&quot; (&quot;Contemplation of the Realm of Reality&quot;). Mazu&#x27;s student Baizhang Huaihai also draws on Huayan metaphysics in his writings.

Dongshan Liangjie (806–869), the founder of the Caodong lineage, formulated his theory of the Five Ranks based on Huayan&#x27;s Fourfold Dharmadhatu teaching. The influential Caodong text called &quot;Sandokai&quot;, attributed to Shitou, also draws on Huayan themes. In a similar fashion, Linji, the founder of the Linji school, also drew on Huayan texts and commentaries, such as Li Tongxuan&#x27;s &quot;Xin Huayan Jing Lun&quot; (新華嚴經論, &quot;Treatise on the new translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;). This influence can also be seen in Linji&#x27;s schema of the &quot;four propositions&quot;. According to Thomas Cleary, similar Huayan influences can be found in the works of other Tang dynasty Chan masters like Yunmen Wenyan (d. 949) and Fayen Wenyi (885-958).

During the Song dynasty, Huayan metaphysics were further assimilated by the various Chan lineages. Cleary names Touzi Yiqing (1032-1083) and Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) as two Song era Chan figures which drew on Huayan teachings. The Ming era Chan master Hanshan Deqing (1546-1623) is known for promoting the study of Huayan and for his work on a new edition of Chengguan&#x27;s commentary on the Huayan sutra.

A similar syncretism with Zen occurred in Korea, where the Korean Huayan tradition influenced and was eventually merged with Seon (Korean Zen). The influence of Huayan teachings can be found in the works of the seminal Seon figure Jinul. Jinul was especially influenced by the writings of Li Tongxuan.

Huayan thought has also been influential on the worldview of Thich Nhat Hanh, particularly his understanding of emptiness as &quot;Interbeing&quot;.

==Texts==
===&quot;Huayan sutra&quot;===
The Huayan school&#x27;s central text is the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Flower Garland Sutra&quot;, Ch. &quot;Huāyán Jīng&quot;), which is considered the supreme Buddhist revelation in this tradition. There are three different translations of the work in Chinese and other related sutras as well. According to Paul Williams, the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; is not a systematic philosophical work, though it does contain various Mahayana teachings reminiscent of Madhyamaka and Yogacara, as well as mentioning a pure untainted awareness or consciousness (&quot;amalacitta&quot;).

The sutra is filled with mystical and visionary imagery, focusing on figures like the bodhisattvas Samantabhadra and Manjushri, and the Buddhas Shakyamuni, and Vairocana. Vairocana is the universal Buddha, whose body is the entire universe and who is said to pervade every atom in the universe with his light, wisdom, teachings, and magical emanations.

 According to the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot;:
The realm of the Buddhas is inconceivable, no sentient being can fathom it...The Buddha constantly emits great beams of light, in each light beam are innumerable Buddhas...The Buddha-body is pure and always tranquil, the radiance of its light extends throughout the world...The Buddha&#x27;s freedom cannot be measured— It fills the cosmos and all space...With various techniques it teaches the living, sound like thunder, showering the rain of truth...All virtuous activities in the world come from the Buddha&#x27;s light...In all atoms of all lands Buddha enters, each and every one, producing miracle displays for sentient beings: Such is the way of Vairocana...In each atom are many oceans of worlds, their locations each different all beautifully pure. Thus does infinity enter into one, yet each unit&#x27;s distinct, with no overlap...In each atom are innumerable lights pervading the lands of the ten directions, all showing the Buddhas’ enlightenment practices. The same in all oceans of worlds. In each atom the Buddhas of all times appear, according to inclinations; While their essential nature neither comes nor goes, by their own power they pervade the worlds. 
All these awakened activities and skillful techniques (upaya) are said to lead all living beings through the bodhisattva stages and eventually to Buddhahood. These various stages of spiritual attainment are discussed in various parts of the sutra (book 15, book 26).

An important doctrine that the Huayan school drew from this sutra is the idea that all levels of reality are interrelated, interpenetrated and interfused, and so &quot;inside everything is everything else&quot;. As the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot; states:They . . . perceive that the fields full of assemblies, the beings and aeons which are as many as all the dust particles, are all present in every particle of dust. They perceive that the many fields and assemblies and the beings and the aeons are all reflected in each particle of dust.According to Dumoulin, the Huayan vision of &quot;unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything&quot;. According to Williams, this interfused vision of the cosmos is the total realm of all phenomena, the &quot;Dharma realm&quot; (Dharmadhatu) as seen from the point of view of a Buddha. The focus of the Huayan sutra is thus how to attain this contemplative universal vision of ultimate reality, as well as the miraculous powers of Buddhas and bodhisattvas with which they communicate their vision of the ultimate truth.

Furthermore, because all things are interconnected and interfused, the Buddha (and his cosmic body and universal light) is present everywhere and so is his wisdom, which is said to be all pervasive. As chapter 32 of the sutra states: &quot;in the class of living beings there is no place where the wisdom of Tathagata is not present.&quot;

===Other key scriptures===
The &quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot; (&quot;Dasheng Qixin Lun,&quot; 大乘起信論) was another key scriptural source for Huayan masters like Fazang and Zongmi, both of whom wrote commentaries on this treatise. The &quot;Lotus sutra&quot; was also seen as an important scripture in Huayan. Various Huayan masters saw the &quot;Lotus sutra&quot; as a sutra of definitive (ultimate) meaning alongside the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;. Fazang also considered the &quot;Lankavatara sutra&quot; to be a definitive sutra, and he wrote a commentary on it&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; was also particularly important for the Huayan patriarch Zongmi.

=== Commentaries and treatises ===
The Huayen patriarchs wrote numerous other commentaries and original treatises. Fazang for example, wrote commentaries on the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;, the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra,&quot; the &quot;Awakening of Faith,&quot; the &quot;Brahmajāla Sūtra&quot; (Taisho no. 40, no. 1813) and the &quot;Ghanavyūha Sūtra&quot; (no. X368 in the supplement to the Taisho canon, &quot;Xu zang jing&quot; 續藏經 vol. 34).

Perhaps the most important commentaries for the Chinese Huayan school are Fazang&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Huayan jing tanxuan ji&quot; (華嚴經探玄記, &quot;Record of Investigating the Mystery of the Avatamsaka sutra&quot;) in 60 fascicles and Chengguan&#x27;s &quot;Extensive Commentary on the Buddhāvataṃsaka sutra&quot; (&quot;Da fang-guang fo huayan jing shu,&quot; 大方廣佛華嚴經疏&quot;,&quot; T. 1735), and his sub-commentary (T. 1736)&quot;.&quot; Other Huayan figures like Zhiyan, and Li Tongxuan also wrote influential commentaries on the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot;.

Fazang wrote a number of other original Huayan treatises, such as &quot;Treatise on the Golden Lion,&quot; which is said to have been written to explain Huayan&#x27;s view of interpenetration to Empress Wu. Another key Huayen treatise is &quot;On the Meditation of the Dharmadhātu&quot; attributed to the first patriarch Dushun.

Peter N. Gregory notes that the Huayan commentarial tradition was: &quot;not primarily concerned with a careful exegesis of the original meaning of the scripture.&quot; Instead it was concerned with specific doctrines, ideas and metaphors (such as nature origination, the dependent arising of the dharmadhatu, interfusion, and the six characteristics of all dharmas) which was inspired by scripture.

==Doctrine==
Huayan thought seeks to explain the nature of the &quot;Dharmadhatu&quot; (法界, &quot;fajie&quot;, the realm of phenomena, the Dharma realm), which is the world as it is ultimately, from the point of view of a fully awakened being. In East Asian Buddhism, the &quot;Dharmadhatu&quot; is the whole of reality, the totality of all things. Thus, Huayan seeks to provide a holistic metaphysics that explains all of reality.

Huayan philosophy is influenced by the &quot;Huayan sutra&quot;, other Mahayana scriptures like the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and the &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; as well as by the various Chinese Buddhist traditions like Chinese Yogacara, the buddha-nature schools like Shelun and Dilun, and Madhyamaka (Sanlun). Huayan patriarchs were also influenced by non-buddhist Chinese philosophy.

Some key elements of Huayan philosophy are: the interpenetration and interfusion (&quot;yuanrong&quot;) of all phenomena (dharmas), &quot;nature origination,&quot; (&quot;xingqi&quot;) - how phenomena arise out of an ultimate principle, which is buddha-nature, or the &quot;One Mind&quot;, how the ultimate principle (li) and all phenomena (shi) are mutually interpenetrated, the relation between parts and the whole (understood through the six characteristics), a unique Huayan interpretation of the Yogacara framework of the three natures (sanxing) and a unique view of Vairocana Buddha as an all pervasive cosmic being.

===Interpenetration===

A key doctrine of Huayan is the mutual containment and interpenetration (&quot;xiangru&quot;) of all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;), also known as &quot;perfect interfusion&quot; (&quot;yuanrong&quot;, 圓融). This is associated with what is termed &quot;dharmadhatu pratityasamutpada&quot; (法界緣起, &quot;fajie yuanqi,&quot; the dependent arising of the whole realm of phenomena), which is Huayan&#x27;s unique interpretation of dependent arising. This doctrine is described by Wei Daoru as the idea that &quot;countless dharmas (all phenomena in the world) are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception&quot; and that &quot;they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict.&quot; According to the doctrine of interpenetration, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other.

According to Fazang, since the sum of all things determines any individual thing, “one is many, many is one” (&quot;yi ji duo, duo ji yi&quot;). Furthermore, according to Fazang “one in many, many in one” (&quot;yi zhong duo, duo zhong yi&quot;), because any dharma penetrates and is penetrated by the totality of all things. Thomas Cleary explains this Buddhist holism as one which sees the universe &quot;as one single nexus of conditions in which everything simultaneously depends on, and is depended on by, everything else. Seen in this light, then, everything affects and is affected by, more or less immediately or remotely, everything else; just as this is true of every system of relationships, so is it true of the totality of existence.&quot; In this worldview, all dharmas are so interconnected that they are fused together without any obstructions in a perfectly harmonious whole (which is the entire universe, the Dharmadhatu).

In the Huayan school, the teaching of interpenetration is depicted through various metaphors, such as Indra&#x27;s net, a teaching which may have been influenced by the &quot;Gandhavyuha&quot; chapter&#x27;s climax scene in Vairocana&#x27;s Tower. Indra&#x27;s net is an infinite cosmic net that contains a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, with each jewel being reflected in all of the other jewels, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. Thus, each jewel contains the entire net of jewels reflected within.

Other Huayan metaphors included a hall of mirrors, the rafter and the building, and the world text. The rafter-building metaphor can be found in Fazang&#x27;s famous “&quot;Rafter Dialogue&quot;”. Fazang argues that any rafter (any part) is essential to the existence of its building (standing in for the universe, the dharmadhatu). Likewise, the identity and existence of any rafter is also dependent on it being part of a building (otherwise it would not be a rafter). Therefore, any phenomenon is necessarily dependent upon all phenomena in the universe, and because of this, all phenomena lack any metaphysical independence or essential nature (svabhava).

=== The six characteristics ===
One framework which is used by the Huayan tradition to further explain the doctrine of interpenetration is the &quot;perfect interfusion of the six characteristics&quot; (&quot;liuxiang yuanrong&quot; 六相圓融). Each element of the six characteristics refers to a specific kind of mereological relation. The six characteristics are:

# Wholeness / universality (&quot;zongxiang&quot;): each dharma (like a rafter) is characterized by &quot;wholeness&quot;, because it takes part in creating a whole (like a building), and each dharma is indispensable in creating the whole.
# Particularity / distinctness (&quot;biexiang&quot;): a dharma is characterized by &quot;particularity&quot; (e.g. any specific rafter) as far as it is a numerically distinct particular that is different from the whole.
# Identity / sameness (&quot;tongxiang&quot;): each dharma is characterized by a certain &quot;identity&quot; with all other parts of the whole, since they all mutually form the whole without conflict.
# Difference (&quot;yixiang&quot;): each dharma is different, since they have distinct functions and appearance, even while being part of a single whole.
# Integration (&quot;chengxiang&quot;): each dharma is integrated together with other dharmas in forming each other and in forming the whole, and each dharma does not interfere with every other dharma.
# Non-integration / disintegration (&quot;huaixiang&quot;): the fact that each part maintains its unique activity and retains its individuality while making up the whole.

=== Implications of interpenetration ===
The Buddhist doctrine of interpenetration also has several further implications in Huayan thought:
* Truth is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa (see also: two truths)
* Purity (Śuddha) and goodness is understood as interpenetrating impurity and evil
* Practicing any single Buddhist teaching entails the practicing of all other teachings
* Ending one mental defilement (klesha) is ending all of them
* The past contains the future and vice versa, all, three times are interfused
* Practicing in one bodhisattva stage (bhumi) entails practicing in all bodhisattva stages
Furthermore, according to the lay Huayan master Li Tongxuan, all things are just the one true &quot;dharma&quot;-realm (Ch. &quot;yi zhen fajie&quot;), and as such, there is no ontological difference between sacred and secular, awakening and ignorance, or even between Buddhahood and living beings. Because of the unity of ordinary human life and enlightenment, Li also held that Chinese sages like Confucius and Laozi also taught the bodhisattva path in their own way.

The Huayan doctrines of interfusion and non-duality also leads to several seemingly paradoxical views. Some examples include: (1) since any phenomenon X is empty, this implies X is also not X; (2) any particular phenomenon is an expression of and contains the absolute and yet it retains its particularity; (3) since each phenomenon contains all other phenomena, the conventional order of space and time is violated.

=== The ultimate principle and nature-origination ===
Another important metaphysical framework used by Huayan patriarchs is that of principle (理, &quot;li,&quot; or the ultimate pattern) and phenomena (&quot;shi)&quot;. &#x27;Principle&#x27; is the ultimate reality (&quot;paramārtha-satya&quot;) which is endless and without limits, while phenomena (shi) refers to the impermanent and relative dharmas.

In Fazang&#x27;s influential &quot;Essay on the Golden Lion&quot; (Taishō no. 1881), Fazang uses the statue of a golden Chinese lion as a metaphor for reality. The gold itself stands in for the ultimate principle, while the appearance and relative shape of the lion statue is the relative and dependent phenomena as they are perceived by living beings. Because the ultimate principle is boundless, empty and ceaseless, it is like gold in that it can be transformed into many forms and shapes. Also, even though phenomena appear as particular things, they lack any independent existence, since they all depend on the ultimate principle.

Furthermore, Huayan sees the ultimate principle and the relative phenomena as interdependent, unified and interfused, that is to say, they are non-dual. According to Paul Williams:

First, noumenon and phenomena mutually interpenetrate and are (in a sense) identical. There is no opposition between the two. The one does not cancel out the other. Second, Fazang explains elsewhere that since all things arise interdependently (following Madhyamika), and since the links of interdependence expand throughout the entire universe and at all time (past, present, and future depend upon each other, which is to say the total dharmadhatu arises simultaneously), so in the totality of interdependence, the dharmadhatu, all phenomena are mutually interpenetrating and identical. The ultimate principle is associated with various Mahayana terms referring to ultimate reality, such as the &quot;One Mind&quot; of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, Suchness, the tathagatagarbha (the womb of tathagatas), buddha-nature, or just &quot;nature&quot;. This nature is the ontological source and ground of all phenomena&quot;.&quot; This is a key idea in Huayan thought which is called &quot;nature-origination&quot; (&quot;xingqi&quot;). The term derives from chapter 32 of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, titled &quot;Nature Origination of the Jewel King Tathagata (Baowang rulai xingqi pin,&quot; Skt. &quot;Tathâgata-utpatti-sambhava-nirdesa-sûtra).&quot;

Nature origination refers to the manifestation of the ultimate nature in the phenomenal world and its interfusion with it.&quot;&quot; That is to say, the ultimate pure nature is interdependent on and interpenetrates the entire phenomenal universe, while also being its source. For Huayan patriarchs like Fazang, the ultimate nature is thus seen as non-dual with all relative phenomena. Because the ultimate source of all things is also interdependent and interconnected with them, it remains a ground which is empty of self-existence (svabhava) and thus it is not an independent essence, like a monotheistic God.&quot;&quot;

=== The Cosmic Buddha Vairocana ===
In the cosmology of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra,&quot; our world is just one of the immeasurable number of worlds in a multiverse called &quot;Ocean of worlds, whose surface and inside are decorated with an arrangement of flowers&quot; (Kusumatalagarbha-vyuhalamkara-lokadhatu-samudra). The &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; states that this entire cosmos has been purified by the Buddha Vairocana through his bodhisattva practices for countless aeons, after having met countless Buddhas. The sutra also states that our world is in Vairocana&#x27;s buddhafield. Vairocana is closely associated with Shakyamuni Buddha, in some cases he is even identified with him in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;. Huayan generally sees Shakyamuni as an emanation body (nirmanakaya) from the ultimate Buddha Vairocana (&quot;The Illuminator&quot;). 
Furthermore, Huayan thought sees the entire universe as being the very body of Vairocana, who is seen as a supreme cosmic Buddha. Vairocana is infinite, his influence and light is limitless, pervading the entire universe. Furthermore, Vairocana is really the ultimate principle (li), the Dharmakaya, Suchness and &quot;the substance underlying phenomenal reality&quot;. However, while Vairocana as ultimate principle is eternal, it also transforms and changes according to the needs and conditions of sentient beings. Furthermore, Vairocana is empty, interdependent and interfused with all phenomena in the universe. Thus, Vairocana is both immanent (due to its dependent and interfused character) and transcendent (as the immutable basis of all things).

According to Fazang, while the nirmanakaya Shakyamuni taught the other Mahayana sutras, Vairocana teaches the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; through his ten bodies which are: the All-Beings Body, the Lands Body, the Karma Body, the Śrāvakas Body, the Pratyekabuddha Body, the Bodhisattvas Body, the Tathāgatas Body, the Wisdom Body, the Dharma Body, and the Space Body. Fazang sees these ten bodies as encompassing all phenomena (animate and inanimate) in the &quot;three realms&quot;, i.e. the entire universe.&quot;&quot;

===Understanding of the trisvabhāva===
Huayan has a unique interpretation of the three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;) of classical Yogācāra. According to Fazang, the three natures are ultimately identical, as each of the three natures has dual aspects of emptiness and truth on the one hand, and existence and falsity on the other. For the perfected nature (&quot;pariniṣpanna&quot;), its true/empty aspect is that it is immutable, while its false/existing aspect is that it obeys conditions. The dependent nature (&quot;paratantra&quot;) has essencelessness for its true/empty aspect, while it has seeming reality for its false/existing aspect. Finally, the true/empty aspect of the imagined nature (&quot;parikalpita&quot;) is its nonexistence in reality, while its false/existing aspect is that it exists to the senses. Regarding their true/empty aspects, Fazang regards the immutability of the perfected, the essencelessness of the dependent, and the nonexistence of the imagined to be identical. He also regards their false/existing aspects to all be identical as well, namely the conditionedness of the perfected, the seeming reality of the dependent, and the existing to the senses of the imagined. For Fazang, the aspects in the true/empty category are &quot;root,&quot; while the aspects in the false/existing category are &quot;limbs.&quot; The limbs develop from the root. Thus, where the limbs are derivative, the root is their source. 

Fazang also differs from standard Yogācāra &quot;pivot&quot; models of the three natures, in which the imagined and the perfected pivot on the dependent. That is, in the Yogācāra pivot model, the imagined and perfected are merely different ways of apprehending the dependent. For Fazang, on the other hand, the dependent and the imagined natures pivot on the perfected (which is equated with the One Mind), as its unconditioned and conditioned aspects.

===Differences with classical Yogācāra===
The cosmogonic role of self-cognition

Unlike the classical Yogācāra model, which regards self-cognition as an &quot;effect&quot; of consciousness&#x27; subjective aspect perceiving its objective aspect, Huayan treats self-cognition as the &quot;cause&quot; of consciousness&#x27; subjective and objective aspects. Where the Yogācāra model is concerned with epistemology, the Huayan model is cosmogony-oriented. That is, according to Fazang, self-cognition is the original karmic appearance which causes the delusive world of samsāra with all its suffering. It is a state in which the mind is aware only of itself. Fazang says it is karmic since it is an action and is the cause of suffering. Of this karmic activity, Fazang states that, &quot;Although this is (a form of) active conceptualization, it is exceedingly subtle and in a dependently originated single characteristic, that which can (cause) and that which is (caused) are not divided.&quot; According to Fazang, based on delusion, a semblance of suchness arises which stirs the Mind-as-Suchness to produce the karmic consciousness.

The active role of suchness

Fazang held that suchness plays an active role in creating the realm of perception and the world of phenomena. This is unlike the Yogācāra view of Xuanzang, for whom suchness plays only a passive role in the evolution of the phenomenal world. According to the &quot;faxiang&quot; (dharma characteristics) view associated with Xuanzang&#x27;s Yogācāra, the relationship of phenomena to suchness is that of &quot;house and ground&quot; in which the ground (suchness) supports the house (phenomena), but the two are nonetheless distinct. On the other hand, according to the &quot;faxing&quot; (dharma nature) view of Huayan, the relationship between suchness and phenomena is one of &quot;water and wave&quot; in which the wind of ignorance stirs the water (suchness) to produce waves (phenomena).

The singular nature of the shared sensory world

Other differences between Huayan and classical Yogācāra were highlighted during Ming dynasty debates over the nature of the &quot;bhājanaloka&quot;, or container world (i.e. the shared world of sensory experience). According to classical Yogācāra, strictly speaking, each being occupies its own sensory world, which nonetheless overlaps with those of other beings with whom a suitable karmic connection is shared. Thus, according to this view, there are technically as many sensory worlds as there are beings. Huayan exegetes such as Kongyin Zhencheng (1547–1617) in the Ming dynasty rejected this. Drawing on Huayan notions, such as that of an all-encompassing holistic &quot;dharmadhātu&quot;, Zhencheng argued that there is just a single sensory world which is shared by all beings.

Objective idealism versus subjective idealism

According to Fung Yu-lan, where Xuanzang&#x27;s classical Yogācāra is a system of subjective idealism, Huayan is one of objective idealism. Regarding the Huayan position, Fung says, &quot;the central element in Fa-tsang’s philosophy is a permanently immutable &#x27;mind&#x27; which is universal or absolute in its scope, and is the basis for all phenomenal manifestations. That is to say, his philosophy is a system of objective idealism. As such, it approaches realism more closely than does an idealism which is purely subjective. This is because, in a system of objective idealism, it is possible for the objective world to survive even when separated from a subject.&quot; Regarding the Yogācāra and Huayan schools, Wing-Tsit Chan says, &quot;in both schools, the external world, called external sphere by Hsüan-tsang and the Realm of Facts by Fa-tsang, is considered manifestations of the mind. In both schools, these manifestations have universal and objective validity, although the degree of validity is higher in Hua-yen. The interesting thing is that Hua-yen presupposes a preestablished harmony while the Consciousness-Only School does not.&quot;

=== Classification of Buddhist teachings ===
In order to understand the vast number of texts and teachings they had received from India, Chinese Buddhist schools developed schematic classifications of these various teachings (called &quot;panjiao&quot;), such as the Five Periods and Eight Teachings of the Tiantai school.

The Huayan school patriarch Zhiyan developed a five tiered doctrinal classification of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching which was expanded on by later figures such as Fazang. The five tiers are:
# The Hinayana teachings found in the Agamas and Abhidharma which is grounded in not-self (anatman). Fazang calls this &quot;the teaching of the existence of dharmas and the non-existence of the self&quot;.
# The Mahayana teachings which focus on emptiness, non-arising and lack of form, and include the &quot;Prajñaparamita sutras&quot;, Yogacara teachings on consciousness, and Madhyamaka sources like the &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika.&quot;
# The &quot;Final&quot; Mahayana teaching which according to Fazang teach the &quot;eternal nature of the tathagatagarbha&quot;. Fazang writes that this teaching is based on buddha-nature sources like the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;, &quot;Srimaladevi sutra&quot;, &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot;, and &quot;Dilun shastra.&quot;
# The Sudden Teaching, which is non-verbal and non-conceptual. This was associated with Vimalakirti&#x27;s silence in the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra&quot; by Fazang. Chengguan also associated this with the &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot; teachings of the Chan school.
# The Complete or Perfect (Ch: &quot;yuan&quot;, lit. &quot;Round&quot;) Teaching of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; and Huayan which teach both the interpenetration of principle (or buddha-nature) and phenomena as well as the interpenetration of all phenomena with each other.

Huayan and Chan had doctrinal arguments regarding which would be the correct concept of sudden awakening. The teachings of the Chan school were regarded as inferior by Huayan masters, a characterization which was rejected by Chan masters.

== Practice ==

The Huayan school developed numerous practices as part of their conception of the bodhisattva path. These include devotional practices, studying, chanting and copying of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot;, repentance rituals, recitation of dharanis, and meditation. These various elements might also be combined in ritual manuals such as &quot;The Practice of Samantabhadra&#x27;s Huayan Dharma Realm Aspiration and Realization&quot; (華嚴普賢行願修證儀, Taisho Supplement, No. X1473) by Jinshui Jingyuan (靜源) which are still practiced together by Huayan communities during day long events.

=== Textual practices ===
According to Paul Williams, some of the central practices for the Huayan tradition were textual practices, such as the recitation of the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;. The ritual chanting, studying and copying of the sutra was often done in &quot;Huayen Assemblies&quot; (Huayanhui), who would meet regularly to chant the sutra. Chanting the entire sutra could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. 

Regular chanting of important passages from the sutra is also common, particularly the &quot;Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna (The Aspiration Prayer for Good Conduct),&quot; sometimes called the &quot;Vows of Samantabhadra&quot;&quot;.&quot; Solo chanting practice was also common, and another common element of reciting the sutra was bowing to the sutra during the chanting. Since this practice is time-consuming, it was also often done in solitary retreats called &quot;biguan,&quot; which could last years.

Copying the entire sutra (or passages from the sutra) by hand was also another key practice in this tradition and some sutra copyists were known for their excellent calligraphy. This practice was also sometimes combined with chanting and bowing as well. Sutra copying is a traditional Buddhist practice which remains important in modern Chinese Buddhism. Another element that was sometimes added to this practice was to use one&#x27;s own blood in the process of sutra copying (sometimes just blood mixed with the ink). This blood writing was rare, but it was done by a few celebrated figures, like Hanshan Deqing (1546-1623) and the Republican Period monk Shouye.

=== Contemplation of Buddhas and bodhisattvas ===

Another practice which is often highlighted in the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; and in the Huayan school is that of buddhānusmṛti (Ch. &quot;nianfo&quot;), contemplation of the Buddha. In Chinese Buddhism, one popular method of contemplating the Buddha is to recite the Buddha&#x27;s name. The practice of reciting the names of the Buddhas was also seen as a way to achieve rebirth in Vairocana&#x27;s Pure Land, the Lotus Treasury World (Skt. Padmagarbha-lokadhātu; Ch. &quot;Lianhuazang shijie&quot; 蓮花藏世界). This Pure Land contains the entire universe, including our world, and it is identical with the entire Dharmadhatu. As such, for Huayan, our own world (known as the &quot;Sahā world&quot;) is also the Lotus Storehouse Pure Land. Huayan also saw Vairocana&#x27;s Pure land as non-dual and interfused with Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land of Sukhavati.

The practice of Buddha contemplation was promoted by various figures, such as the Huayan patriarchs Chengguan, Zongmi, the Goryeo monk Gyunyeo (923–973) and Peng Shaosheng, a householder scholar of the Qing dynasty.

The patriarch Guīfēng Zōngmì taught four types of buddhānusmṛti (&quot;nianfo&quot;), a schema that was also adopted by later Chinese figures: These four types of nianfo are the following:
* “Contemplation of the name” (&quot;chēngmíng niàn&quot; 稱名念), modeled on &quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra preached by Mañjuśrī&quot; (Taisho. 232). One selects Buddha, faces their direction, and then one mentally &quot;holds&quot; (chēngmíng 稱名) the sound of the name until one has a vision of all buddhas.
* “Contemplating an image” (&quot;guānxiàng niàn&quot; 觀像念), based on the &quot;Great Jewel Collection Sutra&quot; (大寶積經, &quot;Dà bǎojī jīng&quot; , T.310), which entails contemplating the form of a Buddha by using a Buddha image.
* “Contemplating the visualization” (&quot;guānxiǎng niàn&quot; 觀想念), this entails contemplating a Buddha&#x27;s body without the aid of a physical image, and is based on sutras like &quot;Sutra on the samadhi-ocean of the contemplation of the Buddha&quot; (T.643) and &quot;Sutra on the samadhi of seated meditation&quot; (T.614).
* “Contemplating the true mark” (&quot;shíxiàng niàn&quot; 實相念), which entails the contemplation of the Dharmakaya, the true nature of all dharmas, Dharmata. This is &quot;the true nature of the Buddha&quot; according to &quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra Preached by Mañjuśrī&quot;, which is &quot;unproduced and unextinguished, neither going nor coming, without name and without feature&quot;.

Another leading figure in the teaching of Huayan Nianfo was the 12th century Song monk Yihe (義和) who combined the method of nianfo with Huayan meditation teachings and the practice of the ten vows of Samantabhadra and saw this practice as a method of realizing the Huayan vision of ultimate reality. During the Qing, Baiting Xufa (1641-1728) and the lay scholar Peng Shaosheng (1740–1796) further promoted Huayan-Nianfo methods. Huayan Pure Land practice also sometimes included devotion to bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara. This promoted by figures like the Korean monks Ŭisang and Ch&#x27;ewŏn.

===Visualization meditations===
The lay scholar-practitioner Li Tongxuan (635-730) writes of a meditative practice based on the 9th chapter of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot;. The practice, named &quot;the contemplation of Buddhalight&quot; (&quot;foguang guan&quot;), focused on contemplating and visualizing the universal light which is radiated by the Buddha in one&#x27;s mind and expanding one&#x27;s contemplation further and further outwards until it fills the entire universe. This contemplation of the Buddha&#x27;s light leads to a state of joyful tranquility which leads to insight into emptiness. The meditative teachings of Li Tongxuan were especially influential on the Japanese Kegon monk Myōe, who promoted a similar practiced that he termed &quot;the Samadhi of Contemplating the Buddha&#x27;s Radiance&quot; (Japanese: &quot;bukkō zanmaikan&quot;, 佛光三昧觀).

Another visualization type meditation was promoted by the Korean Huayan monk Ch’ewŏn. Ch’ewŏn taught visualization meditation (kwansang 觀想) on bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. According to Ch’ewŏn, this is effective because Avalokiteśvara’s sphere of realization, the essence of one&#x27;s own mind and Avalokiteśvara and one’s own body are mutually interfused and interpenetrating. 

===Meditation and the fourfold Dharmadhatu===
Various Huayan texts provide different frameworks for the practice of meditation and the development of samadhi. Huayan sources mentions two key samadhis, the ocean-seal samadhi (Ch. &quot;haiyin sanmei&quot;) and the huayan samadhi (&quot;huayan sanmei&quot;). Some key Huayan sources which discuss meditation include Dushun&#x27;s &quot;Contemplation of the Realm of Reality&quot; (&quot;Fajie guanmen&quot;) and &quot;The Ending of Delusion&quot; and the &quot;Return to the Source&quot; (&quot;Wangjin huanyuan&quot;) attributed to Fazang. Another key text is the &quot;Cessation and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan&quot; (&quot;Huayan wujiao zhiguan&quot; 華嚴五教止觀).

Dushun&#x27;s meditative framework was based on three main stages of contemplation: (1) understanding emptiness as the true nature of all dharmas, (2) understanding that all dharmas are harmonious with the truth, and (3) understanding that all dharmas do not obstruct each other and that each dharma contains all other dharmas.

The theory of the &quot;fourfold Dharmadhatu&quot; (&quot;sifajie&quot;, 四法界) eventually became the central meditative framework for the Huayan tradition. This doctrinal and meditative framework is explained in Chengguan&#x27;s meditation manual titled &quot;Meditative Perspectives on the Huayan Dharmadhatu&quot; (&quot;Huayan Fajie Guanmen&quot;, 華嚴法界觀門) and its commentaries. The Dharmadhatu is the goal of the bodhisattva&#x27;s practice, the ultimate nature of reality which must be known or entered into. According to Fox, the Fourfold Dharmadhatu is &quot;four cognitive approaches to the world, four ways of apprehending reality&quot;.

These four ways of seeing reality are:

# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events or phenomena (shi 事). This is the mundane way of seeing and is not a contemplation or meditation, but the pre-meditative perspective.
# All events are an expression of &quot;li&quot; (理, the ultimate principle), which is associated with the concepts of &quot;true emptiness&quot;, “One Mind” (&quot;yi xin&quot; 一心) and Buddha nature. This is the first level of Huayan meditation.
# This is the “non-obstruction of principle and phenomena” (&quot;lishi wuai&quot; 理事無礙), i.e. their interpenetration and interfusion.
# All events / phenomena interpenetrate (&quot;shishi wuai&quot; 事事無礙), which refers to how &quot;all distinct phenomenal dharmas interfuse and penetrate in all ways&quot; (Zongmi). This is also described as “universal pervasion and complete accommodation.”

According to Fox, &quot;these dharmadhatus are not separate worlds – they are actually increasingly more holographic perspectives on a single phenomenological manifold...they more properly represent four types or orders of perspectives on experience.&quot; Furthermore, for Huayan, this contemplation is the solution to the problem of suffering which lies in the &quot;fixation or attachment to a particular perspective. What we think are the essences of objects are really therefore nothing but mere names, mere functional designations, and none of these contextual definitions need necessarily interfere with any of the others.&quot;

Regarding the practical application of this teaching, Baiting Xufa correlated the practice of nianfo with the fourfold Dharmadhatu as follows:

# Nianfo on the level of the realm of phenomena refers to reciting the name of the Buddha as if the Buddha was external to oneself.
# Nianfo on the level of the ultimate principle refers to reciting nianfo while knowing it as mind-only (cittamatra).
# Nianfo practice on the level of “non-obstruction of principle and phenomena” refers to a nianfo practice which has transcended notions like &quot;buddha&quot;, &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;name of the buddha&quot;.
# Nianfo on the level of the interpenetration of all dharmas refers to the realization that the name of Buddha and the mind is all pervasive throughout the one true dharmadhatu.

===Esoteric practices===


Fazang promoted the practice of several dharanis, such as the Xuanzang&#x27;s version of the &quot;Dhāraṇī of Avalokiteśvara-ekadaśamukha&quot;.

The synthesis of Huayan with Chinese Esoteric Buddhist practices was a feature of the Buddhism of the Khitan Liao Dynasty. Jueyuan, a Huayan monk from Yuanfu Temple during the Liao Dynasty and author of the &quot;Dari jing yishi yanmi chao,&quot; practiced esoteric rituals like Homa and Abhiseka based on the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot; and the tradition of Yixing. Furthermore, according to Sorensen, the iconography of the Huayan Vairocana Buddha and the Esoteric Mahavairocana also became fused during the post-Tang period.

Perhaps the most important figure in the synthesis of Huayan and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism was the 11th century monk Daoshen (道蝗), author of the &quot;Xianmi yuantong chengfo xinyao ji&quot; (顯密圓通成佛心要集 &quot;Collection of Essentials for the Attainment of Buddhahood by Total [Inter-]Penetration of the Esoteric and the Exoteric,&quot; T1955). The work is divided into three parts. Part one summarizes the Huayan philosophy, which Daoshen sees as the highest form of the explicit or manifest Buddhist teachings. It also discusses the praxis of Huayan, here called “cultivating the ocean of Samantabhadra’s practices”, which includes numerous exoteric Buddhist practices such as breath meditation, meditation on emptiness, prostrations, offerings, confession rites, vows, and buddha name recitation. 

The second part of this work teaches esoteric Buddhism or mantra method (Mijiao, Zhenyan), with a focus on the Cundi dharani and other mantras (like the Mani mantra) which are said to have many powerful effects and is recommended even for laypersons. Finally, the third part promotes &quot;the systematic integration of exoteric doctrine and occult practice, arguing that each is incomplete without the other, whether they are practised in sequence or in tandem.&quot;

According to Gimello:Daozhen’s central thesis in the work is that the “body” of Huayan doctrine and the envisaged image of Cundi are somehow co-inherent, and that by invoking the presence of the goddess we somehow confirm the truth of the doctrines and render them practically efficacious. In other words, Daozhen holds that if one recites Cundi dharani and/or visualizes the dharani in its graphic form as an array of Sanskrit letters or Chinese characters, and then imagines the goddess’s anthropomorphic bodily image emerging from the intoned and envisioned syllables of the spell, all the while performing the corresponding manual gestures (mudra), one will thereby both quicken and verify the truth of the doctrines, and one will do this not merely allegorically but also, if I may say so, sacramentally. Important esoteric texts used in the Liao tradition included the: &quot;Cundī-dhāraṇī&quot;, the &quot;Usṇīsavijayā-dhāranī&quot;, the &quot;Nīlakaṇthaka-dhāranī&quot; and the &quot;Sutra on the Great Dharma Torch Dhāraṇī&quot; ( 大法炬陀羅尼 經, &quot;Da faju tuoluoni jing&quot;) among others. In the Liao, stupas, pagodas and statues were often empowered with dharanis and mantras. These structures would often be filled or inscribed with dharanis, sutras, or mantras like the Six syllable mantra of Avalokiteshvara. Pillars inscribed with dhāraṇīs and mantras were also common.

The synthesis of Esoteric Buddhist practice with Huayan Buddhism remained popular during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), where &quot;Usṇīsavijayā and&quot; Cundī practices were some of the most popular. A similar synthesis of Huayan-Chan Buddhism (derived from Zongmi) with esoteric Buddhist teachings and practices from Tibetan Buddhism (mainly Sakya and Kagyu) also occurred in Buddhism of the Western Xia (1038–1227) dynasty.

Dharanis like the &quot;Cundī-dhāraṇī&quot;, the &quot;Usṇīsavijayā-dhāranī&quot;, and the &quot;Nīlakaṇthaka-dhāranī&quot; remain important in modern Huayan Buddhism and are chanted in modern Dharma assemblies. Another dharani / esoteric practice in modern Huayan is the contemplation of the 42 Avatamsaka syllables (a version of the arapacana alphabet, which is a contemplation found in various Mahayana sources).

The Japanese Kegon school was known for adopting many esoteric mantras and practices from the Shingon school. The Kegon monk Myōe was known for his widespread promotion of the popular Mantra of Light (&quot;kōmyō shingon&quot;, 光明眞言). Due to influence from the Shingon school, today&#x27;s Kegon school retains numerous esoteric Buddhist elements.

===The path and sudden awakening===
The Huayan school defended a sudden awakening view. This is because the buddha-nature is already present in all sentient beings, and also because their theory of universal interpenetration entails that Buddhahood is interfused with the very first stage of a bodhisattva&#x27;s path. Thus, according to patriarch Fazang, “when one first arouses the thought of enlightenment [bodhicitta] one also becomes perfectly enlightened”.

Similarly, according to Gimello, Huayan master Li Tongxuan understands the path as follows:The first access of faith in the mind of the practitioner is in itself the culmination of the entire path, the very realization of final Buddhahood... ‘Faith’ or confidence in the possibility of enlightenment is nothing but enlightenment itself, in an &quot;anticipatory and causative modality&quot;. This interpenetration of all elements of the path to awakening is also a consequence of the Huayan view of time, which sees all moments as interfused (including a sentient being&#x27;s present practice and their eventual future Buddhahood aeons from now). Since time itself is empty, all moments (past, present, and future) are interfused with each other. As Fazang writes, &quot;beginning and end Interpenetrate. On each [bodhisattva] stage, one is thus both a Bodhisattva and a Buddha.&quot; As such, Huayan does not understand a bodhisattva&#x27;s progress through the bodhisattva stages (bhumis) as being linear. Instead, as soon as one reaches the earlier stages of &quot;perfection of faith&quot; (which is part of Huayan&#x27;s 52 bhumi model), one has also acquired all the stages, as well as Buddhahood. This doctrine of &quot;enlightenment at the stage of faith&quot; (信滿成佛, &quot;xinman cheng fo&quot;) was a unique feature of Huayan and was first introduced by Fazang though it has a precedent in a passage of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;.

In Huayan, Buddhahood transcends all concepts, times and stages. Because practice cannot create something that is not immanent, Huayan sees the bodhisattva path as simply revealing what is already there (buddha-nature, which is buddhahood itself concealed within sentient beings). In spite of this doctrine, Huayan patriarchs also argued that the gradual practices of the bodhisattva stages are still necessary. This is because all stages retain their particularity even while being wholly interfused and only through the practice of the bodhisattva path does the immanent Buddhahood manifest.

Thus, according to Li Tongxuan &quot;there is no other enlightenment&quot; than simply following the bodhisattva path, and furthermore:Primordial wisdom is made manifest through meditation; cultivation does not create it or bring it into being. If one simply follows the Bodhisattva Path and learns the bodhisattva practices, primordial wisdom will shine forth of itself...Similarly, patriarch Zongmi held that Buddhahood is reached through &quot;sudden awakening followed by gradual cultivation&quot; and he also held that &quot;sudden and gradual are not only not contradictory, but are actually complementary&quot;.

<text>The history of the Royal Canadian Navy goes back to 1910, when the naval force was created as the Naval Service of Canada and renamed a year later by King George V. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) is one of the three environmental commands of the Canadian Forces. Over the course of its history, the RCN has played a role in the First World War, contributed significantly to the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War, and was a part of NATO&#x27;s force buildup during the Cold War. In 1968, the RCN was amalgamated with the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force to form what is today the unified Canadian Armed Forces. The naval force was known as Maritime Command until 2011, when the environmental command was renamed as the Royal Canadian Navy.

==History==
===Formative years===
During the early years of the 20th century, there was growing debate within the British Empire as to the role the Dominions would play in defence and foreign relations. Because of the developing naval arms race with Germany, a key part of this discussion focused on naval issues. In Canada, the naval debate came down to a choice between two options: either the young country could provide funds, support and manpower to the Royal Navy, or it could form its own navy, which could help support the Royal Navy if necessary. After extensive political debates, Canadian politicians chose the latter option.

On 29 March 1909, George Foster introduced a resolution in the House of Commons calling for the establishment of a Canadian Naval Service. The resolution was not successful; however, on 12 January 1910, the government of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier took Foster&#x27;s resolution and introduced it as the Naval Service Bill. After third reading, the bill received royal assent on 4 May 1910, becoming the &quot;Naval Service Act&quot; which created a Department of the Naval Service under the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, who also became the Minister of the Naval Service. The act called for:

* a permanent force
* a reserve (to be called up in emergency)
* a volunteer reserve (to be called up in emergency)
* the establishment of a naval college

The official title of the navy was the Naval Service of Canada (also Canadian Naval Forces), and the first Director of the Naval Service of Canada was Rear-Admiral Charles Kingsmill (Royal Navy, retired), who had previously been in charge of the Marine Service of the Department of Marine and Fisheries. A request to change name of the Naval Service of Canada to Royal Canadian Navy on 30 January 1911, brought a favourable reply from King George V on 29 August of that year.

The naval college was established in the dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1911 as &quot;Royal Naval College of Canada&quot;. The Royal Naval College was established to impart a complete education in Naval Science. Graduates were qualified to enter the Imperial or Canadian Service as midshipmen although a Naval career was not compulsory. The course provided a grounding in Applied Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Navigation, History and Modern Languages and was accepted as qualifying for entry as second-year students in Canadian Universities. The program aimed to develop both the physical and mental including discipline, the ability to obey and take charge, and honour. Candidates had to be between their fourteenth and sixteenth birthdays on 1 July following the examination. The original Royal Naval College of Canada facilities were destroyed in December 1917 in the Halifax Explosion. What could be salvaged was moved to at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. The &quot;Royal Canadian Naval College&quot; moved in 1919 to a building in the naval dockyard at Esquimalt, British Columbia. The college was closed in 1922.

To form the nucleus of its new navy, and to train Canadians for the country&#x27;s planned fleet of five cruisers and six destroyers, Canada acquired two ships from Great Britain. The cruiser was the first ship commissioned into Canada&#x27;s navy on 4 August 1910, at Portsmouth, England. She arrived at Esquimalt on 7 November 1910, and carried out fishery patrols and training duties on Canada&#x27;s west coast. Another Royal Navy cruiser, , became the second ship commissioned into the Canadian navy on 6 September 1910, at Devonport in England and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 21 October 1910—Trafalgar Day.
These initial plans encountered significant setbacks following Laurier&#x27;s defeat in the 1911 federal election, in which the debate about naval policy played a significant part. The new Conservative government, led by Robert Borden, had opposed the Naval Service Act while they were in opposition. At the urging of the Admiralty&#x27;s First Sea Lord Winston Churchill, Borden agreed to finance the construction of three dreadnoughts for $35 million. This plan was far more costly than Laurier&#x27;s original plan of the Canadian-built fleet, and would reap no benefits to Canadian industries whatsoever. On 5 December 1912, Borden introduced the Naval Aid Bill as a one-time contribution to the British Royal Navy. After a bitter debate and a long filibuster by the opposition Liberals, the Borden government invoked cloture on the debate, for the first time ever in Canadian Parliament, and the bill passed third reading on 15 May 1913. The act was soundly defeated by the Liberal-majority Senate two weeks later. The Royal Canadian Navy now found itself in limbo, with very limited funds for operations, two obsolescent cruisers, and no prospect of new ships being built or acquired.

Despite the problems of these early years, some Canadians were still active supporters of a national navy. Building on earlier, unofficial efforts, a volunteer reserve came into being in May 1914 as the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve (RNCVR). Its initial establishment was 1,200 men, and it was divided into three distinct geographic areas: (1) Atlantic, (2) Pacific, and (3) Lake (representing inland areas). During the First World War, it would expand considerably, and also establish an &quot;Overseas Division&quot; specifically for service with the Royal Navy.

Immediately before the First World War, the premier of British Columbia, in a fit of public spirit, purchased two submarines ( and ) from a shipyard in Washington. The submarines had been built for the Chilean Navy but the purchase had fallen through. On 7 August 1914, the Government of Canada purchased the boats from the Government of British Columbia, and they were consequently commissioned into the RCN.

===First World War===
At the outbreak of the First World War on 5 August 1914, two government vessels, CGS &quot;Canada&quot; (renamed ) and , were immediately pressed into naval service, joining &quot;Niobe&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot; and the two submarines &quot;CC-1&quot; and &quot;CC-2&quot;, to form a six-vessel naval force. At this point, London and Ottawa were planning to significantly expand the RCN, but it was decided that Canadian men would be permitted to enlist in either the Royal Navy or its Canadian counterpart, with many choosing the former.

During the fall of 1914, HMCS &quot;Rainbow&quot; patrolled the west coast of North America, as far south as Panama, although these patrols became less important following the elimination of the German naval threat in the Pacific with the December 1914 defeat of German Admiral Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Many of &quot;Rainbow&quot; crew were posted to the east coast for the remainder of the war and by 1917 &quot;Rainbow&quot; was withdrawn from service.

The early part of the war also saw HMCS &quot;Niobe&quot; actively patrolling off the coast of New York City as part of British blockading forces, but she returned to Halifax permanently in July 1915 when she was declared no longer fit for service and was converted to a depot ship. She was heavily damaged in the December 1917 Halifax Explosion.

&quot;CC-1&quot; and &quot;CC-2&quot; spent the first three years of the war patrolling the Pacific; however, the lack of German threat saw them reposted to Halifax in 1917. With their tender, HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot;, they became the first warships to transit the Panama Canal flying the White Ensign (the RCN&#x27;s service flag). Arriving in Halifax on 17 October 1917, they were declared unfit for service and never patrolled again, being scrapped in 1920.

In June 1918, was sunk by a U-boat. In terms of the number of dead, the sinking was the most significant Canadian naval disaster of the First World War.

On 5 September 1918, the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service (RCNAS) was formed with a main function to carry out anti-submarine operations using flying boat patrol aircraft. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Air Station Halifax, located on the eastern shores of the harbour at Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia, was acquired, but following the 11 November 1918 Armistice, the RCNAS was discontinued.

===Inter-war period===

Following a draw-down in the RCN after the war, the RCN undertook to find a mission and found it in taking over many of the civilian responsibilities of the Marine Service of the Department of Transport. Even though by 1922 the RCN had been cut back to 366 men and had paid off its last remaining cruiser HMCS &quot;Aurora&quot;, the Navy kept two destroyers donated by the Royal Navy, and , until they were replaced in the late 1920s by two other ex-Royal Navy vessels and , and thereby maintained ships in service throughout the lean years.

On 31 January 1923, the RNCVR was replaced by the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR). The initial authorized strength of the RCNVR was 1,000 all ranks. Twelve Canadian cities (Calgary, Charlottetown, Edmonton, Halifax, Hamilton, Ottawa, Prince Rupert, Quebec City, Regina, Saint John, Saskatoon and Vancouver) were earmarked for divisions of &quot;Half-Company&quot; strength, i.e. 50 men, all ranks. Three larger cities (Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg) were ordered to man to a &quot;Company&quot; strength, which was 100, all ranks. The first commission was given, on 14 March 1923, to Lieutenant Frank Meade, who established a Company sized detachment in Montreal. By the end of 1923, twelve units had been formed.

In 1931, the RCN underwent a major facelift when the first ships specifically built for the RCN, the destroyers and , were commissioned at Portsmouth, England.

In late January 1932, &quot;Skeena&quot; along with &quot;Vancouver&quot; provided protection to British assets and civilians in El Salvador at the request of the British Consul in San Salvador following the outbreak of a peasant uprising. A landing party was briefly sent ashore at Acajutla, but the situation there improved and the sailors saw no combat, although the two ships remained in the area until the end of the month.

Throughout the 1930s, the RCN, along with its sister services, was starved of funding and equipment. Nevertheless, this decade saw the RCN slowly begin its rebuilding, as Ottawa joined London, Paris, and Washington in a growing apprehension of the ramifications of Nazi Germany&#x27;s rearmament and the adventurism of Italy and Japan, and procured two more destroyers from the Royal Navy: and . A custom-built training vessel, the tern schooner based on the famous &quot;Bluenose&quot; was commissioned in 1938 for advanced seamanship training. By the outbreak of war in September 1939, however, the RCN still had only six River-class destroyers, five minesweepers and two small training vessels, bases at Halifax and Victoria, and altogether 145 officers and 1,674 men.

===Second World War===
The RCN expanded substantially during the Second World War, with the larger vessels transferred or purchased from the US and British navies (many through the Destroyers for Bases Agreement), and the smaller vessels such as corvettes and frigates constructed in Canada. By the end of the conflict Canada had the fourth-largest navy in the world, behind the United States, the United Kingdom and the USSR, but only two ships larger than destroyers, the light cruisers and . Although it showed its inexperience at times during the early part of the war, a navy made up of men from all across the country, including many who had never before seen a large body of water, proved capable of exceeding the expectations of its allies. By the end of the Battle of the Atlantic, the RCN was the primary navy in the northwest sector of the Atlantic Ocean and under the command of Rear-Admiral Murray was responsible for the safe escort of innumerable convoys and the destruction of many U-boats—an anti-submarine capability that the RCN would build upon in post-war years. The Northwest Atlantic Theatre was the only theatre not under command of either a Briton or American during the entire war.

At the end of the Battle of the Atlantic, Canadian ships (either alone or in conjunction with other ships and planes) sank a total of 27 U-boats, and either sank or captured 42 Axis surface ships. But the real victory was not so much in the statistics of battle, as in the successful completion of 25,343 merchant ship crossings, carrying 181,643,180 tons of cargo and a significant proportion of the Canadian and US forces for the eventual victory in Europe. Canada lost 24 ships in five different theatres: first was &quot;Fraser&quot;, sunk in a collision while evacuating refugees from France in 1940; , , and were lost in 1944 during Operation Neptune and cross-Channel escort duty; and sank in the Mediterranean Sea during the North African invasions of Operation Torch; eight ships were sunk protecting Canadian coastal waters , , and (minesweepers), and (armed yachts), and and (corvettes); and nine ships were lost on Atlantic escort duty &quot;Margaree&quot;, , , , &quot;Ottawa&quot;, &quot;St. Croix&quot;, , &quot;Skeena&quot; and (on loan to the RCN from the Royal Navy). Altogether the RCN lost 1,797 seamen, and 95 became prisoners of war.

As the end of the war against Germany approached, attention focused on Japan. At the end of 1944, some RCN ships were deployed with the British Pacific Fleet, joining the many Canadian personnel already serving with the Royal Navy in the Pacific War. Ottawa was also laying plans to expand the RCN&#x27;s capabilities beyond its anti-submarine orientation. The war in the Pacific was expected to culminate with a massive invasion of Japan itself, and this would need a different navy than that required in the Atlantic.

Britain was nearly bankrupt after five and a half years of war and was looking to shrink its military somewhat, especially since the United States was now the dominant power in the Pacific. With this in mind, the RCN and the Royal Australian Navy were to receive many ships considered surplus to the RN&#x27;s needs, with the end goal being a powerful Commonwealth fleet of Australian, British, Canadian, and New Zealand ships alongside the United States Navy. As in the First World War, the war ended before these plans came to fruition. With the dropping of two nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan&#x27;s surrender was effected.

With the end of the war, the RCN stopped expanding. A planned transfer of two light aircraft carriers from the Royal Navy, and was slowed, and when &quot;Warrior&quot; was found to be unsuitable for a North Atlantic winter, she was sent to the west coast and the next year was replaced by &quot;Magnificent&quot;, with &quot;Warrior&quot; being returned to the Royal Navy. Canada still had two light cruisers, and HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot; (later HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot;), a number of and other destroyers, and a mass of frigates, corvettes, and other ships, the majority of which were mothballed by 1947.

===1949 &#x27;mutinies&#x27;===
In the late winter of 1949, the RCN was shaken by three almost simultaneous cases of mass insubordination variously described as &quot;Incidents&quot; or &quot;Mutinies&quot;:

* On 26 February, when the destroyer was on a fuelling stop at Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, ninety Leading Seamen and below—constituting more than half the ship&#x27;s company—locked themselves in their messdecks, and refused to come out until getting the captain to hear their grievances.
* On 15 March, in another destroyer—, at Nanjing, China—eighty-three junior ratings held a similar protest.
* On 20 March, thirty-two aircraft handlers on the carrier &quot;Magnificent&quot;, which was on fleet manoeuvres in the Caribbean Sea, briefly refused an order to turn to morning cleaning stations.

As noted by Dr. Richard Gimblett, researcher and himself a retired naval officer the respective captains in all three cases acted with great sensitivity, entering the messes for an informal discussion of the sailors&#x27; grievances and carefully avoided using the term &quot;mutiny,&quot; which could have had severe legal consequences for the sailors involved. Specifically, the captain of &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, while talking with the disgruntled crew members, is known to have placed his cap over a written list of demands, which could have been used as legal evidence of a mutiny, and pretended not to notice it.

Still, the Canadian government of the time—the early years of the Cold War—felt apprehensive of &quot;The Red Menace,&quot; especially since the naval sailors&#x27; discontent coincided with a Communist-inspired strike in the Canadian merchant marine (also, one of the incidents occurred in a country—China—where the local Communists were in the fast process of winning a civil war and gaining power).

Defence Minister Brooke Claxton appointed Rear-Admiral Rollo Mainguy, Flag Officer Atlantic Coast, to head a commission of inquiry. The Mainguy Report— described by Dr. Gimblett as &quot;a watershed in the Navy&#x27;s history, whose findings, recommendations and conclusions remain a potent legacy&quot;—concluded that no evidence was found of Communist influence or of collusion between the three crews.

The &quot;General Causes Contributing to [the] Breakdown of Discipline&quot; noted by the commission included:

* Collapse of the Divisional System of personnel management;
* Failure to provide Welfare Committees for the airing of petty grievances, which led to sailors informally adopting a kind of equivalent to a sit down strike;
* Frequent changes in ships&#x27; manning and routines with inadequate explanation;
* A deterioration in the traditional relationship between officers and petty officers;
* The absence of a distinguishing Canadian identity in the Navy.

The last issue—an assertion of &quot;an uncaring officer corps harbouring aristocratic British attitudes inappropriate to Canadian democratic sensitivities&quot;—went beyond the question of sailors&#x27; morale and touched on the basic identity of the Canadian Navy and indeed, on the national identity of Canada as a whole.

It was to have ramifications in the process undertaken in later decades, painful to many of the officers concerned, of deliberately cutting off many of the British traditions in such areas as ensigns and uniforms.

===Cold War===

Immediately after the end of the Second World War, Canada, like many other countries, dramatically reduced its military expenditures. For the RCN, this meant large cuts to its personnel strength and number of commissioned ships. The emergence of the Cold War and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), followed by the outbreak of the Korean War, prompted the Canadian government to dramatically increase its military spending. For the RCN, this resulted in increased numbers of personnel, the recommissioning and modification of some Second World War ships held in reserve, the design and construction of new classes of ships, and the upgrading of its recently created aviation capabilities. RCN destroyers formed part of Canada&#x27;s initial response to the United Nations&#x27; call for assistance during the Korean War, and were sent to Korean waters to join other UN naval forces. The Canadian ships&#x27; duties included &quot;exciting but dangerous&quot; shore bombardments and the destruction of North Korean trains and railway lines. Initially dispatched in 1950, Canadian destroyers maintained a presence off the Korean peninsula until 1955.

At much the same time, the growing Soviet submarine threat led the RCN to update and convert existing ships to improve their anti-submarine capabilities. Most notably, 21 wartime River-class frigates were extensively converted to s during the mid-to-late 1950s. The RCN also acquired several new classes of anti-submarine destroyer escorts (DDEs) to augment its fleet. Built in Canada, these ships pioneered innovative design features, including a distinctive rounded upper part of the hull which helped seawater drain from the deck during the extremely rough weather and also helped minimize winter-time ice buildup. The first of these new ships were the seven DDEs, which were soon followed by the , , and classes with seven, four, and two vessels respectively. Following the construction of these new ships throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the RCN was able to retire most of its remaining vessels dating from the Second World War. The RCN intended to replace some of the capabilities lost with the retirement of those vessels with the General Purpose Frigate, but after disagreement over the direction of the service, the project was scrapped.

Seeking to improve its ships&#x27; anti-submarine capabilities, the RCN pioneered the use of large ship-borne helicopters on small surface ships like destroyers in the rough waters of the North Atlantic and Pacific. The recovery of helicopters to a wildly pitching flight deck was made possible by the invention of the &quot;Bear Trap&quot;, a cable and winch system which hauled a helicopter, hovering at full power, to the flight deck in all manner of conditions. Using this technology, the &quot;St. Laurent&quot;-class DDEs were upgraded to destroyer-helicopter (DDH) vessels during the early to mid-1960s to accommodate recently acquired CH-124 Sea King anti-submarine helicopters. Other ships also received upgrades to increase their anti-submarine capabilities. The RCN was also actively involved in the development of various forms of ship-borne sonar, most notably the variable depth sonar (VDS), which greatly increased the ranges at which submarines could be detected. The improved capabilities conferred by these innovations contributed to Canada&#x27;s NATO allies giving the RCN an expanded anti-submarine role in the North Atlantic. Much of the RCN&#x27;s experimental work in these fields was conducted in conjunction with the Defence Research Board, and it would later include experiments leading to the development of the fastest warship ever built, the .

The RCN also expanded and improved its aviation capabilities during much of this period. While it had provided crews for the British aircraft carriers and during the Second World War, and Canadians had served in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, Canada had no carriers of its own until HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot; entered Canadian service in 1946. &quot;Warrior&quot; proved unsuitable for North Atlantic winters, however, and was replaced by HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot; in 1948. By the mid-1950s, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was no longer used as an active aircraft carrier, but was used as a vehicle transport during Canada&#x27;s peacekeeping response to the 1956 Suez Crisis, before being paid off. Her replacement, , was a more modern aircraft carrier which had been substantially rebuilt to accommodate an angled flight deck and other improvements. During this time, the RCN also used stations at HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; and to operate carrier-based fighter and anti-submarine aircraft, including the British Supermarine Seafire and Hawker Sea Fury, and the American F2H Banshee, the RCN&#x27;s only jet fighter. Anti-submarine aircraft included variants of the Fairey Firefly, the Grumman Avenger, and a version of the Grumman Tracker built by de Havilland Canada.

===Unification===

On 1 February 1968, the personnel of the Royal Canadian Navy, along with those of the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Army, were transferred to the new, unified Canadian Forces, established under separate legislation, the National Defence Act. The naval forces were restructured as Canadian Forces Maritime Command (MARCOM), with Fleet Air Arm units being transferred to the Canadian Forces Air Command (AIRCOM).

For many of the serving naval personnel, the transition – giving up the old ensigns, and even more the adoption of army-type ranks and green uniforms instead of the distinctive naval ones – was a very painful process. Researcher Alan Filewood recalls:

&quot;I grew up in a navy family; my father was a regular force officer who had risen from the lower deck, and he was himself the son of a petty officer who had come to Canada as one of the British Royal Navy crews that brought Canada&#x27;s first warships to this country in 1911 and elected to stay to build the RCN. Growing up in a naval family, I was imbued with the traditions of a service that prided itself on its British roots.&quot;

&quot;I recall vividly the day the armed forces paraded in Ottawa to witness the lowering of the old service ensigns and the raising of the new. My mother was a naval vet, a former WREN, and at this transformative moment of national symbolism, she wept; with the lowering of the White Ensign something disappeared from her history. Sometime later my father came home demoralized in his new army-style uniform with an army rank. Like many other naval officers, he retired soon thereafter.&quot;

The controversy included the dismissal of Rear-Admiral William Landymore, senior officer in the Atlantic, who tried to secure commitments that naval traditions would be maintained, but was later fired by Defence Minister Paul Hellyer for his opposition to the changes.

MARCOM was formed on 7 June 1965 as part of the integration reorganization of the services into six functional commands. The Canadian Forces Reorganization Act was given Royal Assent on 1 February 1968 and the Royal Canadian Navy ceased to exist as a separate service. The headquarters for MARCOM was based at CFB Halifax.

Canadian sailors exchanged their RCN uniforms for a rifle-green uniform common to all services (known as &quot;CF green&quot;) and adopted an army-based rank structure. Only cap and collar badges identified &quot;naval&quot; personnel. These policies were somewhat reversed in the 1970s when MARCOM returned to a naval-based rank structure. In 1985 the Canadian Armed Forces introduced its distinctive environmental uniforms (DEUs) for its three environmental commands. The new naval uniform was broadly similar to the former RCN uniform except that officers&#x27; uniforms contained six rather than eight buttons on the front of the tunic and the &quot;square rig&quot; for other ranks was not re-introduced. In addition, the executive curl on officers&#x27; rank insignia was omitted and the rank insignia of other ranks continued to follow the pattern used by the army.

The 1968 unification of the Canadian Armed Forces was the first time a nation with a modernized military had combined sea, land, and air branches into a unified-command structure. The move also saw the fleet air arm of the RCN become the Maritime Air Group. These air units were eventually placed under the Canadian Forces Air Command (AIRCOM) after that command was created in 1975.

In the mid-1990s, MARCOM headquarters were consolidated from Halifax at NDHQ in Ottawa at the same time that AIRCOM headquarters moved from Winnipeg and LFC headquarters moved from Saint-Hubert, Quebec.

===Re-structure===
Following the 1968 unification, MARCOM undertook several changes to its force structure. The sole remaining aircraft carrier, HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot;, was nearing the end of her service life, being a Second World War–era vessel. In the early 1970s, it was decided to pay &quot;Bonaventure&quot; off and not find a replacement, instead focusing on the traditional blue-water navy.

The fleet was enhanced in 1972 with the addition of the four new s, also known as the Tribal class. By the mid-1970s, the navy was looking at a new class of frigate-helicopter (FH) vessels to replace the aging &quot;St. Laurent&quot;, &quot;Restigouche&quot;, &quot;Mackenzie&quot;, and &quot;Annapolis&quot; classes. This design evolved into the Canadian Patrol Frigate (CPF), which was promised by the government in the early 1980s during a period of increased military spending. By the late 1980s, with construction of the first six vessels underway (by now called the s), construction of six further vessels was announced. Nine of the twelve CPF vessels were built at Saint John, New Brunswick, and the remaining three were built at Lauzon, Quebec.

The mid-1980s saw the announcement of the Tribal Update and Modernization Program (TRUMP), which saw the four early-1970s &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers updated into area air-defence destroyers. The update saw these vessels become the first non-US ships to carry the Standard SM-2 anti-aircraft missile.

The 1990s saw the addition of the s which enhanced MARCOM&#x27;s minesweeping and route survey capabilities. Manned by naval reservists, the &quot;Kingston&quot; class is also used for training.

===Fleet rationalization===
In 1977, the Maritime Command recommended structure based on a fleet consisting of 24 destroyers and frigates, three submarines, three support ships, 36 long range patrol aircraft and 45 maritime helicopters. Despite a realistic fleet structure at the time, the Progressive Conservative minority government led by Joe Clark offered an expensive vision. The Conservative party wanted an expensive fleet structure consisting of 16 destroyers and frigates, 20 submarines, 13 minesweeping vessels, 12 fast attack craft, three escort merchant vessels, 36 long range patrol aircraft, 45 maritime helicopters and 84 shore-based attack aircraft. In 1984, DND requested a revision during the &quot;Capabilities Planning Guide&quot;, which included a largely status quo fleet consisting of a 24 destroyers and frigates, four submarines, 12 mine clearance vessels, three support ships, 18 long range patrol aircraft, 18 medium range patrol aircraft and an unspecified number of maritime helicopters. In 1985 the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies recommended a fleet consisting of four nuclear submarines, three helicopter carriers, eight patrol vessels, four polar icebreakers and many helicopters and patrol aircraft.

In 1987, a defence White Paper suggested Canada purchase nuclear-powered submarines (SSN) and specifically the . However the plans for the submarines fell through due to cost. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reorganization of the Russian Navy in 1991, the Maritime Command plan to maintain the capacity to defend the Canadian interest in the region was based on a fleet consisting of four destroyers, 18 frigates, six submarines, three supply ships and 12 minesweeping vessels. The plan was scrapped and re-evaluated in 1993, since the original plan could not be met with the money the government had provided at the time.

===Action post-1968===

On 23 October 1969 at 8:21 AM suffered the worst peacetime accident in the history of the RCN during routine full-power trials when her starboard gearbox reached an estimated temperature of 650 degrees Celsius and exploded. The explosion and the ensuing fire killed 9 crew members and injured at least 53 others.

MARCOM provides vessels for Standing Naval Force Atlantic and for exercises off Norway in support of Canada&#x27;s defence obligations for northern Scandinavia under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), patrols the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans in support of Canadian sovereignty, and is tasked by NATO with anti-submarine patrols for the northwest Atlantic.

In August–September 1990, MARCOM hurriedly modernized and deployed the &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class destroyer escort , the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyer , and the replenishment ship to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield and later Operation Desert Storm, where the Canadian Navy led the coalition maritime support operation. relieved the task force and was the first coalition ship to visit Kuwait City at the end of the war.

During the mid-to-late 1990s, MARCOM provided vessels for a NATO task force patrolling the Adriatic Sea off the former Yugoslavia. As part of Operation Apollo, Canada&#x27;s military contribution to the international campaign against terrorism, 20 MARCOM vessels have been patrolling in the Arabian Sea in recent years.

In 1995, Canada was involved in a minor non-shooting skirmish with a few European countries in a conflict over fishing rights that was nicknamed the Turbot War.

On 4 May 2010, Senators William Rompkey and Hugh Segal announced their intention to introduce a motion into the Senate asking the Canadian Government to rename Maritime Command as the Canadian Navy, in order to recognize the Canadian Naval Centennial. As of May 2010, the executive curl on officers uniforms have been restored.

 and other U.S. Third Fleet ships participated in the International Fleet Review commemorating the 100th birthday of the Royal Canadian Navy in Victoria, British Columbia. The naval review took place 9–12 June 2010, and it involved 21 naval ships and more than 8,000 naval personnel from Canada, France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Joining &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; for the naval review were the cruiser , the destroyer , and the frigate .

On 29 June 2010, the Canadian Navy celebrated its 100th anniversary in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 18 vessels from several countries took part in the celebrations, including and . The warships were reviewed by Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

As part of the Canadian navy&#x27;s centennial celebrations, SONAR, the naval mascot, which is based on a Newfoundland dog, was &quot;recruited&quot; into the navy in 2010.

On 12 May 2011, HMCS &quot;Charlottetown&quot; came under fire by small craft off the coast of Libya. This was the first time that a Canadian naval vessel had been under hostile attack since the Korean War.

===Legacy===
What many think of as the modern Canadian Navy became known as the Canadian Forces Maritime Command (MARCOM) from February 1968 until August 2011. It was one of six functional commands which were formed under the integration reorganization of the Canadian services. The Royal Canadian Navy effectively ceased to exist 1 February 1968, when the Canadian Forces Reorganization Act was given Royal Assent. However, MARCOM, being the operational commander of the naval forces of Canada, was unofficially called the &quot;Canadian Navy&quot; and maintained many of the traditions of its predecessor. As the Canadian Monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian military, commissioned Canadian naval ships, as units of the Canadian Armed Forces, use the prefix HMCS &quot;Her/His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship/Submarine,&quot; a unit designation that began with the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy and continued under the Canadian Forces. On 14 December 2010, the Canadian Senate passed a motion urging the federal government to change the name of Canada&#x27;s naval force from Maritime Command to a title that included the word &quot;navy.&quot; Both &quot;Canadian Navy&quot; and &quot;Royal Canadian Navy&quot; were considered acceptable.

The government announced on 16 August 2011, that Maritime Command was to regain its former name, the Royal Canadian Navy (along with the change of name of Air Command to Royal Canadian Air Force).

On 3 March 1911, the RCN was authorized the use of the White Ensign, which remained the main identifying flag of the navy for the next 54 years. At the same time, the Canadian Blue Ensign was designated the jack of the RCN. However, because naval tradition dictates that the jack is worn at the ship&#x27;s bow only when moored or on &quot;dress ship&quot; occasions, HMC ships normally had no distinctly Canadian flags when under way, the White Ensign being identical to the Royal Navy&#x27;s ensign. Because of this, a tradition developed of painting a green maple leaf on ships&#x27; funnels to mark the ship as Canadian.

When British and Canadian foreign policies began to diverge in the 1950s (highlighted by the two countries&#x27; different roles in the Suez Crisis), having an ensign identical to the Royal Navy&#x27;s became less satisfactory. In 1961, a policy of wearing the Canadian Red Ensign from the masthead (in addition to the Canadian Blue Ensign at the jack staff when appropriate, and the White Ensign at the ensign staff) was established. On 15 February 1965, the White, Blue, and Red ensigns were all replaced by the new National Flag of Canada, the Maple Leaf flag.

==RCN Roundel==

Shortly after the Second World War, Canadian military aircraft began using roundels featuring a red maple leaf. While the RCAF used a &quot;silver maple&quot; style, aircraft of the RCN used a roundel based on the sugar maple. In 1965, both the RCAF and RCN adopted the same roundel with the stylized leaf found in Canada&#x27;s new flag.

Since 1975 there has been no roundel for the RCN as all aircraft used on board ships are operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Leadership==

The Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy is the institutional head of the Royal Canadian Navy. The appointment was entitled Director of the Naval Service from 1910 to 1928 and then Chief of the Naval Staff from 1928 to 1964. In August 1964 the position of Chief of the Naval Staff was formally abolished when amendments to the National Defence Act came into force. Responsibility for naval matters was split between the newly established Defence Staff in Ottawa and operational headquarters in Halifax (for the Atlantic fleet) and Esquimalt (for the Pacific fleet). The appointment was entitled Commander of Maritime Command from 1966 to 1997 and Chief of the Maritime Staff from 1997 to 2011. In 2011 Maritime Command was renamed the Royal Canadian Navy at which time the appointment was renamed to its present incarnation.

== Heritage ==
This history of the Royal Canadian Navy is preserved and presented at the Maritime Command Museum in Halifax, the Canadian War Museum, the Naval Museum of Alberta, The Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt Naval and Military Museum and naval museums on several bases. Several RCN vessels have been preserved including the corvette , which serves as Canada&#x27;s Naval Memorial, as well as the destroyer and the auxiliary patrol ship HMCS/CSS &quot;Acadia&quot; which served the RCN in both the First and Second World Wars.

<text>Field electron emission, also known as field emission (FE) and electron field emission, is emission of electrons induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into a vacuum. However, field emission can take place from solid or liquid surfaces, into a vacuum, a fluid (e.g. air), or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the Zener effect) can also be regarded as a form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, thermionic emission (or Richardson–Dushman effect) and &quot;cold electronic emission&quot;, i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When the term &quot;field emission&quot; is used without qualifiers, it typically means &quot;cold emission&quot;.

Field emission in pure metals occurs in high electric fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly dependent upon the work function. While electron sources based on field emission have a number of applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include the construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution electron microscopes or the discharge of induced charges from spacecraft. Devices that eliminate induced charges are termed charge-neutralizers.

Field emission was explained by quantum tunneling of electrons in the late 1920s. This was one of the triumphs of the nascent quantum mechanics. The theory of field emission from bulk metals was proposed by Ralph H. Fowler and Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim.
A family of approximate equations, Fowler–Nordheim equations, is named after them. Strictly, Fowler–Nordheim equations apply only to field emission from bulk metals and (with suitable modification) to other bulk crystalline solids, but they are often used – as a rough approximation – to describe field emission from other materials.

== Terminology and conventions ==
&quot;Field electron emission&quot;, &quot;field-induced electron emission&quot;, &quot;field emission&quot; and &quot;electron field emission&quot; are general names for this experimental phenomenon and its theory. The first name is used here.

&quot;Fowler–Nordheim tunneling&quot; is the wave-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a rounded triangular barrier created at the surface of an electron conductor by applying a very high electric field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler–Nordheim tunneling from many materials in various different circumstances.

&quot;Cold field electron emission&quot; (CFE) is the name given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler–Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level. (By contrast, in the Schottky emission regime, most electrons escape over the top of a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.

&quot;Fowler–Nordheim-type equations&quot; are a family of approximate equations derived to describe CFE from the internal electron states in bulk metals. The different members of the family represent different degrees of approximation to reality. Approximate equations are necessary because, for physically realistic models of the tunneling barrier, it is in principle mathematically impossible to solve the Schrödinger equation exactly in any simple way. There is no theoretical reason to believe that Fowler–Nordheim-type equations validly describe field emission from materials other than bulk crystalline solids.

For metals, the CFE regime extends to well above room temperature. There are other electron emission regimes (such as &quot;thermal electron emission&quot; and &quot;Schottky emission&quot;) that require significant external heating of the emitter. There are also emission regimes where the internal electrons are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and the emission current is, partly or completely, determined by the supply of electrons to the emitting region. A non-equilibrium emission process of this kind may be called field (electron) emission if most of the electrons escape by tunneling, but strictly it is not CFE, and is not accurately described by a Fowler–Nordheim-type equation.

Care is necessary because in some contexts (e.g. spacecraft engineering), the name &quot;field emission&quot; is applied to the field-induced emission of ions (field ion emission), rather than electrons, and because in some theoretical contexts &quot;field emission&quot; is used as a general name covering both field electron emission and field ion emission.

Historically, the phenomenon of field electron emission has been known by a variety of names, including &quot;the aeona effect&quot;, &quot;autoelectronic emission&quot;, &quot;cold emission&quot;, &quot;cold cathode emission&quot;, &quot;field emission&quot;, &quot;field electron emission&quot; and &quot;electron field emission&quot;.

Equations in this article are written using the International System of Quantities (ISQ). This is the modern (post-1970s) international system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity &quot;ε&quot;0. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern international form. For clarity, this should always be done.

Since work function is normally given with the unit electronvolt (eV), and for fields it is often convenient to use the unit volt per nanometer (V/nm), values of most universal constants are given here in units that involve eV, V and nm. Increasingly, this is normal practice in field emission research. However, all equations here are ISQ-compatible equations and remain dimensionally consistent, as is required by the modern international system. To indicate their status, numerical values of universal constants are given to seven significant figures. Values are derived using the 2006 values of the fundamental constants.

== Early history of field electron emission ==
Field electron emission has a long, complicated and messy history. This section covers the early history, up to the derivation of the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation in 1928.

In retrospect, it seems likely that the electrical discharges reported by J.H. Winkler in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode. However, meaningful investigations had to wait until after J.J. Thomson&#x27;s identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood – from thermal emission and photo-emission work – that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from surface-adsorbed gas molecules), and that – in the absence of applied fields – electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier.

It was suspected at least as early as 1913 that field-induced emission was a separate physical effect. However, only after vacuum and specimen cleaning techniques had significantly improved, did this become well established. Lilienfeld (who was primarily interested in electron sources for medical X-ray applications) published in 1922 the first clear account in English of the experimental phenomenology of the effect he had called &quot;autoelectronic emission&quot;. He had worked on this topic, in Leipzig, since about 1910. Kleint describes this and other early work.

After 1922, experimental interest increased, particularly in the groups led by Millikan at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, and by Gossling at the General Electric Company in London. Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current–voltage (&quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot;) data in different ways, to look for a straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type log(&quot;i&quot;) vs. &quot;V&quot; were not straight. Walter H. Schottky suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of log(&quot;i&quot;) vs. should be straight, but they were not. Nor is Schottky&#x27;s explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE – a point initially overlooked.

A breakthrough came when C.C. Lauritsen
(and J. Robert Oppenheimer independently) found that plots of log(&quot;i&quot;) vs. 1/&quot;V&quot; yielded good straight lines. This result, published by Millikan and Lauritsen in early 1928, was known to Fowler and Nordheim.

Oppenheimer had predicted that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this &quot;i&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced tunneling of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory explained both the Millikan–Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal conduction band, with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics.

Oppenheimer had mathematical details of his theory seriously incorrect. There was also a small numerical error in the final equation given by Fowler–Nordheim theory for CFE current density: this was corrected in the 1929 paper of .

Strictly, if the barrier field in Fowler–Nordheim 1928 theory is exactly proportional to the applied voltage, and if the emission area is independent of voltage, then the Fowler–Nordheim 1928 theory predicts that plots of the form (log(&quot;i&quot;/&quot;V&quot;2) vs. 1/&quot;V&quot;) should be exact straight lines. However, contemporary experimental techniques were not good enough to distinguish between the Fowler–Nordheim theoretical result and the Millikan–Lauritsen experimental result.

Thus, by 1928 basic physical understanding of the origin of CFE from bulk metals had been achieved, and the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation had been derived.

The literature often presents Fowler–Nordheim work as a proof of the existence of electron tunneling, as predicted by wave-mechanics. Whilst this is correct, the validity of wave-mechanics was largely accepted by 1928. The more important role of the Fowler–Nordheim paper was that it was a convincing argument from experiment that Fermi–Dirac statistics applied to the behavior of electrons in metals, as suggested by Sommerfeld in 1927. The success of Fowler–Nordheim theory did much to support the correctness of Sommerfeld&#x27;s ideas, and greatly helped to establish modern electron band theory. In particular, the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation was one of the first to incorporate the statistical-mechanical consequences of the existence of electron spin into the theory of an experimental condensed-matter effect. The Fowler–Nordheim paper also established the physical basis for a unified treatment of field-induced and thermally induced electron emission. Prior to 1928 it had been hypothesized that two types of electrons, &quot;thermions&quot; and &quot;conduction electrons&quot;, existed in metals, and that thermally emitted electron currents were due to the emission of thermions, but that field-emitted currents were due to the emission of conduction electrons. The Fowler–Nordheim 1928 work suggested that thermions did not need to exist as a separate class of internal electrons: electrons could come from a single band occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics, but would be emitted in statistically different ways under different conditions of temperature and applied field.

The ideas of Oppenheimer, Fowler and Nordheim were also an important stimulus to the development, by George Gamow, and Ronald W. Gurney and Edward Condon, later in 1928, of the theory of the radioactive decay of nuclei (by alpha particle tunneling).

== Practical applications: past and present ==

=== Field electron microscopy and related basics ===
As already indicated, the early experimental work on field electron emission (1910–1920) was driven by Lilienfeld&#x27;s desire to develop miniaturized X-ray tubes for medical applications. However, it was too early for this technology to succeed.

After Fowler–Nordheim theoretical work in 1928, a major advance came with the development in 1937 by Erwin W. Mueller of the spherical-geometry field electron microscope (FEM) (also called the &quot;field emission microscope&quot;). In this instrument, the electron emitter is a sharply pointed wire, of apex radius &quot;r&quot;. This is placed, in a vacuum enclosure, opposite an image detector (originally a phosphor screen), at a distance &quot;R&quot; from it. The microscope screen shows a projection image of the distribution of current-density &quot;J&quot; across the emitter apex, with magnification approximately (&quot;R&quot;/&quot;r&quot;), typically 105 to 106. In FEM studies the apex radius is typically 100 nm to 1 μm. The tip of the pointed wire, when referred to as a physical object, has been called a &quot;field emitter&quot;, a &quot;tip&quot;, or (recently) a &quot;Mueller emitter&quot;.

When the emitter surface is clean, this FEM image is characteristic of: (a) the material from which the emitter is made: (b) the orientation of the material relative to the needle/wire axis; and (c) to some extent, the shape of the emitter endform. In the FEM image, dark areas correspond to regions where the local work function &quot;φ&quot; is relatively high and/or the local barrier field &quot;F&quot; is relatively low, so &quot;J&quot; is relatively low; the light areas correspond to regions where &quot;φ&quot; is relatively low and/or &quot;F&quot; is relatively high, so &quot;J&quot; is relatively high. This is as predicted by the exponent of Fowler–Nordheim-type equations [see eq. (30) below].

The adsorption of layers of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, or part of it, can create surface electric dipoles that change the local work function of this part of the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler–Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of surface science. For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on heterogeneous catalysis. FEM has also been used for studies of surface-atom diffusion. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.

A consequence of FEM development, and subsequent experimentation, was that it became possible to identify (from FEM image inspection) when an emitter was &quot;clean&quot;, and hence exhibiting its clean-surface work-function as established by other techniques. This was important in experiments designed to test the validity of the standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation. These experiments deduced a value of voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor &quot;β&quot; from a Fowler–Nordheim plot (see below), assuming the clean-surface &quot;φ&quot;–value for tungsten, and compared this with values derived from electron-microscope observations of emitter shape and electrostatic modeling. Agreement to within about 10% was achieved. Only very recently has it been possible to do the comparison the other way round, by bringing a well-prepared probe so close to a well-prepared surface that approximate parallel-plate geometry can be assumed and the conversion factor can be taken as 1/&quot;W&quot;, where &quot;W&quot; is the measured probe-to emitter separation. Analysis of the resulting Fowler–Nordheim plot yields a work-function value close to the independently known work-function of the emitter.

=== Field electron spectroscopy (electron energy analysis) ===
Energy distribution measurements of field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939. In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young, and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was the distribution of the total energy of the emitted electron (its &quot;total energy distribution&quot;). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that angular momentum about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any kinetic energy that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the emitter surface gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So what gets measured in an energy analyzer is the total energy at emission.

With the development of sensitive electron energy analyzers in the 1960s, it became possible to measure fine details of the total energy distribution. These reflect fine details of the surface physics, and the technique of Field Electron Spectroscopy flourished for a while, before being superseded by newer surface-science techniques.

=== Field electron emitters as electron-gun sources ===

To achieve high-resolution in electron microscopes and other electron beam instruments (such as those used for electron beam lithography), it is helpful to start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an early field emission gun.

From the 1950s onwards, extensive effort has been devoted to the development of field emission sources for use in electron guns. [e.g., DD53] Methods have been developed for generating on-axis beams, either by field-induced emitter build-up, or by selective deposition of a low-work-function adsorbate (usually Zirconium oxide – ZrO) into the flat apex of a (100) oriented Tungsten emitter.

Sources that operate at room temperature have the disadvantage that they rapidly become covered with adsorbate molecules that arrive from the vacuum system walls, and the emitter has to be cleaned from time to time by &quot;flashing&quot; to high temperature. Nowadays, it is more common to use Mueller-emitter-based sources that are operated at elevated temperatures, either in the Schottky emission regime or in the so-called temperature-field intermediate regime. Many modern high-resolution electron microscopes and electron beam instruments use some form of Mueller-emitter-based electron source. Currently, attempts are being made to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electron-gun field emission sources.

The use of field emission sources in electron optical instruments has involved the development of appropriate theories of charged particle optics, and the development of related modeling. Various shape models have been tried for Mueller emitters; the best seems to be the &quot;Sphere on Orthogonal Cone&quot; (SOC) model introduced by Dyke, Trolan. Dolan and Barnes in 1953. Important simulations, involving trajectory tracing using the SOC emitter model, were made by Wiesener and Everhart. Nowadays, the facility to simulate field emission from Mueller emitters is often incorporated into the commercial electron-optics programmes used to design electron beam instruments. The design of efficient modern field-emission electron guns requires highly specialized expertise.

=== Atomically sharp emitters ===
Nowadays it is possible to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and field ion microscope (FIM) images of the emitter. Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the scanning probe microscopy and helium scanning ion microscopy (He SIM). Techniques for preparing them have been under investigation for many years. A related important recent advance has been the development (for use in the He SIM) of an automated technique for restoring a three-atom (&quot;trimer&quot;) apex to its original state, if the trimer breaks up.

=== Large-area field emission sources: vacuum nanoelectronics ===

==== Materials aspects ====
Large-area field emission sources have been of interest since the 1970s. In these devices, a high density of individual field emission sites is created on a substrate (originally silicon). This research area became known, first as &quot;vacuum microelectronics&quot;, now as &quot;vacuum nanoelectronics&quot;.

One of the original two device types, the &quot;Spindt array&quot;, used silicon-integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication techniques to make regular arrays in which molybdenum cones were deposited in small cylindrical voids in an oxide film, with the void covered by a counterelectrode with a central circular aperture. This overall geometry has also been used with carbon nanotubes grown in the void.

The other original device type was the &quot;Latham emitter&quot;. These were MIMIV (metal-insulator-metal-insulator-vacuum) – or, more generally, CDCDV (conductor-dielectric-conductor-dielectric-vacuum) – devices that contained conducting particulates in a dielectric film. The device field-emits because its microstructure/nanostructure has field-enhancing properties. This material had a potential production advantage, in that it could be deposited as an &quot;ink&quot;, so IC fabrication techniques were not needed. However, in practice, uniformly reliable devices proved difficult to fabricate.

Research advanced to look for other materials that could be deposited/grown as thin films with suitable field-enhancing properties. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the &quot;macroscopic&quot; field &quot;F&quot;M between the plates is given by , where &quot;W&quot; is the plate separation and &quot;V&quot; is the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on one plate, then the local field &quot;F&quot; at its apex is greater than &quot;F&quot;M and can be related to &quot;F&quot;M by
: formula_1

The parameter &quot;γ&quot; is called the &quot;field enhancement factor&quot; and is basically determined by the object&#x27;s shape. Since field emission characteristics are determined by the local field &quot;F&quot;, then the higher the &quot;γ&quot;-value of the object, then the lower the value of &quot;F&quot;M at which significant emission occurs. Hence, for a given value of &quot;W&quot;, the lower the applied voltage &quot;V&quot; at which significant emission occurs.

For a roughly ten year-period from the mid-1990s, there was great interest in field emission from plasma-deposited films of amorphous and &quot;diamond-like&quot; carbon. However, interest subsequently lessened, partly due to the arrival of CNT emitters, and partly because evidence emerged that the emission sites might be associated with particulate carbon objects created in an unknown way during the deposition process: this suggested that quality control of an industrial-scale production process might be problematic.

The introduction of CNT field emitters, both in &quot;mat&quot; form and in &quot;grown array&quot; forms, was a significant step forward. Extensive research has been undertaken into both their physical characteristics and possible technological applications. For field emission, an advantage of CNTs is that, due to their shape, with its high aspect ratio, they are &quot;natural field-enhancing objects&quot;.

In recent years there has also been massive growth in interest in the development of other forms of thin-film emitter, both those based on other carbon forms (such as &quot;carbon nanowalls&quot;) and on various forms of wide-band-gap semiconductor. A particular aim is to develop &quot;high-&quot;γ&quot;&quot; nanostructures with a sufficiently high density of individual emission sites. Thin films of nanotubes in form of nanotube webs are also used for development of field emission electrodes. It is shown that by fine-tuning the fabrication parameters, these webs can achieve an optimum density of individual emission sites. Double-layered electrodes made by deposition of two layers of these webs with perpendicular alignment towards each other are shown to be able to lower the turn-on electric field (electric field required for achieving an emission current of 10 μA/cm2) down to 0.3 V/μm and provide a stable field emission performance.

Common problems with all field-emission devices, particularly those that operate in &quot;industrial vacuum conditions&quot; is that the emission performance can be degraded by the adsorption of gas atoms arriving from elsewhere in the system, and the emitter shape can be in principle be modified deleteriously by a variety of unwanted subsidiary processes, such as bombardment by ions created by the impact of emitted electrons onto gas-phase atoms and/or onto the surface of counter-electrodes. Thus, an important industrial requirement is &quot;robustness in poor vacuum conditions&quot;; this needs to be taken into account in research on new emitter materials.

At the time of writing, the most promising forms of large-area field emission source (certainly in terms of achieved average emission current density) seem to be Spindt arrays and the various forms of source based on CNTs.

==== Applications ====
The development of large-area field emission sources was originally driven by the wish to create new, more efficient, forms of electronic information display. These are known as &quot;field-emission displays&quot; or &quot;nano-emissive displays&quot;. Although several prototypes have been demonstrated, the development of such displays into reliable commercial products has been hindered by a variety of industrial production problems not directly related to the source characteristics [En08].

Other proposed applications of large-area field emission sources include microwave generation, space-vehicle neutralization, X-ray generation, and (for array sources) multiple e-beam lithography. There are also recent attempts to develop large-area emitters on flexible substrates, in line with wider trends towards &quot;plastic electronics&quot;.

The development of such applications is the mission of vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good &quot;vacuum robustness&quot; of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.

=== Vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena ===
As already indicated, it is now thought that the earliest manifestations of field electron emission were the electrical discharges it caused. After Fowler–Nordheim work, it was understood that CFE was one of the possible primary underlying causes of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena. (The detailed mechanisms and pathways involved can be very complicated, and there is no single universal cause) Where vacuum breakdown is known to be caused by electron emission from a cathode, then the original thinking was that the mechanism was CFE from small conducting needle-like surface protrusions. Procedures were (and are) used to round and smooth the surfaces of electrodes that might generate unwanted field electron emission currents. However the work of Latham and others showed that emission could also be associated with the presence of semiconducting inclusions in smooth surfaces. The physics of how the emission is generated is still not fully understood, but suspicion exists that so-called &quot;triple-junction effects&quot; may be involved. Further information may be found in Latham&#x27;s book and in the on-line bibliography.

=== Internal electron transfer in electronic devices ===
In some electronic devices, electron transfer from one material to another, or (in the case of sloping bands) from one band to another (&quot;Zener tunneling&quot;), takes place by a field-induced tunneling process that can be regarded as a form of Fowler–Nordheim tunneling. For example, Rhoderick&#x27;s book discusses the theory relevant to metal–semiconductor contacts.

== Fowler–Nordheim tunneling ==

=== Introduction ===
The next part of this article deals with the basic theory of cold field electron emission from bulk metals. This is best treated in four main stages, involving theory associated with: (1) derivation of a formula for &quot;escape probability&quot;, by considering electron tunneling through a rounded triangular barrier; (2) an integration over internal electron states to obtain the &quot;total energy distribution&quot;; (3) a second integration, to obtain the emission current density as a function of local barrier field and local work function; (4) conversion of this to a formula for current as a function of applied voltage. The modified equations needed for large-area emitters, and issues of experimental data analysis, are dealt with separately.

Fowler–Nordheim tunneling is the wave-mechanical tunneling of an electron through an exact or rounded triangular barrier. Two basic situations are recognized: (1) when the electron is initially in a localized state; (2) when the electron is initially not strongly localized, and is best represented by a travelling wave. Emission from a bulk metal conduction band is a situation of the second type, and discussion here relates to this case. It is also assumed that the barrier is one-dimensional (i.e., has no lateral structure), and has no fine-scale structure that causes &quot;scattering&quot; or &quot;resonance&quot; effects. To keep this explanation of Fowler–Nordheim tunneling relatively simple, these assumptions are needed; but the atomic structure of matter is in effect being disregarded.

=== Motive energy ===
For an electron, the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation can be written in the form

\right]\Psi(x) = M(x)\Psi(x), &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where Ψ(&quot;x&quot;) is the electron wave-function, expressed as a function of distance &quot;x&quot; measured from the emitter&#x27;s electrical surface, &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, &quot;m&quot; is the electron mass, &quot;U&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the electron potential energy, &quot;E&quot;n is the total electron energy associated with motion in the &quot;x&quot;-direction, and &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is called the electron motive energy. &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be interpreted as the negative of the electron kinetic energy associated with the motion of a hypothetical classical point electron in the &quot;x&quot;-direction, and is positive in the barrier.

The shape of a tunneling barrier is determined by how &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) varies with position in the region where . Two models have special status in field emission theory: the &quot;exact triangular (ET) barrier&quot; and the &quot;Schottky–Nordheim (SN) barrier&quot;. These are given by equations (2) and (3), respectively:

(x) = h - eFx &lt;/math&gt;|}}
(x) = h - eFx -e^2/(16\pi\varepsilon_0 x), &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Here &quot;h&quot; is the zero-field height (or &quot;unreduced height&quot;) of the barrier, &quot;e&quot; is the elementary positive charge, &quot;F&quot; is the barrier field, and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant. By convention, &quot;F&quot; is taken as positive, even though the classical electrostatic field would be negative. The SN equation uses the classical image potential energy to represent the physical effect &quot;correlation and exchange&quot;.

=== Escape probability ===
For an electron approaching a given barrier from the inside, the &quot;probability of escape&quot; (or &quot;transmission coefficient&quot; or &quot;penetration coefficient&quot;) is a function of &quot;h&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, and is denoted by . The primary aim of tunneling theory is to calculate . For physically realistic barrier models, such as the Schottky–Nordheim barrier, the Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly in any simple way. The following so-called &quot;semi-classical&quot; approach can be used. A parameter can be defined by the JWKB (Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) integral:

where the integral is taken across the barrier (i.e., across the region where &quot;M&quot; &gt; 0), and the parameter &quot;g&quot; is a universal constant given by

^{-1/2}\; {\rm{nm}}^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Forbes has re-arranged a result proved by Fröman and Fröman, to show that, formally – in a one-dimensional treatment – the exact solution for &quot;D&quot; can be written

{1 + P\mathrm{e}^{-G}}, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the &quot;tunneling pre-factor&quot; &quot;P&quot; can in principle be evaluated by complicated iterative integrations along a path in complex space. In the CFE regime we have (by definition) &quot;G&quot; ≫ 1. Also, for simple models &quot;P&quot; ≈ 1. So eq. (6) reduces to the so-called simple JWKB formula:

For the exact triangular barrier, putting eq. (2) into eq. (4) yields , where

{3e\hbar} \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This parameter &quot;b&quot; is a universal constant sometimes called the &quot;second Fowler–Nordheim constant&quot;. For barriers of other shapes, we write

 = \nu(h, F)b h^{3/2}/F, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where is a correction factor that in general has to be determined by numerical integration, using eq. (4).

=== Correction factor for the Schottky–Nordheim barrier ===

The Schottky–Nordheim barrier, which is the barrier model used in deriving the standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation, is a special case. In this case, it is known that the correction factor formula_2 is a function of a single variable &quot;fh&quot;, defined by &quot;fh&quot; = &quot;F&quot;/&quot;Fh&quot;, where &quot;Fh&quot; is the field necessary to reduce the height of a Schottky–Nordheim barrier from &quot;h&quot; to 0. This field is given by

^{-1})(h/{\rm{eV}})^2. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

The parameter &quot;fh&quot; runs from 0 to 1, and may be called the &quot;scaled barrier field&quot;, for a Schottky–Nordheim barrier of zero-field height &quot;h&quot;.

For the Schottky–Nordheim barrier, is given by the particular value &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;fh&quot;) of a function &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;ℓ&quot;). The latter is a function of mathematical physics in its own right and has been called the &quot;principal Schottky–Nordheim barrier function&quot;. An explicit series expansion for &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;ℓ&quot;) is derived in a 2008 paper by J. Deane. The following good simple approximation for &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;fh&quot;) has been found:

===Decay width===
The &quot;decay width&quot; (in energy), &quot;dh&quot;, measures how fast the escape probability &quot;D&quot; decreases as the barrier height &quot;h&quot; increases; &quot;dh&quot; is defined by:

When &quot;h&quot; increases by &quot;dh&quot; then the escape probability &quot;D&quot; decreases by a factor close to e ( ≈ 2.718282). For an elementary model, based on the exact triangular barrier, where we put &quot;ν&quot; = 1 and &quot;P&quot; ≈ 1, we get
: formula_3

The decay width &quot;dh&quot; derived from the more general expression (12) differs from this by a &quot;decay-width correction factor&quot; &quot;λd&quot;, so:

 = \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{h}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Usually, the correction factor can be approximated as unity.

The decay-width &quot;d&quot;F for a barrier with &quot;h&quot; equal to the local work-function &quot;φ&quot; is of special interest. Numerically this is given by:

= \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}} \approx \frac{e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}} \approx 0.09759678 \; \mathrm{eV} \, \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1\ \mathrm{eV}}{\phi}} \cdot \frac{F}{1\ \mathrm{V}\ \mathrm{nm}^{-1}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

For metals, the value of &quot;d&quot;F is typically of order 0.2 eV, but varies with barrier-field &quot;F&quot;.

=== Comments ===
A historical note is necessary. The idea that the Schottky–Nordheim barrier needed a correction factor, as in eq. (9), was introduced by Nordheim in 1928, but his mathematical analysis of the factor was incorrect. A new (correct) function was introduced by Burgess, Kroemer and Houston in 1953, and its mathematics was developed further by Murphy and Good in 1956. This corrected function, sometimes known as a &quot;special field emission elliptic function&quot;, was expressed as a function of a mathematical variable &quot;y&quot; known as the &quot;Nordheim parameter&quot;. Only recently (2006 to 2008) has it been realized that, mathematically, it is much better to use the variable &quot;ℓ&quot; . And only recently has it been possible to complete the definition of &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;ℓ&quot;) by developing and proving the validity of an exact series expansion for this function (by starting from known special-case solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation). Also, approximation (11) has been found only recently. Approximation (11) outperforms, and will presumably eventually displace, all older approximations of equivalent complexity. These recent developments, and their implications, will probably have a significant impact on field emission research in due course.

The following summary brings these results together. For tunneling well below the top of a well-behaved barrier of reasonable height, the escape probability is given formally by:

{F}\right], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where is a correction factor that in general has to be found by numerical integration. For the special case of a Schottky–Nordheim barrier, an analytical result exists and is given by &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;fh&quot;), as discussed above; approximation (11) for &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;fh&quot;) is more than sufficient for all technological purposes. The pre-factor &quot;P&quot; is also in principle a function of &quot;h&quot; and (maybe) &quot;F&quot;, but for the simple physical models discussed here it is usually satisfactory to make the approximation &quot;P&quot; = 1. The exact triangular barrier is a special case where the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly, as was done by Fowler and Nordheim; for this physically unrealistic case, &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;fh&quot;) = 1, and an analytical approximation for &quot;P&quot; exists.

The approach described here was originally developed to describe Fowler–Nordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii down to about 10 to 20 nm. It can be adapted to surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as &quot;ν&quot; and &quot;D&quot; then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.

As noted at the beginning, the effects of the atomic structure of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account is a very difficult problem, and only limited progress has been made. However, it seems probable that the main influences on the theory of Fowler–Nordheim tunneling will (in effect) be to change the values of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;ν&quot; in eq. (15), by amounts that cannot easily be estimated at present.

All these remarks apply in principle to Fowler Nordheim tunneling from any conductor where (before tunneling) the electrons may be treated as in travelling-wave states. The approach may be adapted to apply (approximately) to situations where the electrons are initially in localized states at or very close inside the emitting surface, but this is beyond the scope of this article.

== Total-energy distribution ==
The energy distribution of the emitted electrons is important both for scientific experiments that use the emitted electron energy distribution to probe aspects of the emitter surface physics and for the field emission sources used in electron beam instruments such as electron microscopes. In the latter case, the &quot;width&quot; (in energy) of the distribution influences how finely the beam can be focused.

The theoretical explanation here follows the approach of Forbes. If &quot;ε&quot; denotes the total electron energy relative to the emitter Fermi level, and &quot;K&quot;p denotes the kinetic energy of the electron parallel to the emitter surface, then the electron&#x27;s &quot;normal energy&quot; &quot;ε&quot;n (sometimes called its &quot;forwards energy&quot;) is defined by

Two types of theoretical energy distribution are recognized: the &quot;normal-energy distribution&quot; (NED), which shows how the energy &quot;ε&quot;n is distributed immediately after emission (i.e., immediately outside the tunneling barrier); and the &quot;total-energy distribution&quot;, which shows how the total energy &quot;ε&quot; is distributed. When the emitter Fermi level is used as the reference zero level, both &quot;ε&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;n can be either positive or negative.

Energy analysis experiments have been made on field emitters since the 1930s. However, only in the late 1950s was it realized (by Young and Mueller [,YM58]) that these experiments always measured the total energy distribution, which is now usually denoted by &quot;j&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;). This is also true (or nearly true) when the emission comes from a small field enhancing protrusion on an otherwise flat surface.

To see how the total energy distribution can be calculated within the framework of a Sommerfeld free-electron-type model, look at the &quot;P-T energy-space diagram&quot; (P-T=&quot;parallel-total&quot;).

This shows the &quot;parallel kinetic energy&quot; &quot;K&quot;p on the horizontal axis and the total energy &quot;ε&quot; on the vertical axis. An electron inside the bulk metal usually has values of &quot;K&quot;p and &quot;ε&quot; that lie within the lightly shaded area. It can be shown that each element d&quot;ε&quot;d&quot;K&quot;p of this energy space makes a contribution formula_4 to the electron current density incident on the inside of the emitter boundary. Here, &quot;z&quot;S is the universal constant (called here the &quot;Sommerfeld supply density&quot;):

=4\mathrm{\pi}em / h_{\mathrm{P}}^3 = 1.618311 \times 10^{14} \, \rm{A} \, m^{-2} \, eV^{-2}, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

and formula_5 is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function:

where &quot;T&quot; is thermodynamic temperature and &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant.

This element of incident current density sees a barrier of height &quot;h&quot; given by:

The corresponding escape probability is : this may be expanded (approximately) in the form

 \; \exp(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \exp(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) , &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where &quot;D&quot;F is the escape probability for a barrier of unreduced height equal to the local work-function &quot;φ&quot;. Hence, the element d&quot;ε&quot;d&quot;K&quot;p makes a contribution formula_6 to the emission current density, and the total contribution made by incident electrons with energies in the elementary range d&quot;ε&quot; is thus

 f_{\mathrm{FD}} \left[ \int D \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon =
z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \exp(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the integral is in principle taken along the strip shown in the diagram, but can in practice be extended to ∞ when the decay-width &quot;d&quot;F is very much less than the Fermi energy &quot;K&quot;F (which is always the case for a metal). The outcome of the integration can be written:

 d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \exp(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) = j_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \exp (\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}), &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_7 and formula_8 are values appropriate to a barrier of unreduced height &quot;h&quot; equal to the local work function &quot;φ&quot;, and formula_9 is defined by this equation.

For a given emitter, with a given field applied to it, formula_10 is independent of &quot;F&quot;, so eq. (21) shows that the shape of the distribution (as &quot;ε&quot; increases from a negative value well below the Fermi level) is a rising exponential, multiplied by the FD distribution function. This generates the familiar distribution shape first predicted by Young. At low temperatures, formula_11 goes sharply from 1 to 0 in the vicinity of the Fermi level, and the FWHM of the distribution is given by:

 \ln (2) \approx 0.693 \, d_{\mathrm{F}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

The fact that experimental CFE total energy distributions have this basic shape is a good experimental confirmation that electrons in metals obey Fermi–Dirac statistics.

== Cold field electron emission ==

=== Fowler–Nordheim-type equations ===

==== Introduction ====
Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, in the &quot;J&quot;–&quot;F&quot; form, are (approximate) theoretical equations derived to describe the local current density &quot;J&quot; emitted from the internal electron states in the conduction band of a bulk metal. The &quot;emission current density&quot; (ECD) &quot;J&quot; for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function of the local work-function &quot;φ&quot; and the local barrier field &quot;F&quot; that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, &quot;J&quot; may also depend on the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature.

Owing to the physical assumptions made in the original derivation, the term &quot;Fowler–Nordheim-type equation&quot; has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, it is better to allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime.

==== Zero-temperature form ====
Current density is best measured in A/m2. The total current density emitted from a small uniform region can be obtained by integrating the total energy distribution &quot;j&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;) with respect to total electron energy &quot;ε&quot;. At zero temperature, the Fermi–Dirac distribution function for , and for . So the ECD at 0 K, &quot;J&quot;0, is given from eq. (18) by

 d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \exp(\epsilon /
d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} \epsilon \; = \; z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2 D_{\mathrm{F}} \; = \; Z_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}}, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_12 is the &quot;effective supply for state F&quot;, and is defined by this equation. Strictly, the lower limit of the integral should be −&quot;K&quot;F, where &quot;K&quot;F is the Fermi energy; but if &quot;d&quot;F is very much less than &quot;K&quot;F (which is always the case for a metal) then no significant contribution to the integral comes from energies below &quot;K&quot;F, and it can formally be extended to –∞.

Result (23) can be given a simple and useful physical interpretation by referring to Fig. 1. The electron state at point &quot;F&quot; on the diagram (&quot;state F&quot;) is the &quot;forwards moving state at the Fermi level&quot; (i.e., it describes a Fermi-level electron moving normal to and towards the emitter surface). At 0 K, an electron in this state sees a barrier of unreduced height &quot;φ&quot;, and has an escape probability &quot;D&quot;F that is higher than that for any other occupied electron state. So it is convenient to write &quot;J&quot;0 as &quot;Z&quot;F&quot;D&quot;F, where the &quot;effective supply&quot; &quot;Z&quot;F is the current density that would have to be carried by state F inside the metal if all of the emission came out of state F.

In practice, the current density mainly comes out of a group of states close in energy to state F, most of which lie within the heavily shaded area in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a free-electron model, the contribution to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the Sommerfeld supply density &quot;z&quot;S as the constant of proportionality), it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size &quot;d&quot;F2 (measured in eV2) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily shaded area in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.)

&quot;Z&quot;F can also be written in the form:

 =z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2= {\lambda_d}^2 (z_{\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2}) \phi^{-1} F^2 = {\lambda_d}^2 a \phi^{-1} F^2, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the universal constant &quot;a&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;First Fowler–Nordheim Constant&quot;, is given by

 e^2 g^{-2} = e^3 /8 \pi h_{\mathrm{P}} \approx \; 1.541434 \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{A \; eV} \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-2}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This shows clearly that the pre-exponential factor &quot;aφ&quot;−1&quot;F&quot;2, that appears in Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, relates to the effective supply of electrons to the emitter surface, in a free-electron model.

==== Non-zero temperatures ====
To obtain a result valid for non-zero temperature, we note from eq. (23) that &quot;z&quot;S&quot;d&quot;F&quot;D&quot;F = &quot;J&quot;0/&quot;d&quot;F. So when eq. (21) is integrated at non-zero temperature, then – on making this substitution, and inserting the explicit form of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function – the ECD &quot;J&quot; can be written in the form:

)}{1 + \exp [(\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}})(d_{\mathrm{F}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)]} \mathrm{d}(\epsilon/ d_{\mathrm{F}}) = \lambda_T J_0 ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where &quot;λ&quot;&quot;T&quot; is a temperature correction factor given by the integral. The integral can be transformed, by writing formula_13 and formula_14, and then formula_15, into the standard result:

^x } { 1+ {\mathrm{e}}^{wx} } \mathrm{d}x = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{1+u^w} = \frac{\pi} {w\sin(\pi/w)}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This is valid for (i.e., ). Hence – for temperatures such that :

 T/d_{\mathrm{F}} }{ \sin(\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T / d_{\mathrm{F}})} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{6} \left( {\frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{ d_{\mathrm{F}}}} \right) ^2, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the expansion is valid only if (. An example value (for , , ) is . Normal thinking has been that, in the CFE regime, &quot;λ&quot;&quot;T&quot; is always small in comparison with other uncertainties, and that it is usually unnecessary to explicitly include it in formulae for the current density at room temperature.

The emission regimes for metals are, in practice, defined, by the ranges of barrier field &quot;F&quot; and temperature &quot;T&quot; for which a given family of emission equations is mathematically adequate. When the barrier field &quot;F&quot; is high enough for the CFE regime to be operating for metal emission at 0 K, then the condition provides a formal upper bound (in temperature) to the CFE emission regime. However, it has been argued that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition is a better working limit: this corresponds to a &quot;λ&quot;&quot;T&quot;-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an upper temperature limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K. This limit is a function of barrier field.

Note that result (28) here applies for a barrier of any shape (though &quot;d&quot;F will be different for different barriers).

==== Physically complete Fowler–Nordheim-type equation ====
Result (23) also leads to some understanding of what happens when atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the band-structure is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron wave-functions at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor formula_16, the prefactor &quot;P&quot;, and (to a limited extent) the correction factor &quot;λ&quot;&quot;d&quot;. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter &quot;D&quot;F and (to a limited extent) the parameter &quot;d&quot;F. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point &quot;F&quot; may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor &quot;λ&quot;B into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range .

By defining an overall supply correction factor &quot;λ&quot;&quot;Z&quot; equal to , and combining equations above, we reach the so-called physically complete Fowler–Nordheim-type equation:

 \exp[- \nu_{\mathrm{F}} b \phi^{3/2} / F ], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_17 [= formula_17(&quot;φ&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)] is the exponent correction factor for a barrier of unreduced height &quot;φ&quot;. This is the most general equation of the Fowler–Nordheim type. Other equations in the family are obtained by substituting specific expressions for the three correction factors formula_17, &quot;P&quot;F and &quot;λ&quot;&quot;Z&quot; it contains. The so-called elementary Fowler–Nordheim-type equation, that appears in undergraduate textbook discussions of field emission, is obtained by putting , , &lt;/math&gt; → 1}}; this does not yield good quantitative predictions because it makes the barrier stronger than it is in physical reality. The so-called standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation, originally developed by Murphy and Good, and much used in past literature, is obtained by putting , , &lt;/math&gt; → &quot;v&quot;F}}, where &quot;v&quot;F is &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), where &quot;f&quot; is the value of &quot;f&quot;&quot;h&quot; obtained by putting , and &quot;t&quot;F is a related parameter (of value close to unity).

Within the more complete theory described here, the factor &quot;t&quot;F−2 is a component part of the correction factor &quot;λ&quot;&quot;d&quot;2 [see, and note that &quot;λ&quot;&quot;d&quot;2 is denoted by &quot;λ&quot;&quot;D&quot; there]. There is no significant value in continuing the separate identification of &quot;t&quot;F−2. Probably, in the present state of knowledge, the best approximation for simple Fowler–Nordheim-type equation based modeling of CFE from metals is obtained by putting , , &lt;/math&gt; → &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;)}}. This re-generates the Fowler–Nordheim-type equation used by Dyke and Dolan in 1956, and can be called the &quot;simplified standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation&quot;.

==== Recommended form for simple Fowler–Nordheim-type calculations ====
Explicitly, this recommended &quot;simplified standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation&quot;, and associated formulae, are:

 F^2 \exp[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

^{-2};\;\;\;\;\; b \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

^2 \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-1} \; \mathrm{nm}) (F/ {\phi}^2). &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where &quot;F&quot;&quot;φ&quot; here is the field needed to reduce to zero a Schottky–Nordheim barrier of unreduced height equal to the local work-function &quot;φ&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; is the scaled barrier field for a Schottky–Nordheim barrier of unreduced height &quot;φ&quot;. [This quantity &quot;f&quot; could have been written more exactly as &quot;f&quot;&quot;φ&quot;SN, but it makes this Fowler–Nordheim-type equation look less cluttered if the convention is adopted that simple &quot;f&quot; means the quantity denoted by &quot;f&quot;&quot;φ&quot;SN in, eq. (2.16).] For the example case (, ), and ; practical ranges for these parameters are discussed further in.

Note that the variable &quot;f&quot; (the scaled barrier field) is not the same as the variable &quot;y&quot; (the Nordheim parameter) extensively used in past field emission literature, and that &quot;&quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;)&quot; does NOT have the same mathematical meaning and values as the quantity &quot;&quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)&quot; that appears in field emission literature. In the context of the revised theory described here, formulae for &quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), and tables of values for &quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) should be disregarded, or treated as values of &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;1/2). If more exact values for &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) are required, then provides formulae that give values for &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) to an absolute mathematical accuracy of better than 8×10−10. However, approximation formula (30c) above, which yields values correct to within an absolute mathematical accuracy of better 0.0025, should gives values sufficiently accurate for all technological purposes.

==== Comments ====
A historical note on methods of deriving Fowler–Nordheim-type equations is necessary. There are several possible approaches to deriving these equations, using free-electron theory. The approach used here was introduced by Forbes in 2004 and may be described as &quot;integrating via the total energy distribution, using the parallel kinetic energy &quot;K&quot;p as the first variable of integration&quot;. Basically, it is a free-electron equivalent of the Modinos procedure (in a more advanced quantum-mechanical treatment) of &quot;integrating over the surface Brillouin zone&quot;. By contrast, the free-electron treatments of CFE by Young in 1959, Gadzuk and Plummer in 1973 and Modinos in 1984, also integrate via the total energy distribution, but use the normal energy &quot;ε&quot;n (or a related quantity) as the first variable of integration.

There is also an older approach, based on a seminal paper by Nordheim in 1928, that formulates the problem differently and then uses first &quot;K&quot;p and then &quot;ε&quot;n (or a related quantity) as the variables of integration: this is known as &quot;integrating via the normal-energy distribution&quot;. This approach continues to be used by some authors. Although it has some advantages, particularly when discussing resonance phenomena, it requires integration of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function in the first stage of integration: for non-free-electron-like electronic band-structures this can lead to very complex and error-prone mathematics (as in the work of Stratton on semiconductors). Further, integrating via the normal-energy distribution does not generate experimentally measured electron energy distributions.

In general, the approach used here seems easier to understand, and leads to simpler mathematics.

It is also closer in principle to the more sophisticated approaches used when dealing with real bulk crystalline solids, where the first step is either to integrate contributions to the ECD over constant energy surfaces in a wave-vector space (k-space), or to integrate contributions over the relevant surface Brillouin zone. The Forbes approach is equivalent either to integrating over a spherical surface in k-space, using the variable &quot;K&quot;p to define a ring-like integration element that has cylindrical symmetry about an axis in a direction normal to the emitting surface, or to integrating over an (extended) surface Brillouin zone using circular-ring elements.

=== CFE theoretical equations ===
The preceding section explains how to derive Fowler–Nordheim-type equations. Strictly, these equations apply only to CFE from bulk metals. The ideas in the following sections apply to CFE more generally, but eq. (30) will be used to illustrate them.

For CFE, basic theoretical treatments provide a relationship between the local emission current density &quot;J&quot; and the local barrier field &quot;F&quot;, at a local position on the emitting surface. Experiments measure the emission current &quot;i&quot; from some defined part of the emission surface, as a function of the voltage &quot;V&quot; applied to some counter-electrode. To relate these variables to&quot; J&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, auxiliary equations are used.

The &quot;voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor&quot; &quot;β&quot; is defined by:

The value of &quot;F&quot; varies from position to position on an emitter surface, and the value of &quot;β&quot; varies correspondingly.

For a metal emitter, the &quot;β&quot;−value for a given position will be constant (independent of voltage) under the following conditions: (1) the apparatus is a &quot;diode&quot; arrangement, where the only electrodes present are the emitter and a set of &quot;surroundings&quot;, all parts of which are at the same voltage; (2) no significant field-emitted vacuum space-charge (FEVSC) is present (this will be true except at very high emission current densities, around 109 A/m2 or higher); (3) no significant &quot;patch fields&quot; exist, as a result of non-uniformities in local work-function (this is normally assumed to be true, but may not be in some circumstances). For non-metals, the physical effects called &quot;field penetration&quot; and &quot;band bending&quot; [M084] can make &quot;β&quot; a function of applied voltage, although – surprisingly – there are few studies of this effect.

The emission current density &quot;J&quot; varies from position to position across the emitter surface. The total emission current &quot;i&quot; from a defined part of the emitter is obtained by integrating &quot;J&quot; across this part. To obtain a simple equation for &quot;i&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), the following procedure is used. A reference point &quot;r&quot; is selected within this part of the emitter surface (often the point at which the current density is highest), and the current density at this reference point is denoted by &quot;J&quot;r. A parameter &quot;A&quot;r, called the &quot;notional emission area&quot; (with respect to point &quot;r&quot;), is then defined by:

 J_{\mathrm{r}} = \int J \mathrm{d} A, &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the integral is taken across the part of the emitter of interest.

This parameter &quot;A&quot;r was introduced into CFE theory by Stern, Gossling and Fowler in 1929 (who called it a &quot;weighted mean area&quot;). For practical emitters, the emission current density used in Fowler–Nordheim-type equations is always the current density at some reference point (though this is usually not stated). Long-established convention denotes this reference current density by the simple symbol &quot;J&quot;, and the corresponding local field and conversion factor by the simple symbols &quot;F&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, without the subscript &quot;r&quot; used above; in what follows, this convention is used.

The notional emission area &quot;A&quot;r will often be a function of the reference local field (and hence voltage), and in some circumstances might be a significant function of temperature.

Because &quot;A&quot;r has a mathematical definition, it does not necessarily correspond to the area from which emission is observed to occur from a single-point emitter in a field electron (emission) microscope. With a large-area emitter, which contains many individual emission sites, &quot;A&quot;r will nearly always be very very much less than the &quot;macroscopic&quot; geometrical area (&quot;A&quot;M) of the emitter as observed visually (see below).

Incorporating these auxiliary equations into eq. (30a) yields

 a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \exp[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This is the simplified standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation, in &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; form. The corresponding &quot;physically complete&quot; equation is obtained by multiplying by &quot;λ&quot;&quot;Z&quot;&quot;P&quot;F.

=== Modified equations for large-area emitters ===
The equations in the preceding section apply to all field emitters operating in the CFE regime. However, further developments are useful for large-area emitters that contain many individual emission sites.

For such emitters, the notional emission area will nearly always be very very much less than the apparent &quot;macroscopic&quot; geometrical area (&quot;A&quot;M) of the physical emitter as observed visually. A dimensionless parameter &quot;α&quot;r, &quot;the area efficiency of emission&quot;, can be defined by

 = \; \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} A_{\mathrm{M}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Also, a &quot;macroscopic&quot; (or &quot;mean&quot;) emission current density &quot;J&quot;M (averaged over the geometrical area &quot;A&quot;M of the emitter) can be defined, and related to the reference current density &quot;J&quot;r used above, by

 = \; i/A_{\mathrm{M}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} (i /A_{\mathrm{r}}) = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} J_{\mathrm{r}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This leads to the following &quot;large-area versions&quot; of the simplified standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation:

 = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} a {\phi^{-1}} F^2 \exp[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

 A_{\mathrm{M}} a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \exp[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Both these equations contain the area efficiency of emission &quot;α&quot;r. For any given emitter this parameter has a value that is usually not well known. In general, &quot;α&quot;r varies greatly as between different emitter materials, and as between different specimens of the same material prepared and processed in different ways. Values in the range 10−10 to 10−6 appear to be likely, and values outside this range may be possible.

The presence of &quot;α&quot;r in eq. (36) accounts for the difference between the macroscopic current densities often cited in the literature (typically 10 A/m2 for many forms of large-area emitter other than Spindt arrays) and the local current densities at the actual emission sites, which can vary widely but which are thought to be generally of the order of 109 A/m2, or possibly slightly less.

A significant part of the technological literature on large-area emitters fails to make clear distinctions between local and macroscopic current densities, or between notional emission area &quot;A&quot;r and macroscopic area &quot;A&quot;M, and/or omits the parameter &quot;α&quot;r from cited equations. Care is necessary in order to avoid errors of interpretation.

It is also sometimes convenient to split the conversion factor &quot;β&quot;r into a &quot;macroscopic part&quot; that relates to the overall geometry of the emitter and its surroundings, and a &quot;local part&quot; that relates to the ability of the very-local structure of the emitter surface to enhance the electric field. This is usually done by defining a &quot;macroscopic field&quot; &quot;F&quot;M that is the field that would be present at the emitting site in the absence of the local structure that causes enhancement. This field &quot;F&quot;M is related to the applied voltage by a &quot;voltage-to-macroscopic-field conversion factor&quot; &quot;β&quot;M defined by:

 = \; \beta_{\mathrm{M}} V. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

In the common case of a system comprising two parallel plates, separated by a distance &quot;W&quot;, with emitting nanostructures created on one of them, .

A &quot;field enhancement factor&quot; &quot;γ&quot; is then defined and related to the values of &quot;β&quot;r and &quot;β&quot;M by

 / F_{\mathrm{M}} = \beta_{\mathrm{r}} / \beta_{\mathrm{M}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

With eq. (31), this generates the following formulae:

 = \beta V ;&lt;/math&gt;|}}
 \gamma ;&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where, in accordance with the usual convention, the suffix &quot;r&quot; has now been dropped from parameters relating to the reference point. Formulae exist for the estimation of &quot;γ&quot;, using classical electrostatics, for a variety of emitter shapes, in particular the &quot;hemisphere on a post&quot;.

Equation (40) implies that versions of Fowler–Nordheim-type equations can be written where either &quot;F&quot; or &quot;βV&quot; is everywhere replaced by formula_20. This is often done in technological applications where the primary interest is in the field enhancing properties of the local emitter nanostructure. However, in some past work, failure to make a clear distinction between barrier field &quot;F&quot; and macroscopic field &quot;F&quot;M has caused confusion or error.

More generally, the aims in technological development of large-area field emitters are to enhance the uniformity of emission by increasing the value of the area efficiency of emission &quot;α&quot;r, and to reduce the &quot;onset&quot; voltage at which significant emission occurs, by increasing the value of &quot;β&quot;. Eq. (41) shows that this can be done in two ways: either by trying to develop &quot;high-&quot;γ&quot;&quot; nanostructures, or by changing the overall geometry of the system so that &quot;β&quot;M is increased. Various trade-offs and constraints exist.

In practice, although the definition of macroscopic field used above is the commonest one, other (differently defined) types of macroscopic field and field enhancement factor are used in the literature, particularly in connection with the use of probes to investigate the &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; characteristics of individual emitters.

In technological contexts field-emission data are often plotted using (a particular definition of) &quot;F&quot;M or 1/&quot;F&quot;M as the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate. However, for scientific analysis it usually better not to pre-manipulate the experimental data, but to plot the raw measured &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; data directly. Values of technological parameters such as (the various forms of) &quot;γ&quot; can then be obtained from the fitted parameters of the &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; data plot (see below), using the relevant definitions.

=== Modified equations for nanometrically sharp emitters ===
Most of the theoretical derivations in the field emission theory are done under the assumption that the barrier takes the Schottky–Nordheim form eq. (3). However, this barrier form is not valid for emitters with radii of curvature &quot;R&quot; comparable to the length of the tunnelling barrier. The latter depends on the work function and the field, but in cases of practical interest, the SN barrier approximation can be considered valid for emitters with radii , as explained in the next paragraph.

The main assumption of the SN barrier approximation is that the electrostatic potential term takes the linear form formula_21 in the tunnelling region. The latter has been proved to hold only if formula_22. Therefore, if the tunnelling region has a length formula_23, formula_24 for all formula_25 that determines the tunnelling process; thus if formula_26 eq. (1) holds and the SN barrier approximation is valid. If the tunnelling probability is high enough to produce measurable field emission, L does not exceed 1–2 nm. Hence, the SN barrier is valid for emitters with radii of the order of some tens of nm.

However, modern emitters are much sharper than this, with radii that of the order of a few nm. Therefore, the standard FN equation, or any version of it that assumes the SN barrier, leads to significant errors for such sharp emitters. This has been both shown theoretically and confirmed experimentally.

The above problem was tackled by Kyritsakis and Xanthakis, who generalized the SN barrier by including the electrostatic effects of the emitter curvature. The general barrier form for an emitter with radius of average curvature formula_27 (inverse of the average of the two principal curvatures) can be asymptotically expanded as 

After neglecting all formula_28 terms, and employing the JWKB approximation (4) for this barrier, the Gamow exponent takes a form that generalizes eq. (5) 
{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{h}{eFR} \right) &lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_29 is defined by (30d), formula_30 is given by (30c) and formula_31 is a new function that can be approximated in a similar manner as (30c) (there are typographical mistakes in ref., corrected here): 
Given the expression for the Gamow exponent as a function of the field-free barrier height formula_32, the emitted current density for cold field emission can be obtained from eq. (23). It yields 
{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{\phi}{eFR} \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt; |}}
where the functions formula_33 and formula_34 are defined as

and 

In equation (46), for completeness purposes, &quot;λ&quot;&quot;d&quot; is not approximated by unity as in (29) and (30a), although for most practical cases it is a very good approximation. Apart from this, equations (43), (44) and (46) coincide with the corresponding ones of the standard Fowler–Nordheim theory (3), (9), and (30a), in the limit ; this is expected since the former equations generalise the latter.

Finally, note that the above analysis is asymptotic in the limit , similarly to the standard Fowler–Nordheim theory using the SN barrier. However, the addition of the quadratic terms renders it significantly more accurate for emitters with radii of curvature in the range ~ 5–20 nm. For sharper emitters there is no general approximation for the current density. In order to obtain the current density, one has to calculate the electrostatic potential and evaluate the JWKB integral numerically. For this purpose, scientific computing software has been developed (see e.g. GETELEC).

=== Empirical CFE &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; equation ===
At the present stage of CFE theory development, it is important to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current &quot;i&quot; on voltage &quot;V&quot;.

In the 1920s, empirical equations were used to find the power of &quot;V&quot; that appeared in the exponent of a semi-logarithmic equation assumed to describe experimental CFE results. In 1928, theory and experiment were brought together to show that (except, possibly, for very sharp emitters) this power is &quot;V&quot;−1. It has recently been suggested that CFE experiments should now be carried out to try to find the power (&quot;κ&quot;) of &quot;V&quot; in the pre-exponential of the following empirical CFE equation:

where &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;κ&quot; are treated as constants.

From eq. (42) it is readily shown that

In the 1920s, experimental techniques could not distinguish between the results (assumed by Millikan and Laurtisen) and (predicted by the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation). However, it should now be possible to make reasonably accurate measurements of dlni/d(1/V) (if necessary by using lock-in amplifier/phase-sensitive detection techniques and computer-controlled equipment), and to derive &quot;κ&quot; from the slope of an appropriate data plot.

Following the discovery of approximation (30b), it is now very clear that – even for CFE from bulk metals – the value is not expected. This can be shown as follows. Using eq. (30c) above, a dimensionless parameter &quot;η&quot; may be defined by

For , this parameter has the value . Since and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) is given by eq (30b), the exponent in the simplified standard Fowler–Nordheim-type equation (30) can be written in an alternative form and then expanded as follows:

^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \exp[- \eta /f] \; = \; {\mathrm{e}}^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \exp[-b {\phi}^{3/2} /F ]. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Provided that the conversion factor &quot;β&quot; is independent of voltage, the parameter &quot;f&quot; has the alternative definition , where &quot;V&quot;&quot;φ&quot; is the voltage needed, in a particular experimental system, to reduce the height of a Schottky–Nordheim barrier from &quot;φ&quot; to zero. Thus, it is clear that the factor &quot;v&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) in the &quot;exponent&quot; of the theoretical equation (30) gives rise to additional &quot;V&quot;-dependence in the &quot;pre-exponential&quot; of the empirical equation. Thus, (for effects due to the Schottky–Nordheim barrier, and for an emitter with ) we obtain the prediction:

Since there may also be voltage dependence in other factors in a Fowler–Nordheim-type equation, in particular in the notional emission area &quot;A&quot;r and in the local work-function, it is not necessarily expected that &quot;κ&quot; for CFE from a metal of local work-function 4.5 eV should have the value &quot;κ&quot; = 1.23, but there is certainly no reason to expect that it will have the original Fowler–Nordheim value .

A first experimental test of this proposal has been carried out by Kirk, who used a slightly more complex form of data analysis to find a value 1.36 for his parameter &quot;κ&quot;. His parameter &quot;κ&quot; is very similar to, but not quite the same as, the parameter &quot;κ&quot; used here, but nevertheless his results do appear to confirm the potential usefulness of this form of analysis.

Use of the empirical CFE equation (42), and the measurement of &quot;κ&quot;, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler–Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that one way in which CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler–Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of &quot;F&quot; (or &quot;V&quot;) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of &quot;κ&quot; might provide some experimental indication of this.

== Fowler–Nordheim plots and Millikan–Lauritsen plots ==
The original theoretical equation derived by Fowler and Nordheim has, for the last 80 years, influenced the way that experimental CFE data has been plotted and analyzed. In the very widely used Fowler–Nordheim plot, as introduced by Stern &quot;et al.&quot; in 1929, the quantity ln{&quot;i&quot;/&quot;V&quot;2} is plotted against 1/&quot;V&quot;. The original thinking was that (as predicted by the original or the elementary Fowler–Nordheim-type equation) this would generate an exact straight line of slope &quot;S&quot;FN. &quot;S&quot;FN would be related to the parameters that appear in the exponent of a Fowler–Nordheim-type equation of &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; form by:

 = \; - b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Hence, knowledge of &quot;φ&quot; would allow &quot;β&quot; to be determined, or vice versa.

[In principle, in system geometries where there is local field-enhancing nanostructure present, and the macroscopic conversion factor &quot;β&quot;M can be determined, knowledge of &quot;β&quot; then allows the value of the emitter&#x27;s effective field enhancement factor&quot; γ&quot; to be determined from the formula . In the common case of a film emitter generated on one plate of a two-plate arrangement with plate-separation &quot;W&quot; (so ) then

Nowadays, this is one of the most likely applications of Fowler–Nordheim plots.]

It subsequently became clear that the original thinking above is strictly correct only for the physically unrealistic situation of a flat emitter and an exact triangular barrier. For real emitters and real barriers a &quot;slope correction factor&quot; &quot;σ&quot;FN has to be introduced, yielding the revised formula

 = \; - \sigma_{\mathrm{FN}} b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

The value of &quot;σ&quot;FN will, in principle, be influenced by any parameter in the physically complete Fowler–Nordheim-type equation for &quot;i&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) that has a voltage dependence.

At present, the only parameter that is considered important is the correction factor formula_35 relating to the barrier shape, and the only barrier for which there is any well-established detailed theory is the Schottky–Nordheim barrier. In this case, &quot;σ&quot;FN is given by a mathematical function called &quot;s&quot;. This function &quot;s&quot; was first tabulated correctly (as a function of the Nordheim parameter &quot;y&quot;) by Burgess, Kroemer and Houston in 1953; and a modern treatment that gives &quot;s&quot; as function of the scaled barrier field &quot;f&quot; for a Schottky–Nordheim barrier is given in. However, it has long been clear that, for practical emitter operation, the value of &quot;s&quot; lies in the range 0.9 to 1.

In practice, due to the extra complexity involved in taking the slope correction factor into detailed account, many authors (in effect) put in eq. (49), thereby generating a systematic error in their estimated values of &quot;β&quot; and/or &quot;γ&quot;, thought usually to be around 5%.

However, empirical equation (42) – which in principle is more general than Fowler–Nordheim-type equations – brings with it possible new ways of analyzing field emission &quot;i&quot;–&quot;V&quot; data. In general, it may be assumed that the parameter &quot;B&quot; in the empirical equation is related to the unreduced height &quot;H&quot; of some characteristic barrier seen by tunneling electrons by

(In most cases, but not necessarily all, &quot;H&quot; would be equal to the local work-function; certainly this is true for metals.) The issue is how to determine the value of &quot;B&quot; by experiment. There are two obvious ways. (1) Suppose that eq. (43) can be used to determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of &quot;κ&quot;, from the slope of a plot of form [−dln{&quot;i&quot;}/d(1/&quot;V&quot;) vs. &quot;V&quot;]. In this case, a second plot, of ln(&quot;i&quot;)/&quot;V&quot;&quot;κ&quot; vs. 1/&quot;V&quot;, should be an exact straight line of slope −&quot;B&quot;. This approach should be the most accurate way of determining &quot;B&quot;.

(2) Alternatively, if the value of &quot;κ&quot; is not exactly known, and cannot be accurately measured, but can be estimated or guessed, then a value for&quot; B&quot; can be derived from a plot of the form [ln{&quot;i&quot;} vs. 1/&quot;V&quot;]. This is the form of plot used by Millikan and Lauritsen in 1928. Rearranging eq. (43) gives

Thus, &quot;B&quot; can be determined, to a good degree of approximation, by determining the mean slope of a Millikan–Lauritsen plot over some range of values of 1/&quot;V&quot;, and by applying a correction, using the value of 1/&quot;V&quot; at the midpoint of the range and an assumed value of &quot;κ&quot;.

The main advantages of using a Millikan–Lauritsen plot, and this form of correction procedure, rather than a Fowler–Nordheim plot and a slope correction factor, are seen to be the following. (1) The plotting procedure is marginally more straightforward. (2) The correction involves a physical parameter (&quot;V&quot;) that is a measured quantity, rather than a physical parameter (&quot;f&quot;) that has to be calculated [in order to then calculate a value of &quot;s&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) or, more generally &quot;σ&quot;FN(&quot;f&quot;)]. (3) Both the parameter &quot;κ&quot; itself, and the correction procedure, are more transparent (and more readily understood) than the Fowler–Nordheim-plot equivalents. (4) This procedure takes into account all physical effects that influence the value of &quot;κ&quot;, whereas the Fowler–Nordheim-plot correction procedure (in the form in which it has been carried out for the last 50 years) takes into account only those effects associated with barrier shape – assuming, furthermore, that this shape is that of a Schottky–Nordheim barrier. (5) There is a cleaner separation of theoretical and technological concerns: theoreticians will be interested in establishing what information any measured values of &quot;κ&quot; provide about CFE theory; but experimentalists can simply use measured values of &quot;κ&quot; to make more accurate estimates (if needed) of field enhancement factors.

This correction procedure for Millikan–Lauritsen plots will become easier to apply when a sufficient number of measurements of &quot;κ&quot; have been made, and a better idea is available of what typical values actually are. At present, it seems probable that for most materials &quot;κ&quot; will lie in the range .

== Further theoretical information ==
Developing the approximate theory of CFE from metals above is comparatively easy, for the following reasons. (1) Sommerfeld&#x27;s free-electron theory, with its particular assumptions about the distribution of internal electron states in energy, applies adequately to many metals as a first approximation. (2) Most of the time, metals have no surface states and (in many cases) metal wave-functions have no significant &quot;surface resonances&quot;. (3) Metals have a high density of states at the Fermi level, so the charge that generates/screens external electric fields lies mainly on the outside of the top atomic layer, and no meaningful &quot;field penetration&quot; occurs. (4) Metals have high electrical conductivity: no significant voltage drops occur inside metal emitters: this means that there are no factors obstructing the supply of electrons to the emitting surface, and that the electrons in this region can be both in effective local thermodynamic equilibrium and in effective thermodynamic equilibrium with the electrons in the metal support structure on which the emitter is mounted. (5) Atomic-level effects are disregarded.

The development of &quot;simple&quot; theories of field electron emission, and in particular the development of Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) one or more of the above factors will be untrue. For example, crystalline semiconductors do not have a free-electron-like band-structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and band bending, and may exhibit both internal voltage drops and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk band-structure (this decoupling is known as &quot;the Modinos effect&quot;).

In practice, the theory of the actual Fowler–Nordheim tunneling process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). However, notwithstanding such differences, one expects (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler–Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler–Nordheim or Millikan–Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler–Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.

Note that a straight line in a Fowler–Nordheim or Millikan–Lauritsen plot does &quot;not&quot; indicate that emission from the corresponding material obeys a Fowler–Nordheim-type equation: it indicates only that the emission mechanism for individual electrons is probably Fowler–Nordheim tunneling.

Different materials may have radically different distributions in energy of their internal electron states, so the process of integrating current-density contributions over the internal electron states may give rise to significantly different expressions for the current-density pre-exponentials, for different classes of material. In particular, the power of barrier field appearing in the pre-exponential may be different from the original Fowler–Nordheim value &quot;2&quot;. Investigation of effects of this kind is an active research topic. Atomic-level &quot;resonance&quot; and &quot;scattering&quot; effects, if they occur, will also modify the theory.

Where materials are subject to field penetration and band bending, a necessary preliminary is to have good theories of such effects (for each different class of material) before detailed theories of CFE can be developed. Where voltage-drop effects occur, then the theory of the emission current may, to a greater or lesser extent, become theory that involves internal transport effects, and may become very complex.

<text>Blue Peter is a British children&#x27;s television entertainment programme created by John Hunter Blair. It is the longest-running children&#x27;s TV show in the world, having been broadcast since October 1958. It was broadcast primarily from BBC Television Centre in London until September 2011, when the programme moved to dock10 studios at MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester. It is currently shown live on the CBBC television channel on Fridays at 5 p.m. The show is also repeated on Saturdays on BBC Two, Sundays at 9:00 a.m. and a BSL version is shown on Tuesdays at 2:00 p.m.

Following its original creation, the programme was developed by a BBC team led by Biddy Baxter; she became the programme editor in 1965, relinquishing the role in 1988. Throughout the show&#x27;s history there have been forty-two official presenters; currently, it is hosted by Joel Mawhinney, Abby Cook and Shini Muthukrishnan.

The show uses a nautical title and theme. Its content, which follows a magazine/entertainment format, features viewer and presenter challenges, competitions, celebrity interviews, popular culture, and sections on making arts and crafts items from household items. The show has had a garden in both London and Salford, known as the Blue Peter Garden, which is used during the summer and for outdoor activities. The programme has featured a number of pets including dogs, tortoises, cats and parrots. The longevity of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; has established it as a significant part of British culture and British heritage.

==Content==

&quot;Blue Peter&quot; content is wide-ranging. Most programmes are broadcast live, but usually include at least one filmed report. There will also often be a demonstration of an activity in the studio, or a music or dance performance. Between the 1960s and 2011 the programme was made at BBC Television Centre, and often came from Studio 1, the fourth-largest TV studio in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. This enabled &quot;Blue Peter&quot; to include large-scale demonstrations and performances within the live programme. From the September 2007 series, the programme was broadcast from a small fixed set in Studio 2. However, from 2009 the series began to use the larger studios once more; also more programmes were broadcast in their entirety from the Blue Peter Garden.

The show is also famous for its &quot;makes&quot;, which are demonstrations of how to construct a useful object or prepare food. These have given rise to the oft-used phrase &quot;Here&#x27;s one I made earlier&quot;, as presenters bring out a perfect and completed version of the object they are making – a phrase credited to Christopher Trace, though Marguerite Patten is another possibility. Trace also used the line &quot;And now for something completely different&quot;, which was later taken up by &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Time is also often given over to reading letters and showing pictures sent in by viewers.

Over 5,000 editions have been produced since 1958, and almost every episode from 1964 onwards still exists in the BBC archives. This is unusual for programmes of that era; editor Biddy Baxter personally ensured that telerecordings and, from 1970, video recording were kept of each episode. The earliest surviving footage, a 35mm film sequence, comes from Programme 204 produced and broadcast in 1962. The earliest edition to survive in a complete form is Programme 238 from 1963, which survives as a 16mm film recording.

Many items from &quot;Blue Peter&quot; history have become embedded in British popular culture, especially moments when things have gone wrong, such as the much-repeated clip of Lulu the baby elephant (from a 1969 edition) who urinated and defecated on the studio floor, appeared to tread on the foot of presenter John Noakes and then proceeded to attempt an exit, dragging her keeper along behind her. Although it is often assumed to have been broadcast live, the edition featuring Lulu was one of the rare occasions when the programme was pre-recorded, as the presenters were en route to Ceylon for the summer expedition at the time of transmission.

Other well-remembered and much-repeated items from this era include a Girl Guides&#x27; campfire that got out of hand on the 1970 Christmas edition, John Noakes&#x27;s report on the cleaning of Nelson&#x27;s Column and Simon Groom referring to a previous item on the production of a facsimile door knocker for Durham Cathedral which was displayed alongside the original, with the words &#x27;what a beautiful pair of knockers&#x27;.

==History==
===Early years===
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; was first aired on 16 October 1958. It had been commissioned to producer John Hunter Blair by Owen Reed, the head of children&#x27;s programmes at the BBC, as there were no programmes for children aged between five and eight. Reed got his inspiration after watching &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Club&quot;, the brainchild of former radio producer, Trevor Hill, who created the latter show as a successor to his programme &quot;Out of School&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;; Hill networked the programme from BBC Manchester and launched it aboard the MV &quot;Royal Iris&quot; ferry on the River Mersey, Liverpool with presenter Judith Chalmers welcoming everyone aboard at the bottom of the gangplank.

It was subsequently televised about once a month. Hill relates how Reed came to stay with him and his wife, Margaret Potter, in Cheshire, and was so taken with the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; flag on the side of the ship and the programme in general, that he asked to rename it and take it to London to be broadcast on a weekly basis (see Reed&#x27;s obituary). The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; is used as a maritime signal, indicating that the vessel flying it is about to leave, and Reed chose the name to represent &quot;a voyage of adventure&quot; on which the programme would set out. Hunter Blair also pointed out that blue was a popular colour with children, and Peter was a common name of a typical child&#x27;s friend.

The first two presenters were Christopher Trace, an actor, and Leila Williams, winner of Miss Great Britain in 1957. The two presenters were responsible for activities which matched the traditional gender roles. As broadcasting historian Asa Briggs expressed it in 1995: &quot;Leila played with dolls; Chris played with trains&quot;. They were supported on occasion by Tony Hart, an artist who later designed the ship logo, who told stories about an elephant called Packi (or Packie). It was broadcast every Thursday for fifteen minutes (17:00–17:15) on BBC TV (which later became BBC One). Over the first few months more features were added, including competitions, documentaries, cartoons, and stories. Early programmes were almost entirely studio-based, with very few filmed inserts being made.

===1960–1969===
From Monday 10 October 1960, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was switched to every Monday and extended from 15 minutes to 20 minutes (17.00–17.20). In 1961, Hunter Blair became ill, and was often absent. After he produced his last edition on 12 June 1961, a series of temporary producers took up the post. Hunter Blair was replaced the following September by Clive Parkhurst who did not get along with Leila Williams. &quot;He could not find anything for me to do,&quot; Williams recalled. In October, she did not appear for six editions, and was eventually fired, leaving Christopher Trace on his own or with one-off presenters. Parkhurst was replaced by John Furness, and Anita West joined Trace on 7 May 1962. She featured in just 16 editions, making her the shortest-serving presenter, and was replaced by Valerie Singleton, who presented regularly until 1972, and on special assignments until 1981. Following the departure of Furness, a new producer who was committed to &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was required, so Biddy Baxter was appointed. At the time she was contracted to schools&#x27; programmes on the radio, and therefore unable to take up her new post immediately.

It was suggested that Edward Barnes, a production assistant, would temporarily produce the show until Baxter arrived, at which point he would become her assistant. This suggestion was turned down, and Leonard Chase was appointed, with Barnes as his assistant. Baxter eventually joined &quot;Blue Peter&quot; at the end of October 1962.

During this period, many iconic features of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; were introduced. The first appeal took place in December 1962, replacing the practice of reviewing toys that children would ask for themselves. &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s first pet, a brown and white mongrel dog named Petra, was introduced on 17 December 1962. The puppy soon died of distemper, and having decided against upsetting young viewers over the news, Barnes and Baxter had to search London pet shops for a convincing clandestine replacement. Features such as &quot;makes&quot; (normally involving creating something such as an advent crown, out of household junk) and cooking became regular instalments on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and continue to be used today. The Blue Peter badge was introduced in 1963, along with the programme&#x27;s new logo designed by Tony Hart. Baxter introduced a system that ensured replies sent to viewers&#x27; letters were personal; as a girl, she had written to Enid Blyton and twice received a standard reply, which had upset her.

The next year, from 28 September 1964, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; began to be broadcast twice weekly, with Baxter becoming the editor in 1965, and Barnes and Rosemary Gill (an assistant producer who had joined as a temporary producer while Baxter was doing jury service) becoming the programme&#x27;s producers. The first &quot;Blue Peter&quot; book, an annual in all but name, was published that year, and one was produced nearly every year after that, until 2010. A third presenter, John Noakes, was introduced at the end of 1965 and became the longest-serving presenter. A complete contrast to Trace, Noakes set the scene for &quot;daredevil&quot; presenters that has continued through the generations of presenters. Trace left &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in July 1967, and was replaced by Peter Purves in November. The trio of Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves lasted five years, and according to Richard Marson were &#x27;the most famous presenting team in the show&#x27;s history&#x27;. In 1965, the first Summer Expedition (a filming trip abroad) was held in Norway, and continued every year (except 1986 and 2011) until 2012, all over the world.

===1970–1999===

The first colour edition of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; aired on 14 September 1970, and the last black and white edition on 24 June 1974. A regular feature of the 1970s were the Special Assignments, which were essentially reports on interesting topics, filmed on location. Singleton took this role, and in effect became the programme&#x27;s &quot;roving reporter&quot;. &quot;Blue Peter&quot; also offered breaking news on occasion, such as the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna. In May 1976, presenter Lesley Judd interviewed Otto Frank, father of Anne Frank, after he had agreed to bring his daughter&#x27;s diaries to Britain. From 1971 the summer expedition from the previous year was edited into special programmes broadcast under the title &quot;Blue Peter Flies The World&quot;, televised during the summer break when the team were recording the latest expedition. The first was shown in July 1971 and featured the expedition to Jamaica.

In 1974, the Blue Peter Garden was officially opened in a green space outside the Television Centre restaurant block. By this time, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; had become an established children&#x27;s programme, with regular features which have since become traditions. In 1978, the show celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a nationwide balloon launch from five regional cities during a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace, Leila Williams, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves returned. John Noakes contributed a message pre-recorded on film. At this time, Trace introduced the Blue Peter Outstanding Endeavour Award.

In 1979, its theme music was updated by Mike Oldfield, and at the end of the decade a new presenting team was brought in, consisting of Simon Groom, Tina Heath and Christopher Wenner. They were overshadowed by the success of the previous two decades, and failed to make as much of an impact. Heath decided to leave after a year when she discovered she was pregnant, but agreed to have a live scan of her baby, something which had never been done on television before. &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was praised for this by the National Childbirth Trust who told the BBC that in &#x27;five minutes, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; had done more to educate children about birth than they&#x27;d achieved in ten years of sending out leaflets&#x27;. The production team decided not to renew Wenner&#x27;s contract, resulting in him leaving along with Heath on 23 June 1980.

Sarah Greene and Peter Duncan both joined in 1980, and a new producer, Lewis Bronze, joined in 1982. Janet Ellis joined Sarah Greene and Peter Duncan on 28 April 1983. The 1980s saw the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; studio become more colourful and bright, with the presenters gradually wearing more fashionable outfits, in contrast to the more formal appearance of previous decades. Several videos of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; were made available from 1982, the first being &quot;Blue Peter Makes&quot;, and an omnibus comprising the two weekly editions appeared in 1986 on Sunday mornings. Ahead of the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary in October 1983, BBC1 ran a series &quot;Blue Peter Goes Silver&quot;, revisiting previous summer expeditions. The 25th anniversary itself was commemorated by a documentary presented by Valerie Singleton shown on BBC1 on Sunday 16 October 1983. This was followed the next day by a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace presented the annual Outstanding Endeavour Award and Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Christopher Wenner, Tina Heath and Sarah Greene returned to celebrate the show&#x27;s birthday with the current presenting trio of Simon Groom, Peter Duncan and Janet Ellis who launched a national balloon treasure hunt.

On 27 June 1988, Baxter took part in her final show, after nearly 26 years of involvement, and Bronze took her place as editor. Around this time, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; became distinctively environmentally aware, and introduced a green badge in November 1988 for achievements related to the environment. Shortly before, in October 1988, the show celebrated its thirtieth anniversary with a competition to design the cover of a commemorative issue of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; and Valerie Singleton presented the Outstanding Endeavour Award on the birthday show itself. The following year, the award was presented for the last time.

On 13 September 1984, champion trampolinist and professional performer Michael Sundin presented for the first time, as a replacement for Peter Duncan. He had been talent spotted by the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; team when they filmed an item on the set of &quot;Return to Oz&quot;; Sundin was playing the part of Tik-Tok. After 77 appearances as a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter his contract was not renewed. It has since been explained by Biddy Baxter that he attracted complaints from viewers. She stated in her autobiography that homophobia was not the reason for his departure: &quot;he came across as a whinger... and an effeminate whinger to boot... it was nothing to do with his sexual proclivities&quot;. Sundin successfully continued his performing career but died from an AIDS-related illness in 1989.

In 1989 (and again in 1992 and 1994), new arrangements of the theme tune were introduced. In 1995, BBC1 controller Alan Yentob suggested airing a third edition of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; each week. This meant that it was sometimes pre-recorded; Joe Godwin, the director, suggested that the Friday edition should be a lighter version of the show, which would concentrate on music, celebrities and games. Helen Lederer presented a documentary on BBC2 to celebrate the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary &quot;Here&#x27;s One I Made Earlier&quot;, with a special edition of the regular programme featuring the returns of Leila Williams, John Noakes and Lesley Judd amongst many other presenters. Neither Noakes or Judd had appeared in the studio since leaving the programme and Williams was returning for the first time in 15 years. A fourth presenter, Katy Hill, was introduced in 1995, but unlike earlier decades, there was little stability in the line-up, with resignations and new additions made almost every year of the decade. The 1990s also saw many more live broadcasts on location, with many shot entirely away from the studio. &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was also one of the first television series to launch a website. Oliver Macfarlane replaced Bronze as editor in 1996.

The 40th anniversary of the show was marked in 1998. Apart from two summer proms concerts, the most talked about event to celebrate the milestone was a trip behind LNER Peppercorn Class A2 60532 Blue Peter on an Edinburgh to London railtour. The special train in question was Days Out Limited&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Midlothian&quot; from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh Waverley on Sunday 19 April 1998, with 60532 working the train from Edinburgh. Due to safety rules, none of the presenters were supposed to ride on board the footplate during the trip. Peter Kirk, who was in charge on board the train and who was presenting from the footplate, however, allowed Stuart Miles to travel on board the footplate between Newark-on-Trent and Peterborough. This was the stretch of track which, on 3 July 1938, saw the world speed record for steam locomotives of set by LNER A4 Locomotive no. 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; (a segment in the same episode showed Katy Hill exploring the National Railway Museum and viewing locomotives like Mallard, Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket, Midland Compound no.1000, LMS Black 5 no.5000 and 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot; alongside Stuart Miles helping with the servicing of 60532 in the NRM&#x27;s yard).

In October 1998, Richard Bacon was sacked, following reports in &quot;News of the World&quot; that he had taken cocaine. This incident followed shortly after the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, when previous presenters returned for a special programme. Those returning included Leila Williams, Valerie Singleton, John Noakes, Peter Purves, Diane Louise Jordan, Anthea Turner, John Leslie, Tim Vincent, Yvette Fielding, Caron Keating, Mark Curry, Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan, Sarah Greene, Tina Heath, Simon Groom and Christopher Wenner. Steve Hocking then replaced Macfarlane as editor, at what was regarded as a difficult period for the programme. He introduced a further re-arrangement of the theme tune and a new graphics package in September 1999.

===2000–2010===

The 2000s began with the opening of two previously buried time capsules. Former presenters including Singleton, Purves and Noakes were invited back to assist, and the programme also looked at life in the 1970s when the first capsule was buried. With Hill&#x27;s departure and replacement by Liz Barker in 2000, the new team of herself, Konnie Huq, Simon Thomas, and Matt Baker were consistent for the next few years. The Friday edition, as in the previous decade, featured games, competitions and celebrities, but additionally there was a drama series, &quot;The Quest&quot;, which featured cameos of many former presenters.

It was at this time that the new Head of the BBC Children&#x27;s Department, Nigel Pickard, asked for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; to be broadcast all year round. This was achieved by having two editions per week instead of three during the summer months, and using pre-recorded material. The early 2000s also introduced Christmas productions, in which the presenters took part. In 2003, Richard Marson became the new editor, and his first tasks included changing the output of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on the digital CBBC. The first year of the channel&#x27;s launch consisted of repeated editions, plus spin-off series &quot;Blue Peter Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Blue Peter Flies the World&quot;. This new arrangement involved a complex schedule of live programmes and pre-recorded material, being broadcast on BBC One and CBBC. Marson also introduced a brand new set, graphics and music.

In September 2007, a new editor, Tim Levell, took over. At the same time, budget cuts meant that the programme came from a smaller studio. In February 2008 the BBC One programme was moved from 5pm to 4:35pm to accommodate &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and as a result, &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s ratings initially dropped to as low as 100,000 viewers in the age 6–12 bracket, before steadily improving.

As with the previous decade, numerous presenters joined and left the programme. This included the exits of Thomas, Baker and Barker and the additions of Zöe Salmon, Gethin Jones and Andy Akinwolere. Early 2008 saw the departure of Huq, who had become the longest serving female presenter with over ten years on the show. Later that year, Salmon and Jones both left and the presenting team of Akinwolere with new additions Helen Skelton and Joel Defries was introduced.

On 16 October 2008, Blue Peter celebrated its 50th anniversary with a reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by Queen Elizabeth II and featuring several former presenters. There was a special live edition of the show broadcast to celebrate the anniversary with many returning presenters and a 60-minute documentary on BBC1 featuring interviews with many previous presenters and production staff, including Edward Barnes, Biddy Baxter and Rosemary Gill.

Writing in the BBC&#x27;s in-house magazine, &quot;Ariel&quot;, in 2009, BBC Children&#x27;s Controller Richard Deverell announced plans to re-invent the show to be more like the BBC&#x27;s motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Deverell hopes that by adding &quot;danger and excitement&quot;, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; will achieve the same &quot;playground buzz&quot; among children as &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

===2011–2017===

In January 2011, Barney Harwood was introduced to the programme as replacement for Defries, who had departed in late 2010 after two years. Unusually, Harwood was no stranger to &quot;Blue Peter&quot; viewers, having appeared as a presenter on CBBC for many years, on shows including &quot;Prank Patrol&quot; and &quot;Bear Behaving Badly&quot;.

On 29 March 2011, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; became the first programme in the UK to broadcast an entire show in 360 degrees on the web. Viewers were able to watch the programme via their TVs and simultaneously interact with the television studio in front of and behind the cameras on the website. Viewers were also challenged to play a game where they had to find particular crew members and staff dressed up in distinctive costumes.

The final edition of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; to broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Television Centre in London was broadcast on 28 June 2011, before a move to Dock10 studios, MediaCityUK. The set left behind at BBC Television Centre was subsequently purchased and installed at Sunderland University&#x27;s David Puttnam Media Centre in August 2013.

When the new series started on 26 September 2011, after the usual summer break, Harwood and Skelton revealed the new look &quot;Blue Peter&quot; studio along with the new music and title sequence. Departed presenter Andy Akinwolere was not initially replaced, and for the first time in 50 years only two presenters remained on the programme. The new &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Garden, located outside the studios, was officially opened by Princess Anne in February 2012.

From 12 January 2012, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; has been broadcast all year round (with no break for summer) once a week, its original premiere being on CBBC on Thursdays at 5:45pm, changed to 5:30pm from April 2013 then 5pm from March 2015. It was usually repeated on Fridays on BBC One, although this ceased in December 2012. A repeat airs at 9am on Sundays. At this time, Levell left to work at BBC Radio 5 Live; he was replaced (initially in an acting capacity) as editor by Ewan Vinnicombe, who had worked on the programme as a producer since 2007. The reformatted &quot;Blue Peter&quot; occasionally also included specials and spin-offs such as &quot;Helen&#x27;s Polar Adventure&quot; or the &quot;Stargazing Live&quot; special on other days of the week.

In 2013, Lindsey Russell was voted the 36th presenter via &quot;Blue Peter - You Decide!&quot;, a series of five programmes hosted by Dick and Dom, where ten aspiring presenters were set a number of challenges to prove that they were worthy of the position. Judges Cel Spellman, Eamonn Holmes and Myleene Klass decided the final three, before viewers were given the chance to vote online. Russell joined &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in September of that year, shortly before Skelton&#x27;s departure and the introduction of her replacement Radzi Chinyanganya.

From October 2013, the team consisted of Harwood, Russell and Chinyanganya. The format adapted with slightly different branding and a more classic take on the show, as well as beginning &quot;Blue Peter Bites&quot;, which are five-minute clips showing just one challenge or video from episodes broadcast on CBBC. &quot;Blue Peter&quot; guide pup Iggy joined the team in 2014 and Shelley the Tortoise continues to make occasional appearances. The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Garden is currently maintained by child gardener George who appears throughout the year. The team made more use of the website with more quizzes and videos such as &#x27;Blue Peter VS...&#x27; and &#x27;Ultimate Challenges&#x27; as well as holding a fan club hour after the show where fans could leave comments. A popular game on the programme, &quot;Spot Shelley&quot; was also introduced, where, in most episodes, an animated version of Shelley the tortoise is hiding somewhere or on something and viewers must leave a comment on the website during the show. From April 2017, the show reverted to 5:30 pm. In September 2017, Harwood left the show, again leaving just two presenters.

In the summer, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; often challenges its viewers to earn all of their &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badges (with the exception of orange and gold) through five weeks, where the team look at each individual badge for a week, finishing with the limited time Sports badge which appears every summer with a different design. In the show before these weeks, the team show viewers how to make something to keep their badges in/on and continue the theme through the weeks, these have included the Badge Baton Relay in 2016, where badges stored within a baton tube and 
the Big Badge Boat Bonanza in 2017, where badges displayed on the iconic BP ship, a 2D model that can be made from paper.

Ahead of their Jubilee celebrations, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; introduced its first ever Guest Editor to the show on 19 October 2017 which was children&#x27;s author Dame Jacqueline Wilson. Guest Editors have control for the day and plan what they what to show on their edition, as well as taking control behind the scenes.

===2018–2021===
A special programme broadcast on 1 February 2018, marked &quot;Blue Peter&quot;&#x27;s 5000th edition. A brand new Diamond badge was revealed for the first time, designed by Henry Holland. This was only to be awarded within the special 60th year of 2018.

On 12 October 2017, it was revealed that outside of MediaCityUK, a Hollywood style walk of fame would be created with the names of famous people who have received a Gold &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge. The walkway would lead up to the front of the studios and would help to mark 60 years of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

There were various celebrations across the UK for &quot;The Big Birthday Year&quot;. In January, a competition was launched to design &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s second birthday balloon to be flown. In May, the Millennium Time Capsule formally buried under the Millennium Dome, which was dug up accidentally in 2017 by builders went on tour with various past presenters around the country. A play, &quot;Once Seen On &quot;Blue Peter&quot;&quot;, ran at the Edinburgh Festival fringe in August, with six former presenters appearing in it.

On 16 October 2018, a special one-hour live edition of the programme, entitled &quot;Blue Peter: Big 60th Birthday&quot;, was broadcast on CBBC. Guests included The Vamps, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Ed Sheeran, who was presented with a gold &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge. Many former presenters returned for the show and contributed to the broadcast. Matt Baker contributed a pre-recorded message and Mark Curry was represented by a Lego model as he had to cancel his contribution due to ill health. The programme was repeated on BBC Two on 20 October.

The 60th Birthday celebrations were also marked by other BBC programming, including &quot;The One Show&quot; hosted by Matt Baker and former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; contributor Gabby Logan, which featured Sarah Greene, Mark Curry, Simon Thomas and Konnie Huq; ITV&#x27;s &quot;Lorraine&quot;, where Greene appeared with Leila Williams and Anthea Turner; and &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; which featured Lesley Judd. A documentary entitled &quot;Happy Birthday Blue Peter&quot; was broadcast that evening on BBC Radio 2. It was hosted by Barney Harwood and featured interviews with past and present presenters, as well as members of the production team.

===2021–present===
On 3 June 2021, the show received a refresh with a new logo, title sequence, music and studio. This was the first major refresh since the show&#x27;s move to Salford in 2011. The studio is environmentally-friendly and is composed of upcycled materials from past studios.

On 24 June 2021, Lindsey Russell announced that she would be leaving the show, after eight years. Her final show aired on 15 July 2021.

On 17 June 2022, Adam Beales announced that he would be leaving the show, in July 2022, after 2 years. His final show aired on 15 July 2022. He announced on YouTube that he was gay the next week on 22 July 2022.

On 22 October 2022, former presenter Helen Skelton danced a Charleston with professional partner Gorka Marquez on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; to the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; theme tune as a part of the celebrations of BBC&#x27;s 100th Anniversary.

On 25 October 2022, Joel Mawhinney was announced as the latest presenter. Mawhinney is a magician and content creator who first appeared in 2018 as a guest. He is known for his illusions on social media where he has a large following. He also starred in his own BBC Northern Ireland TV series &quot;Life is Magic&quot; in 2020. Mawhinney is the 41st &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter.

On 3 February 2023, Richie Driss announced that after 4 years he would leave the show, His last show aired on 3 March.

On 6 March 2023 a new presenter (the show&#x27;s 42nd) was announced; Abby Cook. Her first show aired on 10 March. Cook is a wheelchair user who has worked with Forth Valley Disability Sport and as a mental health project administrator for Scottish Disability Sport. She also trains twice a week with Paralympians as part of the Forth Valley Flyers. On 15 January 2024, the BBC announced that Shini Muthukrishnan would become the 43rd presenter and would make her debut later that week.

On 24 January 2024, the BBC announced that the series&#x27; tender rights would be put up for auction as part of the corporation&#x27;s &quot;Competitive Tender&quot; policy, allowing third-parties to bid on producing the programme. On 28 October, it was announced that BBC Studios Kids &amp; Family had retained the rights to produce the programme on a two-year tender.

==Presenters and contributors==

Christopher Trace and Leila Williams were the first presenters of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in October 1958, and since then, there have been 43 subsequent presenters. Joel Mawhinney, who was revealed as the 41st presenter in October 2022, currently presents the programme alongside Abby Cook, who joined as the show&#x27;s 42nd presenter in March 2023.

Other personnel who have played roles on the show include the zoologist George Cansdale, who was the programme&#x27;s first on-screen veterinarian, and Percy Thrower who was the show&#x27;s gardening expert from 21 March 1974 to 23 November 1987 and was presented with a Gold &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge shortly before he died in 1988. He was followed from 1988 until 1991 by Chris Crowder, from 1991 until 2000 by Clare Bradley and from 2004 until 2013 by Chris Collins. From 2014 to present, the gardeners are Lee and Dale Connelly, together with child gardener George Hassal, who makes various appearances throughout the year.

Another contributor, though rarely seen on screen, was Margaret Parnell, who created almost all of the show&#x27;s &quot;makes&quot; from 1963 until her retirement in 2001. Her role was then filled by Gillian Shearing, though Parnell&#x27;s name still appeared in the credits from time to time when a classic &quot;make&quot; was re-used.

Director/producer Alex Leger who joined the show in 1975 as a production assistant and retired in 2011, making him &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s longest serving staff member ever. Presenter Anthea Turner said of Leger: &quot;Alex was the director we feared and loved in the same sentence; he would push you to your limits of endurance and in my case made me face my fear of water by taking me to Crystal Palace to shoot a film about high board diving. Never have my knees knocked so much.&quot; Writing on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in November 2012, Leger admitted the &quot;piles of clippings, strange souvenirs from overseas trips, half-finished &#x27;makes&#x27; from the show and half-dead pot plants disguised the fact something ground-breaking was happening in the cramped &quot;Blue Peter&quot; offices&quot;. Leger published his book, &quot;Blue Peter: Behind the Badge&quot;, on 5 November 2012, in collaboration with many of his former colleagues.

Adam Beales was named as the 40th presenter and joined the team in September 2020, however left on 15 July 2022 after less than two years.

The most recent presenter to depart was Mwaksy; after three years, he left on 29 September 2023.

As of 2021, 5 Blue Peter presenters have died.

Michael Sundin (died 1989)

Christopher Trace (died 1992)

Caron Keating (died 2004)

John Noakes (died 2017)

Christopher Wenner (died 2021)

==Pets==

The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; pets are the animals who regularly appear on the programme. These include dogs, cats, parrots and tortoises. &quot;Blue Peter&quot; pets have included a cat called Socks and another cat called Cookie; and one tortoise called Shelley. Dog Mabel retired on 30 March 2010 after 14 years on the show. Barney, a red setter-dachshund, made his TV debut on Tuesday 22 September 2009, and left four years later at the same time as his owner, presenter Helen Skelton. Lucy, a golden retriever, died aged 13 in late March 2011.

In July 2013, Socks and Cookie made their final appearance in the studio in Salford, as (like Shelley the tortoise) they live in London, but they are still regarded as part of the programme team. Trained Guide Dog Iggy, who joined in 2014, still appears regularly. In 2019, new dog (Beagle-Basset Hound cross) Henry joined the team. They are attended by resident vet Dr Rory Cowlam.

==Blue Peter Garden==
Since the 1970s, presenters have maintained a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Garden. The first garden, which was designed by British horticulturist Percy Thrower in 1974, was at the rear of Television Centre (). Its features included an Italian sunken garden with a pond that contained goldfish, a vegetable patch, greenhouse and viewing platform. The garden was also used to commemorate the show&#x27;s pets and notable events. A bust of the dog Petra was placed in the garden after her death in 1977. The remains of George the Tortoise were interred there in 2004. It had a sculpture of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship, and a plaque honouring Percy Thrower, who died in 1988. The garden was often made available to other programmes for outside broadcasts such as the links between children&#x27;s programmes during the summer months and for &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;″s weather forecasts.

On Monday 21 November 1983, Janet Ellis reported that over the weekend the garden had been vandalised. A rumour circulated in the early 1990s that the vandalism had been carried out by a gang that included the future English international footballers Dennis Wise and Les Ferdinand when they were teenagers. Both men denied any involvement, although Ferdinand did later appear to confess to &quot;helping a few people over the wall.&quot; However, Ferdinand later recanted saying he had been making a joke and was never there.

In September 2011, when the programme&#x27;s production base moved to Dock10 in Salford, parts of the first garden including the sculptures and the sunken pond, were relocated to the piazza outside the new studio (). The 2000 &quot;Blue Peter&quot; time capsule that was buried in London was also brought to the new location. It was due to be opened in 2029 but was accidentally dug up in 2017. &quot;Blue Peter&quot;&#x27;s second garden was officially opened on Thursday 23 February 2012 by The Princess Royal. Like its predecessor, it continues to be used throughout the year for outdoor broadcasts and live events.

In 2022, the BBC&#x27;s centenary year, Blue Peter got a new temporary garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. The new garden was inspired by the theme of &#x27;Discover Soil&#x27;. The garden was designed by Juliet Sargeant, assisted by Richie Driss in design. The garden had soil-themed art, including projects created by the children and people of Salford. Garden visitors could listen to the sounds of a compost heap and in an underground observation chamber, they could watch what happens below ground. The garden was visited by some Blue Peter royalty, such as former presenter Lindsey Russel

After the Chelsea Flower Show, the garden was moved to its permanent home of RHS Garden Bridgewater, which is open to the public.

==Main badges==

Children (and adults) who appear on the show or achieve something notable may be awarded the coveted &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge. The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge allows holders free entry into a number of visitor attractions across the UK. In March 2006, this privilege was temporarily suspended after a number of badges were discovered for sale on the auction site eBay. This suspension was lifted in June 2006, when a new &quot;Blue Peter Badge Card&quot; was introduced to combat the problem, which is issued to each badge winner to prove that they are the rightful owners.

The presenters almost always wear their badge; the only exception being when their apparel is incompatible (for example, a life jacket), in which case a sticker with the ship emblem is normally used instead. In addition, large prints or stickers of the ship are attached to vehicles driven by the presenters during filming assignments.

In addition to the standard &quot;Blue&quot; badge, several variations of the badge exist, for various achievements, including:
* Silver badges, for sending in a different creative contribution to the show when already having a Blue badge.
* Green badges, for contributions with a conservation, nature or environmental theme
* Gold badges, the most rarely awarded, for exceptional achievement, bravery or endeavour
* Orange badges, for competition winners and runners-up (replacing the previous circular &quot;competition winner&#x27;s badge&quot;)
* Fan Club badges, a purple badge awarded for completing a review of the show and providing suggestions for future segments
* 50th anniversary badge, awarded for sending a picture, poem or letter on the subject of the programme&#x27;s 50th birthday
* Factbyte factory badge, awarded to people who completed up to V.I.P. level 7 on the Factbyte factory online game on the official &quot;Blue Peter&quot; website in 2009
* Sport badge, awarded each summer, based on participation in sport or physical activity
* Diamond Badge, awarded to people from February 2018 to February 2019 to celebrate Blue Peter&#x27;s 60th anniversary
* Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Badge, for competition winners and runners-up of the Blue Peter and Doctor Who competition celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the BBC science-fiction program

==Annual events==
The programme also marks annual events, including Chinese New Year, St David&#x27;s Day, Shrove Tuesday, Mothering Sunday, Guy Fawkes Night and Christmas. The latter, in particular, is a special occasion with a traditional format repeated year on year.

===Shrove Tuesday===
Usually shows one of the presenters making a pancake. It is usually the newest presenter who makes the pancake and attempts to toss it perfectly.

===Mothering Sunday===
Usually shows the viewers how to make their own Mother&#x27;s Day card or present.

===Guy Fawkes Night===
Usually tells the history of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot whilst the presenters tell viewers about the firework code and tips for a safe bonfire and fireworks night.

===Christmas===
The traditional Christmas programme usually opens with the signature tune being replaced with a brass band arrangement of the carol &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; juxtaposed with shots of viewers&#x27; home-made Christmas cards and followed by the lighting of the final candle on the Advent Crown. The programme&#x27;s Christmas manger figures are featured, reminding viewers of the Nativity story, a last-minute Christmas make, either a song and dance or filming assignment and the grand finale; the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and children from various schools, assisted by members of the BBC Symphony Chorus, marching &quot;up the hill&quot; and into the studio from the cold outside (lanterns in hand) singing a Christmas carol (alternating years between either &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; or &quot;O! Come All Ye Faithful&quot;) around the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Christmas tree.

In some years there was a Christmas play, either spoofing hit movies like &quot;Grease&quot;, popular songs or a pantomime. Much of the script has been repeated year after year for this special programme. However, for the 2007 Christmas programme, none of these traditions were featured (although the crib had been glimpsed in the previous edition), ending a format repeated annually since the 1960s. Apart from presents for the presenters and pets and a brief look at the programme&#x27;s Nativity crib, the traditional elements remained largely absent in 2008 and 2009. From 2010 the closing carol was reinstated, with the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band being replaced by the Salford band from 2011 onwards, as the programme had moved to MediaCity by then.

In 2014, the full traditional content was revived, including the viewers&#x27; home-made cards accompanied by the Good King Wenceslas arrangement, the Advent Crown (although now using electric candles for safety reasons) and (after an absence in the previous two years) the sparkling ship logo appearing by the shot of the crib in the studio at the end of the closing carol. The Good King Wenceslas sequence was discontinued in 2016, but the Nativity crib, Advent Crown and sparkling ship logo endured, although the last two did not feature in 2020. However, in 2021, the Advent Crown returned.

===Appeals===
An enduring feature of the programme is the annual charity appeal, which asks viewers to collect items that can be recycled or sold to raise money for the chosen cause. For example, in 1973–74, Blue Peter sponsored a &quot;Stampede&quot;, asking people to donate postage stamps in support of Ethiopian famine relief. This is always a charity project in the UK in odd-numbered years, and abroad in even-numbered. The appeal is usually launched in late November and runs through to February or March of the following year.

Until 1979, only waste products were ever collected, such as stamps, linens, coins, scrap metal etc. In 1979, one of the most popular forms of raising appeal money was introduced, encouraging viewers to hold &quot;Blue Peter Bring And Buy Sales&quot; at which buyers are also encouraged to bring their own bric-a-brac or produce to sell. The Great Bring And Buy Sale was used every few years or so as a means of adding variety to the collecting theme during other years.

Between 2001 and 2003 a series of &quot;Bring And Buy Appeals&quot; led many viewers and the media to voice their concern that the traditional method of collecting scrap items to recycle was being abandoned in favour of the &quot;easier revenue&quot; generated by the sales. This led to an on-air explanation by presenter Konnie Huq during the 2003 Get Together Appeal that this particular appeal required the sort of funding that only Bring And Buy Sales could raise.

The 2004 and 2005 appeals saw a return to the collecting theme: the first being to collect old clothes that Oxfam could sell in its stores to raise funds for a family-searching service in third world countries ravaged by war, and the second being the collection of old mobile telephones and coins that could be recycled to raise money for ChildLine. Continuing the return to collecting unwanted items, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; launched its Shoe Biz Appeal campaign in 2006. In partnership with UNICEF, its aim was to collect unwanted pairs of shoes or other footwear in order to raise money for children orphaned by AIDS and HIV in Malawi. The 2007 appeal was the &quot;Disc Drive&quot; – working with Barnardo&#x27;s to sell unwanted CDs and DVDs.

During appeals, the sum of money or objects collected is presented on the &quot;totaliser&quot; – a display that lights to show the amount collected. With some appeals, a second totaliser has often been introduced immediately after the original target has been met, with the aim of providing an incentive to keep on donating.

The 2007 Disc Drive Appeal was handled in a different editorial style, and it was not featured in each programme since its launch as in previous years. Also the &quot;totaliser&quot;, previously a part of the studio set, was relegated to an on-screen animation/graphic.

The 2008 appeal was called &quot;Mission Nutrition&quot;, an attempt to provide children in the UK, Bangladesh and South Africa with better food. As part of this appeal, the Blue Peter presenters held the world&#x27;s biggest bring and buy sale on 18 February 2009, which was attended by several celebrities as well as regular people. Since the 2008 appeal there has been a return to regular features on the Appeal&#x27;s progress in each edition, and the reinstatement of a physical studio set Totaliser.

&quot;Send a Smile Appeal&quot; was held in 2009. Children were encouraged to collect unwanted T-shirts to be donated to Operation Smile, a charity providing free reconstructive surgery to children in the developing world, where they were to be used as surgical gowns for their operations. Appeal contributors were encouraged to customise their gowns in a variety of creative ways, as well as following instructions given on the programme for how to include eyelets and ties to the backs of the gowns. In subsequent years, the traditional Appeal has been dropped in favour of general fundraising and awareness-raising for BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot;.

As part of the 50th year, a BBC estimate was that since the first appeal started &quot;Blue Peter&quot; has raised over £100 million (inflation adjusted figure to 2008 value) by appeals.

In 2018, it was announced that to celebrate &quot;Blue Peter&quot;&#x27;s 60th year, it&#x27;s &#x27;Bring and Buy Sales&#x27; would be returning in aid of BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot;.

===Book awards===
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; promotes the Blue Peter Book Awards, a series of literary prizes for children&#x27;s literature awarded annually, and inaugurated in 2000.

==Time capsules==
One of the most iconic parts of the show is its time capsules. The tradition began in 1971 when the first Blue Peter time capsule was buried, set to be opened in 2000 to demonstrate the next generations of viewers what daily life was like at the time, with viewers selecting what goes in the time capsule. Since then more time capsules have been buried and opened.

===1971–2000===
The first time capsule was buried by Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves in front of the BBC Television Centre on 7 June 1971. It was a steel box lined with lead and fastened with metal screws and two padlocks. It contained objects from the time such as documents describing the capsule&#x27;s contents and the history of the show, an audiotape of the mascot dog Petra and cat Jason along with the show&#x27;s theme tune and greetings from the presenters, a copy of the 1970 &quot;Blue Peter&quot; annual magazine, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badges and booklets, a film reel of the show&#x27;s coverage of an air race from the Isle of Man to Blackpool, a copy of the week&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot;, a set of decimal coins – which were introduced in 1971 – and photographs of the three presenters, the mascots, and the Blue Peter locomotive. The box had to be moved at two points in its long burial – first a few yards away a week later, after viewers sent in letters showing concerns that it would affect the root growth of a nearby tree, and second, when the original site of the capsule was due to be developed in 1984 so the box was unearthed and moved to another site in the Blue Peter garden.

On Friday 7 January 2000, the then-incumbent &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenters joined Singleton, Noakes and Purves, who buried the capsule, to help unearth it. The team used a treasure map and thermal imaging to locate the box and then dug it up and opened it. Water had leaked into the box and partially damaged some items; however, most of the items were in surprisingly good condition. Editor Richard Marson decided that the opening of the capsule should not be broadcast live as it was unclear as to what would be discovered inside or even if the rusted container could even be opened. He was glad he made this decision when it became clear during the recording that the capsule had at some point been opened – probably at the time it was moved and reburied – and that the contents had been wrapped entirely differently from the original burial. By editing the video of the opening, he managed to avoid this becoming obvious to the viewers.

===1981–2022===
A second box made of wood and fastened with two padlocks was entombed in cement on 26 March 1981 by Simon Groom, Sarah Greene, Peter Duncan, and six students at the Samuel Lucas School in Hitchin, at the latter&#x27;s request, within the structure of a multi-storey carpark at BBC Television Centre, with no intended opening date in mind. It marked the 10th anniversary of the 1971 capsule&#x27;s burial and featured &#x27;records of what life was like in the 1980s&#x27;, including projects and drawings from the children on snack foods, dance, playground games, fashion, aircraft, travel, and sport. It also featured records from &quot;Blue Peter&quot; at the time, including photos of the presenters and their &#x27;signature tunes&#x27;, their script for the day, and tapes of the Blue Peter theme tune arranged by Mike Oldfield, as well as clips from the show of the carpark&#x27;s construction.

It had been discovered by builders at BBC Television Centre in 2022 and was opened up on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; in June 2022 by Sarah Greene, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. The contents were severely degraded.

===1984–2000===
A third box, made of wood lined with lead and fastened with one padlock, was buried alongside the original by presenters Simon Groom, Peter Duncan and Janet Ellis on 12 April 1984, when the original was moved to the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; garden on 30 March that year. This box contained a collar for and six hairs from Goldie the Blue Peter Labrador, a vinyl record of the programme&#x27;s theme tune arranged by Mike Oldfield, photographs of the show&#x27;s presenters and mascots, more badges, the cover of the next &quot;Blue Peter&quot; book, and video footage of the moving of Petra&#x27;s statue. The later capsule was dug up by Groom and Ellis in 2000; most of the artifacts were in poor shape, particularly the photographs, because of water seepage.

===1998–2017/2050 (The Millennium Time Capsule)===
The fourth capsule, a metal cylinder without fasteners, was buried by Katy Hill and Richard Bacon in the floor beneath the Millennium Dome on 11 June 1998. As well as &quot;Blue Peter&quot; items including badges, a video tape of a segment on the Oblivion rollercoaster, an official CD-ROM, and a booklet on the history of the programme, the capsule contains a set of 1998 UK coins, a piece of felt from the Dome&#x27;s roof, a set of Teletubby dolls, an insulin pen, a small yellow scarf and blue woggle, a France &#x27;98 football, a roller blade, an asthma inhaler, a Spice Girls compact disc, stamps of Princess Diana, a photo of Tony Blair with the construction crew, a picture of a dove to commemorate the Good Friday Agreement, a toy car, a video tape about a student&#x27;s walk to school, and a copy of &quot;The Roald Dahl Treasury&quot;, all selected in a competition, alongside the selection announcement&#x27;s videotape and 2,000 letters from competition entrants. The time capsule was set to be opened in 2050; however, in 2017, it was accidentally dug up by builders and damaged.

It was then taken to Salford Quays and restored successfully. In 2018, it was announced that, as part of the show&#x27;s 60th birthday, the contents would go on tour with various past presenters meeting it at several locations, after which it would be stored in The National Archives until 2050.

===2000–2029===
Following the unearthing of the 1971 and 1984 time capsules on 7 January 2000, a fifth time capsule, a plastic barrel, was to be buried in the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; garden on 10 January. The capsule contains one of the recent &quot;Blue Peter&quot; books, two video tapes of the show&#x27;s best bits from 1999, two video tapes of the 7 January 2000 unearthing, photographs of the presenters and crew of the show in 2000 as well as a medal celebrating the show&#x27;s 40th birthday in 1998, more badges, and a small plush toy of George the tortoise. Matt Baker contributed a Geordie phrasebook, Simon Thomas an old Motorola Flare, Katy Hill a ring she bought in Mongolia, and Konnie Huq a CD of The Chemical Brothers album &quot;Surrender&quot;. The capsule was relocated to the new garden in 2011 with the programme&#x27;s move to Salford Quays, and is due to be dug up in 2029.

===2018–2038 (The Diamond Time Capsule)===
In 2018, the team announced a new time capsule for their 60th anniversary. Viewers suggested the contents of the time capsule through the website for the first time, and it is also to be stored in The National Archives, the first time it will not be buried. The contents include &quot;a souvenir from the Royal Wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, 2018 set of UK coins and notes, a David Walliams book, fidget spinner, smartphone, World Cup 2018 sticker book and DVD of &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;&quot;. The capsule was stored on the 60th birthday programme by a competition winner, who had won the chance to have her design printed onto the capsule, as well as presenters Radzi Chinyanganya, Lindsey Russell, Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Janet Ellis and Katy Hill.

==Books==
In 1964, the first &quot;Blue Peter&quot; book was published by Lutterworth Press, by arrangement with the BBC. Due to the success of the book, the BBC produced an in house publication the following year. Although an annual in all but name, the books are rarely referred to as such. Each book (published in time for Christmas) features highlights from the previous twelve months of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; features, and chronicles major guests who visit the studio, the Summer expedition, the annual appeal, and the pets. The style of the books&#x27; contents has changed very little over the years, with the only noticeable difference between a 1960s book and the current formula being the increase in colour photography and digital artwork; otherwise, the principle is the same. There was, in 1986 and 1990, and between 1992 and 1997, a break in the publication of the books.

Since Pedigree took over the books in 2004, there has been an increase in quality. The books are now bigger than before, with a greater number of pages. The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; editor and members of the production team write the book, and choose its content, though the book is written from the presenters&#x27; point of view.

A collectors&#x27; market has developed, with &quot;Book One&quot; being especially rare and commanding triple figures on online auction websites. Books from the late 1960s and 1970s are more common, and often turn up for less than a pound in second hand bookshops or charity stores. Books from the 1980s and 1990s tend to be more expensive and rarer, as people realised the value of keeping hold of them.

In the early 1970s, a set of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; mini books were produced, covering specific topics that had been featured in the TV series. A set of these were buried in 1971 in the time capsule for the year 2000. The spin-off series &quot;Blue Peter Special Assignment&quot; also had books.

In 1973, a book about Paddington Bear&#x27;s adventures with Blue Peter was published; it is called Paddington&#x27;s Blue Peter Story Book.

In 2011, it was announced that, due to falling sales, the annuals would be scrapped. However, programme editor Tim Levell indicated that the book could return in the future.

==Broadcast history==
===BBC One (1958–2012)===
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; first aired once a week on Mondays on the BBC Television Service, now BBC One, for a duration of 15 minutes. From 28 September 1964 until 1995 it was shown twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, extending its duration to 25 minutes. A third show was added in 1995, broadcasting on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and from 2000 the show began airing at 5 pm, due to &quot;Newsround&quot; moving to a later slot.

From 2006 the show&#x27;s output began to be reduced, first by dropping the Friday edition, and initially moving the programme schedule to Monday to Wednesday, before moving again to Tuesday to Thursday. In May 2007, it was announced the show would lose a show a week and return to broadcasting twice weekly, leaving Tuesday and Wednesday the only days on which &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was broadcast on BBC One. At the time the BBC claimed that the purpose of returning to two shows a week was to increase the quality of the programme&#x27;s content rather than simply a means of reducing production costs.

The show&#x27;s schedule was changed again in February 2008 when &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was moved to the 4.35 pm slot on BBC One, due to &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; moving from BBC Two to replace &quot;Neighbours&quot; which had transferred to Five. However, this timing change led to a decrease in viewing figures for the weekday afternoon CBBC One slot, with Blue Peter receiving fewer than 100,000 viewers, down from around 335,000 in 2003. The BBC Trust recommended that the BBC produce plans, detailing how they intended to increase viewership, by mid-2009.

In September 2010, the show was moved from Wednesdays and Tuesdays to Mondays and Tuesdays at the same time slot.

On 21 December 2012, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was shown on BBC One for the final time after 54 years and the show moved permanently to CBBC.

===CBBC Channel (2012–)===
From Thursday, 12 January 2012 another episode was dropped, with the show coming full circle by only broadcasting one new episode each week. For the first time in the show&#x27;s history, first run episodes were now broadcast on the CBBC Channel, at 5:45 pm on Thursdays. However, a repeat was still broadcast the following day on BBC One.

Eventually however, in December 2012, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ended its 54-year run on BBC One and now airs only on the CBBC Channel. The move came as regular children&#x27;s programming was removed entirely from BBC One and Two following the completion of the digital switchover. Viewing figures determined that 93% of CBBC&#x27;s target audience was now watching the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming on the dedicated CBBC Channel (including first-run episodes of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;), and few viewers were watching solely on BBC One.

===Repeats and spin-off shows===
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; was first repeated in full on satellite and cable channel UK Gold in the 1990s, one of the first archive channels in the UK. Later it moved to sister channel UK Gold Classics when UK Gold began broadcasting more recent programmes, although that channel lasted only six months before closing.

In September 1998, the BBC launched its first digital only channel BBC Choice. A few months after launch, a new weekend afternoon &quot;CBBC Choice&quot; strand began broadcasting, and as part of this a highlights show &quot;Re:Peter&quot; showcased the best of that week&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; shows. &quot;Re:Peter&quot;, along with a similar highlights show for &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; known as &quot;L&amp;K Replay&quot;, ended when the strand was cancelled in April 2000 and became the daily 6am7pm &quot;CBBC on Choice&quot; programming block which launched in November 1999. However, in 2002, repeats of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; started being shown on CBBC on Choice&#x27;s successor, the newly launched CBBC TV channel, along with spin-off shows &quot;Blue Peter Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Blue Peter Flies the World&quot;. From 2003 a new arrangement involved new material being shown daily, on both BBC One and the CBBC Channel.

In 2017, &quot;Blue Peter Bite&quot;, a five-minute programme which features challenges previously shown on the programme was introduced. However, this has since been renamed &quot;Blue Peter Challenges&quot;, and only includes challenges.

===Summary===

==Signature tune and motif==
The signature tune has always been a hornpipe, originally using variations of &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; by Herbert Ashworth-Hope (not to be confused with the bawdy American drinking song &quot;Barnacle Bill the Sailor&quot;). The original version of the theme was a recording by the New Century Orchestra issued by the FDH Mood Music library. From the 2008 series, the theme became a rendition of the similar &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;. However, from 14 October 2008, the tune has been a blend of both tunes.

===Opening theme===
The following is a list of all the versions of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; signature tune that have been used on the show:

* Sidney Torch &amp; The New Century Orchestra: October 1958 to January 1979
* Mike Oldfield: January 1979 to June 1989 (see &quot;Blue Peter&quot; (Mike Oldfield instrumental))
* Simon Brint: September 1989 to September 1992
* Simon Brint: September 1992 to September 1994
* The Yes/No People: September 1994 to August 1999
* David Arnold and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra: September 1999 to June 2004
* Nial Brown: September 2004 to December 2006
*Dave Cooke: January 2007 to June 2007
*Dave Cooke &amp; The Blue Peter Music Makers: September 2007 to June 2008
*Dobs Vye: September 2008 – June 2011
* Banks &amp; Wag: September 2011 – May 2021
* Sanj Sen: June 2021 – present

The debut of a new version of the theme tune is sometimes accompanied with an introduction by the presenters at the time explaining the reasons behind the new rendition.

In 2006, a new version was arranged and recorded by Murray Gold as part of the Music Makers competition, with prize winners taking part in the final orchestral recording. Viewers were told that this recording would be used when the series returned from its summer break in September 2006; however, for unknown reasons this was not the case, save for excerpts being used as incidental music. Instead, when the September 2006 series began, a slightly shortened version of the 2004 arrangement was used, with &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot; and the opening bars removed. Between January and June 2007, Dave Cooke (who was the husband of ex-presenter Tina Heath) re-arranged the theme tune, although it was confirmed that Murray Gold&#x27;s new arrangement would be used from the new series in September 2007, to coincide with the programme&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. However, the version that ultimately aired bears little resemblance to either the original Murray Gold/Music Makers recording or any previous recording of the theme.

For the start of the September 2008 series, &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; was dropped after nearly fifty years and replaced by an arrangement of the very similar &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;. On 14 October (the same week as the 50th anniversary) the opening tune was reworked to include elements of &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; once again. The closing theme for 2008 was the same as the opening signature tune.

In September 2011, the series returned to using &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; though with the opening bars and drum roll omitted and the traditional closing signature tune not used. On 16 October 2018 (the same week as the 60th anniversary), the opening tune was remixed like the 50th anniversary one, which is composed by David Roocroft.

A new version of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; theme and opening titles was introduced in 2021.

=== Closing theme ===
There is little or no record of the closing music of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in its earliest days, but by the mid-1960s, the show was closing with an edit of Parts Two and Three of &quot;Drums and Fife&quot;, from a 1961 suite of six library cues by Wilfred Burns, performed by The Light Symphonia, conducted by Roberto Capelli (Conroy, BM 301-A). This recording remained in use until January 1979 when it was replaced by an arrangement by Mike Oldfield.

The track continued to be rearranged along with subsequent versions of the opening theme until 1999, when &quot;Drums and Fife&quot; was dropped and the opening theme was instead used to close the show. &quot;Drums and Fife&quot; returned in an arrangement by Nial Brown used from 2004 to 2006, and then by Dave Cooke as of January 2007. From September 2007 to June 2008 the closing theme was slightly extended and rearranged, again by Dave Cooke. From 2008 &quot;Drums and Fife&quot; was dropped again with the closing theme being the same as opening signature tune.

===Motif===
The programme&#x27;s motif is a stylised sailing ship designed by Tony Hart. Hart&#x27;s original design was never successfully used in a totally uniform fashion, with several different reproductions used in studio, on badges, the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; books and on-screen graphics. This was until the show&#x27;s redesign in 1999, when the ship&#x27;s rigging and hull detail was removed, and in 2000, the flags were subtly reshaped. For the 2008 series there has been a return to the original flag design on the ship, although some of the mast detail on the bow and stern has been removed.

===Opening titles===

1958–1989:
The original opening titles showed a Blue Peter flag being lowered on a ship. By the late 1960s, the opening sequence featured extracts of that edition&#x27;s filmed inserts or an event in the studio where speech was absent accompanied by the signature tune and superimposed presenter credits. The presenter&#x27;s names were always listed in &#x27;seniority&#x27; based on the order in which they joined the programme. From 1972 to 1975, any edition that featured Valerie Singleton, whether she was in the studio co-presenting the show, being seen in a filmed insert or even featuring in a repeated film item from the archives, her name was always above the other presenters.

1989–1997:
From 1989, a 2D animation of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship had been developed and used alongside the 1985-introduced word-logo and was used as a method of displaying both the ship and &quot;Blue Peter&quot; name to precede any film or episode footage as before. From 1992 a 3D animation was used and further replaced by another graphical sequence in 1994. Once again, these animations preceded any film, studio or episode footage. Occasionally, from the 1994 series onwards, the 3D animation of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship would be followed by a preview of certain items on the day&#x27;s programme with a &quot;coming up&quot; caption and a presenter commentary. Again, the theme music would either play in full or fade out at an appropriate time.

1997–1999:
From 1997, a more generic title sequence was used with the 1994 ship and title animation remaining, but was followed by clips of different action shots from a variety of the past years&#x27; filming assignments intermixed with specially filmed &quot;posing&quot; footage of the presenters. The traditional format of episode-specific film or studio setting scenes were still used, occasionally on their own, or mixed into the generic footage to varying degrees depending on the day&#x27;s edition. The theme music tended to play out in full, and on days when a totally generic version of the titles were used, the opening was often &quot;followed&quot; by a &quot;coming up&quot; sequence narrated by the presenters.

1999–2004:
By 1999, a new &quot;bubble ship&quot; symbol and titles sequence had been developed to be used alongside the traditional ship emblem. These bubble ships were seen floating around the presenters who were displayed in specially posed shots, and appeared to be floating above a graphical ocean on their own blue coloured ships, and in 2003 when the presenters&#x27; shots were updated, they appeared to be waving, smiling and blowing the bubble ships. This footage was also mixed in with episode-specific film, introductory studio setting or more predominantly from the 2003 series onwards a preview of many items on the day&#x27;s programme with a return to a &quot;coming up&quot; caption and presenter commentary.

2004–2006:
In 2004, a similar approach was adopted with each presenter posing with &quot;ship&#x27;s rigging&quot; in their hands, appearing as though they were hoisting the sails of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship. This sequence, designed by BBC Broadcast (now Red Bee Media) saw a return to the sole use of the original &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship logo and also featured the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; pets in their own poses. Predominantly these titles would precede a &quot;coming up&quot; sequence or occasionally clips of the edition&#x27;s filming assignment. The original version used from 2004 to 2005 opened with the ship logo and featured silhouettes of unidentified children also hoisting sails along with the presenters. This was discarded in 2005 for the last year of the sequence&#x27;s run and opened with the ship and &quot;Blue Peter&quot; name for the first time in six years – allowing more flexibility for when the titles would merge into that day&#x27;s edition without being completed in full, as in the 1950–1990s era – before flowing into the rest of the titles (minus children) as before.

2006–2008:
From September 2006 a new title sequence was introduced, opening with the traditional &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship logo, followed by the presenters surrounded by &quot;fact file boxes&quot; displaying statistics and information about them and also pictures of the pets and snippets of previous assignment films. This also marked the end of the traditional format of the presenter credits being credited in order of seniority (although this is likely to be down to the stylistic dictation of the titles in their &quot;girl boy girl boy&quot; arrangement – the only irregularity being Gethin Jones appearing before Zöe Salmon who debuted on the show five months before him). As in previous years, this new graphical sequence precedes a &quot;coming up&quot; sequence or, alternatively, footage of that edition&#x27;s filming assignment. From September 2007 the posed portion of the same opening titles followed a &quot;coming up&quot; clip of that day&#x27;s programme and used a new theme tune to accompany it.

Following Konnie Huq&#x27;s departure in January 2008, the order of the opening sequence was rejigged slightly, with a filmed aerial pan of a cliff-face taken from a helicopter, featuring a lighthouse and large-scale impression of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship on a grass lawn adjacent to it. The &quot;chopper&quot; sound of the helicopter&#x27;s propellers imitates the traditional drum roll of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; theme tune. The sequence then merges into a summary of what&#x27;s coming up on the programme, with a quick cut at the end to the remaining three presenter poses, now having reverted to appearance order, before ending with the 2006–2008 logo board, minus Konnie Huq&#x27;s silhouette.

2008–2009:
This era of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; titles see a return to the original format without posing presenters. Instead, a fast moving graphical approach is taken where the main colour is light blue. The logo board with the new look word logo appears at the end and graphically &#x27;flows&#x27; away to reveal the day&#x27;s programme. 2008 sees a new word mark for the first time since 1999 and some of the detail has been altered on the ship logo – for example, a return to the original flag design. Small changes have also featured in the studio where the mezzanine wall is now red, the big screen has a new frame and the seating has been re-jigged slightly.

2009–2011:
In the same style to the 2008 titles; however, the presenters&#x27; pictures and first names were now featured in the titles, following the &#x27;coming up&#x27; section.

 2011–2013:
The new Blue Peter titles were created by Mighty Giant. The titles were meant to capture the essence of the show in 20 short seconds. The sequence Mighty Giant created had the presenters playing and throwing an object that changes throughout. As it transforms it captures another element of Blue Peter. These objects include for Helen, the Blue Peter adventure box, Technology screen and a ball. Barney&#x27;s elements of Blue Peter in the titles include a globe, a piece of gaming technology and a keyboard. Mighty Giant shot the presenters against a green screen and then combined them with 3d objects back at its Northern Quarter base to create the desired effect. The logo also had a make over with the ship being put into a blue circle and the original designed ship in white inside the circle. The writing is the same as the 2008 logo.

2013–2015:
In 2013, the sequence had been replaced by a series of clips of previous programme activities.

2015–2021:
In 2015, the sequence had a colourful graphics with rainbow lines, as well as the letters of the logo and the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship logo were floating around in the titles. This sequence was designed by Liquid. It looked similar to the 1999–2004 and 2004–2006 ones.

2021–present:
A new sequence has introduced in 2021, which featured modern-day objects (e.g. a hand writing the message to the series), flying badges, and various clips of the series. Like the previous sequence, it is designed by Liquid.

General notes: The opening titles of every programme featured the list of the presenters in order of their first appearance on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, regardless of whether they actually appear in the edition in question (after 1995 and the introduction of the fourth presenter it was unusual to have all four presenters in the studio at the same time, save for special programmes). The only time this rule was not adopted is when the programme is a special pre-recorded assignment – for example a visit to a foreign country by two of the presenters, in which case the usual practice is just to credit the presenters appearing. Until 2004, the presenters were always credited by their full names. From September 2004, the opening titles only featured their first names, perhaps in a move to make the presenters appear more accessible to the audience. From September 2008, the titles went back to traditional style, not including presenters or their names. This however was changed again in 2009, when pictures of the presenters popped out from nowhere with their name by the side of them.

For the new Technology themed titles for September 2011, the presenters Helen and Barney appeared with specially shot sequences. The names however did not make a return. For the first time the presenters were interacting with different objects in the titles.

===Closing credits===

1958–1992: The &quot;Blue Peter&quot; closing credits were put on screen over the final moments of the programme to the sound of the closing theme tune. Alternatively, once the programme had officially ended (i.e., the presenters had said their &quot;goodbyes&quot;) the camera would focus on shots of the pets or aspects of the studio as a calmer backdrop against which to flash up the credits. The sequence would always end with the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship filling the screen (originally a simple flat image, latterly a more graphically interesting incarnation) and BBC copyright blurb. Before 1989 the &quot;Editor&quot; credit (for almost all this period it was Biddy Baxter) would also flash up over the final moments of the programme, but since Lewis Bronze&#x27;s promotion the editor credit was saved for the final ship frame, starting from 1987 until 1989, the sequence cuts to the frame of the Blue Peter ship that lights up.

1992–2003: Once again during this period the credits maintained the practice of appearing during the final seconds of the programme&#x27;s presentation or once the script had finished. The major difference was that the text scrolled along the bottom third of the screen from right to left, usually overlaid on a graphical bar in the style of the opening titles. The exception to this rule was when the programme was on permanent Outside Broadcast for the whole show. During these occasions the same &quot;theme&quot; of credits would be used – i.e. the same graphics and background etc. but the typeface would almost always change to a completely different font and colour, regardless of the regular typeface used at the time. Also, the credits would flash up on screen one by one, as opposed to scrolling. It is unknown why these anomalies occurred, but it is likely to be related to the reduced technical abilities whilst transmitting a live O.B. The final frame of the credits was always the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship as displayed in the opening titles of the time and the editor&#x27;s credit, along with BBC branding.

2004–2007: This period saw a sequence which showed flashed up credits along the bottom third of the screen, whilst a photo of a recent &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge winner, with or without the project that won them their badge, was shown above. One of the presenters&#x27; voices was also heard introducing the winner and explaining what they did to win their badge. Occasionally on certain programmes, for example the launch of an appeal, special guests in the studio or when out on location, the credits ran as pre-2004 over the closing moments of the programme with the music fading in. Again, the credits end with the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship, editor and BBC credit.

2004, 2007–2008: Early in 2004, the producers experimented with flashing up the credits over a background of &quot;on the next &quot;Blue Peter&quot;&quot; type footage. This was discarded later in 2004 when the new arrangement of signature tune and titles were introduced and a revised format was adopted that remained in use until 2007. September 2007 saw a return to the &quot;coming up next time&quot; sequence of footage, with credits text overlaid on a graphical bar at the bottom section of the screen. The same ship and editor credit is used as the final frame.

2008–present: There are no closing crew credits; instead, the programme ends with a five-second caption of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; logo, the &quot;bbc.co.uk/cbbc&quot; caption border and the CBBC logo (and later, BBC Children&#x27;s Productions Limited.)

General notes: The exceptions to the above were during the Christmas programme, when the credits still scrolled from right to left, often with Christmas-themed drawings separating each crew member. Until 2006, and again from 2010, the Christmas programme ends on a view of the children carol singers in the studio in the background, the Nativity scene in the foreground, studio lights dimmed, a star of Bethlehem glowing on the cyclorama and a sparkling silver &quot;Blue Peter&quot; ship overlaid on the screen (although the sparkling ship did not appear in the Christmas 2012 and 2013 editions).

When a &quot;make&quot; was featured in the programme, the creator of the item (invariably the retired Margaret Parnell or Gillian Shearing) was credited first (until credits were discontinued in 2008). An example of this would be &quot;Dolls House make by Margaret Parnell&quot;.

==Controversy==
===Presenters sacked===
In October 1998, Richard Bacon became the first presenter to have his contract terminated mid-run, after he admitted to taking cocaine and punching a wall, following reports in a tabloid newspaper. Lorraine Heggessey, then the Head of BBC Children&#x27;s programmes, apologised on air.

However, before Bacon, four previous presenters had left the programme when their contracts were not renewed, each for different reasons: these were Leila Williams in 1962, Christopher Wenner in 1980, Michael Sundin in 1985 and Romana D&#x27;Annunzio in 1998.

===Fake phone competition winner===
It was revealed by the BBC that a phone-in competition supporting the UNICEF &quot;Shoe Biz Appeal&quot;, held on 27 November 2006, was rigged. The person who appeared to be calling in the competition was actually a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Team Player who was visiting that day. The visitor pretended to be a caller from an outside line who had won the phone-in and the chance to select a prize. The competition was rigged due to a technical error when receiving the calls.

Former editor Biddy Baxter, described as still being influential with the programme today, explained the problem as an issue with a member of the production team on the studio floor and the Editor being oblivious to the situation in the studio gallery. She also went on to say that the programme would not feature premium rate telephone competitions in the future.

It was announced on 16 May 2007 that &quot;Blue Peter&quot; editor and unofficial historian, Richard Marson, had stood down from his job, although any link to the controversy of March 2007 remains in doubt.

In July 2007, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was given a £50,000 fine by the Office of Communications (OFCOM) as a result of rigging the competition.

===Political partiality===

On 24 November 1988, Frank Ruse, a left-wing Labour councillor for Liverpool City Council, accompanied Liverpool&#x27;s Pagoda Chinese Youth Orchestra to London for an appearance on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. He was given a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge and wore it proudly to his council meetings. However, he received a BBC headed letter requesting the return of the badge. The letter (which was later discovered to be a forgery) stated that &quot;Blue Peter&quot; had been approached by the office of Neil Kinnock (Labour leader at the time) who were alarmed that a councillor with hard-left views had been given a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge. On receiving the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge from Frank Ruse, the BBC wrote back to him stating that they had sent no such letter (thereby proving it was a hoax) and an angry Ruse started a local and national enquiry to find out who sent the hoax letter.

In August 2007 while the programme was off air for its annual Summer Expedition, long-time presenter Konnie Huq was involved in a press conference to promote the health benefits of cycling along with Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. The Conservative Party accused the BBC of political bias as a result of one of its employees appearing at what was construed as a pro-Labour Party event. The BBC claimed to have turned down the offer for Huq to appear, but this was unknown to both her and her agent.

===&quot;Socks&quot;===
In September 2007, an online vote on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; official website took place to choose the name of the eighth &quot;Blue Peter&quot; kitten in January: the reported story was that, instead of calling the cat &quot;Cookie&quot; as chosen by a majority of the votes, the staff overruled the vote and called the kitten &quot;Socks&quot;, citing problems with the voting system and a large surge in the former name. As a result of negative media coverage, the original cat, Socks, was joined by another kitten named Cookie, as had been chosen in the online vote. The BBC broadcast an apology on 25 September 2007 at the start of the new series.

==Tributes, honours and awards==

In 1992, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Children&#x27;s Programme (Factual): Lewis Bronze.

Asteroid 16197 Bluepeter is named in its honour. The asteroid was discovered on 7 January 2000, the day that the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; time capsules from 1971 and 1984 were unearthed.

In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was placed 6th.

In 2008, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was nominated for the BAFTA Children&#x27;s Kids Vote Award.

<text>A flat-panel display (FPD) is an electronic display used to display visual content such as text or images. It is present in consumer, medical, transportation, and industrial equipment.

Flat-panel displays are thin, lightweight, provide better linearity and are capable of higher resolution than typical consumer-grade TVs from earlier eras. They are usually less than thick. While the highest resolution for consumer-grade CRT televisions was 1080i, many interactive flat panels in the 2020s are capable of 1080p and 4K resolution.

In the 2010s, portable consumer electronics such as laptops, mobile phones, and portable cameras have used flat-panel displays since they consume less power and are lightweight. As of 2016, flat-panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.

Most 2010s-era flat-panel displays use LCD or light-emitting diode (LED) technologies, sometimes combined. Most LCD screens are back-lit with color filters used to display colors. In many cases, flat-panel displays are combined with touch screen technology, which allows the user to interact with the display in a natural manner. For example, modern smartphone displays often use OLED panels, with capacitive touch screens.

Flat-panel displays can be divided into two display device categories: volatile and static. The former requires that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state (e.g. liquid-crystal displays (LCD)), and can only show an image when it has power. On the other hand, static flat-panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable, such as displays that make use of e-ink technology, and as such retain content even when power is removed.

==History==
The first engineering proposal for a flat-panel TV was by General Electric in 1954 as a result of its work on radar monitors. The publication of their findings gave all the basics of future flat-panel TVs and monitors. But GE did not continue with the R&amp;D required and never built a working flat panel at that time. The first production flat-panel display was the Aiken tube, developed in the early 1950s and produced in limited numbers in 1958. This saw some use in military systems as a heads up display and as an oscilloscope monitor, but conventional technologies overtook its development. Attempts to commercialize the system for home television use ran into continued problems and the system was never released commercially.

Dennis Gabor, better known as the inventor of holography, patented a flat-screen CRT in 1958. This was substantially similar to Aiken&#x27;s concept, and led to a years-long patent battle. By the time the lawsuits were complete, with Aiken&#x27;s patent applying in the US and Gabor&#x27;s in the UK, the commercial aspects had long lapsed, and the two became friends. Around this time,Clive Sinclair came across Gabor&#x27;s work and began an ultimately unsuccessful decade-long effort to commercialize it.

The Philco Predicta featured a relatively flat (for its day) cathode-ray tube setup and would be the first commercially released &quot;flat panel&quot; upon its launch in 1958; the Predicta was a commercial failure. The plasma display panel was invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois, according to The History of Plasma Display Panels.

===Liquid-crystal displays (LC displays, or LCDs)===
The MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and presented in 1960. Building on their work, Paul K. Weimer at RCA developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962. It was a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET. The idea of a TFT-based LCD was conceived by Bernard J. Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. B.J. Lechner, F.J. Marlowe, E.O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with a dynamic scattering LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs.

The first active-matrix addressed electroluminescent display (ELD) was made using TFTs by T. Peter Brody&#x27;s Thin-Film Devices department at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968. In 1973, Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories demonstrated the first thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AM LCD) using TFTs in 1974.

By 1982, pocket LCD TVs based on LCD technology were developed in Japan. The 2.1-inch Epson ET-10 &quot;Epson Elf&quot; was the first color LCD pocket TV, released in 1984. In 1988, a Sharp research team led by engineer T. Nagayasu demonstrated a 14-inch full-color LCD, which convinced the electronics industry that LCD would eventually replace CRTs as the standard television display technology. , all modern high-resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices use TFT-based active-matrix displays.

===LED displays===
The first usable LED display was developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and introduced in 1968. It was the result of research and development (R&amp;D) on practical LED technology between 1962 and 1968, by a research team under Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Mohamed M. Atalla, at HP Associates and HP Labs. In February 1969, they introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator. It was the first alphanumeric LED display, and was a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the Nixie tube for numeric displays and becoming the basis for later LED displays. In 1977, James P Mitchell prototyped and later demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat-panel LED television display.

Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak built the first practical organic LED (OLED) device in 1987. In 2003, Hynix produced an organic EL driver capable of lighting in 4,096 colors. In 2004, the Sony Qualia 005 was the first LED-backlit LCD. The Sony XEL-1, released in 2007, was the first OLED television.

==Common types==

===Liquid-crystal display (LCD)===

Field-effect LCDs are lightweight, compact, portable, cheap, more reliable, and easier on the eyes than CRT screens. LCD screens use a thin layer of liquid crystal, a liquid that exhibits crystalline properties. It is sandwiched between two glass plates carrying transparent electrodes. Two polarizing films are placed at each side of the LCD. By generating a controlled electric field between electrodes, various segments or pixels of the liquid crystal can be activated, causing changes in their polarizing properties. These polarizing properties depend on the alignment of the liquid-crystal layer and the specific field-effect used, being either Twisted Nematic (TN), In-Plane Switching (IPS) or Vertical Alignment (VA). Color is produced by applying appropriate color filters (red, green and blue) to the individual subpixels. LC displays are used in various electronics like watches, calculators, mobile phones, TVs, computer monitors and laptops screens etc.

===LED-LCD===
Most earlier large LCD screens were back-lit using a number of CCFL (cold-cathode fluorescent lamps). However, small pocket size devices almost always used LEDs as their illumination source. With the improvement of LEDs, almost all new displays are now equipped with LED backlight technology. The image is still generated by the LCD layer.

===Plasma panel===
A plasma display consists of two glass plates separated by a thin gap filled with a gas such as neon. Each of these plates has several parallel electrodes running across it. The electrodes on the two plates are at right angles to each other. A voltage applied between the two electrodes one on each plate causes a small segment of gas at the two electrodes to glow. The glow of gas segments is maintained by a lower voltage that is continuously applied to all electrodes. By 2010, consumer plasma displays had been discontinued by numerous manufacturers.

===Electroluminescent panel===
In an electroluminescent display (ELD), the image is created by applying electrical signals to the plates which make the phosphor glow.

===Organic light-emitting diode===
An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs.

===Quantum-dot light-emitting diode===
QLED or quantum dot LED is a flat panel display technology introduced by Samsung under this trademark. Other television set manufacturers such as Sony have used the same technology to enhance the backlighting of LCD TVs already in 2013. Quantum dots create their own unique light when illuminated by a light source of shorter wavelength such as blue LEDs. This type of LED TV enhances the colour gamut of LCD panels, where the image is still generated by the LCD. In the view of Samsung, quantum dot displays for large-screen TVs are expected to become more popular than the OLED displays in the coming years; Firms like Nanoco and Nanosys compete to provide the QD materials. In the meantime, Samsung Galaxy devices such as smartphones are still equipped with OLED displays manufactured by Samsung as well. Samsung explains on their website that the QLED TV they produce can determine what part of the display needs more or less contrast. Samsung also announced a partnership with Microsoft that will promote the new Samsung QLED TV.

==Volatile==

Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically refreshed to retain their state, even for a static image. As such, a volatile screen needs electrical power, either from mains electricity (being plugged into a wall socket) or a battery to maintain an image on the display or change the image. This refresh typically occurs many times a second. If this is not done, for example, if there is a power outage, the pixels will gradually lose their coherent state, and the image will &quot;fade&quot; from the screen.

===Examples===
The following flat-display technologies have been commercialized in 1990s to 2010s:
* Plasma display panel (PDP)
* Active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD)
* Rear projection: Digital Light Processing (DLP), LCD, LCOS
* Electronic paper: E Ink, Gyricon
* Light-emitting diode display (LED)
* Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED)
* Quantum dot display (QLED)

Technologies that were extensively researched, but their commercialization was limited or has been ultimately abandoned:
* Active-matrix electroluminescent display (ELD)
* Interferometric modulator display (IMOD)
* Field-emission display (FED)
* Surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED, SED-TV)

==Static==

Static flat-panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable. This means that the image they hold requires no energy to maintain, but instead requires energy to change. This results in a much more energy-efficient display, but with a tendency toward slow refresh rates which are undesirable in an interactive display. Bistable flat-panel displays are beginning deployment in limited applications (cholesteric liquid-crystal displays, manufactured by Magink, in outdoor advertising; electrophoretic displays in e-book reader devices from Sony and iRex; anlabels; interferometric modulator displays in a smartwatch).

<text>Stefan Wul was the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of the French science fiction writer Pierre Pairault (27 March 1922 – 26 November 2003), born in Paris.

==Biography==
He was a dental surgeon, but science fiction was his real passion. Most of his books reflect that, showing a deep knowledge of scientific data. Pairault retired from dental surgery in 1989, but remained active in the French science fiction scene.

He published eleven novels between 1956 and 1959 and a twelfth in 1977. One of them, &quot;Le Temple du Passé&quot; (1957), was translated into English, as &quot;The Temple of the Past&quot; in 1973. His fame outside of French-speaking countries is due to the animated adaptations of two of his novels by the animator and film director René Laloux. &quot;Oms en série&quot;, which Laloux filmed in 1973, was translated into English in 2010 and published under the title &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;.

<doc id="293401" wikidata="Q1371288" url="?curid=293401" title="Vassal state">
<text>A vassal state is any state that has a mutual obligation to a superior state or empire, in a status similar to that of a vassal in the feudal system in medieval Europe. Vassal states were common among the empires of the Near East, dating back to the era of the Egyptian, Hittite, and Mitanni conflict, as well as in ancient China. 

The relationships between vassal rulers and empires were dependent on the policies and agreements of each empire. While the payment of tribute and military service was common amongst vassal states, the degree of independence and benefits given to vassal states varied. Today, more common terms are puppet state, protectorate, client state, associated state, or satellite state.

==Historical examples==
===Ancient Egypt===

The reign of Thutmose III (1479 BC – 1425 BC) laid the foundations for the systems that functioned during the Amarna period of Egypt. Vassal states in the Levant became fully integrated in Egypt&#x27;s economy with the construction of harbours – allowing for greater communication and collection of tax between Egypt and its vassal states during this period.

Much of what is known about Egypt&#x27;s vassal states from the reigns of Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun (1390 BC – 1323 BC) stems from the Amarna letters – a collection of 350 cuneiform tablets. The different ways vassal rulers communicated with the Pharaoh via grovelling and obsequiousness is a key method of extrapolating relationships between Egypt and vassal states.

Egypt&#x27;s key vassal states were located on the northern frontier, and included states such as Nuhašše, Qatna, and Ugarit. These were located on the fringes of the territory claimed by Egypt and were a potential threat from acting with the Hittites in Anatolia, or the Mitanni in Iraq and Syria. Due to these vassal states’ distance from the Nile, and their value as a buffer zone from rival kingdoms, these states appeared to have a more high-status relationship with the Pharaoh and Egypt. These states could also solicit the Pharaoh for various requests. The fulfilment of these asks by Egypt may have served the purpose of ensuring the loyalty of these distant vassal states. However, these vassal states were claimed by the Hittite Empire following the death of Akhenaten (1353 BC – 1336 BC) and were never reclaimed.

Under Ramesses II (1279 BC – 1213 BC), Egypt engaged in several military campaigns against the Hittites, eventually capturing the kingdoms of Kadesh and Amurru by taking advantage of growing problems in the Hittite Empire. In 1258 BC, Ramesses and the Hittite King Ḫattušili III signed a peace treaty that created a border from north of Byblos to Damascus between the two empires.

====Byblos====
The Kingdom of Byblos was significant in linking the worlds of Egypt, the Near East and the Aegean to one another. It is first attested during the reign of Thutmose III. Through Byblos, the Egyptians had access to products from Lebanon and Syria, while also using the kingdom as a base for military activity. Byblos held religious importance to Egypt, as the local goddess appeared in the form of Hathor, and was associated with Isis. Byblos was also valuable for Egypt as a trade partner, as it allowed the latter to interact with the regional trade connections between Byblos and other small cities. Byblos seemed to have a large amount of influence itself. Rib-Hadda&#x27;s letters indicate that Byblos had control over its own territory, until it was taken in conflict with Amurru.

Correspondence with the Kingdom of Byblos is well documented, as the longest interaction between Egypt and a vassal state and spanned a period of 12 years. The subject king in these letters – Rib-Hadda – is unique among vassal rulers as his letters are more verbose than other small rulers in the Near East. Despite his loyalty to the Pharaoh, Rib-Hadda never received any meaningful reply from Egypt during times of need and was eventually exiled from his own kingdom by his brother.

While Rib-Hadda&#x27;s brother was on the throne, Byblos continued to communicate with the Egyptians, although there is some contention over potential alliances between Byblos and Amurru and the Hittite Empire as well.

Interactions between Byblos and Egypt declined in the 12th and 11th centuries BC with the fall of the New Kingdom. Following Egypt&#x27;s resurgence, kingdoms such as Tyre and Sidon were favoured over Byblos. By the Early Iron Age, Byblos no longer had connections to any great powers in the region. While the city still had religious authority until the Roman Empire, it had long lost its economic and political importance.

===Hittite Empire===
The Hittite Empire incorporated vassal states that extended over much of Anatolia and Northern Syria. The addition of vassal states reached its peak under the reigns of Šuppiluliuma I and Muršili II in the 14th century BC. The relationships between the Hittites and their vassal states centered around the Hittite king and the vassal ruler; the terms of their relationship were imposed unilaterally by the former, and accepted by the latter. Whenever a new Hittite king or vassal ruler came into power, a new treaty would be drawn up.

In rare cases, local rulers were given &quot;kiurwana&quot; (protectorate status). While they had distinct privileges such as exemption from tribute they did not have any more freedom of activity than other vassal states. All relations among the regions under Hittite control were strictly determined by the king. While this led to the belief that contact between vassal states was limited, it has also been thought that such restrictions were limited to the enemies of the Hatti.

The treaties imposed on vassal states came with military obligations, though vassals were also promised military assistance in return. Some treaties also contained details of annual tribute. Treaties were often concluded with a marriage between a vassal ruler and a Hatti princess of the royal family. The princess would hold greater power than other wives of the vassal, and succession would pass down her descendants.

Vassal states were obliged to support and swear fealty to the king&#x27;s legitimate successors as well. In the event of a usurper taking the throne, the vassal state was freed from all treaty obligations except to help restore a legitimate king to the throne. In doing so, vassal rulers were guaranteed sovereignty from themselves and their successors in their region.

====Ugarit====
The relations of Ugarit are the most well-known of the Hittite&#x27;s vassal states. Sources on Ugarit&#x27;s role and relationship with the Hittites mostly comes from the Ugarit Archives, with only a few from Hittite sources. From the sources, it is believed that Ugarit held economic and commercial importance to the Hittite Empire, as many letters and documents relate to trade. Ugarit also maintained a relationship with Egypt, due to contacts with the Pharaoh&#x27;s court. Most evidence of this contact comes from the era of the Pax Hethitica, which came after peace between Egypt and the Hittite Empire.

====Amurru====
Amurru&#x27;s relationship to the Hittite Empire is attested to in documents recovered from Ugarit and Hattusa. Unlike Ugarit, Amurru does not appear to have been a trading centre. Rather, Hitttite sources place importance on the political and military role this kingdom played in the empire, as it was located on the border of Hatti territory and Egypt. Previously a vassal state of Egypt, the Kingdom defected to the Hittites under the ruler Aziru. Amurru was loyal to the Hittite Empire from the end of the Amarna Period until the reign of Muwatalli II, when they switched allegiances back to Egypt. The defection was punished with a temporary replacement of the king with a more loyal ruler. Two marriages occurred between Hittites and Amurru royalty at this time, raising Amurru&#x27;s importance within the empire. Amurru&#x27;s relationship with the Hittite Empire was maintained until the collapse of the latter in the 12th century BC. A shift from Semitic names used by descendants of Aziru suggest a lasting impact of Hittite influence in the region.

====Carchemish====
While Carchemish was a leading power in Syria and delegate for Syrian affairs, not much is known about their interactions with the Great Powers of the region. What is known comes from archives at Hattusa, Emar, and Ugarit. When the city was conquered by Suppiluliuma I, he installed his son on the throne Due to this, the later kings of Carchemish acted as representatives for the Hittite Empire in Syria. In the 13th century, Carchemish was trading directly with Assyria, and had relations with Babylonia as well. Carchemish also survived the end of the Hittite Empire, and became its own city-state in the Early Iron Age. In the 8th century BC, it was annexed by the Assyrian Empire.

===Neo-Assyrian Empire===
The vassal states of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911 BC – 609 BC) had a unique relationship with the empire they became a part of. While vassal states were necessary to the politics of the empire and connected by administrative and economic means, they are not considered to be ‘properly Assyrian’. Neo-Assyrian imperial ideology placed importance on unified diversity, and as such vassal states maintained a degree of cultural independence. While territorial expansion slowed in the 7th century BC, the amount of vassal states increased in number, suggesting a change in foreign policy.

Assyrian kings expressed their hold over vassal states through the collection of flora and fauna from these regions. The earliest records of this practice date back to Tiglath-Pileser I (1114 BC – 1076 BC) in the Middle Assyrian Period. It was revived by Ashurnasirpal in the Neo-Assyrian Period by creating a garden with specimens from across the empire. Later Neo-Assyrian rulers would expand on this practice; Sargon II created a garden that imitated the forests of Northern Syria, while Sennacherib created a swamp that reflected the landscape of Southern Babylonia. In artistic representations, subjects of vassal states are depicted bringing tribute to Assyria. These representatives are shown bowing or crouching before the king. The gifts offered range from horses and monkeys to wineskins. These scenes of tribute and audience with the king express how vassal states participated in the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

By the 8th century BC, the southern vassal states of the empire saw an increase in settlement. In comparison to the northern regions of the empire – which were previously devastated – these kingdoms become denser and the more prosperous parts of the empire. The kingdoms west of the Euphrates river were considered vassal states until the 7th century BC, when they were incorporated into the proper provincial system of the empire, though they still had various degrees of political control depending on location. In Judah, there was a further increase in settlement in the 7th century that was greater than the 8th. It was the same in Jordan, showing that Neo-Assyrian control over the region was a successful period for these kingdoms.

===Achaemenid Persia===

While the Persians made use of satraps (appointed Persian governors) rather than vassal rulers in subject regions, there were rare cases of vassal states being utilised. Herodotus writes that negotiations took place between King Amyntas I of Macedonia and the Persians after the former&#x27;s subjugation by the Achaemenids by 513 BC. The Macedonians became further connected to the Persians as Amyntas married his daughter to a Persian nobleman (Hdt. 5.21.). Under Darius I, Macedonia was organised into a regular tax district of the Empire (Hdt. 6.44.). Their control over Macedonia is attested in the DNA inscription at Naqsh-I-Rustam. Amyntas’ son Alexander I supported Xerxes I during the Persian invasion of Greece. In 479 BC, the Achaemenid forces were defeated by the Greeks, and Macedonia was no longer considered Greek by other city-states.

Another region considered a vassal state rather than a satrap was Arabia. According to Herodotus, they aided Cambyses II in his invasion of Egypt (525 BC). As such, Arabia did not become a satrap and was exempt from paying annual tribute. Instead, they are attested to in the Behistun inscription and in the Persepolis Fortification Tablets as providing 1000 talents per year. In Xerxes’ invasion of Greece, Herodotus mentions the Arabians among the different sections of the Persian Army as being led by Arsamenes – the son of Darius I.

Despite the size of the Achaemenid Empire, there was efficient communication and connectivity between different regions. The Royal Road which ran through most of the empire allowed for the movement and sharing of goods, culture, and ideas between the Achaemenid satraps and vassal states.

===Ancient China===

From the time of the Zhou dynasty (1046–770 BC) until the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), a varying number of vassal states existed in Ancient China.

These ranged in size from small city states to vassals which controlled large swathes of territory such as the states of Chu and Qi. One of these vassal states would go on to conquer China and unite the country under the first emperor Qin Shi Huang.

====Controversy on Status of Joseon====
The Qing dynasty of China viewed the Joseon dynasty of Korea as an autonomous vassal state. The Joseon dynasty was autonomous in its internal and external affairs. It was not a colony or dependency of China. However, China abandoned its conventional policy of noninterference toward Korea and adopted a radical interventionist one in the late 19th century. Yuan Shikai argued that Korea was a dependent &quot;vassal state&quot;; Owen N. Denny argued that Korea was an independent &quot;tributary state&quot;. William W. Rockhill said that calling Korea a vassal state was &quot;misleading&quot;. According to Rockhill: &quot;The tribute sent to Peking by all the &#x27;vassal states,&#x27; and also by the Tibetans, and the Aboriginal tribes of Western China, is solely a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for the privilege of trading with the Chinese under extraordinarily favorable conditions.&quot; Rockhill argued that Korea viewed China not as a suzerain but as a family head: Korea likened the Ming dynasty to a father and the Qing dynasty to an older brother. According to Rockhill: &quot;As to the custom of submitting to the Emperor the choice made by the king of an heir to the throne, or of a consort, or informing him of the death of his mother, of his wife, etc., we can look at them as only strictly ceremonial relations, bearing with them no idea of subordination.&quot;

===Ottoman Empire===
The Ottoman Empire (1299–1923) controlled a number of tributary or vassal states in the peripheral areas of its territory. Vassalage took a number of different forms with some states permitted to elect their own leaders. Other states paid tribute for their lands.

During the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire controlled many vassal and tributary states such as the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, and the Crimean Khanate.

<text>Frederick Buscombe (September 2, 1862 – July 21, 1938), was the 11th Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He served from 1905 to 1906. A glassware and china merchant, he was a President of the Vancouver Board of Trade in 1900.

Buscombe was born in 1862 in Bodmin, Cornwall, England, to Edwin and Isabella Oliver Grilles Buscombe. He immigrated to Canada with his family in 1870, settling near Hamilton, Ontario, where his father became a builder. He first worked in Hamilton from 1878 to James A. Skinner &amp; Company, a glassware and china company, as a travelling salesman from 1878 to 1891. In 1891, his job with the company brought him west to Vancouver, where he established an office with his brother, George. Prior to 1891, he visited the Vancouver area twice, in 1884 and 1886. He served as a partner of the company in Vancouver until 1899, when he bought out the company, and established Frederick Buscombe &amp; Co. Ltd. china, glassware and earthenware with his brother, which grew to be one of the largest businesses of the kind in the Canadian West. He was also president of the Pacific Coast Lumber &amp; Sawmills Company, and director of the Pacific Marine Insurance Company. In 1899, he commissioned the Buscombe Building, located at 342 Water Street &amp; 403 West Cordova Street, in Gastown, Vancouver, which is now the site of a restaurant and various businesses.

Buscombe was elected Mayor of Vancouver in 1905. During the election, he advocated for improved financial management within the municipal affairs, earning support from three newspapers, and many businessmen. He served two terms, until 1906. During his mayoralty, he helped develop the Greater Vancouver Water Board. The city council also passed a motion to request suspension of immigration of East Indians to Vancouver due to public discontent of immigrants working in the growing construction trade.

Buscombe served as president of Vancouver&#x27;s Board of Trade from 1900 to 1901, and as president of the Vancouver Tourist Association in 1901. A Mason, he was also a member of the Vancouver Club, Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Terminal City Club, Jericho Country Club, and the Sons of England Society. He died at Vancouver 1938 and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was married to Cora Elsie Bird.

He married Lydia Rebecca Mattice on May 6, 1886, with whom he had five children. He lived in Dundurn, Vancouver. A member of the Church of England, he enjoyed yachting, fishing and golf.

<text>Alexander Bethune (January 31, 1852 – June 10, 1947), merchant, was the 12th Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, serving from 1907 to 1908. He had previously served seven years as alderman.

==Early and family life==
Bethune was born in Peterborough, Ontario to William B. and Catherine (née Dingwall) Bethune.

He married Catherine MacIntosh of Paisley, Ontario in 1878, and they had two daughters. A Presbyterian church, Bethune enjoyed hunting, fishing and motoring as hobbies. He was also a Freemason and founding member of Acacia Lodge No. 22.

==Career==
After completing his education in Ontario, he moved to Manitou, Manitoba in 1887 where he entered the hardware business. He also served as postmaster of Manitou as well as on the city council as an alderman. He moved further west in 1890, to Vancouver. In Vancouver he would establish a shoe store, Mills &amp; Bethune, operating from 1896 to 1900, when he entered the building business.

Bethune was elected to Vancouver City Council in 1900 and served until 1907, when he was elected mayor. He was also the head of the Electoral Union slate. During the election, which was at the time overshadowed by the ongoing provincial election, the main issue of contention was whether to have a stop in the city along the Vancouver Westminster and Yukon Railway.

During his term, he was faced with the September 1907 Vancouver riots in which he permitted demonstrators from the Asiatic Exclusion League to hold a rally at city hall in which speeches were delivered in support of the prohibition of Asian immigration to the city. Bethune was also a founder, paying member and ardent supporter of the organization. After the city hall rally, the crowd descended upon Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown and Japantown, continuing protests, smashing windows and even beating residents. Bethune would later express regret about the riot and urged citizens to use moderation. Bethune was also against the immigration of Indians, prohibiting them from settling in Vancouver during his term in 1907.

==Death and legacy==
He died in 1947 at Los Angeles County, California, but his remains were returned to Vancouver, for interment at Mountain View Cemetery.

<doc id="293408" wikidata="Q549818" url="?curid=293408" title="John the Cappadocian">
<text>John the Cappadocian () (&quot;fl.&quot; 530s, living 548) was a praetorian prefect of the East (532–541) in the Byzantine Empire under Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565). He was also a patrician and the &quot;consul ordinarius&quot; of 538.

==Biography==
Both John the Lydian and Zacharias Rhetor report that John was a native of Caesarea, Cappadocia. Procopius, John Malalas, the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, and Zacharias called him &quot;John the Cappadocian&quot; for disambiguation reasons, as the name John (&quot;Ioannes&quot; in Greek and &quot;Johannes&quot; in Latin) was widely used by his time. John the Lydian and John Malalas at times mention him only as &quot;the Cappadocian&quot;. John occasionally styled himself as &quot;Flavius Marianus Michaelius Gabrielius Archangelus Ioannes&quot;, although most of these names were probably just honorifics, as by that time most individuals were known by a single name. His family connections are obscure and only two relatives are known with certainty. Those are his only daughter Euphemia and a kinsman called Ioannes Maxilloplumacius.

===Rise to power===
His contemporary historians were biased against him, particularly Procopius and John the Lydian, and their accounts are often coloured by their prejudices. Procopius calls John poorly educated, though he grudgingly admits the Cappadocian&#x27;s great natural abilities led to his rise to prominence. He first appears in the sources as a &quot;scriniarius&quot; (notary) in the service of an unidentified &quot;magister militum&quot;. His administrative ideas reportedly attracted the attention of Emperor Justinian, resulting in his promotion to positions with financial responsibilities. From there, he gained enough favour to become a &quot;vir illustris&quot; and eventually the acting Prefect. There is a theory that his close relationship with Emperor Justinian may date to Justinian&#x27;s service as &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot; in the 520s, prior to his elevation to the Byzantine throne.
John was appointed to lead the first commission on Emperor Justinian&#x27;s new legal code, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, and became Justinian&#x27;s chief legal advisor. He was also appointed praetorian prefect of the East, giving him the power to introduce new taxes on the population. The new taxes were very unpopular, and the mob involved in the Nika riots of 532 demanded that both John the Cappadocian and the &quot;quaestor sacri palatii&quot; Tribonian be dismissed. Emperor Justinian did so, until the riots had been suppressed, after which he reinstated John as prefect and Tribonian as &quot;quaestor&quot;. After the riots, which had been supported by upper-class Senators, John, who had the same lower-class background as Justinian, became even more important in political affairs. John influenced Emperor Justinian&#x27;s military decisions, helping to draft the Perpetual Peace with Khosrow I (531–579) and convincing Justinian not to empty the treasury with a large expedition against the Vandal kingdom in North Africa. John worked with the Byzantine emperor to reduce the size of the bureaucracy, both in Constantinople and in the provinces, developing a rudimentary meritocracy.

Zacharias reports that the Cappadocian was widely feared for his influence on Emperor Justinian and a tendency to bring accusations against many people. He was reportedly aided by several flatterers in his service. John the Lydian reports that the Cappadocian constructed a prison within the Praetorium of Constantinople. There, prisoners were regularly tortured and executed. John the Lydian asserts that the Cappadocian extracted money from his victims and gives an eyewitness testimony to the execution of one such victim.

John the Lydian goes on to report other changes to life in the Praetorium. The Cappadocian transferred his quarters upstairs, offering the traditional living quarters of the Prefect to his followers. The Prefect reportedly treated his official staff as common slaves. He converted the baths of the Praetorium to a stable for his horses, building a new elevated bathroom for himself equipped with fountains. He reportedly used his official residence to give lavish feasts and indulge &quot;in all manners of debaucheries&quot; while maintaining a luxurious private residence at the same time. Procopius seems to agree, reporting that the Cappadocian would spend his mornings robbing the taxpayers, devoting the rest of the day to &quot;unrestrained debauchery&quot;. Procopius also claims that John employed thousands of bodyguards to ensure his security.

===Downfall and exile===
John the Cappadocian&#x27;s downfall seems to have been the result of an ongoing rivalry with Empress Theodora and general Belisarius. He was considered a rival of Theodora for independent and unique influence over Emperor Justinian. At that time the influence of both on the emperor was in fact so great that they became very hostile to each other and each supposedly accused the other to him, so that they could influence the government alone. Belisarius had reportedly gained much popular support following his return from the Gothic War and the Cappadocian considered him another rival favorite. According to Procopius, Theodora and Antonina, wife of Belisarius, allied against the Prefect. Antonina arranged a private meeting with John, supposedly to conspire against Justinian. John agreed to meet her at the palace of Rufinianae near Chalcedon, reportedly violating a direct order by Justinian to avoid secret meetings with Antonina. Their supposedly private conversation was actually overheard by Marcellus and Narses, as pre-arranged by the two women. Marcellus and Narses were ordered by Theodora to kill John if he spoke out in favor of treason. In the ensuing scuffle, however, John escaped and fled to a church, while Marcellus was wounded by one of John&#x27;s guards. John was removed from office immediately after and banished to Cyzicus.

Theodotus succeeded John as praetorian prefect in late May or early June 541. A continuation of Marcellinus Comes reports that the private residence of John at Constantinople passed to the ownership of Belisarius. The Cappadocian was ordained a priest against his will, but he reportedly avoided practicing his priesthood in fear that this would ruin his chances for a return to power. His wealth was confiscated, but Justinian was reluctant to be overly harsh to his old favourite and restored part of John&#x27;s private property to him at a later date. Procopius noted that John remained wealthy enough to live a life of luxury, but his troubles were not over. He was hostile to his new superior, Eusebius, Bishop of Cyzicus, and when Eusebius was murdered, the Cappadocian found himself accused of complicity in the crime.

John was imprisoned, his captors beating him to produce a confession. His guilt was not established, but his wealth was again confiscated. This time Justinian was much harsher to him. His new place of exile was Antinoe in Egypt. He was transported there by ship, forced to only wear a cheap cloak and earn his living as a beggar at every stop on the way. Procopius wrote his account on the third year of John&#x27;s exile, that is in 544. John still didn&#x27;t lose his hopes for restoration to power. He had taken to accusing various citizens of Alexandria for tax avoidance. Procopius notes Theodora&#x27;s continued efforts to put John on trial for murder, but the residents of Cyzicus would not testify against him.

In 548, Theodora died, and Justinian recalled John to Constantinople. However, the Cappadocian never returned to political power and was not allowed to resign his unwanted priesthood. John Malalas notes that the Cappadocian died peacefully at Constantinople some time later. His contemporary historians acknowledge his ability to identify problems and produce solutions, but decry his wickedness, greed, and the way he squandered his wealth.

<doc id="293409" wikidata="Q57274" url="?curid=293409" title="Yoweri Museveni">
<text>Yoweri Kaguta Museveni Tibuhaburwa (born 15 September 1944) is a Ugandan politician, military officer, and dictator who is the ninth and current president of Uganda since 1986. As of 2025, he is the third-longest consecutively serving current non-royal national leader in the world (after Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in Equatorial Guinea and Paul Biya in Cameroon).

Born in Ntungamo, Museveni studied political science from the University of Dar es Salaam where he initiated the University Students&#x27; African Revolutionary Front. In 1972, he participated in the abortive invasion of Uganda against the regime of President Idi Amin. The next year, Museveni established the Front for National Salvation and fought alongside Tanzanian forces in the Tanzania–Uganda War, which overthrew Amin. Museveni contested the subsequent 1980 general election on the platform of Uganda Patriotic Movement, though claimed electoral fraud after losing to the unpopular Milton Obote. Museveni unified the opposition under the National Resistance Movement and started the Ugandan Bush War. In January 1986, after the decisive Battle of Kampala, Museveni was sworn as president.

As president, Museveni suppressed the Ugandan insurgency and oversaw involvement in the Rwandan Civil War and the First Congo War. He ordered an intervention against the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army in an effort to halt their insurgency. His rule has been described by scholars as competitive authoritarianism, or illiberal democracy. The press has been under the authority of government. His presidency has been characterized by relative economic success and, in its later period, an upsurge in anti-gay activity alongside numerous constitutional amendments like the scrapping of presidential term and age limits in 2005 and 2017.

On 16 January 2021, Museveni was reelected to a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote, despite many videos and reports showing ballot box stuffing, over 400 polling stations with 100% voter turnout and human rights violations. , after 36 years of his authoritarian rule, Uganda has been ranked 166th in GDP (nominal) per capita and 167th by Human Development Index.

== Early life and education ==
Museveni was estimated to be born on 15 September 1944 to parents Mzee Amos Kaguta (1916–2013), a cattle keeper, and Esteri Kokundeka Nganzi (1918–2001), in Ntungamo. He is an ethnic Hima of the kingdom of Mpororo (now part of Ankole).

According to Julius Nyerere, Museveni&#x27;s father, Amos Kaguta, was a soldier in the King&#x27;s African Rifles&#x27; 7th battalion during World War II. Yoweri was born, relatives used to say, &quot;His father was a mu-seven&quot; (meaning &quot;in the seventh&quot;). This is how he obtained the name Museveni.

His family migrated to Ntungamo, then within the British Protectorate of Uganda. Museveni attended Kyamate Elementary School, Mbarara High School, and Ntare School for his primary and secondary education. He attended the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania for his tertiary education, where he studied economics and political science. The university at the time was a hot bed of radical pan-African and Marxist political thought. While at university, he formed the University Students&#x27; African Revolutionary Front student activist group and led a student delegation to FRELIMO-held territory in Portuguese Mozambique where they received military training. Studying under the leftist Walter Rodney, among others, Museveni wrote a university thesis on the applicability of Frantz Fanon&#x27;s ideas on revolutionary violence to post-colonial Africa.

== Career ==
=== 1971–1979: Front for National Salvation and the toppling of Amin ===

The exile forces opposed to Idi Amin invaded Uganda from Tanzania in September 1972 and were repelled. In October, Tanzania and Uganda signed the Mogadishu Agreement that denied the rebels the use of Tanzanian soil for aggression against Uganda. Museveni broke away from the mainstream opposition and formed the Front for National Salvation (FRONASA) in 1973. In August of the same year, he married Janet Kainembabazi.

In October 1978, Ugandan troops invaded the Kagera Salient in northern Tanzania, initiating the Uganda–Tanzania War. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere ordered the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force (TPDF) to counter-attack and mobilized Ugandan dissidents to fight Amin&#x27;s regime. Museveni was pleased by this development. In December 1978 Nyerere attached Museveni and his forces to Tanzanian troops under Brigadier Silas Mayunga. Museveni and his FRONASA troops subsequently accompanied the Tanzanians during the counter-invasion of Uganda. He was present during the capture and destruction of Mbarara in February 1979, and involved in the Western Uganda campaign of 1979.

In course of these operations, he alternatively spent time at the frontlines and in Tanzania. While in Tanzania, he discussed the cooperation of various anti-Amin rebel groups as well as the political future of Uganda with Tanzanian politicians and other Ugandan opposition figures such as Obote. He played a significant part in the Moshi Conference which led to the unification of the opposition as the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF). Yusuf Lule was appointed as UNLF chairman and the potential President of Uganda after Amin&#x27;s overthrow. Museveni felt dissatisfied with the results of the conference, believing that he and his followers were not granted enough representation.

=== 1980–1986: Ugandan Bush War ===

==== Obote II and the National Resistance Army ====
With the overthrow of Amin in 1979 and the contested election that returned Milton Obote to power in 1980, Museveni returned to Uganda with his supporters to gather strength in their rural strongholds in the Bantu-dominated south and south-west to form the Popular Resistance Army (PRA). They planned a rebellion against the second Obote regime (Obote II) and its armed forces, the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). The insurgency began with an attack on an army installation in the central Mubende district on 6 February 1981. The PRA later merged with former president Yusufu Lule&#x27;s fighting group, the Uganda Freedom Fighters, to create the National Resistance Army (NRA) with its political wing, the National Resistance Movement (NRM). Two other rebel groups, the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF) and the Former Uganda National Army (FUNA), engaged Obote&#x27;s forces. The FUNA was formed in the West Nile sub-region from the remnants of Amin&#x27;s supporters.

The NRA/NRM developed a &quot;Ten-point Programme&quot; for an eventual government, covering: democracy; security; consolidation of national unity; defending national independence; building an independent, integrated, and self-sustaining economy; improvement of social services; elimination of corruption and misuse of power; redressing inequality; cooperation with other African countries; and a mixed economy.

The Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot; estimates that the Obote regime was responsible for more 100,000 civilian deaths across Uganda.

==== 1985 Nairobi Agreement ====
On 27 July 1985, sub factionalism within the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress government led to a successful military coup against Obote by his former army commander, Lieutenant-General Tito Okello, an Acholi. Museveni and the NRM/NRA were angry that the revolution for which they had fought for four years had been &quot;hijacked&quot; by the UNLA, which they viewed as having been discredited by gross human rights violations during Obote II.

Despite these reservations, the NRM/NRA eventually agreed to peace talks presided over by a Kenyan delegation headed by President Daniel arap Moi. The talks, which lasted from 26 August to 17 December, were notoriously acrimonious and the resultant ceasefire broke down almost immediately. The final agreement, signed in Nairobi, called for a ceasefire, demilitarization of Kampala, integration of the NRA and government forces, and absorption of the NRA leadership into the Military Council. These conditions were never met.

==== Battle of Kampala ====

While involved in the peace negotiations, Museveni was courting General Mobutu Sésé Seko of Zaire to forestall the involvement of Zairean forces in support of Okello&#x27;s military junta. On 20 January 1986, several hundred troops loyal to Amin were accompanied into Ugandan territory by the Zairean military. The forces intervened following secret training in Zaire and an appeal from Okello ten days previously.

By 22 January, government troops in Kampala had begun to quit their posts and masse as the rebels gained ground from the south and south-west.

== Presidency ==
Museveni was sworn in as president on 29 January. &quot;This is not a mere change of guard, it is a fundamental change,&quot; said Museveni, after a ceremony conducted by British-born Chief Justice Peter Allen. Speaking to crowds of thousands outside the Ugandan parliament, Museveni promised a return to democracy: &quot;The people of Africa, the people of Uganda, are entitled to a democratic government. It is not a favor from any regime. The sovereign people must be the public, not the government.&quot;

=== Rise to power: 1986–1996 ===
==== Political and economic regeneration ====
Uganda began participating in an IMF Economic Recovery Program in 1987. Its objectives included the restoration of incentives in order to encourage growth, investment, employment, and exports; the promotion and diversification of trade with particular emphasis on export promotion; the removal of bureaucratic constraints and divestment from ailing public enterprises so as to enhance sustainable economic growth and development through the private sector and the liberalization of trade at all levels.

====Human rights and internal security====
The NRM came to power promising to restore security and respect for human rights. This was part of the NRM&#x27;s ten-point programme, as Museveni noted in his swearing in speech:

Although Museveni headed a new government in Kampala, the NRM could not project its influence fully across Ugandan territory, finding itself fighting a number of insurgencies. From the beginning of Museveni&#x27;s presidency, he drew strong support from the Bantu-speaking south and southwest, where Museveni had his base. Museveni managed to get the Karamojong, a group of semi-nomads in the sparsely populated northeast that had never had a significant political voice, to align with him by offering them a stake in the new government. The northern region along the Sudanese border proved more troublesome. In the West Nile sub-region, inhabited by Kakwa and Lugbara (who had previously supported Amin), the UNRF and FUNA rebel groups fought for years until a combination of military offensives and diplomacy pacified the region.

The leader of the UNRF, Moses Ali, gave up his struggle to become the second deputy prime minister. People from the northern parts of the country viewed the rise of a government led by a person from the south with great trepidation. Rebel groups sprang up among the Lango, Acholi, and Teso peoples, though they were overwhelmed by the strength of the NRA except in the far north where the Sudanese border provided a safe haven. The Acholi rebel Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army (UPDA) failed to dislodge the NRA occupation of Acholiland, leading to the desperate chiliasm of the Holy Spirit Movement (HSM). The defeat of both the UPDA and HSM left the rebellion to a group that eventually became known as the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, which turned upon the Acholi themselves.
The NRA subsequently earned a reputation for respecting the rights of civilians, although Museveni later received criticism for using child soldiers. Undisciplined elements within the NRA soon tarnished a hard-won reputation for fairness. &quot;When Museveni&#x27;s men first came they acted very well—we welcomed them&quot;, said one villager, &quot;but then they started to arrest people and kill them&quot;.

In March 1989, Amnesty International published a human rights report on Uganda, &quot;Uganda, the Human Rights Record 1986–1989&quot;. It documented gross human rights violations committed by NRA troops. According to Olara Otunnu, a United Nations Diplomat argued that Museveni pursued a genocide to Nilotic – Luo people living in the Northern part of the country. In one of the most intense phases of the war, between October and December 1988, the NRA forcibly cleared approximately 100,000 people from their homes in and around Gulu town. Soldiers committed hundreds of extrajudicial executions as they forcibly moved people, burning down homes and granaries. In its conclusion, the report offered some hope:

On 13 September 2019, Museveni&#x27;s former Inspector General of Police (IGP) General Kale Kayihura was placed on the United States Department of the Treasury sanctions list for gross violation of Human rights during his reign as the IGP (from 2005 to March 2018). This was due to activities of the Uganda Police&#x27;s Flying Squad Unit that involved torture and corruption. Kayihura was subsequently replaced with Martin Okoth Ochola.

=== First elected term (1996–2001) ===

==== Elections ====
The first elections under Museveni&#x27;s government were held on 9 May 1996. Museveni defeated Paul Ssemogerere of the Democratic Party, who contested the election as a candidate for the &quot;Inter-party forces coalition&quot;, and the upstart candidate Kibirige Mayanja. Museveni won with 75.5 percent of the vote from a turnout of 72.6 percent of eligible voters. Although international and domestic observers described the vote as valid, both the losing candidates rejected the results. Museveni was sworn in as president for the second time on 12 May 1996.

In 1997 he introduced free primary education.

The second set of elections were held in 2001. Museveni got 69 percent of the vote to beat his rival Kizza Besigye. Besigye had been a close confidant of the president and was his physician during the Ugandan Bush War. They had a terrible fallout shortly before the 2001 elections, when Besigye decided to stand for the presidency. The 2001 election campaigns were a heated affair with Museveni threatening to put his rival &quot;six feet under&quot;.

The election culminated in a petition filed by Besigye at the Supreme Court of Uganda. The court ruled that the elections were not free and fair but declined to nullify the outcome by a 3–2 majority decision. The court held that although there were many cases of election malpractice, they did not affect the result in a substantial manner. Chief Justice Benjamin Odoki and Justices Alfred Karokora and Joseph Mulenga ruled in favor of the respondents while Justices Aurthur Haggai Oder and John Tsekoko ruled in favor of Besigye.

==== International recognition ====
Museveni was elected chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1991 and 1992.

Perhaps Museveni&#x27;s most widely noted accomplishment has been his government&#x27;s successful campaign against AIDS. During the 1980s, Uganda had one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, but now Uganda&#x27;s rates are comparatively low, and the country stands as a rare success story in the global battle against the virus. One of the campaigns headed by Museveni to fight against HIV/AIDS was the ABC program. The ABC program had three main parts &quot;Abstain, Be faithful, or use Condoms if A and B are not practiced.&quot; In April 1998, Uganda became the first country to be declared eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, receiving US$700 million in aid.

Museveni was lauded by some for his affirmative action program for women in the country. He had a female vice-president, Specioza Kazibwe, for nearly a decade, and has done much to encourage women to go to college. On the other hand, Museveni has resisted calls for greater women&#x27;s family land rights (the right of women to own a share of their matrimonial homes).

The &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1997 said about Museveni:

These are heady days for the former guerilla who runs Uganda. He moves with the measured gait and sure gestures of a leader secure in his power and his vision. It is little wonder. To hear some of the diplomats and African experts tell it, President Yoweri K. Museveni started an ideological movement that is reshaping much of Africa, spelling the end of the corrupt, strong-man governments that characterized the cold-war era. These days, political pundits across the continent are calling Mr. Museveni an African Bismarck. Some people now refer to him as Africa&#x27;s &quot;other statesman&quot;, second only to the venerated South African President Nelson Mandela.

In official briefing papers from Madeleine Albright&#x27;s December 1997 Africa tour as Secretary of State, Museveni was claimed by the Clinton administration to be a &quot;beacon of hope&quot; who runs a &quot;uni-party democracy&quot;, despite Uganda not permitting multiparty politics.

Museveni has been an important ally of the United States in the War on Terror.

==== Regional conflict ====

Following the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the new Rwandan government felt threatened by the presence across the Rwandan border in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) of former Rwandan soldiers and members of the previous regime. These soldiers were aided by Mobutu Sese Seko, leading Rwanda (with the aid of Museveni) and Laurent Kabila&#x27;s rebels during the First Congo War to overthrow Mobutu and take power in the DRC.

In August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda invaded the DRC again during the Second Congo War, this time to overthrow Kabila, who was a former ally of Museveni and Kagame. Museveni and a few close military advisers alone made the decision to send the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force (UPDF) into the DRC. A number of highly placed sources indicate that the Ugandan parliament and civilian advisers were not consulted over the matter, as is required by the 1995 constitution. Museveni apparently persuaded an initially reluctant High Command to go along with the venture. &quot;We felt that the Rwandese started the war and it was their duty to go ahead and finish the job, but our President took time and convinced us that we had a stake in what is going on in Congo&quot;, one senior officer is reported as saying.

The official reasons Uganda gave for the intervention were to stop a &quot;genocide&quot; against the Banyamulenge in the DRC in concert with Rwandan forces, and that Kabila had failed to provide security along the border and was allowing the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) to attack Uganda from rear bases in the DRC. In reality, the UPDF were deployed deep inside the DRC, more than to the west of Uganda&#x27;s border with the DRC.

Troops from Rwanda and Uganda plundered the country&#x27;s rich mineral deposits and timber. The United States responded to the invasion by suspending all military aid to Uganda, a disappointment to the Clinton administration, which had hoped to make Uganda the centerpiece of the African Crisis Response Initiative. In 2000, Rwandan and Ugandan troops exchanged fire on three occasions in the DRC city of Kisangani, leading to tensions and a deterioration in relations between Kagame and Museveni. The Ugandan government has also been criticized for aggravating the Ituri conflict, a sub-conflict of the Second Congo War. The Ugandan army officially withdrew from the Congo in 2003 and a contingent of UN peace keepers was deployed. In December 2005, the International Court of Justice ruled that Uganda must pay compensation to the DRC for human rights violations during the Second Congo War.

=== Second term (2001–2006) ===

==== 2001 elections ====
In 2001, Museveni won the presidential elections by a substantial majority, with his former friend and personal physician Kizza Besigye as the only real challenger. In a populist publicity stunt, a pentagenarian Museveni travelled on a &quot;bodaboda&quot; motorcycle taxi to submit his nomination form for the election. &quot;Boda-boda&quot; is a cheap and somewhat dangerous (by western standards) method of transporting passengers around towns and villages in East Africa.

There was much recrimination and bitterness during the 2001 presidential elections campaign, and incidents of violence occurred following the announcement of the win by Museveni. Besigye challenged the election results in the Supreme Court of Uganda. Two of the five judges concluded that there were such illegalities in the elections and that the results should be rejected. The other three decided that the illegalities did not affect the result of the election in a substantial manner, but stated that &quot;there was evidence that in a significant number of polling stations there was cheating&quot; and that in some areas of the country, &quot;the principle of free and fair election was compromised.&quot;

==== Political pluralism and constitutional change ====
After the elections, political forces allied to Museveni began a campaign to loosen constitutional limits on the presidential term, allowing him to stand for election again in 2006. The 1995 Ugandan constitution provided for a two-term limit on the tenure of the president.

Moves to alter the constitution and alleged attempts to suppress opposition political forces have attracted criticism from domestic commentators, the international community, and Uganda&#x27;s aid donors. In a press release, the main opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), accused Museveni of engaging in a &quot;life presidency project&quot;, and for bribing members of parliament to vote against constitutional amendments, FDC leaders claimed:

As observed by some political commentators, including Wafula Oguttu, Museveni had previously stated that he considered the idea of clinging to office for &quot;15 or more&quot; years ill-advised. Comments by the Irish anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof sparked a protest by Museveni supporters outside the British High Commission in Kampala. &quot;Get a grip Museveni. Your time is up, go away&quot;, said Geldof in March 2005, explaining that moves to change the constitution were compromising Museveni&#x27;s record against fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS. In an opinion article in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and in a speech delivered at the Wilson Center, former U.S. Ambassador to Uganda Johnnie Carson heaped more criticism on Museveni. Despite recognizing the president as a &quot;genuine reformer&quot; whose &quot;leadership [has] led to stability and growth&quot;, Carson also said, &quot;we may be looking at another Mugabe and Zimbabwe in the making&quot;. &quot;Many observers see Museveni&#x27;s efforts to amend the constitution as a re-run of a common problem that afflicts many African leaders – an unwillingness to follow constitutional norms and give up power&quot;.

In July 2005, Norway became the third European country in as many months to announce symbolic cutbacks in foreign aid to Uganda in response to political leadership in the country. The UK and Ireland made similar moves in May. &quot;Our foreign ministry wanted to highlight two issues: the changing of the constitution to lift term limits, and problems with opening the political space, human rights and corruption&quot;, said Norwegian Ambassador Tore Gjos. Of particular significance was the arrest of two opposition MPs from the FDC. Human rights campaigners charged that the arrests were politically motivated. Human Rights Watch stated that &quot;the arrest of these opposition MPs smacks of political opportunism&quot;.

A confidential World Bank report leaked in May suggested that the international lender might cut its support to non-humanitarian programmes in Uganda. &quot;We regret that we cannot be more positive about the present political situation in Uganda, especially given the country&#x27;s admirable record through the late 1990s&quot;, said the paper. &quot;The Government has largely failed to integrate the country&#x27;s diverse peoples into a single political process that is viable over the long term... Perhaps most significant, the political trend-lines, as a result of the President&#x27;s apparent determination to press for a third term, point downward.&quot;

Museveni responded to the mounting international pressure by accusing donors of interfering with domestic politics and using aid to manipulate poor countries. &quot;Let the partners give advice and leave it to the country to decide ... [developed] countries must get out of the habit of trying to use aid to dictate the management of our countries.&quot; &quot;The problem with those people is not the third term or fighting corruption or multiparters&quot;, added Museveni at a meeting with other African leaders, &quot;the problem is that they want to keep us there without growing&quot;.

In July 2005, a constitutional referendum lifted a 19-year restriction on the activities of political parties. In the non-party &quot;Movement system&quot; (so-called &quot;the movement&quot;) instituted by Museveni in 1986, parties continued to exist, but candidates were required to stand for election as individuals rather than representative of any political grouping. This measure was ostensibly designed to reduce ethnic divisions, although many observers have subsequently claimed that the system had become nothing more than a restriction on opposition activity. Before the vote, the FDC spokesperson stated, &quot;Key sectors of the economy are headed by people from the president&#x27;s home area... We have got the most sectarian regime in the history of the country in spite of the fact that there are no parties.&quot; Many Ugandans saw Museveni&#x27;s conversion to political pluralism as a concession to donors – aimed at softening the blow when he announces he wants to stay on for a third term. Opposition MP Omara Atubo has said Museveni&#x27;s desire for change was merely &quot;a façade behind which he is trying to hide ambitions to rule for life&quot;.
==== Death of John Garang De Mabior ====
On 30 July 2005, Sudanese vice-president John Garang was killed when the Ugandan presidential helicopter crashed while he was flying back to Sudan from talks in Uganda. Garang had been Sudan&#x27;s vice-president for three weeks before his death.

Widespread speculation as to the cause of the crash led Museveni, on 10 August, to threaten the closure of media outlets that published &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; about Garang&#x27;s death. In a statement, Museveni claimed that the speculation was a threat to national security. &quot;I will no longer tolerate a newspaper which is like a vulture. Any newspaper that plays around with regional security, I will not tolerate it – I will close it.&quot; The following day, popular radio station KFM had its license withdrawn for broadcasting a debate on Garang&#x27;s death. Radio presenter Andrew Mwenda was eventually arrested for sedition in connection with comments made on his KFM talk show.

=== February 2006 elections ===
On 17 November 2005, Museveni was chosen as the NRM&#x27;s presidential candidate for the February 2006 elections. His candidacy for a further third term sparked criticism, as he had promised in 2001 that he was contesting for the last time.

The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye on 14 November – charged with treason, concealment of treason, and rape – sparked demonstrations and riots in Kampala and other towns. Museveni&#x27;s bid for a third term, the arrest of Besigye, and the besiegement of the High Court during a hearing of Besigye&#x27;s case (by a heavily armed Military Intelligence group dubbed by the press as the &quot;Black Mambas Urban Hit Squad&quot;), led Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom to withhold economic support to Museveni&#x27;s government because of their concerns about the country&#x27;s democratic development. On 2 January 2006, Besigye was released after the High Court ordered his immediate release.

The 23 February 2006 elections were Uganda&#x27;s first multi-party elections in 25 years and were seen as a test of its democratic credentials. Although Museveni did worse than in the previous election, he was elected for another five-year tenure, having won 59 percent of the vote against Besigye&#x27;s 37 percent. Besigye alleged fraud and rejected the result. The European Union and independent Ugandan electoral observers described the 2006 elections as not a fair and free contest. The Supreme Court of Uganda later noted that the election was marred by intimidation, violence, voter disenfranchisement and other irregularities; it voted 4–3 to uphold the results.

=== Third term (2006–2011) ===
In 2007, Museveni deployed troops to the African Union&#x27;s peacekeeping operation in Somalia.

Also in this term, Museveni held meetings with investors that included Wisdek, to promote Uganda&#x27;s call centre and outsourcing industry and create employment to the country.

==== September 2009 riots ====
In September 2009 Museveni refused Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi, the Buganda King, permission to visit some areas of the Buganda Kingdom, particularly the Kayunga district. Riots occurred and over 40 people were killed while others were imprisoned. Furthermore, nine more people were killed during the April 2011 &quot;Walk to Work&quot; demonstrations. According to the Human Rights Watch 2013 World Report on Uganda, the government failed to investigate the killings associated with both of these events.

==== Fundamentalist Christianity ====
In 2009, MSNBC and NPR reported on Jeff Sharlet&#x27;s investigation regarding ties between Museveni and the American fundamentalist Christian organization The Fellowship (also known as &quot;The Family&quot;). Sharlet reports that Douglas Coe, leader of The Fellowship, identified Museveni as the organization&#x27;s &quot;key man in Africa&quot;.

==== LGBT rights ====

Further international scrutiny accompanied the 2009 Ugandan efforts to institute the death penalty for homosexuality, with British, Canadian, French, and American leaders expressing concerns for human rights. British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Museveni &quot;appeared to add his backing&quot; to the legislative effort by, among other things, claiming &quot;European homosexuals are recruiting in Africa&quot;, and saying gay relationships were against God&#x27;s will.

Museveni and members of NRM continue to use the terms &#x27;gay&#x27; and &#x27;homosexuals&#x27; to degrade opponents and in particular members of the National Unity Platform. In 2023, Museveni signed an anti-LGBTQ+ bill and called on other African leaders to reject the &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot;.

=== Fourth term (2011–2016) ===
Museveni was reelected on 20 February 2011 with a 68 percent majority with 59 percent of registered voters having voted. The election results were disputed by both the European Union and the opposition. &quot;The electoral process was marred with avoidable administrative and logistical failures&quot;, according to the European Union election observer team.

Following the fall of Egypt&#x27;s Hosni Mubarak and Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi, Museveni became the fifth-longest serving African leader.

In October 2011, the annual inflation rate reached 30.5 percent, principally due to food and fuel increases. Earlier in 2011, opposition leader Kizza Besigye staged &quot;Walk to Work&quot; protests against the high cost of living. On 28 April 2011, Besigye was arrested because Museveni said Besigye had attacked first, a charge he denied. Besigye&#x27;s arrest led to more riots in Kampala. Besigye promised that &quot;peaceful demonstrations&quot; would continue. The government&#x27;s response to the riots has been condemned by donor nations. In more recent years, infringements on press freedom have increasingly been a central focus. According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Between January and June [2013], a media watchdog organization registered 50 attacks on journalists, despite multiple pledges to respect media freedom.&quot; During this period, two widely read periodicals, &quot;The Daily Monitor&quot; and &quot;The Red Pepper&quot;, were shut down and seized by the government because they published allegations about a &quot;plot to assassinate senior government and military officials who [were] opposed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni ... and his plans to hand over power to his son when he retires&quot;.

Another issue of human rights became an issue in early 2014 when Museveni signed an anti-homosexuality bill into law. In an interview with CNN, Museveni called homosexuals &quot;disgusting&quot; and said that homosexuality was a learned trait. Western leaders, including United States President Obama, condemned the law.

Museveni has criticized the US&#x27;s involvement in the Libyan Civil War, and in a UN speech argued that military intervention from African countries produces more stable countries in the long term, which he calls &quot;African solutions for African problems&quot;.

===Fifth term (2016–2021)===
==== 2016 election ====

The presidential candidates included Museveni and Kizza Besigye, who complained of rigging and violence at polling stations. Voting was extended in several locations after reports of people not being allowed to cast their votes. According to the Electoral Commission, Museveni was reelected (18 February 2016) with 61 percent of the vote to Besigye&#x27;s 35 percent. Opposition candidates claimed that the elections were marred by widespread fraud, voting irregularities, the repeated arrest of opposition politicians, and a climate of voter intimidation.

==== 2018 age limit bill ====

Museveni, as the incumbent president of Uganda, signed the Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 2 2017, commonly known as the &quot;Age Limit&quot; bill on 27 December 2017. The bill was passed by the 10th parliament of Uganda on 20 December 2017. As of 27 December 2017, in accordance with articles 259 and 262 of the Constitution of Uganda, the bill has effectively amended the Constitution to remove the presidential age limit caps. Before the amendment, article 102 (b) barred people above 75 and below 35 from running for the highest office. The current age limit bill also extends the term of office of parliament from five years to seven. The bill also restores presidential two-term limits which had been removed in a 2005 constitutional amendment.

==== Challenge to the bill ====
After Museveni signed the 2018 Age Limit Bill into law on 27 December 2017 (but parliament received the letter on 2 January 2018), the general public protested as they had been doing prior to the signing of the bill, using all avenues including on social media. In October 2017, some MPs returned what they alleged were bribes to facilitate the bill.

The Uganda Law Society and members of the opposition house sued and challenged the bill in court, citing that the process leading to the vote was in violation of Articles 1, 2, 8A, 44 (c), 79 and 94 of the Ugandan constitution because the Speaker of Parliament [Kadaga] closed debate on the Amendment after only 124 out of 451 legislators had debated the bill. They also argue that the use of force by the army and police during the bill debate was inconsistent with and in contravention of Articles 208(2), 209 and 259 among others. The third argument they make is that the bill violates other constitutional clauses in relation to the extension of terms and electoral procedures. One legislature [Mbwaketamwa Gaffa] is quoted as saying, &quot;when the president to the bill, it might be legal, but it will be illegitimate, and we are going to challenge it.&quot;

==== Public reaction to the new bill ====

The law enforcement agencies in Uganda, i.e. the police, the military etc., have arrested at least 53 people, including opposition leader Kizza Besigye, for demonstrating against the bill to scrap the presidential age limit.

A group of legislators from the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), clandestinely agitated to remove the age limit because it would give Museveni leeway to run for another term in the 2021 elections.

A three-month survey conducted between September and November by civil society organizations recorded that 85 percent of the sampled population opposed the removal of the age limit, with only 15 percent in support.

Ugandan lawmakers have voted predominantly to remove the presidential age limits because they want to pave way for the Museveni to spend a sixth term in office. Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo said that removing the age limitone of the most important safeguardswill entrench a dictatorial and autocratic regime in Uganda.

===Sixth term (2021–present)===

On 16 January 2021 the electoral commission of Uganda announced that Museveni had won reelection to a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote. Runner-up Bobi Wine, and other opposition leaders refused to accept the results, claiming that the election was the most fraudulent in Uganda&#x27;s history. During the campaign for the presidential elections on 19 November 2020, Museveni described Wine&#x27;s campaign as being financed by foreigners, and, in particular, foreign homosexuals.
Independent organizations and democracy experts confirmed the elections were neither free nor fair. The Electoral Commission published a Declaration of Results form that turned out to be fraudulent. The Electoral Commission promised an investigation which did not take place. Wine was placed under house arrest on 15 January. Independent international observers called for investigation into potential election fraud amidst a nationwide internet shutdown, human rights abuses, and denied accreditation requests. Wine was released on 26 January.

In June 2021, 44 people were arrested at an LGBT center, with the pretext of violating COVID SOPs.

In July 2022, Museveni hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, saying that &quot;We don&#x27;t believe in being enemies of somebody&#x27;s enemy.&quot;

In October 2022 Museveni apologized to Kenya on behalf of his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba who tweeted that he could invade Kenya in two weeks.

In July 2023, Museveni attended the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Without specifically mentioning the Russian invasion of Ukraine or any other war, Museveni said that the &quot;only justified wars are the just wars, like the anti-colonial wars. Wars of hegemony will fail and waste time and opportunity. Dialogue is the correct way.&quot;

After the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, Museveni expressed concern over the situation and called for dialogue and a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

<text>A corporate action is an event initiated by a public company that brings or could bring an actual change to the debt securities—equity or debt—issued by the company. Corporate actions are typically agreed upon by a company&#x27;s board of directors and authorized by the shareholders. For some events, shareholders or bondholders are permitted to vote on the event. Examples of corporate actions include stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs.

Some corporate actions such as a dividend (for equity securities) or coupon payment (for debt securities) may have a direct financial impact on the shareholders or bondholders; another example is a call (early redemption) of a debt security. Other corporate actions such as stock split may have an indirect financial impact, as the increased liquidity of shares may cause the price of the stock to decrease. Some corporate actions, such as name changes or ticker symbol changes to better reflect a company&#x27;s business focus, have no direct financial impact on the shareholders; securities may be listed under a different security identifier (e.g. ISIN, CUSIP, Sedol) however. For example, &quot;Apple Computers&quot; changed its name to Apple Inc.

== Overview ==
===Types===
There are three types of corporate actions: voluntary, mandatory, and mandatory with choice.

* Mandatory corporate action: A mandatory corporate action is an event initiated by the board of directors of the corporation that affects all shareholders. Participation of shareholders are mandatory for these corporate actions. An example of a mandatory corporate action is cash dividend. A shareholder does not need to act to receive the dividend. Other examples of mandatory corporate actions include stock splits, mergers, pre-refunding, return of capital, bonus issue, asset ID change, and spin-offs. Strictly speaking, the word &quot;mandatory&quot; is not appropriate because the shareholder is not required to do anything; the shareholder is just a passive beneficiary in all the cases cited above. There is nothing the shareholder has to do or does in a Mandatory Corporate Action.
* Voluntary corporate action: A voluntary corporate action is an action where the shareholders elect to participate in the action. A response is required for the corporation to process the action. An example of a voluntary corporate action is a tender offer. A corporation may request shareholders to tender their shares at a predetermined price. The shareholder may or may not participate in the tender offer. Shareholders send their responses to the corporation&#x27;s agents, and the corporation will send the proceeds of the action to the shareholders who elect to participate. 
* Mandatory with choice corporate action: This corporate action is a mandatory corporate action where shareholders are given a chance to choose among several options. An example is cash or stock dividend option with one of the options as default. Shareholders may or may not submit their elections. In case a shareholder does not submit the election, the default option will be applied.

Some market participants use a different method to distinguish the corporate action types. For example, &quot;mandatory corporate action&quot; and &quot;mandatory with choice corporate action&quot; may be used together. DTC uses the terms distributions, redemptions and reorganizations. 

===Purpose===
The primary reasons companies use corporate actions are:
* Return profits to shareholders: Cash dividends are a classic example where a public company declares a dividend to be paid on each outstanding share. Bonus is another case where the shareholder is rewarded. In a stricter sense, the bonus issue should not impact the share price but in reality, in rare cases, it does and results in an overall increase in value.
* Influence the share price: If the price of a stock is too high or too low, the liquidity of the stock suffers. Stocks priced too high will not be affordable to all investors and stocks priced too low may be delisted. Corporate actions such as stock splits or reverse stock splits increase or decrease the number of outstanding shares to decrease or increase the stock price respectively. Buybacks are another example of influencing the stock price where a corporation buys back shares from the market in an attempt to reduce the number of outstanding shares thereby increasing the price.
* Corporate restructuring: Corporations restructure in order to increase profitability. Examples include mergers (where two companies that are competitive or complementary join forces) and spin-offs (where a company breaks itself up in order to focus on its core competencies).

===Impact===
As an owner, the impact of a corporate action is usually measured in terms of changes to the securities and/or cash positions, so corporate actions can be divided into two categories:
* Benefits: Actions that result in an increase to the position holder’s securities or cash position, without altering the underlying security. Examples include bonus issues, which is a Mandatory With Options Action/Event.
* Reorganizations: Actions that reshape or restructure the beneficial owner&#x27;s underlying securities position, which sometimes also results in a cash payout. Examples include equity restructures, conversions, and subscriptions.

==Notification requirement==
In order to keep investors and the market informed of corporate actions, they need to be announced. For public companies listed on exchanges, the exchanges themselves handle the announcement, notifying shareholders as well as making information about the corporate action available online. For companies that trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace, U.S. federal securities regulators task Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization, with processing the corporate action announcement. 

The event information flow for public companies where shareholders or bondholders can vote usually involves numerous parties. The information is first announced by the company to the exchange. Financial data companies which provide economic and financial data to customers collect such information and disseminate it via their own services to banks, institutional investors, managed service providers, and other market participants. In addition, the central securities depository (CSD) of the respective market collects the data and informs the CSD participants holding the respective share or bond in custody about the upcoming corporate action. The CSD sets a deadline for its participants by which the elections must be returned. The CSD participants then further disseminate the information to its clients (e.g. banks, institutional investors or private clients), which in turn must submit their election by the deadline set by the CSD participant.

<doc id="293411" wikidata="Q735085" url="?curid=293411" title="David (Donatello, bronze)">
<text>David is a bronze statue of the biblical hero by the Italian Early Renaissance sculptor Donatello, probably made in the 1440s. Nude except for helmet and boots, it is famous as the first unsupported standing work of bronze cast during the Renaissance, and the first freestanding nude male sculpture made since antiquity. It depicts David with an enigmatic smile, posed with his foot on Goliath&#x27;s severed head just after defeating the giant. The youth is completely naked, apart from a laurel-topped hat and boots, and holds Goliath&#x27;s sword.

The creation of the work is undocumented. Most scholars assume the statue was commissioned by Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, but the date of its creation is unknown and widely disputed; suggested dates vary from the 1420s to the 1460s (Donatello died in 1466), with the majority opinion recently falling in the 1440s, when the new Medici Palace (now called the Palazzo Medici Riccardi) designed by Michelozzo was under construction.

Decades earlier, Donatello worked on a marble statue of David. Both are now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence. The bronze remains his most famous work, and was made for a secular context, commissioned by the Medici family. The iconography of the bronze &quot;David&quot; follows that of the marble &quot;David&quot;: a young hero stands with weapon in hand, the severed head of his enemy at his feet. Visually, however, this statue is startlingly different. David is both physically delicate and remarkably effeminate. The head has been said to have been inspired by classical sculptures of Antinous, the favourite of the Emperor Hadrian, renowned for his beauty. The statue&#x27;s physique, contrasted with the large sword in hand, shows that David has overcome Goliath not by physical prowess, but through God. The boy&#x27;s nakedness further implies the idea of the presence of God, contrasting the youth with the heavily-armoured giant. David is presented uncircumcised, which is customary for male nudes in Italian Renaissance art.

== The biblical text ==
The story of David and Goliath comes from 1 Samuel 17. The Israelites are at war with the Philistines, whose champion – Goliath – repeatedly offers to meet the Israelites&#x27; best warrior in single combat to decide the whole battle. None of the trained Israelite soldiers is brave enough to fight the giant Goliath, until David – a shepherd boy who is too young to be a soldier – accepts the challenge. Saul, the Israelite leader, offers David armour and weapons, but the boy is untrained and refuses them. Instead, he goes out with his sling, and confronts the enemy. He hits Goliath in the head with a stone, knocking the giant down, and then grabs Goliath&#x27;s sword and cuts off his head. The Philistines withdraw as agreed and the Israelites are saved. David&#x27;s special strength comes from God, and the story illustrates the triumph of good over evil.

== History ==
According to one theory, it was commissioned by the Medici family in the 1430s to be placed in the center of the courtyard of the old Medici Palace. Alternatively it may have been made for that position in the new Palazzo Medici, where it was placed later, which would place the commission in the mid-1440s or even later. The statue is only recorded there by 1469. The Medici family were exiled from Florence in 1494, and the statue was moved to the courtyard of the Palazzo della Signoria along with Donatello&#x27;s bronze &quot;Judith&quot;, which had an equal topic and potent symbolic meaning. The &quot;David&quot; lost its place (and its column) in the middle of the courtyard to a fountain in the 1450s and was installed in a niche flanking the doorway near the stairs, where the &quot;Judith&quot; stood since the early 1500s.

In the 17th century the &quot;David&quot; was moved to the Palazzo Pitti, then to the Uffizi in 1777, and then finally, in 1865, to the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, where it remains today.

According to Vasari, the statue stood on a column designed by Desiderio da Settignano in the middle of the courtyard of the old Palazzo Medici; an inscription seems to have explained the statue&#x27;s significance as a political monument. A quattrocento manuscript containing the text of the inscription is probably an earlier reference to the statue; unfortunately the manuscript is not dated. Although a political meaning for the statue is widely accepted, what that meaning is has been a matter of considerable debate among scholars.

=== Reception ===

There are no indications of contemporary responses to the &quot;David.&quot; However, the fact that the statue was placed in the main government building of the Republic of Florence in the 1490s indicates that it was not viewed as controversial. In the early 16th century, the Herald of the Signoria mentioned the sculpture in a way that suggested there was something unsettling about it: &quot;The David in the courtyard is not a perfect figure because its right leg is tasteless.&quot; By mid-century Vasari was describing the statue as so naturalistic that it must have been cast from a live model. However, among 20th- and 21st-century art historians there has been considerable controversy about how to interpret it.

Goliath&#x27;s beard curls around David&#x27;s sandaled foot, as if the young hero is running his toes through his dead opponent&#x27;s hair. Goliath is wearing a winged helmet. David&#x27;s right foot stands firmly on the short right wing, while the left wing, considerably longer, extends up his right leg to his groin.

The figure has been interpreted in a variety of ways. One has been to suggest that Donatello was homosexual and that he was expressing that sexual attitude through this statue. A second is to suggest that the work refers to homosocial values in Florentine society without expressing Donatello&#x27;s personal tendencies. A third interpretation is that &quot;David&quot; represents Donatello&#x27;s effort to create a unique version of the male nude, to exercise artistic licence rather than copy the classical models that had thus far been the sources for the depiction of the male nude in Renaissance art.

===Identification===

The traditional identification of the figure was questioned in 1939 by , with an interpretation leaning toward ancient mythology, the hero&#x27;s helmet especially suggesting Hermes or Mercury. A number of scholars since have followed Lányi, sometimes referring to the statue as &quot;David-Mercury&quot;. If the figure were indeed meant to represent Mercury, it may be supposed that he stands atop the head of the vanquished giant Argus Panoptes. However, all quattrocento references to the statue identify it as David.
===Restoration===
The statue underwent restoration from June 2007 to November 2008. This was the first time the statue had ever been restored, but concerns about layers of &quot;mineralised waxings&quot; on the surface of the bronze led to the 18-month intervention. The statue was scraped with scalpels (on the non-gilded areas) and lasered (on the gilded areas) to remove surface build-up.

=== Copies and influence ===

David continued to be a subject of great interest for Italian patrons and artists. Later representations of the biblical hero include 
* Desiderio da Settignano, &quot;Martelli David&quot;, marble, c. 1462–64, finished by someone else, possibly by Bertoldo di Giovanni(?), c. 1465–70, Washington, National Gallery of Art
* Verrocchio&#x27;s, partly gilded bronze, c. 1468–70, Bargello, Florence
* Antonio del Pollaiuolo, panel painting, c. 1470, Gemäldegalerie, Berlin
* Bartolomeo Bellano, ormolu bronzetto, 1470s, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York
* Domenico Ghirlandaio, fresco, c. 1485, S. Maria Novella, Florence
* Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, marble, 1501–1504, Accademia, Florence
* Bernini&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, marble, 1623–24, Galleria Borghese, Rome. 
Following the model of Donatello&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; for other figures are for example Pollaiuolo&#x27;s bronzetto of &quot;Hercules at Rest&quot; (c. 1480), two figures of Andrea del Castagno&#x27;s cycle of &quot;Illustrous Men and Women&quot; from the Villa Carducci at Legnaia (detached frescoes, 1448–49, Uffizi, Florence). 
Pontormo and Francesco da Sangallo are among the artists who made sketches of the bronze &quot;David&quot;, that have been preserved (c. 1514 and 1455 resp., Uffizi).

Plaster casts taken from original sculptures that were otherwise unobtainable, were bought by museums and other collections; some had their own plaster workshops, like the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. Among the 7000 casts the workshop produced since 1819 is also a copy of the bronze &quot;David&quot;, that was taken from the original some time before 1880, and served itself again for over a dozen plaster copies in the last century alone.

The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has also a &quot;David&quot; in their huge plaster collection, although with a broken sword. Full-size white marble copies are to be found in the Temperate House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Surrey (near London), and at the Slater Museum at the Norwich Free Academy in Norwich, Connecticut, United States.

<doc id="293418" wikidata="Q1062934" url="?curid=293418" title="Character (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a character is (most commonly) a special kind of function from a group to a field (such as the complex numbers). There are at least two distinct, but overlapping meanings. Other uses of the word &quot;character&quot; are almost always qualified.

==Multiplicative character==
A multiplicative character (or linear character, or simply character) on a group &quot;G&quot; is a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the multiplicative group of a field , usually the field of complex numbers. If &quot;G&quot; is any group, then the set Ch(&quot;G&quot;) of these morphisms forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication.

This group is referred to as the character group of &quot;G&quot;. Sometimes only &quot;unitary&quot; characters are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle); other such homomorphisms are then called &quot;quasi-characters&quot;. Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition.

Multiplicative characters are linearly independent, i.e. if formula_1 are different characters on a group &quot;G&quot; then from formula_2 it follows that formula_3.

==Character of a representation==

The character formula_4 of a representation formula_5 of a group &quot;G&quot; on a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot; is the trace of the representation formula_6 , i.e. 

:formula_7 for formula_8

In general, the trace is not a group homomorphism, nor does the set of traces form a group. The characters of one-dimensional representations are identical to one-dimensional representations, so the above notion of multiplicative character can be seen as a special case of higher-dimensional characters. The study of representations using characters is called &quot;character theory&quot; and one-dimensional characters are also called &quot;linear characters&quot; within this context.

===Alternative definition===
If restricted to finite abelian group with formula_9 representation in formula_10 (i.e. formula_11), the following alternative definition would be equivalent to the above (For abelian groups, every matrix representation decomposes into a direct sum of formula_9 representations. For non-abelian groups, the original definition would be more general than this one):

A character formula_13 of group formula_14 is a group homomorphism formula_15 i.e. formula_16 for all formula_17

If formula_18 is a finite abelian group, the characters play the role of harmonics. For infinite abelian groups, the above would be replaced by formula_19 where formula_20 is the circle group.

<doc id="293421" wikidata="Q4854637" url="?curid=293421" title="Banditti of the Plains">
<text>Banditti of the Plains is a book written by Asa Mercer about the 1889 to 1893 Johnson County War in Wyoming, United States, where wealthy cattle ranchers intent on controlling limited resources enlisted hired guns to fight smaller settlers and homesteaders.

==Publication history==
The title of the book was taken from a now-forgotten Western titled &quot;The Banditti of the Range&quot;.

It is written from the perspective of Mercer, who had come to Wyoming to edit the &quot;North West Live Stock Journal&quot;, the official publication of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA), which represented the monied interests intent on controlling the cattle industry. As the events of the range wars unfolded, Mercer came to sympathize with the homesteaders and turned against the WSGA. The book reflects his pro-settler view and is an important document of the events.

The first edition of the book is one of the rarities of western Americana. Immediately after it was printed, the Wyoming cattlemen objected and sued. The court ordered it destroyed. While the books were in the court&#x27;s custody, a number were stolen and smuggled to Denver and later bound. For many years, the Wyoming Stockgrowers&#x27; Association, their sympathizers, and their descendants destroyed every copy they came across. Surviving copies are rare, and in 2016 copies were listed for prices between $1,250 and $6000. The second edition simply disappeared somewhere between Denver, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the Wyoming Stock Growers Association was rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped.

Mercer saw his printing press in Cheyenne burned down; he was harassed, arrested, jailed and had the plates of his book destroyed. His writings were seized in the mails as obscenity; his business was ruined.

Mercer&#x27;s main views of the Johnson County War were ultimately proved true, and never again did the cattle barons attempt to invade Wyoming.

Thanks to republication in 1954 by the University of Oklahoma Press, with a foreword by William H. Kittrell, the first edition text is now readily available, having appeared in paperback in 1976.

==&quot;Pawn Stars&quot; appearance==
In &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;, a November 12, 2012, episode of the reality television series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, a visitor to the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas brought in an 1884 .45 Colt revolver that belonged to Sheriff Fred Coats, which was accompanied by a copy of &quot;Banditti of the Plains&quot;. The seller pointed out that Page 140 of the book mentions that Coats was one of three men involved in an assault during the Wyoming Range Wars.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, a *-algebra (or involutive algebra; read as &quot;star-algebra&quot;) is a mathematical structure consisting of two involutive rings and , where is commutative and has the structure of an associative algebra over . Involutive algebras generalize the idea of a number system equipped with conjugation, for example the complex numbers and complex conjugation, matrices over the complex numbers and conjugate transpose, and linear operators over a Hilbert space and Hermitian adjoints.
However, it may happen that an algebra admits no involution.
== Definitions ==

===*-ring===

In mathematics, a *-ring is a ring with a map that is an antiautomorphism and an involution.

More precisely, is required to satisfy the following properties: 
* 
* 
for all in .

This is also called an involutive ring, involutory ring, and ring with involution. The third axiom is implied by the second and fourth axioms, making it redundant.

Elements such that are called &quot;self-adjoint&quot;.

Archetypical examples of a *-ring are fields of complex numbers and algebraic numbers with complex conjugation as the involution. One can define a sesquilinear form over any *-ring.

Also, one can define *-versions of algebraic objects, such as ideal and subring, with the requirement to be *-invariant: and so on.

&amp;ast;-rings are unrelated to star semirings in the theory of computation.

===*-algebra===
A *-algebra is a *-ring, with involution * that is an associative algebra over a commutative *-ring with involution , such that .

The base *-ring is often the complex numbers (with acting as complex conjugation).

It follows from the axioms that * on is conjugate-linear in , meaning
for .

A *-homomorphism is an algebra homomorphism that is compatible with the involutions of and , i.e.,
* for all in .

===Philosophy of the *-operation===
The *-operation on a *-ring is analogous to complex conjugation on the complex numbers. The *-operation on a *-algebra is analogous to taking adjoints in complex matrix algebras.

===Notation===
The * involution is a unary operation written with a postfixed star glyph centered above or near the mean line:
: , or 
: (TeX: codice_1),
but not as &quot;&quot;; see the asterisk article for details.

==Examples==
* Any commutative ring becomes a *-ring with the trivial (identical) involution. 
* The most familiar example of a *-ring and a *-algebra over reals is the field of complex numbers where * is just complex conjugation.
* More generally, a field extension made by adjunction of a square root (such as the imaginary unit ) is a *-algebra over the original field, considered as a trivially-*-ring. The * flips the sign of that square root.
* A quadratic integer ring (for some ) is a commutative *-ring with the * defined in the similar way; quadratic fields are *-algebras over appropriate quadratic integer rings.
* Quaternions, split-complex numbers, dual numbers, and possibly other hypercomplex number systems form *-rings (with their built-in conjugation operation) and *-algebras over reals (where * is trivial). None of the three is a complex algebra.
* Hurwitz quaternions form a non-commutative *-ring with the quaternion conjugation.
* The matrix algebra of matrices over R with * given by the transposition.
* The matrix algebra of matrices over C with * given by the conjugate transpose.
* Its generalization, the Hermitian adjoint in the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space also defines a *-algebra.
* The polynomial ring over a commutative trivially-*-ring is a *-algebra over with .
* If is simultaneously a *-ring, an algebra over a ring (commutative), and , then is a *-algebra over (where * is trivial).
** As a partial case, any *-ring is a *-algebra over integers.
* Any commutative *-ring is a *-algebra over itself and, more generally, over any its *-subring.
* For a commutative *-ring , its quotient by any its *-ideal is a *-algebra over .
** For example, any commutative trivially-*-ring is a *-algebra over its dual numbers ring, a *-ring with &quot;non-trivial&quot; *, because the quotient by makes the original ring.
** The same about a commutative ring and its polynomial ring : the quotient by restores .
* In Hecke algebra, an involution is important to the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial.
* The endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve becomes a *-algebra over the integers, where the involution is given by taking the dual isogeny. A similar construction works for abelian varieties with a polarization, in which case it is called the Rosati involution (see Milne&#x27;s lecture notes on abelian varieties).
Involutive Hopf algebras are important examples of *-algebras (with the additional structure of a compatible comultiplication); the most familiar example being:
* The group Hopf algebra: a group ring, with involution given by .

==Non-Example==

Not every algebra admits an involution:

Regard the 2×2 matrices over the complex numbers. Consider the following subalgebra:
formula_1

Any nontrivial antiautomorphism necessarily has the form:
formula_2
for any complex number formula_3.

It follows that any nontrivial antiautomorphism fails to be involutive:
formula_4

Concluding that the subalgebra admits no involution.

==Additional structures==
Many properties of the transpose hold for general *-algebras:
* The Hermitian elements form a Jordan algebra;
* The skew Hermitian elements form a Lie algebra;
* If 2 is invertible in the *-ring, then the operators and are orthogonal idempotents, called &quot;symmetrizing&quot; and &quot;anti-symmetrizing&quot;, so the algebra decomposes as a direct sum of modules (vector spaces if the *-ring is a field) of symmetric and anti-symmetric (Hermitian and skew Hermitian) elements. These spaces do not, generally, form associative algebras, because the idempotents are operators, not elements of the algebra.

===Skew structures===
Given a *-ring, there is also the map .
It does not define a *-ring structure (unless the characteristic is 2, in which case −* is identical to the original *), as , neither is it antimultiplicative, but it satisfies the other axioms (linear, involution) and hence is quite similar to *-algebra where .

Elements fixed by this map (i.e., such that ) are called &quot;skew Hermitian&quot;.

For the complex numbers with complex conjugation, the real numbers are the Hermitian elements, and the imaginary numbers are the skew Hermitian.

<text>Isaac Murphy (October 16, 1799 or 1802 – September 8, 1882) was a native of Pennsylvania, a teacher and lawyer who moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas with his wife and child in 1834. He continued to teach and also became active in politics. Murphy is best known as the only delegate to have repeatedly voted against secession at the second Arkansas Secession Convention in 1861.

Having served in local offices and the State House, Murphy was elected as governor in a special election after the US Army occupied Arkansas in 1863 under President Abraham Lincoln. He is considered the first Reconstruction governor of Arkansas, as he was allowed to stay in office after the Reconstruction Acts were passed by Congress in 1867. Murphy was known for his fiscal restraint and a conciliatory attitude toward former Confederates.

==Early life and education==
Murphy was born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a wealthy paper manufacturer and his wife. He was educated locally and at Washington College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) in Washington, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the bar in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on April 29, 1825.

In 1830, Murphy moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, where he taught school. There he met and wed Angelina Lockhart on July 31, 1830. Her father so opposed the marriage when he learned that Murphy favored the abolition of slavery that he disinherited Angelina.

In 1834, the Murphys, with their newborn daughter, moved west to Fayetteville in the Arkansas Territory. In Fayetteville, Murphy established himself as a school teacher, surveyor, and lawyer. The territory was admitted as a state in 1836.

==Career==
Murphy became active in politics, elected as the first county treasurer of Washington County in 1836, and serving for two years. He was appointed as a master in chancery in 1841. From 1837 to 1838, Murphy ran the original government land lines for Franklin County, Arkansas.

On November 30, 1844, the noted Indian Missionary Cephas Washburn, along with Murphy and other leaders, secured a charter for a college known as the Far West Seminary. Murphy taught both whites and Indians at the seminary, intended for young men. Murphy taught here until the building was destroyed by fire on February 17, 1845, putting him in debt, as he had invested in the school.

In 1846 Murphy was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives for Washington County, and re-elected in 1848. With assignment to the Banking Committee, he attempted to introduce reforms but was stymied by the powerful political cabal known as &quot;The Family&quot;.

Murphy ran into financial difficulties about 1849 and left for California to seek wealth in the California Gold Rush. Among the many who did not succeed, he returned to Arkansas in 1854 with nothing to show for his efforts.

Upon his return he moved to Huntsville in Madison County, Arkansas. His daughter Mrs. Mary Lowe Pierson of Washington County had been hired to teach at a new female seminary in Huntsville, the Pleasant View Female Seminary. Murphy and two more daughters were hired to assist in its operations.

In 1856, Murphy was elected to the State Senate representing Madison and Benton counties, to succeed the late senator John Berry. Murphy&#x27;s eldest daughter Malilla married James R. Berry, one of the senator&#x27;s sons. Northwest Arkansas was a Unionist stronghold in the years before the Civil War.

==American Civil War==

===Secession convention===
When the secession crisis swept the State in February 1861, Murphy was elected by 85% on a Unionist platform to represent Madison County at the Secession Convention; his county voted to remain in the Union. When Fort Sumter, South Carolina, was fired on and President Abraham Lincoln called for troops from Arkansas, the delegates of the Secession Convention were recalled, before the planned statewide referendum on secession could be held. The convention voted to take Arkansas out of the Union, but Murphy and four other delegates opposed this step. The convention chair called on the five to switch their votes. All four of the other &quot;nay&quot; delegates changed their votes, but Murphy refused. Initially his position was popular in Huntsville, but as the war went on, Confederate sentiment increased.

===Governorship===
As war broke out, Murphy fled his home in Huntsville; he spent much of the war traveling with the Union army in northwestern Arkansas. Following the fall of the capital city of Little Rock to the Union in 1863, Arkansas&#x27; Confederate government, led by Governor Harris Flanagin, went into exile.

In a special election, held with the approval of President Lincoln, Isaac Murphy was elected as governor of Arkansas in 1863.

==Reconstruction era==
Murphy worked to try to heal the war wounds in Arkansas, even as the war continued in the southern parts of the state. He worked for balance and said publicly that &quot;We have all done wrong.&quot; The 4th of July celebrations in Little Rock were led by pro-Union speakers who refrained from anti-Southern speeches or actions.

After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination and the actions of numerous state legislatures to control freedmen and limit their rights, Republicans in Congress began advocating stricter Reconstruction for the former Confederate states. In 1866, pro-Confederate legislators won majorities in several southern states. That same year, white violence against former slaves broke out in several states.

In response, Republicans in Congress pushed through the 14th Amendment, granting full citizenship, rights and due process to freedmen, and the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. The rebel states were divided into military districts, to be controlled by US Army forces until the states passed new state constitutions protecting the civil rights of former slaves and accepting the 14th Amendment. Murphy was allowed to stay in office, but he was criticized by both sides.

When Murphy left office, his administration had a budget surplus. It had started with no funds. With no initiatives passed by the Reconstruction legislature to provide for public welfare and education, as well as investment in infrastructure, this surplus was diverted to public projects.

==Death and legacy==
Murphy returned to Huntsville and took up farming and practicing law. He lived a quiet life with his family. On September 8, 1882, Murphy died unexpectedly at his home. He is buried in Huntsville Cemetery in Huntsville.

In 1974, historian John I. Smith published several articles about what he called the Huntsville Massacre, an execution of prisoners of war in 1862. He said that Murphy had been implicated in those deaths. A memorial to those murdered in Huntsville was erected, dedicated on September 30, 2006.

<doc id="293432" wikidata="Q2719767" url="?curid=293432" title="Antilinear map">
<text>In mathematics, a function formula_1 between two complex vector spaces is said to be antilinear or conjugate-linear if 
formula_2
hold for all vectors formula_3 and every complex number formula_4 where formula_5 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_6 

Antilinear maps stand in contrast to linear maps, which are additive maps that are homogeneous rather than conjugate homogeneous. If the vector spaces are real then antilinearity is the same as linearity.

Antilinear maps occur in quantum mechanics in the study of time reversal and in spinor calculus, where it is customary to replace the bars over the basis vectors and the components of geometric objects by dots put above the indices. Scalar-valued antilinear maps often arise when dealing with complex inner products and Hilbert spaces. 

== Definitions and characterizations ==

A function is called or if it is additive and conjugate homogeneous. An on a vector space formula_7 is a scalar-valued antilinear map. 

A function formula_8 is called if
formula_9
while it is called if 
formula_10 
In contrast, a linear map is a function that is additive and homogeneous, where formula_8 is called if
formula_12 

An antilinear map formula_1 may be equivalently described in terms of the linear map formula_14 from formula_7 to the complex conjugate vector space formula_16

=== Examples ===

==== Anti-linear dual map ====

Given a complex vector space formula_7 of rank 1, we can construct an anti-linear dual map which is an anti-linear map formula_18 sending an element formula_19 for formula_20 to formula_21 for some fixed real numbers formula_22 We can extend this to any finite dimensional complex vector space, where if we write out the standard basis formula_23 and each standard basis element as formula_24 then an anti-linear complex map to formula_25 will be of the form formula_26 for formula_27

==== Isomorphism of anti-linear dual with real dual ====

The anti-linear dualpg 36 of a complex vector space formula_7 formula_29 is a special example because it is isomorphic to the real dual of the underlying real vector space of formula_30 formula_31 This is given by the map sending an anti-linear map formula_32to formula_33 In the other direction, there is the inverse map sending a real dual vector formula_34 to formula_35 giving the desired map.

== Properties ==

The composite of two antilinear maps is a linear map. The class of semilinear maps generalizes the class of antilinear maps.

== Anti-dual space ==

The vector space of all antilinear forms on a vector space formula_36 is called the of formula_37 If formula_36 is a topological vector space, then the vector space of all antilinear functionals on formula_39 denoted by formula_40 is called the or simply the of formula_36 if no confusion can arise. 

When formula_42 is a normed space then the canonical norm on the (continuous) anti-dual space formula_40 denoted by formula_44 is defined by using this same equation: 
formula_45 

This formula is identical to the formula for the on the continuous dual space formula_46 of formula_39 which is defined by
formula_48 

Canonical isometry between the dual and anti-dual

The complex conjugate formula_49 of a functional formula_8 is defined by sending formula_51 to formula_52 It satisfies 
formula_53
for every formula_54 and every formula_55 
This says exactly that the canonical antilinear bijection defined by
formula_56 
as well as its inverse formula_57 are antilinear isometries and consequently also homeomorphisms. 

If formula_58 then formula_59 and this canonical map formula_60 reduces down to the identity map.

Inner product spaces

If formula_36 is an inner product space then both the canonical norm on formula_46 and on formula_63 satisfies the parallelogram law, which means that the polarization identity can be used to define a and also on formula_64 which this article will denote by the notations 
formula_65 
where this inner product makes formula_46 and formula_63 into Hilbert spaces. 
The inner products formula_68 and formula_69 are antilinear in their second arguments. Moreover, the canonical norm induced by this inner product (that is, the norm defined by formula_70) is consistent with the dual norm (that is, as defined above by the supremum over the unit ball); explicitly, this means that the following holds for every formula_71
formula_72 

If formula_36 is an inner product space then the inner products on the dual space formula_46 and the anti-dual space formula_40 denoted respectively by formula_76 and formula_77 are related byformula_78
and
formula_79

<text>A series finale is the final installment of an episodic entertainment series, most often a television series. It may also refer to a final theatrical sequel, the last part of a television miniseries, the last installment of a literary series, or any final episode.

==Origins in television==
Most early television series consisted of stand-alone episodes rather than continuing story arcs, so there was little reason to provide closure at the end of their runs. Early comedy series that had special finale episodes include &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; in September 1960, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; in June 1963, &quot;Hank&quot; in April 1966, and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; in June 1966. One of the few dramatic series to have a planned finale during this period was &quot;Route 66&quot;, which concluded in March 1964 with a two-part episode in which the pair of philosophical drifters ended their journey across America and then went their separate ways.

Considered to be &quot;the series finale that invented the modern-day series finale,&quot; the August 1967 final episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Judgment: Part 2&quot;, attracted a 72% audience share when broadcast. This remained the highest viewership percentage in U.S. television history until the 1977 finale of the TV mini-series &quot;Roots&quot; (on the same network) and later the 1980 resolution episode of the internationally prominent &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; cliffhanger of CBS&#x27; &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Notable television series finales==

===Most-watched American series finales===
The most watched series finale in U.S. television history remains the 1983 finale of the CBS war/medical dramedy &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, titled &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;. Viewed by 105.9 million viewers and drawing 77% of those watching televisions at the time, the finale of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; held the record for most watched telecast of all-time for decades until 2010&#x27;s Super Bowl XLIV edged it out with 106 million viewers, which coincidentally also aired on CBS. However, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;&#x27;s final episode remains the all-time most-watched U.S. television episode (and so far, the only single television episode in U.S. history to be watched by at least 100 million viewers for a single telecast).

The second-most-watched series finale in U.S. television history was the 1993 finale of the NBC comedy &quot;Cheers&quot;, titled &quot;One for the Road&quot;. &quot;One for the Road&quot; was watched by between 80.4 million and 93.5 million viewers (estimates vary) while drawing 64% of TVs turned on at the time. To date, &quot;One for the Road&quot; remains the most watched U.S. TV series finale following the rise of cable television, and in terms of sheer viewership numbers for non-sports programming, sits second only to the aforementioned finale of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

With only slightly fewer viewers than the series finale of &quot;Cheers&quot; was the finale of its one-time follow-up on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Must See TV&quot; Thursday night line-up, the absurdist NBC comedy &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The third most-watched U.S. TV series finale in television history, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s controversial 1998 episode &quot;The Finale&quot; was watched by 76.3 million people, drawing 67% of all televisions turned on at the time – as the &quot;New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;grazing Super Bowl country&quot; in terms of viewership.

With the shift away from network television viewing toward cable television viewing (and later, internet use) that occurred during the decade between the finales of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1983) and &quot;Cheers&quot; (1993) – and continued unabated until and beyond the finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1998) – it remains debatable which of these three &quot;event&quot; series finales accomplished the most impressive viewership numbers. Moreover, a large gap in viewership numbers exists between the Super Bowl-sized audiences of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; finales, and the fourth and fifth most watched series finales in television history – respectively, those of the comedy &quot;Friends&quot; (2004, NBC, 52.5 million viewers) and the detective procedural &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1988, CBS, 50.7 million viewers). The &quot;Friends&quot; finale&#x27;s (&quot;The Last One&quot;) viewership numbers dwarf those of all finales since the start of the new millennium and seem particularly impressive in light of the increased media options since the 1990s &quot;event&quot; finales of &quot;Cheers&quot; (1993) and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1998).

In Britain, the most-acclaimed series finale of sitcoms was from &quot;Blackadder&quot;. In 1989, the Britcom, starring Rowan Atkinson as a Blackadder in 1917 WW1, goes &quot;over the top&quot; with his regiment, leaving their fate unknown as fade to a field of poppies. The finale was praised as a &quot;perfect end-of-show finale&quot;.

=== Reception ===

No matter how critically lauded during their respective runs, relatively few popular television series finales end up pleasing critics and audiences universally, or escaping controversy. Prominent examples of controversial series finales include the final episodes of the comedies &quot;Roseanne&quot; (&quot;Into That Good Night&quot;, 1997), &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (&quot;The Finale&quot;, 1998), &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (&quot;Last Forever&quot;, 2014), and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (&quot;Of Course He&#x27;s Dead&quot;, 2015), and those of the dramas The Prisoner (Fall Out ,1968) , &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (&quot;The Iron Throne&quot;, 2019), &quot;True Blood&quot; (&quot;Thank You&quot;, 2014), and &quot;Dexter&quot; (&quot;Remember the Monsters?&quot;, 2013). The final episodes of &quot;Dexter&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, in particular, triggerred massive backlash from both fans and critics upon airing, and are often regarded as the worst finales in recent memory.

Some series endings have proved divisive among viewers immediately on airing, leading to extensive discussions online, but ended up being generally lauded by critics. Notable examples of this trend are the finales of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (&quot;Made in America&quot;, 2007), &quot;The Wire&quot; (&quot;-30-&quot;, 2008), and &quot;Lost&quot; (&quot;The End&quot;, 2010). For example, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;&#x27; finale caused millions of viewers to temporarily believe they had lost cable service due to an abrupt blackout. All three episodes were also nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Writing, with &quot;The Sopranos&quot;&#x27; finale winning.

Several television series have, however, managed to produce final episodes that lived up to both critics&#x27; and audiences&#x27; expectations. Examples include the twist endings that concluded both the &quot;Newhart&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; finales, the mixture of comedy and resonance that wrapped up &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; and the redemption arc that concluded &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

Several more series finales have received unanimous critical and popular acclaim, and are often considered as benchmarks for great TV endings. Recent examples include the finales of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; (&quot;Felina&quot;, 2013), &quot;Community&quot; (&quot;Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television&quot;, 2015), &quot;The Good Place&quot; (&quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Ready&quot;, 2020), &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (&quot;Saul Gone&quot;, 2022), and &quot;Succession&quot; (&quot;With Open Eyes&quot;, 2023).

Examples of universally acclaimed finales from earlier in the millennium include those of Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot; (&quot;Interview&quot;, 2002), &quot;The Shield&quot; (&quot;Family Meeting&quot;, 2008), and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (&quot;Everyone&#x27;s Waiting&quot;, 2005), the last of which &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked at No. 22 on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Episodes of All Time&quot;.

==Plot devices==

Television series finales frequently feature fundamental deviations from the central plot line, such as the resolution of a central mystery or problem, (e.g. &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;) the separation or return of a major character (e.g. &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;) or an event signifying the end of an era, such as a change to primary setting for the series (e.g. &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Liv and Maddie&quot;)

Series finales will sometimes include clips or characters from the series&#x27; past (e.g. &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Suits&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;), and the ending moments of the episode often take place in the show&#x27;s primary setting.

==Premature series finales==
In some cases, a TV series finale proves premature, as was the case with &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, and &quot;Arrested Development&quot; to name but a few. Some shows that have constantly been in danger of cancellation wrote every season finale with the idea that the episode would serve as a quality series finale if the network decided not to bring it back; in recent years from NBC&#x27;s Thursday night comedy lineup, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; used this formula for the season finales for Seasons 3–6, before getting a renewal for a seventh and final season where the series finale was planned in advance, and &quot;Community&quot; wrote its fifth-season finale with the notion that whether the show found new life elsewhere or not, it would definitely not be returning to the network (while NBC did indeed cancel the show, it was renewed for a sixth season by Yahoo! Screen, where the season, and sure enough, series finale was once again scripted as a potential last episode ever; the final image is that of text reading &quot;#andamovie&quot;, a reference to the show&#x27;s recurring catchphrase &quot;six seasons and a movie&quot;). The series finale of &quot;Dr. Ken&quot;, a fictionalized sitcom based on the life of doctor-turned-actor Ken Jeong, features the title character trying out for a fictional version of &quot;Community&quot; (Jeong was a cast member in real life).

The medical comedy &quot;Scrubs&quot; aired its two-part finale episode billed simply as a &quot;My Finale&quot; in May 2009 as the show&#x27;s renewal or cancellation had not been decided as of its airing, and so it was not known whether the episode would conclude just the season or the entire series; &quot;Scrubs&quot; would eventually be renewed for one additional season, which became a de facto spin-off series titled &quot;Scrubs: Med School&quot;.

The cartoon &quot;Futurama&quot; has had four designated series finales, due to the recurringly uncertain future of the series. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Hands Are Idle Playthings&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, and &quot;Meanwhile&quot; have all been written to serve as a final episode for the show.

The series &quot;American Dad!&quot; had two possible finales, the season premiere of the eighth season, &quot;Hot Water&quot; was written due to the uncertainty from the staff of the show getting picked up. The episode of Season 19 was also intended as a series finale, as revealed by showrunner and executive producer Matt Weitzman.

The series finale of &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot; (itself an epilogue to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;) was unintentionally fitting: stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were about to divorce and end the show, a fact that the show&#x27;s guest star for what would be the final program, Edie Adams, did not know when she chose the song she would sing on the program. Prophetically, the song was named &quot;That&#x27;s All.&quot; The series also ended with Lucy and Ricky making up and kissing, while in reality Ball and Arnaz would not (the two would eventually reconcile later in life, although both would go on to marry other people). The last produced half-hour episode was titled &quot;The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue&quot; which included real-life kids Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. in the final scene where Ricky unveils what he thinks is a Revolutionary War statue only to find out that it is Lucy.
The aforementioned &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; had a premature series finale, as well. At the end of the seventh season, protagonist Thomas Magnum was to be killed off, which was intended to end the series. The final episode of the season, &quot;Limbo&quot;, after seeing Magnum wander around as a ghost for nearly the entire run-time, closes with him appearing to walk off into heaven. However, following outcry from fans, who demanded a more satisfactory conclusion, an eighth, final season was produced, to bring Magnum &quot;back to life&quot;, and to round the series off. The mystery of whether Higgins was Robin Masters, or not, was a highly anticipated series finale reveal. The mystery still has yet to be revealed. A number of other episodes also make reference to supernatural occurrences and the seeming existence of ghosts.

The Showtime series &quot;Californication&quot; was designed from start to make any season finale work as a series finale, in case of early cancelling the show. It is seen most primarily at the end of the first and fourth season.

After its fifth season, the sitcom &quot;Reba&quot; was in danger of being cancelled as a result of its original home, The WB, being replaced by The CW in September 2006, and the resulting uncertainty over which WB series (as well as which series from CW co-predecessor UPN) would be carried over to the new network. (&quot;Reba&quot; would be renewed by The CW for an additional season as one of the holdover WB series.) The sixth (and final) season&#x27;s finale episode was written to serve as a series finale, in which Brock and Barbara-Jean come to a reconciliation and Van and Cheyenne move back in with Reba, bringing the show to a full wrap.

A series finale may not be the last aired episode of a show, such as &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, which produced &quot;To Sirloin with Love&quot; as its series finale, though four more episodes produced before it were aired after in syndication.

Another instance of premature endings was with the Rural Purge of 1971 where networks (notably CBS) axed still-popular TV series in an effort to move to more sophisticated programming. Shows were &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

==Finales launching spin-offs==
Series finales are sometimes used as a backdoor pilot to launch spin-off series. Two well-known examples include &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;″s series finale, which launched the spin-off &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot;″s series finale, and much of its final season was used as a launching pad for &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, starring James Spader and William Shatner. &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; series finale was set up to lead into a new series with most of the remaining cast, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; transitioned more or less seamlessly into &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, the &quot;Henry Danger&quot; finale served as a pilot to &quot;Danger Force&quot; while &quot;The Fosters&quot; series finale acted as an introduction to its spin-off series &quot;Good Trouble&quot;. &quot;The Closer&quot; was spun off into a new series, &quot;Major Crimes&quot; the same night that the original ended, after star Kyra Sedgwick chose, as producer, to end the series.

The &quot;Steven Universe&quot; finale &quot;Change Your Mind&quot; served as not just a conclusion to the original series and its overarching plot, but helped pave the way for &quot;Steven Universe: The Movie&quot;, and eventually the limited epilogue series &quot;Steven Universe Future&quot;.

Some planned spin-offs that influenced series finales, however, never materialized, as in the case of the proposed &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; spin-off for Carmine that never came into fruition, or &quot;Posse Impossible&quot;, a proposed spin-off of &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot; that, instead of getting its own show, aired as an interstitial segment on &quot;CB Bears&quot;. &quot;Arrow&quot; used its penultimate episode of its final season, &quot;Green Arrow &amp; The Canaries&quot;&quot;,&quot; as a backdoor pilot for a potential spin-off series based on the characters Mia Smoak, Laurel Lance and Dinah Drake, however, the series was ultimately not picked up.

<doc id="293437" wikidata="Q3181701" url="?curid=293437" title="Guifeng Zongmi">
<text>Guifeng Zongmi () (780–1 February 841) was a Tang dynasty Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar who is considered a patriarch of both the Huayan school and Chan Buddhism. Zongmi wrote a number of works on several Mahayana Sutras, Chan and Huayan, and he also discussed Taoism and Confucianism. His works are a major source for studying the various Chan schools of the Tang.

Zongmi was deeply interested in both the practical and doctrinal aspects of Mahayana Buddhism, especially the teachings of the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; and the &quot;Mahayana Awakening of Faith&quot;. Zongmi&#x27;s work is concerned with harmonizing the various Chan teachings (especially the doctrines of sudden awakening and original enlightenment) with other Chinese Buddhist traditions, especially Huayan, though he also drew on the work of Tiantai Zhiyi in his ritual works. His philosophy attempts to create a comprehensive worldview that includes and sublimates all Buddhist and non-buddhist teachings of his time into a single harmonious spiritual vision.

==Biography==

===Early years (780–810)===
Zongmi was born in 780 into the powerful and influential He () family in what is now central Sichuan. In his early years, he studied the Chinese classics, hoping for a career in the provincial government. When he was seventeen or eighteen, Zongmi lost his father and took up Buddhist studies. In an 811 letter to Chengguan, he wrote that for three years he &quot;gave up eating meat, examined [Buddhist] scriptures and treatises, became familiar with the virtues of meditation and sought out the acquaintance of noted monks.&quot;

At the age of twenty-two, he returned to the Confucian classics and deepened his understanding, studying at the Yixueyuan () Confucian Academy in Suizhou. His later writings reveal a detailed familiarity with the &quot;Analects&quot;, the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, and the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, as well as historical texts and Daoist classics such as the works of Laozi. He eventually converted to Buddhism, but Zongmi&#x27;s Confucian moral values never left him and he spent much of his career attempting to integrate Confucian ethics with Buddhism.

=== Chan (804–810) ===
At the age of twenty-four, Zongmi met the Chan master Suizhou Daoyuan () and trained in Chan for two or three years. He received Daoyuan&#x27;s seal in 807, the year he was fully ordained as a Buddhist monk. Daoyuan was part of a southern Chan tradition called the Jingzhong school, which was based in Chengdu, Sichuan. This lineage goes back to the Korean prince and Chan master Kim Hwasang (c. 684–762, also known as Jingzhong Wuxiang, 浄衆無相 ), and to his student Shenhui (not to be confused with the earlier Heze Shenhui). According to Broughton, Daoyuan&#x27;s teacher, Yizhou Nanyin, the abbot of Shengshou Monastery, likely trained with Heze Shenhui and this other Shenhui of Sichuan.

In his autobiographical summary, Zongmi recounts how after a sutra chanting service, he encountered a copy of the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;. According to Gregory, &quot;after only reading two or three pages, he had an awakening, an experience whose intensity so overwhelmed him that he found himself spontaneously dancing for joy.&quot; Zongmi would later write: &quot;at one word [from Daoyuan] my mind-ground opened thoroughly, and with one scroll [of the Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment] its meaning was as clear and bright as the heavens.&quot;

Zongmi&#x27;s sudden awakening during this period had a profound impact upon his subsequent scholarly career. He spent the next several years studying the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; and its commentaries extensively. He propounded the necessity of scriptural studies in Chan, and was highly critical of what he saw as the antinomianism of the Hongzhou lineage derived from Mazu Daoyi (709–788), which practiced &quot;entrusting oneself to act freely according to the nature of one&#x27;s feelings&quot;.

===Huayan (810–816)===
In 810, at the age of thirty, Zongmi met Lingfeng (), a disciple of the preeminent Buddhist scholar and Huayan exegete Chengguan (, 738–839). Lingfeng gave Zongmi a copy of Chengguan&#x27;s commentary and sub-commentary on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;. The two texts were to have a profound impact on Zongmi. He studied these texts and the sūtra with great intensity, declaring later that due to his assiduous efforts, finally &quot;all remaining doubts were completely washed away.&quot; In 812 Zongmi travelled to the western capital, Chang&#x27;an, where he spent two years studying with Chengguan, who was not only the undisputed authority on Huayan, but was also highly knowledgeable in Chan, Tiantai, the vinaya and East Asian Mādhyamaka.

===Mount Zhongnan and scholarly work (816–828)===
In 816, Zongmi withdrew to the Zhongnan Mountains southwest of Chang&#x27;an and began his writing career, composing an annotated outline of the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, and a compilation of passages from four commentaries on the sūtra. For the next three years Zongmi continued his scholarly research, reading through the Buddhist canon, the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;, and traveling to various temples on Zhongnan. He returned Chang&#x27;an in 819 and continued his studies utilizing the extensive libraries of various monasteries in the capital city. In late 819 he completed a commentary () and subcommentary () on the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;. In early 821 he returned to Cottage Temple () beneath Gui Peak and hence became known as &quot;Guifeng Zongmi&quot;. In mid-823, he finally finished his own commentary on the text that had led to his first awakening, &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, and the culmination of a vow he had made some fifteen years earlier. For the next five years, Zongmi continued writing and studying in the Zhongnan Mountains as his fame grew.

===Capital city (828–835)===
Zongmi was summoned to the capital in 828 by Emperor Wenzong (r. 826–840) and awarded the purple robe and the honorific title &quot;Great Worthy&quot; (; bhadanta). The two years he spent in the capital were significant for Zongmi. He was now a nationally honored Buddhist master with extensive contacts among the literati of the day, such as the devout Buddhist layman and scholar-official Pei Xiu and the famed poet Bai Juyi (772–846).

During this time, Zongmi turned his considerable knowledge and intellect towards writing for a broader audience rather than the technical exegetical works he had produced for a limited readership of Buddhist specialists. His scholarly efforts became directed towards the intellectual issues of the day and much of his subsequent work was produced at the appeals of assorted literati of the day. One such works directed at the lay literati was &quot;Inquiry into the Origin of Humanity&quot;.

During this period, Zongmi also began collecting every extant Chan text in circulation with the goal of producing a Chan canon to create a new section of the Buddhist canon. This work is lost, but the title, &quot;Collected Writings on the Source of Chan&quot; () remains.

===Last years (835–841)===
It was Zongmi&#x27;s association with the great and the powerful that led to his downfall in 835 in an event known as the Sweet Dew Incident. A high official and friend of Zongmi, Li Xun, in connivance with Emperor Wenzong of Tang and his general Zheng Zhu, attempted to curb the power of the court eunuchs by killing them all. The plot failed and Li Xun fled to the Zhongnan Mountains, seeking refuge with Zongmi. Li Xun was quickly captured and executed and Zongmi was arrested and tried for treason. Impressed with Zongmi&#x27;s bravery and honesty in the face of execution, the eunuch generals spared Zongmi.

Little is known about Zongmi&#x27;s activities after this event, though he certainly would not have been welcome at court and evidence from his late commentary on the Yulanpen sutra indicates he returned home to Sichuan. Zongmi died in the zazen posture on 1 February 841 in Chang&#x27;an. According to his wishes, his body was left as food for scavengers, and was then cremated. Twelve years later he was awarded the posthumous title &quot;Samādhi-Prajñā Dhyāna Master&quot; and his remains were interred in a stupa called Blue Lotus.

=== Influence ===
Zongmi&#x27;s work continued to be studied by later Chinese Buddhists. His ecumenical vision of Chan as a single family with many branches and his account of Tang Chan lineages were influential sources for later Song dynasty Chan works. His work was also very influential on the &quot;Huayan-Chan&quot; traditions of the Khitan Liao Empire (916–1125) and the Tangut kingdom (1038–1227) of the Western Xia.

Zongmi&#x27;s ideas also remained influential during the later Song and Ming dynasties. For example, Zongmi&#x27;s views about sudden awakening, gradual cultivation, and the importance of scripture to Chan practice was influential on the later Chan figure Yongming Yanshou, whose &quot;Mind Mirror&quot; (&quot;Zongjinglu&quot;) echoes Zongmi&#x27;s views on these topics. The &quot;Mind Mirror&quot; was widely printed during the Song dynasty and widely circulated. According to Broughton, the &quot;Mind Mirror&quot; &quot;conveyed to Song Chan the most fundamental elements of Zongmi&#x27;s &quot;Chan Prolegomenon&quot;, sometimes in Zongmi&#x27;s wording or close paraphrases&quot;. Zongmi&#x27;s paradigm of &quot;sudden awakening, gradual cultivation&quot; was also promoted and defended by later Chan figures like as Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) and Hanshan Deqing (1546–1623).

Zongmi&#x27;s work was also very influential on the Song era Tiantai school. This led to the &quot;home mountain&quot; vs &quot;off mountain&quot; debates initiated by Siming Zhili who penned extensive criticisms of Zongmi&#x27;s teaching.

According to Albert Welter, during the Song era, there were to main contrasting styles of Chan, the &quot;moderate&quot; sutra based Chan (wenzi chan) of Zongmi and Yanshou, and the &quot;rhetorical&quot; Chan of the Linji school which is based on recorded sayings literature (like the &quot;Linji yulu&quot;). The rhetorical Chan held that Chan was &quot;separate transmission outside the teachings&quot; (jiaowai biechuan) and thus saw sutra based Chan as a confused and futile method and the sutras as &quot;old toilet paper that wipes away filth&quot; (&quot;Extensive Record of Yunmen&quot;).

Furthermore, Zongmi&#x27;s thought also influenced later Neo-Confucianism. For example, Zhu Xi&#x27;s (1130–1200) critique of Chan Buddhism is a but recapitulation, in Confucian terms, of Zongmi&#x27;s critique of the Hongzhou school.

The Chan of Zongmi and Yanshou was also influential on Korean Buddhism, due to its impact on Jinul&#x27;s (1158–1210) system, who also argued for the unity of Chan and the teachings. According to Broughton, Jinul&#x27;s influential &quot;Excerpts from the Separately Circulated Record of the Dharma Collection with Inserted Personal Notes&quot; &quot;is an expression of sutra-based sudden awakening gradual practice Guifeng Chan&quot;. The gradual practice is centered around the Kanhua Chan of Dahui, making Jinul&#x27;s system a mix of Zongmi Chan and Dahui&#x27;s Linji Chan. Zongmi&#x27;s &quot;Chan Preface&quot; remained one of the most widely printed texts throughout Korean Buddhist history, with a large number of woodblock print editions. Zongmi&#x27;s thought continues to be influential on modern Korean Seon (where the &quot;Preface&quot; remains part of the study curriculum of the Chogye order), and his ideas remain a major topic of discussion today.

Through the influence of the &quot;Mind Mirror,&quot; Zongmi-Yanshou Chan also reached Japan, were it was influential on the Daruma school of Zen and on the thought of early Rinzai figures like Myoan Yosai (1141–1215) and Enni Ben&#x27;en (1202–1280). The works of Zongmi and Yanshou were also printed by the monasteries of the Five Mountains of Rinzai (around Kyoto and Kamakura). This tradition valued textual study, and the influence of Zongmi can be seen in the works of some of its important literari figures, like Kiyō Hōshū (1361–1424), who promoted Zongmi&#x27;s teachings with the aphorism: &quot;No Zen separate from the teachings; no teachings separate from Zen.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
Zongmi&#x27;s lifelong work was the attempt to incorporate differing and sometimes conflicting systems into an integrated framework that harmonized various Buddhist teachings and traditions, especially those of Chan practice and Huayan doctrine. More specifically, according to Peter Gregory, one of Zongmi&#x27;s main philosophical projects was to reformulate Huayan thought so as to &quot;provide an ontological basis and philosophical rationale for Ch&#x27;an practice&quot;. This philosophical basis also provided a basic ethical theory for Chan which could stand up against Confucian critiques. It also provided the moral foundations needed to critique the more antinomian forms of Chan Buddhism that had developed in the Tang.

Metaphysically speaking, Zongmi moves beyond the thought of earlier Huayan thinkers like Fazang, who emphasized the doctrine of perfect interfusion or unobstructed interpenetration. Instead, Zongmi emphasizes the teachings of the &quot;Mahayana Awakening of Faith&quot; on the &quot;one mind&quot; (一心) and the teachings of the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; on the teaching of sudden enlightenment (頓教) followed by gradual cultivation, which is based on the originally enlightened mind that all beings have.

===Classification of teachings===
As with many Chinese Buddhist scholars, doctrinal classification (Chinese: p’an chiao) was an integral part of Zongmi&#x27;s work. Such taxonomical schemas (prefigured by Indian ideas like the three turnings of the wheel) were important in Chinese Buddhism, since they provided a sense of order and a hermeneutical structure to the mass of Buddhist teachings which contained numerous, seemingly conflicting ideas and which had been transmitted to China at different times.

Zongmi&#x27;s classification system, influenced by previous Huayan schemas like those of Fazang and Chengguan, provided a schematic analysis of various teachings and practices which explained and harmonized their differences. Zongmi organized all teachings into a hierarchical schema that integrates and validates all traditions and teachings, seeing each lower category as partially true. According to Gregory, &quot;the logic by which such a synthetic approach worked was dialectical. Each teaching overcame the particular shortcoming of the one that preceded it, and the highest teaching was accorded that vaunted position precisely because it succeeded in sublating all of the other teachings within itself.&quot;

Zongmi&#x27;s mature panchiao (found in sources like &quot;Inquiry into the Origin of Humanity&quot; and &quot;Chan Preface&quot;) arranged the Buddhist teachings into five categories:

# The teaching of men and gods (人天教), teaches ethics, karmic retribution and rebirth;
# The teachings of the Hinayana (&quot;Lesser Vehicle&quot;, non-Mahayana Śrāvakayāna Buddhism, Ch: 小乘教); including the doctrine of not-self and the classic teachings of Abhidharma Buddhism; 
# The Mahayana teaching of the analysis of phenomenal appearances (大乘法相教), mainly referring to the Yogacara teachings which see all phenomena as constructed by mind;
# The Mahayana teaching of the negation of phenomenal appearances (大乘破相教), the teaching of emptiness and Madhyamaka which sees all phenomena, even mind, as equally unreal;
# The teaching of the one vehicle (ekayāna) that reveals the nature (一乘顯性教) also known as the &quot;teaching of the nature&quot; (xingzong, i.e. faxing zong, &quot;Dharmata teaching&quot;), which is associated with the teaching of intrinsically enlightened pure mind found in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;. It teaches that one&#x27;s own mind is the true nature (Ch: zhenxing, Skt: tattva), which is the true mind (zhenxin), empty, calm, intrinsically pure. It is a clear, bright and constant knowing (Ch: zhi, Skt: jñana), also called buddha-nature, mind ground, etc.

In Zongmi&#x27;s teaching, the &quot;nature&quot; of each person is identical with Buddha-nature, which is emphasised in Chan. He stated, &quot;To designate it, initially there is only one true spiritual nature, that is not born, does not die, does not increase, does not decrease, does not become, and does not change.&quot; In giving this teaching the highest position, Zongmi&#x27;s schema is quite different from the Huayan system of Fazang, who regarded the Huayan &quot;perfect&quot; teaching of the interpenetration of all dharmas (Ch: shih-shih wu-ai), as illustrated by the Indra&#x27;s net metaphor, to be the supreme teaching.

Zongmi&#x27;s thought instead focuses on the nature of the mind and on how all phenomena arise from that ultimate nature and are deeply interconnected with it. As such, Zongmi follows a doctrinal shift initiated by Chengguan, who also saw the idea of the &quot;unobstructed interpenetration of the absolute and phenomenal&quot; (li-shih wu-ai) and &quot;nature origination&quot; (how all phenomena arise from one ultimate nature) as a more foundational doctrine than the interpenetration of all phenomena (shih-shih wu-ai). Zongmi identifies this ultimate nature, the one true dharmadhatu, with the &quot;one mind&quot; taught in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and with buddha-nature. As such, for Zongmi, the highest teaching of the &quot;One Vehicle&quot; (&quot;Ekayāna&quot;), the culmination of Chan and Huayan, is grounded in this teaching of the ontological basis of all reality, which is the originally awakened mind, the ultimate &quot;nature&quot; or principle (li).

According to Gregory, Zongmi&#x27;s classification scheme provides a dialectical progression, from a naive view, to increasingly apophatic positions (which culminate in the full apophasis of Madhyamaka that lets go of all views and words), to an advanced cataphasis which recovers the use of positive religious language as a method to directly reveal (hsien-shih) the true nature. Zongmi&#x27;s defense of affirmative religious discourse (Ch: piao-ch&#x27;uan), against those who held that only a negative apophatic discourse (che-ch&#x27;uan, like Madhyamaka or some forms of Chan), is an important element of his &quot;Chan Preface&quot;. Zongmi held that the tradition which &quot;takes the nature as its cardinal principle&quot; made use of both types of discourse in order to reveal the true nature of reality. Zongmi thus affirms positive statements which describe ultimate reality as &quot;empty tranquil awareness&quot; (k&#x27;ung chi chih), &quot;the enlightened illumination of awareness and vision&quot;, &quot;the mirror-like radiance of the spirit&quot;, &quot;brilliant refulgence&quot;, &quot;clear tranquility,&quot; &quot;clear and bright, unobscured, ever-present awareness&quot; and so forth. According to Zongmi, without the positive elements, the negative descriptions of the ultimate cannot apply to anything but to a complete nothingness.

=== The intrinsically enlightened true mind ===
The central doctrine of the highest teaching which is at the core of Zongmi&#x27;s thought is the idea that all beings are endowed with a &quot;perfectly enlightened mind,&quot; which is none other than the buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha), the Dharmadhātu (法界, absolute reality) and the &quot;one mind&quot; of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;. According to Zongmi:The teaching of the one vehicle that reveals the nature holds that all sentient beings without exception have the intrinsically enlightened true mind. From time without beginning it is permanently abiding and immaculate. It is shining, unobscured, clear and bright ever-present awareness. It is also called Buddha-nature, and it is also called tathagatagarbha. From time without beginning deluded thoughts cover it, and [sentient beings] by themselves are not aware of it. Because they only recognize their inferior qualities, they become indulgently attached, enmeshed in karma, and experience the suffering of birth-and-death. The Great Enlightened One took pity upon them and taught that everything without exception is empty. He further revealed that the purity of the numinous enlightened true mind is wholly identical with that of all Buddhas. 

Zongmi saw the term &quot;empty tranquil awareness&quot; as expressing the positive and negative aspects of the ultimate reality:&quot;Empty&quot; means empty of all phenomenal appearances and is still a negative term. &quot;Tranquil&quot; just indicates the principle of the immutability of the true nature and is not the same as nothingness. &quot;Awareness&quot; indicates the revelation of the very essence and is not the same as discrimination. It alone constitutes the intrinsic essence of the true mind.

Zongmi described the ultimate truth by the term &quot;awareness&quot; (chih), which he also sometimes calls the &quot;numinous awareness&quot; (ling-chih), &quot;numinous awareness unobscured&quot; (ling-chih pu-mei), &quot;ever-present awareness&quot; (ch&#x27;ang-chih), and &quot;empty tranquil awareness&quot; (k&#x27;ung chi [chih] chih). This awareness is not the defiled mind, mental discrimination, nor is it an object of the mind. According to Gregory, for Zongmi, this awareness is &quot;the underlying ground of consciousness that is always present in all sentient life,&quot; it is &quot;the noetic ground of both delusion and enlightenment, ignorance and wisdom, or, as he aptly terms it, the mind ground (hsin-li).&quot; 

In the &quot;Chan Letter&quot;, Zongmi explains the mind ground through the simile of the wish fulfilling jewel (cintamani) which is like a crystal ball reflecting many colors. Because its substance is brightness, the jewel has the capacity to reflect. In terms of the analogy, the brightness stands for awareness while the color characteristics stand for objective supports. However, while it has the potential to reflect them in all their variety, the jewel itself has no differentiation at all in terms of colors. Zongmi says, &quot;The variety is inherent in the color characteristics themselves; the bright jewel never changes.&quot;

According to Zongmi:

Just the perfect brightness of jade-like purity [yingjing yuanming] is the jewel substance [zhuti]. [...] The black color, up to and including all the other colors, such as blue and yellow, etc., are unreal. [...] When one truly sees the color black, the black from the outset is not black. It is just the brightness. The blue from the outset is not blue. It is just the brightness, up to and including, all the [other colors], such as red, white, yellow, etc., are like this. They are just the brightness. If, at the locus of the color characteristics, one after the other you just see the perfect brightness of jade-like sparkling purity, then you are not confused about the jewel. [...] If you are just free of confusion about the jewel, then black is non-black; black is the bright jewel, and so on with all colors. This is freedom [from the two extremes of] existence and non-existence. The brightness and the blackness are in fusion. How could there be any further obstacle?

Zongmi follows the &quot;Śrīmālādevī sutra&quot; and the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; in seeing this ultimate mind ground as being both empty and not-empty in the sense that it is empty of defilement and discrimination, but not empty of positive qualities like the four perfect qualities (Skt: guṇapāramitā, which are: permanence, purity, bliss, and self), as well as all the buddha qualities.

For Zongmi, any gradual practice of the Buddhist path must be grounded in faith in the originally enlightened mind. This is what makes it possible to attain a sudden awakening to our own originally enlightened state. This true awakened mind is what is revealed during the experience of sudden awakening. It is a recognition of what is already the case, one&#x27;s innate originally awakened nature. This is like how gold is already present in ore.

Before awakening, the true mind has two principles: being in concord with and not being in concord with unreal thought. Insofar as it concords with unreal thought, it can contain both purity and impurity and is known as the storehouse consciousness. But in its principle of not being in concord with unreal thought its substance is immutable and it is known as thusness. Zongmi&#x27;s metaphysics follows the &quot;one mind two gates&quot; model of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; which sees the mind as having an unchanging absolute aspect and a phenomenal appearing aspect. As such, Zongmi saw enlightenment and delusion as two parallel sides of the same non-dual reality.

Zongmi cites the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; which states that &quot;there is not a single sentient being that is not fully endowed with the wisdom of the Tathagata&quot; as a major source for this teaching. He also sees this teaching as exemplified by numerous sources, like the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, the &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Ghanavyuha, Śrīmālādevī&quot;, &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot; sutra, &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;,&quot; Buddha-nature treatise&quot; (Foxing lun) and &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;.

=== Nature origination ===
This ultimate ground of reality, the &quot;dharmadhatu of suchness&quot; (chen-ju fa-chieh), is, according to Zongmi, &quot;the pure mind that is the source of Buddhas and sentient beings.&quot; It is the nature or the essence of mind which gives rise to all dharmas (phenomena). Thus, &quot;nature origination&quot; (hsing-ch&#x27;i) refers to the manifestation of all phenomena in the universe from the ultimate nature.

Nature origination is also identified with the concept of the interpenetration of the absolute and the phenomenal realms (li-shih wu-ai). Like gold (i.e. the nature) and the various objects that can be produced from gold (dharmas), they are neither the same exact thing, nor are they different in essence.

According to Zongmi, this teaching of nature origination is one of the key differences between Huayan thought and Yogacara, since for Yogacara, the pure suchness is inert and unchanging, while in Huayan and in the Awakening of Faith, suchness also has a conditioned aspect that gives rise to all dharmas.

Furthermore, it is precisely due to the fact that all dharmas originate wholly from suchness that all dharmas also interpenetrate. As Zongmi writes, nature origination &quot;is why Buddhas and sentient beings are inextricably interconnected and the pure and defiled lands harmoniously interpenetrate.&quot; As such, for Zongmi, the Huayan idea of the interfusion and interpenetration of all dharmas with each other (shih shih wu-ai) is subordinate to and derived from the interpenetration of the ultimate principle and phenomena that arise from it (li-shih wu-ai).

Zongmi also makes use of the East Asian discourse of essence and function (ti yong) to explain the ultimate nature. In this analysis, Buddha nature (i.e. suchness) is described as the essence (ti) which is the pure and absolute (pu-pien) aspect of the mind. Meanwhile, the innate capacities and manifestations of Buddha nature are its functioning, which includes an intrinsic unchanging awareness, and also the impermanent and conditioned (sui-yuan) aspects of mind which respond to various causes and conditions. According to Zongmi, all of these are aspects of a unitary reality which includes both dependent arising on the conventional level and also nature origination which is more fundamental and makes conventional causality possible. Ultimate reality thus includes all phenomena in the world which are all empty and interconnected with each other, as well as the ontological basis of reality, the dynamic mind ground of awareness (chih), which generates all phenomena.

=== The five stages of phenomenal evolution ===
Another key part of Zongmi&#x27;s system is a theory of cosmogonic development which, as Gregory writes, &quot;explains how the world of delusion and defilement, the world in terms of which unenlightened beings experience themselves, evolves out of a unitary ontological ground that is both intrinsically enlightened and pure.&quot; In this system, which is largely derived from the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, the world of suffering, samsara, arises out of a primal dualistic delusion (i.e. the unenlightened aspect of the storehouse consciousness) which arises out of the primordial state of undifferentiated perfection. Zongmi compares the primal delusion to the act of a wealthy and well respected man falling asleep and forgetting who they are.

The five stages are:

# The One Mind, the ultimate source (Ch: pen-yuan) of all pure and impure phenomena. It is the underlying nature (hsing) of all reality, the buddha-nature in all beings that is the basis for samsara and nirvana and yet transcends all dualities. It is also termed the wondrous mind of perfect enlightenment (in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment) and the one true dharmadhatu (in Huayan). Enlightenment for Zongmi is thus a return to the original source, which is also said to be ineffable, inconceivable and beyond thought.
# The Two Aspects of the One Mind. As described in the &quot;Awakening of Faith,&quot; the one mind also has two aspects: the transcendent &quot;mind as suchness&quot;, which is neither born nor dies, and the &quot;mind subject to birth-and-death&quot;, which refers to the storehouse consciousness. As indicated by the Awakening of Faith, the second aspect (the storehouse) is an interfusion of buddha-nature and the conditioned deluded consciousness &quot;in such a way that they are neither one nor different.&quot; This is compared to waves and water, though a wave is not identical to water itself, their nature is not different. As such, in this system, ignorance and delusion are adventitious manifestations of the one mind.
# The Two Modes of the storehouse consciousness. These two modes are the enlightened mode, which is free of thought and gives rise to pure dharmas (phenomena) through pure dependent arising, and the unenlightened mode, which gives rise to impure dharmas (i.e. the world of samsara). The enlightened mode refers to intrinsic awakening, which is none other than the undifferentiated Dharmakaya. The unenlightened mode is &quot;primordial unenlightenment&quot; which gives rise to impure dependent arising, and which is yet also based on the enlightened nature (i.e. they are of the same essence).
# The Three Subtle Phenomenal Appearances: 1. activation (yeh) or the activity of ignorance, 2. the perceiving subject, 3. the perceived object. The activity of ignorance is the initial &quot;subtle movement of thought&quot; which stirs the originally calm one mind, and this produces the duality of subject and object.
# The Six Coarse Phenomenal Appearances, which is a step by step process found in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, each one leading to the other, . The six are: 1. discrimination of likes and dislikes; 2. continuation: awareness and thoughts of pleasure and pain; 3. attachment to and objectification of perceptual objects; 4. conceptual elaboration; 5. karmic generation in which one&#x27;s attachments lead to actions (karma); 6. suffering of karmic bondage - the experience of the consequences of one&#x27;s past actions.

Zongmi also correlated these five stages to the various teachings in his doctrinal classification system, seeing different teachings as focusing on overcoming different stages of phenomenal development in a process that reverses the course of phenomenal evolution. As such, the first three stages of evolution are associated with the sudden and advanced teachings, while the fourth stage of evolution is correlated with the Yogacara teachings. The first two of the six coarse phenomenal appearances are then seen as covered by the Mahayana teachings on emptiness, the third and fourth appearances by Hinayana, and the last two phenomenal appearances are dealt with by the teaching of men and gods. Thus, this psycho-cosmogy provides another layer to Zongmi&#x27;s soteriological map of Buddhist practice.

===Sudden awakening, gradual cultivation===

Zongmi tried to harmonize the different views on the nature of awakening (bodhi). A key topic of debate in Tang Chan circles was the nature of awakening, and how it could occur suddenly. Zongmi advocated the view of sudden awakening (Ch: tun-wu), accompanied by gradual cultivation. In the &quot;Chan Preface,&quot; Zongmi writes that all ancient Chan teachings &quot;first show the original nature [kaishi benxing] and then require reliance on this nature to practice dhyana [yixing xiuchan].&quot;

Indeed, sudden awakening and gradual cultivation were ultimately one and the same according to Zongmi who writes:

Zongmi thus understands &quot;sudden&quot; and &quot;gradual&quot; teachings as different ways or methods that express the same truth, not to two separate teachings or truths. Furthermore, although the sudden teaching reveals the truth directly, and results in a &quot;sudden&quot; understanding that all beings are Buddhas, this does not mean that one attained full Buddhahood right away. This is because the deeply rooted defiled seeds are only removed by extensive training which reduces these residual effects of past life conditionings.

As such, Zongmi differentiates between two types of awakening / enlightenment: the awakening of initial insight (chieh-wu) which is the basis of gradual cultivation and the awakening of full realization (cheng wu) which is the final awakening. This means Zongmi&#x27;s analysis of the path has three main components: initial insight, gradual cultivation, full realization. Thus, Zongmi advocated &quot;sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation&quot; (Ch: tun-wu chien-hsiu). Sudden awakening provides an initial insight into the true nature and gradual cultivation was needed to eliminate all remaining traces of defilements that prevented the total integration of the originally enlightened mind into all actions.

As Gregory writes: &quot;the realization that one was a Buddha was not sufficient to guarantee that one acted like a Buddha. The gradual practices thus played a necessary role in the post-enlightenment actualization of the insight afforded by the sudden teaching to beings of superior capacity.&quot; Furthermore, for Zongmi, gradual practices are only truly authentic after the experience of sudden awakening. He writes &quot;if one engages in spiritual cultivation without having first experienced enlightenment, then it is not authentic practice.&quot;

Zongmi described this sudden awakening event as follows:Sudden enlightenment means that although [beings] have been deluded [from time] without beginning, recognizing the four elements as their body and deluded thoughts as their mind and taking them both together as constituting their self, when they meet a good friend who explains to them the meaning of the absolute and conditioned [aspects of suchness], the nature and its phenomenal appearance, the essence and its functioning ..., then they at once realize that [their own] marvelous awareness and vision is their true mind, that the mind-which is from the beginning empty and tranquil, boundless and formless-is the dharmakaya, that the nonduality of body and mind is their true self, and that they are no different from all Buddhas by even a hair.

Zongmi drew on various similes to explain the process of sudden awakening - gradual cultivation:

In terms of the elimination of hindrances, it is like when the sun immediately comes out, yet the frost melts gradually. With respect to the perfection of virtue, it is like a child which, when born, immediately possesses four limbs and six senses. As it grows, it gradually develops control over its actions. Therefore, the Hua Yen Avatamsaka sutra] says that when the bodhicitta is first aroused, this is already the accomplishment of perfect enlightenment.

Zongmi also used the metaphor of water and waves found in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; to explain this teaching. The essential tranquil nature of water which reflects all things (intrinsic enlightenment) is disturbed by the winds of ignorance (un-enlightenment, delusion). Although the wind may stop suddenly (sudden enlightenment), the disturbing waves subside only gradually (gradual cultivation) until all motion ceases and the water once again reflects its intrinsic nature (Buddhahood). However, whether disturbed by ignorance or not, the fundamental nature of the water (i.e., the pure luminous mind) never changes.

=== Stages of spiritual cultivation ===
Zongmi also outlined a ten-stage process of spiritual development. Each stage overturns a corresponding stage of the development of samsara, moving from coarser aspects to more subtle ones. The stages are as follows: 

#Sudden enlightenment: the initial insight into the true nature of the mind, the original enlightenment (benjue), which gives rise to faith.
#Resolving to attain Buddhahood: one generates compassion, wisdom, and bodhisattva vow fueled by bodhicitta.
#Cultivating the five practices of giving, morality, patience, striving and meditative insight (samatha-vipasyana).
#Spiritual development - one further develops compassion, wisdom, and vows, and the three minds: straight mind, deep mind, and mind of great compassion.
#Realizing the emptiness of self
#Realizing the emptiness of dharmas
#Mastery of form - one realizes that perceptual objects are manifestations of the mind and gains mastery over them.
#Mastery of mind - one sees the perceiving subject as also illusory and gains mastery of it
#Freedom from thought - one is fully aware of the origin of deluded thoughts and sees the true nature of mind. 
#Attainment of Buddhahood - returning to the ultimate source, realizing the non-duality of all things, even delusion and enlightenment, samsara and nirvana.

=== Scripture and doctrinal study ===

Aside from promoting the importance of &quot;gradual&quot; classic Buddhist practices such as taking of precepts and taking part in rituals, Zongmi also promoted the importance of doctrinal study as an indispensable element of spiritual cultivation. Indeed, for Zongmi, the Buddhist scriptures were a key element of validating one&#x27;s spiritual experiences, even in Chan, which relies on a direct &quot;mind to mind&quot; transmission of the essential meaning. According to Zongmi, even though Bodhidharma taught in this direct way, he did not reject Buddhist scripture or see enlightenment as a separate teaching from what is taught in the sutras. Zongmi held that those who believed that Chan was separate from doctrinal study were deeply confused.

As such, Zongmi promoted the &quot;correspondence of the teachings and Chan&quot; (chiao-ch&#x27;an i-chih), which sees the meaning of Chan as the same as the meaning of the scriptures. Because of this, Zongmi&#x27;s &quot;Chan Preface&quot; states that: &quot;the scriptures are like a marking line to be used as a standard to determine true and false...those who transmit Ch&#x27;an must use the scriptures and treatises as a standard.&quot; According to Zongmi, Chan and Buddhism rely on three sources of knowledge (pramana): inference, direct perception and the word of the Buddha. Those who only rely on one of these are unbalanced, and they may go astray by merely relying on their own unguided experiences, which may be faulty. Zongmi thus promotes an approach to spiritual cultivation that relies on a harmonious development of both meditation and doctrinal study.

That being said, for Zongmi, the scriptures themselves are not Chan, which relies on an intuitive mysterious or dark understanding based on &quot;getting the idea and forgetting the words&quot;. As such, the meaning of Chan and the sutras &quot;are spontaneously understood in a mysterious way&quot;, not in a conceptual intellectual way. The reading and study of the sutras therefore, are a useful guide to the true meaning, but they are not the true meaning itself, which appears in the source of one&#x27;s mind suddenly without calculation, and without becoming caught up in the words or clinging to the text. This is the meaning of the phrase Zongmi attributes to Bodhidharma &quot;no involvement with the written word.&quot; It is not a rejection of textual study, but an indication that Chan realization goes beyond words even while also skillfully making use of the scriptures. This is the way in which the following simile by Zongmi on Chan (which is beyond words) and the scriptures is to be understood:The sutras are like an inked marking string [shengmo], serving as a model by which to establish the false and the correct. The inked marking string is not the skill itself; a skillful craftsman must use the string as a standard [wei ping]. The sutras and treatises are not Chan; one who transmits Chan must use the sutras and treatises as a norm [wei zhun].Broughton argues that the sutra based &quot;sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation&quot; Chan was the normative type of Chan during the Song and Ming dynasties, as well as in Goryeo Korea. Zongmi&#x27;s sutra-based Chan view contrasts with another popular Zen narrative which sees Chan / Zen as being separate from textual learning altogether, and sees scriptural study as pointless for the Zen practitioner. According to Broughton, modern Japanese Rinzai Zen generally promotes this other popular narrative which is &quot;an image of Zen framed by the &quot;Record of Linji—&quot;wherein the real teacher boldly discards the teachings of the Buddhist canon.&quot;

==Account of Chan Buddhism==
Zongmi&#x27;s analysis of Chan (i.e. Zen Buddhism) also attempted to harmonize the various splits and debates which existed among the various Chan schools of his time, which often engaged in debate and disparaging attacks on each other. Citing the parable of the blind men and the elephant, Zongmi thinks that the various competing Chan schools have different parts of the whole truth, and his doctrinal framework seeks to provide a holistic account of all of the various schools of Chan, writing: &quot;If taken in isolation, each of them is wrong. But if taken together, each of them is valid.&quot; This shows Zongmi&#x27;s basic doctrinal tendency which as Gregory explains &quot;is always to articulate a comprehensive framework in which such discrepant perspectives can be harmoniously subsumed. Such a comprehensive framework not only provides a larger context in which the divergent perspectives can be validated as parts of a whole, it also provides a new and higher perspective that is superior to the others because it succeeds in sublating them within itself.&quot;

===Critiques of Chan schools===
Zongmi gave critiques on seven Chan schools in his &quot;Prolegomenon to the Collection of Expressions of the Zen Source&quot; and although he promoted his own Heze school as exemplifying the highest practice, his accounts of the other schools are mostly balanced. His works on Chan remain an invaluable source for the development of Buddhism in China. Zongmi&#x27;s view of the various Chan schools is closely tied to his doctrinal classification system and his critiques of the various Tang Chan schools draw on his broader philosophical position.

Zongmi categorized all Chan lineages or houses as belonging to one of three main types of doctrinal systems (Skt: siddhanta, Ch: zong):

* the doctrine of &quot; stopping thought of the unreal and cultivating mind (only)&quot;, which is associated with the consciousness-only school. According to Zongmi, Chan schools which focus on this doctrine include: Jingzhong, Northern school, Baotang, and the South Mountain Buddha-Recitation Gate school.
* the doctrine of &quot;cutting off and not leaning on anything&quot;, which is associated with the teaching of emptiness and Madhyamaka. The Shitou and Oxhead schools are associated with this doctrine.
* the doctrine of &quot;directly revealing the mind nature&quot;, which is associated with the buddha-nature teachings of the Dharma nature school (Zongmi&#x27;s own view). This is considered to contain the clear and explicit (Skt: nitartha) meaning of the true nature. The Heze and Hongzhou lineages are associated with this doctrine.

==== Northern school ====
Zongmi&#x27;s critique of Northern Chan was based on its practice of removing impurities in the mind to reach enlightenment. He associated this teaching with the Chinese Yogacara school and saw the practice as a gradual method that was not authentic Chan. Zongmi criticized this on the basis that the Northern school was under the misconception that impurities were inherently different or separate from the pure mind, making this a dualistic view that fails to understand the natural working of intrinsic enlightenment. Zongmi held that the impurities of the mind were merely adventitious, empty and ultimatelly non-dual with the pure mind, since they are nothing but the empty manifestations (yung) of the ultimate nature. Thus, the impurities are not inherently impure, they merely appear that way due to our dualistic misperception. In attempting to remove them one merely feeds that sense of duality. Instead, for Zongmi, we need to first have an initial awakening to the true nature of things, which includes the principle of the non-duality of the pure nature and the impure manifestations, of the identity of samsara and nirvana. It is only based on this awakening which validates the mundane world of appearances as a manifestation of the true nature that one can practice the path of Chan.

==== Oxhead school ====
Zongmi&#x27;s criticism of another prominent Chan lineage, the Oxhead school, is based on their understanding of emptiness, which Zongmi saw as one sided. He claimed that the Oxhead School taught &quot;no mind&quot; (wuxin, 無心) but did not recognize the nonempty aspect of mind, assuming that the intrinsically enlightened nature is only &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;that there is nothing to be cognized&quot;. Drawing on the buddha-nature sutras like the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, Zongmi argues that emptiness does not mean a pure negation, since according to the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, &quot;when there is nothing in a jar, the jar is said to be empty-it does not mean that there is no jar.&quot; As such, the Chan teaching of &quot;no mind&quot; means that the true mind is empty of defilements and concepts. As such, the teaching of the Oxhead school is one sided since it only focuses on emptiness and negation, but does not know the intrinsically enlightened mind and the ultimate reality. In critiquing the purely negative dialectic of this school, Zongmi writes &quot;if there are no real things whatsoever, then on the basis of what are illusions made to appear? Moreover, there has never been a case of the illusory things in the world before us being able to arise without being based on something real...therefore we know that this teaching merely destroys our attachment to feelings but does not yet reveal the nature that is true and numinous.&quot;

==== Hongzhou school ====
Zongmi was also critical of certain Chan sects that seemed to ignore the moral order of traditional Buddhism and Confucianism and that failed to understand the conventional truths of Buddhism in general. As such, Zongmi claimed the Hongzhou school, derived from Mazu Daoyi (709–788), believed &quot;everything as altogether true&quot;. Zongmi does not critique Mazu himself (whom he sees as a great master), rather that &quot;lineage&#x27;s junior trainees&quot; (bi zong houxue) who misundertood his teachings. As such, the target of his critique is not Mazu, but Zongmi&#x27;s ninth century Hongzhou contemporaries. 

According to Zongmi, the Hongzhou teaching led some foolish people to a radical nondualism that believed that all actions, good or bad, and all experiences (anger, greed, pleasure, pain) were totally equal expressions of the Buddha-nature. As such, it collapses the ultimate essence into its myriad functions, holding that there is no essence apart from its functioning. Zongmi saw this as ethically dangerous, and as denying the need for ethics and spiritual cultivation. Zongmi also described their teaching as &quot;entrusting oneself to act freely according to the nature of one&#x27;s feelings&quot;. For Zongmi, this was a dangerously antinomian view as it eliminated all moral distinctions and validated any actions as expressions of the essence of Buddha-nature.

Furthermore, Zongmi also held that this view failed to understand that while the essence (buddha-nature, the mind ground) and its functions (all phenomena) are two aspects of a non-dual reality, they are also still different in an important way, because the essence is more fundamental, being the basis for enlightenment. Indeed, for Zongmi, they are ultimately &quot;neither one nor different&quot;. As such, from the perspective of a sentient being, there is still a distinction between awakening and delusion. As Gregory writes, &quot;their inseparability is what makes religious cultivation possible, and their difference is what makes religious cultivation necessary.&quot;

Because of this, Zongmi sees the Hongzhou practice of &quot;simply allowing the mind to act spontaneously&quot; as an inadequate form of spiritual cultivation. As such, Zongmi writes:

Hung-chou constantly says: &quot;Since greed, anger, compassion, and good deeds are all the Buddha-nature, how could there be any difference between them?&quot; This is like someone seeing that there is never any difference in the wet nature [of the water] and not realizing that there is an enormous difference between the success of a boat that crosses over it and the failure of a boat that capsizes in it. Therefore, as far as this line&#x27;s approach toward sudden enlightenment is concerned, even though it comes close, it still does not hit the mark, and, as far as its approach toward gradual cultivation is concerned, it is mistaken and completely backward.

Thus, while Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its expressions in the world are non-dual, he insisted that there is still a difference between good and evil, and affirmed the need for spiritual cultivation. Gregory writes that to avoid the dualism he saw in the Northern Line and the radical antinomianism of the Hongzhou school, Zongmi&#x27;s paradigm preserved &quot;an ethically critical duality within a larger ontological unity&quot;.

As part of his critique, Zongmi introduces a key distinction between two types of the functioning of the ultimate nature:
* &quot;intrinsic functioning of the self-nature&quot; (tzu-hsing pen-yung), which is &quot;ever-present awareness&quot;. Zongmi compares this to the reflectivity of a mirror, its capacity to reflect.
* &quot;responsive functioning in accord with conditions&quot; (sui-yuan ying-yung), which he compares to the images reflected in a mirror and corresponds to psycho-physical functions like speech, discrimination, bodily movement, etc.

According to Zongmi, the Hongzhou school emphasizes the responsive functioning of buddha-nature, but fails to understand the intrinsic functioning of the self-nature. Indeed, Zongmi thinks that the Hongzhou school mistakes the mirror&#x27;s reflections for its capacity to reflect. That is to say, it mistakes the various impermanent appearances for the true nature itself. This mistake means that they are unable to make ethical and practical distinctions. 

Furthermore, Zongmi argues that the true nature can only be truly seen in the state of no-thought (wu-nien), which is like a reflective jewel that is not reflecting any colors and so can be seen just as it is. He cites the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and Chengguan in support of this view. For Zongmi, this direct perception of the true nature, an empty tranquil awareness in which there are no thoughts, is what is at the core of the experience of sudden awakening. Zongmi argues the Hongzhou school lacks this knowledge, and that their teaching of spontaneous action can even become a rationalization for deluded activity. Thus, they lack knowledge of what sudden enlightenment is, and also of gradual cultivation.

====Baotang school====
Zongmi also criticized the Baotang school in similar ways. According to Zongmi, this school had misinterpreted Shenhui&#x27;s teaching on &quot;no-thought&quot; as entailing &quot;the rejection of all forms of traditional Buddhist ethical practice and ritual observance.&quot; According to Zongmi, this school rejected conventional Buddhist practices like &quot;worship, repentance, reciting scriptures, painting Buddhist images, and copying sutras&quot; because they sought to &quot;extinguish discriminative consciousness&quot; (mieh-shih).

== On the three teachings ==
Zongmi was also concerned with providing an inclusive view of the three main religions of China: Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. He saw all three as expedient means (upaya), functioning within a particular historical context. Although he saw Buddhism as revealing the highest truth, this had nothing to do with the level of understanding of the three sages (Confucius, Laozi and Buddha). Zongmi saw them as &quot;consummate sages, who, in accord with the times and in response to beings, made different paths in setting up their teachings&quot;. As such, the three teachings differed in their goals and in the particular circumstances in which they arose, not in the truth realized by their founding figures.

As Zongmi writes:
Zongmi&#x27;s early training in Confucianism led him to attempt to develop a syncretic framework where Chinese non-Buddhist principles could be integrated within Buddhist teachings. For example, Zongmi matches the five precepts with the five Confucian virtues (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, trustworthiness, wisdom), and he links Buddhist cosmological processes with Daoist cosmogony. Zongmi valued Confucian teachings greatly and did not reject its moral vision. He merely held that only Buddhism could provide the metaphysical foundation for it. He added Confucianism (along with Daoism) into his doctrinal classification scheme in an inclusive manner that validated them, something that previous Huayan scholars had not done.

Zongmi&#x27;s worldview thus attempts to subtlate (Ch: shiyo) non-buddhist traditions (along with buddhist ones), which Zongmi saw as partially true, into what he considered to be a higher more comprehensive worldview. Since this supreme view was inclusive of other, supposedly more limited views, it was seen as a more impartial view that was called &quot;round&quot; or &quot;having no sides&quot; (yuan). Zongmi considered this to be the harmonious consummation of other views.

That being said, Zongmi also presented several criticisms of Confucianism as well as Daoism, such as in the first part of &quot;Inquiry into the Origin of Humanity,&quot; which critiques such concepts as the Way (dao), spontaneity (ziran), primal qi (yuanqi), and the mandate of heaven. One of Zongmi&#x27;s main critiques of the view that the way of heaven determines all things is that this provides no grounding for ethics and no way to distinguish between good and evil. He critiques Confucianism&#x27;s narrow focus on this life, and their failure to understand karma and rebirth. Zongmi also mounts a theodicy critique of the concept of the mandate of heaven, the idea that heaven (tian) &quot;monitors the sociopolitical world of human endeavor to ensure that it resonates with the larger rhythms of a universe functioning in natural harmony with Confucian moral principles&quot;. According to Zongmi, heaven cannot be seen as providential moral force due to the injustice and suffering found in the world.

==Writings==
Zongmi&#x27;s writings were extensive and influential. He wrote commentaries, ritual manuals, and popular essays for literati audiences. There is no certainty about the quantity of Zongmi&#x27;s writings. Zongmi&#x27;s epitaph, written by his student Pei Xiu, (787?–860) listed over ninety fascicles. Tsan-ning&#x27;s (919–1001) biography claimed over two hundred.

For modern scholars, Zongmi provides the &quot;most valuable sources on Tang dynasty Zen. There is no other extant source even remotely as informative&quot;. Unfortunately, many of Zongmi&#x27;s works are lost, including his &quot;Collected Writings on the Source of Ch’an&quot; which would provide modern scholars with an invaluable source to reconstruct Tang dynasty Chan.

=== Work on the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; ===
Zongmi&#x27;s first major work was his commentary and sub-commentary on &quot;Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, completed in 823–824. The sub-commentary contains extensive data on the teachings, ideas and practices on the seven houses of Chan. These data are derived from personal experience and observations.

Zongmi also wrote a major work in eighteen fascicles called &quot;A Manual of Procedures for the Cultivation and Realization of Ritual Practice according to the Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;. In this work, Zongmi discusses the theoretical basis of Buddhist practice as well as the specific details of Buddhist practice. According to Gregory, the work is influenced by the writings of Zhiyi and explains a &quot;complex program of ritual and meditation practice in terms of the Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment.&quot;

=== The &quot;Chart of Chan Succession&quot; ===
The &quot;Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Has Transmitted the Mind-Ground in China&quot; (Chung-hua ch’uan-hsin-ti ch’an-men shih-tzu ch’eng-his t’u), was written at the request of Pei Xiu sometime between 830 and 833. The work clarifies the major Chan traditions of the Tang era. It contains detailed critiques of the Northern School, the Ox-head School and the two branches of Southern Chan, the Hongzhou and his own Heze lineage.

=== The &quot;Chan&quot; &quot;Preface&quot; ===
The &quot;Prolegomenon to the Collection of Expressions of the Chan Source&quot;, also known as the &quot;Chan Preface&quot;, was written around 833. It provides a theoretical basis for Zongmi&#x27;s vision of the correlation between Chan and the Buddhist scriptures. It gives accounts of the several lineages extant at the time, many of which had died out by the time of the Song dynasty (960–1279). This work was the preface to &quot;Collection of Expressions of the Chan Source,&quot; (&quot;Chan-yuan zhuquanji&quot;) which was a large collection of Chan texts that Zongmi compiled as a kind of Chan scriptural canon, i.e. a Chan pitaka (basket of scriptures). Unfortunately, this collection itself is lost, and only the &quot;Chan Preface&quot; exists.

=== &quot;On the Original Nature of Man&quot; ===
Zongmi&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry into the Origin of Humanity&quot;, (or &quot;On the Original Nature of Man&quot;, or &quot;The Debate on an Original Person&quot;, Chinese: 原人論 Yüanren lun) was written sometime between 828 and 835. This essay became one of his best-known works and was popular with the literati of the time. The writing style is simple and straightforward, and the content not overly technical, making the work accessible to non-Buddhist intellectuals of the day. The essay surveys the current major Buddhist teachings of the day, as well as Confucian and Taoist teachings, defending his Buddhist view as the most comprehensive of all. It develops a holistic and inclusive perspective of all the Buddhist and non-buddhist teachings, while also discussing the nature of existence and the human condition. De Bary writes that the essay may have been written as a kind of rejoinder to the &quot;On the original Nature of Man&quot; (&quot;Yuan jen&quot;) and &quot;On the Tao&quot; (&quot;Yuan tao&quot;) by the contemporary Confucian Han Yu (768–824).

=== Other commentaries ===
Zongmi also wrote the following works:

* Commentary on the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;
* Commentary on the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot;, probably written between 823 and 828. 
* Commentary on the &quot;Chengweshilun&quot;
* Commentary on the &quot;Bianzong lun&quot; of Xie Lingyun
* Commentary on the &quot;Yulanpen Sutra&quot;

<text>Vidago is a village and a former-civil parish in the municipality of Chaves, in the Portuguese district of Vila Real. Until its merger into the parish of Vidago, Arcossó, Selhariz e Vilarinho das Paranheiras, the civil parish administered an area of and included a population of 1186 inhabitants.

==History==

Known as a spa town, Vidago was a centre of mineral water treatments dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th century.

For a long time distance was an impediment to the development of the town, due to the difficulty of transport. Guests would arrive by coach from Porto, using roads that were often little more than dirt path. Finally in 1907 the railroad between Régua and Vila Real was extended to Pedras Salgadas, to the south of Vidago. Three years later the first train arrived at the Vidago station, resulting in renewed popularity of the spa.

During the Gilded Age, the popularity of the waters in Vidago resulted in the construction of the Hotel Palace of Vidago, which became the retreat of some Portuguese monarchs. The spa town saw its period of splendor from 1875 to 1877 when King Luís I made consecutive visits. The fame of the curative powers of the waters spread so far that from 1876 to 1889 they were awarded prizes in Madrid, Paris, Vienna and Rio de Janeiro. For this, Vidago was once one of the most visited Portuguese spas; the water is apparently effective in the treatment of digestive problems, as it contains sodium bicarbonate and, according to publicity leaflets, radioactive elements.

Bottled mineral waters &quot;Salus&quot; and &quot;Campilho&quot; are extracted in Vidago.

When the Palace Hotel was built in 1910, it was one of the most luxurious on the Iberian Peninsula, that included concerts, tennis and croquet courts, and, on the small island within the lake, there was a spacious skating rink. Following a period of remodelling, refurbishing and renovation, the 5-star hotel reopened in 2010, which included an expanded golf course and park.

<text>Horses can use various gaits (patterns of leg movement) during locomotion across solid ground, either naturally or as a result of specialized training by humans.

==Classification==
Gaits are typically categorized into two groups: the &quot;natural&quot; gaits that most horses will use without special training, and the &quot;ambling&quot; gaits that are various smooth-riding, four-beat footfall patterns that may appear naturally in some individuals. Special training is often required before a horse will perform an ambling gait in response to a rider&#x27;s command.

Another system of classification that applies to quadrupeds uses three categories: walking and ambling gaits, running or trotting gaits, and leaping gaits. The British Horse Society dressage rules require competitors to perform four variations of the walk, six forms of the trot, five leaping gaits (all forms of the canter), halt, and rein back, but not the gallop. The British Horse Society equitation examinations also require proficiency in the gallop as distinct from the canter.

The so-called &quot;natural&quot; gaits, in increasing order of speed, are the walk, trot, canter, and gallop. Some consider these as three gaits, with the canter a variation of the gallop. All four gaits are seen in wild horse populations. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some horses, these four basic gaits occur in nature across almost all horse breeds. In some animals the trot is replaced by the pace or an ambling gait. Horses who possess an ambling gait are usually also able to trot.

==Walk==
The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about . When walking, a horse&#x27;s legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three or two feet on the ground. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.

In detail, a horse starts a walk by lifting its left front leg (the other three feet are touching the ground). It then lifts its right hind leg (while being supported by the diagonal pair right front and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right hind leg (only the right front leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left hind leg (diagonal support), puts down the right front (lateral support), lifts the left front, puts down the left hind, and the pattern repeats.

Ideally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse&#x27;s hips as each hind leg reaches forward.

The fastest &quot;walks&quot; with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits. If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking but is beginning to either trot or pace.

==Trot==
The trot is a two-beat gait that has a wide variation in possible speeds and averages about . A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but in harness racing, the trot of a Standardbred is faster than the gallop of the average non-racehorse. The North American speed record for a racing trot under saddle was measured at 

In this gait, the horse moves its legs in unison in diagonal pairs. From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, this is a very stable gait, and the horse need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck. The trot is the working gait for a horse. Horses can only canter and gallop for short periods at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good condition can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly from one place to the next.
Depending on the horse and its speed, a trot can make it difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards out of the saddle and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in English riding disciplines, most riders &quot;post&quot; to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy on the horse&#x27;s back and once mastered is also easy on the rider.

To not be jostled out of the saddle or harm the horse by bouncing on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to &quot;sit&quot; the trot. Most riders can easily learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride even a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.

Because the trot is such a safe and efficient gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly is an important component in almost all equestrian disciplines. Nonetheless, &quot;gaited&quot; or &quot;ambling&quot; horses that possess smooth four-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot (see &quot;ambling gaits&quot; below) are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to have to ride at a trot.

Two variations of the trot are specially trained in advanced dressage horses: the piaffe and the passage. The piaffe is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The passage is an exaggerated slow-motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training, and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform them.

== Canter (lope) ==
The canter, or lope as it is known in Western circles of riding, is a controlled three-beat gait that is usually a bit faster than the average trot but slower than the gallop. The average speed of a canter is 16–27 km/h (10–17 mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. The faster the horse is moving, the longer the suspension time between the three beats. The word is thought to be short for &quot;Canterbury gallop&quot;.

In the canter, one of the horse&#x27;s rear legs – the right hind leg, for example – propels the horse forward. During this beat, the horse is supported only on that single leg while the remaining three legs are moving forward. On the next beat the horse catches itself on the left hind and right front legs while the other hind leg is still momentarily on the ground. On the third beat, the horse catches itself on the left front leg while the diagonal pair is momentarily still in contact with the ground.

The more extended foreleg is matched by a slightly more extended hind leg on the same side. This is referred to as a &quot;lead&quot;. Except in special cases, such as the counter-canter, it is desirable for a horse to lead with its inside legs when on a circle. Therefore, a horse that begins cantering with the right hind leg as described above will have the left front and hind legs each land farther forward. This would be referred to as being on the &quot;left lead&quot;.

When a rider is added to the horse&#x27;s natural balance, the question of the lead becomes more important. When riding in an enclosed area such as an arena, the correct lead provides the horse with better balance. The rider typically signals the horse which lead to take when moving from a slower gait into the canter. In addition, when jumping over fences, the rider typically signals the horse to land on the correct lead to approach the next fence or turn. The rider can also request the horse to deliberately take up the wrong lead (counter-canter), a move required in some dressage competitions and routine in polo, which requires a degree of collection and balance in the horse. The switch from one lead to another without breaking gait is called the &quot;flying lead change&quot; or &quot;flying change&quot;. This switch is also a feature of dressage and reining schooling and competition.

If a horse is leading with one front foot but the opposite hind foot, it produces an awkward rolling movement, called a cross-canter, disunited canter or &quot;cross-firing&quot;.

== Gallop ==

The gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster, more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about , and in the wild is used when the animal needs to flee from predators or simply cover short distances quickly. Horses seldom will gallop more than before they need to rest, though horses can sustain a moderately paced gallop for longer distances before they become winded and have to slow down.

The gallop is the gait of the classic race horse. Modern Thoroughbred horse races are seldom longer than , though in some countries Arabian horses are sometimes raced as far as . The fastest galloping speed is achieved by the American Quarter Horse, which in a short sprint of a quarter mile () or less has been clocked at speeds approaching . The Guinness Book of World Records lists a Thoroughbred as having averaged over a two-furlong () distance in 2008.

Like a canter, the horse will strike off with its non-leading hind foot; but the second stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the striking off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.

Contrary to the old &quot;classic&quot; paintings of running horses, which showed all four legs stretched out in the suspension phase, when the legs are stretched out, at least one foot is still in contact with the ground. When all four feet are off the ground in the suspension phase of the gallop, the legs are bent rather than extended. In 1877, Leland Stanford settled an argument about whether racehorses were ever fully airborne: he paid photographer Eadweard Muybridge to prove it photographically. The resulting photos, known as &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot;, are the first documented example of high-speed photography and they clearly show the horse airborne.
According to Equix, who analyzed the biometrics of racing Thoroughbreds, the average racing colt has a stride length of ; that of Secretariat, for instance, was , which was probably part of his success.

A controlled gallop used to show a horse&#x27;s ground-covering stride in horse show competition is called a &quot;gallop in hand&quot; or a &quot;hand gallop&quot;.

In complete contrast to the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, and the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.

==Pace==

The pace is a lateral two-beat gait. In the pace, the two legs on the same side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where the two legs diagonally opposite from each other move forward together. In both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground. The trot is much more common, but some horses, particularly in breeds bred for harness racing, naturally prefer to pace. Pacers are also faster than trotters on average, though horses are raced at both gaits. Among Standardbred horses, pacers breed truer than trotters – that is, trotting sires have a higher proportion of pacers among their get than pacing sires do of trotters.

A slow pace can be relatively comfortable, as the rider is lightly rocked from side to side. A slightly uneven pace that is somewhat between a pace and an amble is the &quot;sobreandando&quot; of the Peruvian Paso. On the other hand, a slow pace is considered undesirable in an Icelandic horse, where it is called a &quot;lull&quot; or a &quot;piggy-pace&quot;.

With one exception, a fast pace is uncomfortable for riding and very difficult to sit, because the rider is moved rapidly from side to side. The motion feels somewhat as if the rider is on a camel, another animal that naturally paces. However, a camel is much taller than a horse and so even at relatively fast speeds, a rider can follow the rocking motion of a camel. A pacing horse, being smaller and taking quicker steps, moves from side to side at a rate that becomes difficult for a rider to follow at speed, so though the gait is faster and useful for harness racing, it becomes impractical as a gait for riding at speed over long distances. However, in the case of the Icelandic horse, where the pace is known as the &quot;skeið,&quot; &quot;flying pace&quot; or &quot;flugskeið&quot;, it is a smooth and highly valued gait, ridden in short bursts at great speed.

A horse that paces and is not used in harness is often taught to perform some form of amble, obtained by lightly unbalancing the horse so the footfalls of the pace break up into a four beat lateral gait that is smoother to ride. A rider cannot properly post to a pacing horse because there is no diagonal gait pattern to follow, though some riders attempt to avoid jostling by rhythmically rising and sitting.

Based on studies of the Icelandic horse, it is possible that the pace may be heritable and linked to a single genetic mutation on DMRT3 in the same manner as the lateral ambling gaits.

==Ambling==

There are a significant number of names for various four-beat intermediate gaits. Though these names derive from differences in footfall patterns and speed, historically they were once grouped together and collectively referred to as the &quot;amble&quot;. In the United States, horses that are able to amble are referred to as &quot;gaited&quot;. In almost all cases, the primary feature of the ambling gaits is that one of the feet is bearing full weight at any one time, reflected in the colloquial term, &quot;singlefoot&quot;.

All ambling gaits are faster than a walk but usually slower than a canter. They are smoother for a rider than either a trot or a pace, and most can be sustained for relatively long periods, making them particularly desirable for trail riding and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle. There are two basic types: lateral, wherein the front and hind feet on the same side move in sequence, and diagonal, where the front and hind feet on opposite sides move in sequence. Ambling gaits are further distinguished by whether the footfall rhythm is isochronous (four equal beats in a 1–2–3–4 rhythm) or non-isochronous (1–2, 3–4 rhythm) created by a slight pause between the ground strike of the forefoot of one side to the hind foot of the other.

Not all horses can perform an ambling gait. However, many breeds can be trained to produce them. In most &quot;gaited&quot; breeds, an ambling gait is a hereditary trait. A 2012 DNA study of movement in Icelandic horses and mice have determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which is related to limb movement and motion, causes a premature &quot;stop codon&quot; in horses with lateral ambling gaits.

The major ambling gaits include:

* The &quot;fox trot&quot; is most often associated with the Missouri Fox Trotter breed, but it is also seen under different names in other gaited breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind. The same footfall pattern is characteristic of the &quot;trocha&quot;, &quot;pasitrote&quot; and &quot;marcha batida&quot; seen in various South American breeds.
* Many South American horse breeds have a range of smooth intermediate lateral ambling gaits. The Paso Fino&#x27;s speed variations are called (from slowest to fastest) the &quot;paso fino&quot;, &quot;paso corto&quot;, and &quot;paso largo&quot;. The Peruvian Paso&#x27;s lateral gaits are known as the &quot;paso llano&quot; and &quot;sobreandando&quot;. The lateral gait of the Mangalarga Marchador is called the &quot;marcha picada&quot;.
* The &quot;rack&quot; or &quot;racking&quot; is a lateral gait most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In the rack, the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, but it is a four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat.
* The &quot;running walk&quot;, a four-beat lateral gait with footfalls in the same sequence as the regular walk but characterized by greater speed and smoothness. It is a distinctive natural gait of the Tennessee Walking Horse.
* The slow gait is a general term for various lateral gaits that follow the same general lateral footfall pattern, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. Terms for various slow gaits include the &quot;stepping pace&quot; and &quot;singlefoot&quot;.
* The &quot;tölt&quot; is a gait that is often described as being unique to the Icelandic horse. The footfall pattern is the same as for the rack, but the tölt is characterized by more freedom and liquidity of movement. Some breeds of horses that are related to the Icelandic horse, living in the Faroe Islands and Norway, also tölt.
* The &quot;revaal&quot; or &quot;ravaal&quot; is a four-beat lateral gait associated with Marwari, Kathiawari or Sindhi horse breeds of India.

<text>Pedras Salgadas () is a small spa town in the district of Vila Real, in Northern Portugal, located approximately 37 km north of the district capital of Vila Real. It is famous for its mineral waters. There are several small hotels in the area, which cater to tourists who want to relax in the green countryside and benefit from the spa facilities located there. In 2010, the Portuguese beer and water company Unicer opened a brand new spa complex in the town. Pedras Salgadas is situated in the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar. Both are located on N2, the national road linking Chaves with Vila real. The new four-lane A24 highway passes a few kilometers west of the town and is connected by a feeder road. The railway was closed in the 1980s and the abandoned railway bed has now been paved for use as a cycling and walking path. This path extends to Vila Pouca de Aguiar, at a distance of about 10 kilometers.

<doc id="293441" wikidata="Q281100" url="?curid=293441" title="Thutmose (sculptor)">
<text>Thutmose, also known as &quot;The King&#x27;s Favourite and Master of Works, the Sculptor Thutmose&quot; (also spelled Djhutmose, Thutmosis, and Thutmes), was an Ancient Egyptian sculptor in the Amarna style. He flourished around 1350 BC, and is thought to have been the official court sculptor of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten in the latter part of his reign. A German archaeological expedition digging in Akhenaten&#x27;s deserted city of Akhetaten, known today as Amarna, found a ruined house and studio complex (labeled P47.1-3) in early December 1912; the building was identified as that of Thutmose based on an ivory horse blinker found in a rubbish pit in the courtyard inscribed with his name and job title. Since it gave his occupation as &quot;sculptor&quot; and the building was clearly a sculpture workshop, the determination seemed logical and has proven to be accurate.

==Recovered works==

Among many other sculptural items recovered at the same time was the polychrome bust of Nefertiti, apparently a master study for others to copy, which was found on the floor of a storeroom. In addition to this now-famous bust, twenty-two plaster casts of faces—some of which are full heads, others just the face—were found in Rooms 18 and 19 of the studio, with an additional one found in Room 14. Eight of these have been identified as various members of the royal family, including Akhenaten, his other wife Kiya, his late father Amenhotep III, and his eventual successor Ay. The rest represent unknown individuals, presumably contemporary residents of Amarna.

A couple of the pieces found in the workshop depict realistic images of older noblewomen, something rare in Ancient Egyptian art, which more often portrayed women in an idealized manner as always young, slender, and beautiful. One of the plaster faces depicts an older woman, with wrinkles at the corner of her eyes, bags under them, and a deeply lined forehead. This piece has been described as showing &quot;a greater variety of wrinkles than any other depiction of an elite woman from ancient Egypt&quot; It is thought to represent the image of a wise, older woman. A small statue of an aging Nefertiti also was found in the workshop, depicting her with a rounded, drooping belly, thick thighs, and a curved line at the base of her abdomen showing that she had borne several children, perhaps intended to project an image of fertility.

Examples of his work recovered from his abandoned studio may be viewed at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Upon the death of Akhenaten, the seat of government was returned from Amarna to Thebes and the associated bureaucratic and professional industries followed.

== Tomb ==

In 1996 the French Egyptologist Alain Zivie discovered at Saqqara the decorated rock cut tomb of the &quot;head of the painters in the place of truth&quot;, Thutmose. The tomb dates to the time shortly after the Amarna Period. Although the title of the Thutmose in Saqqara is slightly different from the title of the Thutmose known from Amarna, it seems likely that they refer to the same person and that the different titles represent different stages in his career.

An extensive article by Zivie in the July–August 2018 edition of &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; provides great detail and many images of artifacts recovered in an adjacent tomb, discussion of many aspects of several topics regarding Ancient Egyptian research and identification, as well as information about the sculptor, Thutmose.

<doc id="293450" wikidata="Q846862" url="?curid=293450" title="Involution (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, an involution, involutory function, or self-inverse function is a function that is its own inverse,
for all in the domain of . Equivalently, applying twice produces the original value.

== General properties ==
Any involution is a bijection.

The identity map is a trivial example of an involution. Examples of nontrivial involutions include negation (), reciprocation (), and complex conjugation () in arithmetic; reflection, half-turn rotation, and circle inversion in geometry; complementation in set theory; and reciprocal ciphers such as the ROT13 transformation and the Beaufort polyalphabetic cipher.

The composition of two involutions and is an involution if and only if they commute: .

== Involutions on finite sets ==
The number of involutions, including the identity involution, on a set with elements is given by a recurrence relation found by Heinrich August Rothe in 1800:
: formula_1 and formula_2 for formula_3
The first few terms of this sequence are 1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232 ; these numbers are called the telephone numbers, and they also count the number of Young tableaux with a given number of cells.
The number can also be expressed by non-recursive formulas, such as the sum
formula_4

The number of fixed points of an involution on a finite set and its number of elements have the same parity. Thus the number of fixed points of all the involutions on a given finite set have the same parity. In particular, every involution on an odd number of elements has at least one fixed point. This can be used to prove Fermat&#x27;s two squares theorem.

== Involution throughout the fields of mathematics ==

=== Real-valued functions ===

The graph of an involution (on the real numbers) is symmetric across the line . This is due to the fact that the inverse of any &quot;general&quot; function will be its reflection over the line . This can be seen by &quot;swapping&quot; with . If, in particular, the function is an &quot;involution&quot;, then its graph is its own reflection. 

Some basic examples of involutions include the functions
formula_5Besides, we can construct an involution by wrapping an involution in a bijection and its inverse (formula_6). For instance :formula_7
=== Euclidean geometry ===
A simple example of an involution of the three-dimensional Euclidean space is reflection through a plane. Performing a reflection twice brings a point back to its original coordinates.

Another involution is reflection through the origin; not a reflection in the above sense, and so, a distinct example.

These transformations are examples of affine involutions.

=== Projective geometry ===
An involution is a projectivity of period 2, that is, a projectivity that interchanges pairs of points.
* Any projectivity that interchanges two points is an involution.
* The three pairs of opposite sides of a complete quadrangle meet any line (not through a vertex) in three pairs of an involution. This theorem has been called Desargues&#x27;s Involution Theorem. Its origins can be seen in Lemma IV of the lemmas to the &quot;Porisms&quot; of Euclid in Volume VII of the &quot;Collection&quot; of Pappus of Alexandria.
* If an involution has one fixed point, it has another, and consists of the correspondence between harmonic conjugates with respect to these two points. In this instance the involution is termed &quot;hyperbolic&quot;, while if there are no fixed points it is &quot;elliptic&quot;. In the context of projectivities, fixed points are called double points.

Another type of involution occurring in projective geometry is a polarity that is a correlation of period 2.

=== Linear algebra ===

In linear algebra, an involution is a linear operator on a vector space, such that . Except for in characteristic 2, such operators are diagonalizable for a given basis with just s and s on the diagonal of the corresponding matrix. If the operator is orthogonal (an orthogonal involution), it is orthonormally diagonalizable.

For example, suppose that a basis for a vector space is chosen, and that and are basis elements. There exists a linear transformation that sends to , and sends to , and that is the identity on all other basis vectors. It can be checked that for all in . That is, is an involution of .

For a specific basis, any linear operator can be represented by a matrix . Every matrix has a transpose, obtained by swapping rows for columns. This transposition is an involution on the set of matrices. Since elementwise complex conjugation is an independent involution, the conjugate transpose or Hermitian adjoint is also an involution.

The definition of involution extends readily to modules. Given a module over a ring , an endomorphism of is called an involution if is the identity homomorphism on .

Involutions are related to idempotents; if is invertible then they correspond in a one-to-one manner.

In functional analysis, Banach *-algebras and C*-algebras are special types of Banach algebras with involutions.

=== Quaternion algebra, groups, semigroups ===
In a quaternion algebra, an (anti-)involution is defined by the following axioms: if we consider a transformation formula_8 then it is an involution if
* formula_9 (it is its own inverse)
* formula_10 and formula_11 (it is linear)
* formula_12

An anti-involution does not obey the last axiom but instead
* formula_13

This former law is sometimes called antidistributive. It also appears in groups as . Taken as an axiom, it leads to the notion of semigroup with involution, of which there are natural examples that are not groups, for example square matrix multiplication (i.e. the full linear monoid) with transpose as the involution.

=== Ring theory ===

In ring theory, the word &quot;involution&quot; is customarily taken to mean an antihomomorphism that is its own inverse function.
Examples of involutions in common rings:
* complex conjugation on the complex plane, and its equivalent in the split-complex numbers
* taking the transpose in a matrix ring.

=== Group theory ===
In group theory, an element of a group is an involution if it has order 2; that is, an involution is an element such that and , where is the identity element.
Originally, this definition agreed with the first definition above, since members of groups were always bijections from a set into itself; that is, &quot;group&quot; was taken to mean &quot;permutation group&quot;. By the end of the 19th century, &quot;group&quot; was defined more broadly, and accordingly so was &quot;involution&quot;.

A permutation is an involution if and only if it can be written as a finite product of disjoint transpositions.

The involutions of a group have a large impact on the group&#x27;s structure. The study of involutions was instrumental in the classification of finite simple groups.

An element of a group is called strongly real if there is an involution with  (where ).

Coxeter groups are groups generated by a set of involutions subject only to relations involving powers of pairs of elements of . Coxeter groups can be used, among other things, to describe the possible regular polyhedra and their generalizations to higher dimensions.

=== Mathematical logic ===
The operation of complement in Boolean algebras is an involution. Accordingly, negation in classical logic satisfies the &quot;law of double negation&quot;: is equivalent to .

Generally in non-classical logics, negation that satisfies the law of double negation is called &quot;involutive&quot;. In algebraic semantics, such a negation is realized as an involution on the algebra of truth values. Examples of logics that have involutive negation are Kleene and Bochvar three-valued logics, Łukasiewicz many-valued logic, the fuzzy logic &#x27;involutive monoidal t-norm logic&#x27; (IMTL), etc. Involutive negation is sometimes added as an additional connective to logics with non-involutive negation; this is usual, for example, in t-norm fuzzy logics.

The involutiveness of negation is an important characterization property for logics and the corresponding varieties of algebras. For instance, involutive negation characterizes Boolean algebras among Heyting algebras. Correspondingly, classical Boolean logic arises by adding the law of double negation to intuitionistic logic. The same relationship holds also between MV-algebras and BL-algebras (and so correspondingly between Łukasiewicz logic and fuzzy logic BL), IMTL and MTL, and other pairs of important varieties of algebras (respectively, corresponding logics).

In the study of binary relations, every relation has a converse relation. Since the converse of the converse is the original relation, the conversion operation is an involution on the category of relations. Binary relations are ordered through inclusion. While this ordering is reversed with the complementation involution, it is preserved under conversion.

=== Computer science ===
The XOR bitwise operation with a given value for one parameter is an involution on the other parameter. XOR masks in some instances were used to draw graphics on images in such a way that drawing them twice on the background reverts the background to its original state.

Two special cases of this, which are also involutions, are the bitwise NOT operation which is XOR with an all-ones value, and stream cipher encryption, which is an XOR with a secret keystream.

This predates binary computers; practically all mechanical cipher machines implement a reciprocal cipher, an involution on each typed-in letter.
Instead of designing two kinds of machines, one for encrypting and one for decrypting, all the machines can be identical and can be set up (keyed) the same way.

Another involution used in computers is an order-2 bitwise permutation. For example. a color value stored as integers in the form , could exchange and , resulting in the form : .
=== Physics ===
Legendre transformation, which converts between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, is an involutive operation. 

Integrability, a central notion of physics and in particular the subfield of integrable systems, is closely related to involution, for example in context of Kramers–Wannier duality.

<text>The University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD; Portuguese: &quot;Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro&quot;) is a public university located in the north-eastern city of Vila Real, Portugal.

It became a public university in 1986, although its history also includes a heritage received from its predecessor, the &quot;Polytechnic Institute of Vila Real&quot;, created in 1973. This Institute took on a relevant role in the development of the region, and in September 1979, it was converted into the &quot;University Institute of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro&quot;. It was due to the intense activity in the fields of teaching and scientific and technological research that, less than ten years later, the government granted its status as a qualified University.

== Organization ==
The University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto includes four university schools and one polytechnic school:
*School of Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences (ECAV; Portuguese: &quot;Escola de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias&quot;)
*School of Sciences and Technology (ECT; Portuguese: &quot;Escola de Ciências e Tecnologias&quot;)
*School of Life and Environmental Sciences (ECVA; Portuguese: &quot;Escola de Ciências da Vida e do Ambiente&quot;)
*School of Human and Social Sciences (ECHS; Portuguese: &quot;Escola de Ciências Humanas e Sociais&quot;)
*School of Health (ESS; Portuguese: &quot;Escola Superior de Saúde&quot;) - polytechnic.

== Academic programs ==

=== Bachelor degrees ===
All BAs listed below are at major level. The Portuguese-language title, &quot;Licenciatura&quot;, indicates that they confer an automatic Licensure for working in a particular profession. In spite of this, some professions may additionally require enrolling in specific professional orders. All engineering, architecture, and medical degrees of the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro are recognised (&quot;reconhecidos&quot;) by these professional orders, and students completing a Bachelor of Arts at this university are exempted from additional examinations for access to those orders. Both university and polytechnic types of degree are awarded in UTAD, however, most are University.

The Nursing degree is given at the School of Health (ESS; Portuguese: &quot;Escola Superior de Saúde&quot;).

<doc id="293463" wikidata="Q8988" url="?curid=293463" title="Southampton Airport">
<text>Southampton Airport is an international airport located in both Eastleigh and Southampton, Hampshire, in England. The airport is located north-northeast of central Southampton. The southern tip of the runway lies within the Southampton unitary authority boundary with most of the airport, including all of the buildings, within the Borough of Eastleigh.

The airport handled nearly two million passengers during 2016, an 8.8% increase compared with 2015, making it the 18th busiest airport in the UK. Southampton Airport has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P690) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. The airport is owned and operated by AGS Airports, which also owns and operates Aberdeen and Glasgow airports. It was previously owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings (formerly known as BAA).

Up to March 2020, 95% of the flights from Southampton were operated by Flybe. However, the airline went into administration on 5 March 2020 with all flights cancelled. When Flybe was purchased and relaunched, it was announced that they would start serving Southampton Airport from the 23 July 2022. The reincarnated Flybe ultimately ceased operations nine months after its relaunch.

==History==
Aviation began at the site in 1910 when pioneer pilot Edwin Rowland Moon used the meadows belonging to North Stoneham Farm as a takeoff and landing spot for his monoplane, Moonbeam Mk II. The site became known as Eastleigh Airfield.

===First World War===
The Royal Flying Corps earmarked the site as an aircraft acceptance base during the First World War, but when forces from the United States Navy Air Service (NAS) arrived in 1917 it was handed over to them and designated NAS Eastleigh. Work on the building of hangars which had begun under the Royal Flying Corps was accelerated. At the peak of the American presence, some 4,000 officers and men were billeted in tents and huts along the adjacent London to Southampton railway line.

===Inter-War years===
After the war, the site became a transit camp for refugees, mainly Russian, who wished to sail to America from the port of Southampton. Shipping companies Cunard and White Star Line (the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company), together with the Canadian Pacific Railway, formed the Atlantic Park Hostel Company to house them temporarily. In 1921, the hangars were converted into dormitories, kitchens and dining rooms.

The hostel was intended as a short-term clearing house for those trans-migrants changing ships, but following changes to United States immigration law which restricted entry under national origins quotas, some residents were forced to stay much longer. In 1924 about 980 Ukrainian Jewish would-be emigrants were cared for at the hostel. Some of them were still there seven years later, stranded between the US and UK which would not accept them, and unable to return to the countries they had fled. Atlantic Park had a school, library, and synagogue; the refugees formed football teams that played local sides and took part in local events, such as Eastleigh carnival. At the height of its use, 20,000 passed through Atlantic Park in 1928 but then numbers started to fall away, leading to the closure of the hostel in 1931.

In 1932, Southampton Corporation purchased the site, and it became Southampton Municipal Airport. This was allowed for by the &quot;Southampton Corporation Act 1931&quot;, which allowed for the creation of a public aerodrome. By 1935, part of the site was being used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was briefly known as RAF Eastleigh before it became RAF Southampton in 1936. Also in 1936, Supermarine opened a flight test facility on the site and built a large new Flight Shed at the south end of the aerodrome in 1937-38, and construction of the vast Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft factory between this and Wide Lane soon followed. The latter factory was better known post-war for production of the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Transit vans until this finally closed in 2013 - leaving only the almost forgotten Supermarine Flight Shed which had accommodated so many Spitfires locally before their first flights and deliveries to the RAF. Sadly, despite its obvious historical significance, this 84-year-old building is now set for demolition and redevelopment with modern industrial units.

===Second World War===
The first test flight of the Supermarine Spitfire took place at the airport on 5 March 1936, an event commemorated in 2004 by the erection of a two-thirds-size sculpture of K5054, the prototype Spitfire, at the road entrance. On 5 March 2006, five restored Spitfires took off from Southampton Airport to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the first test flight of the Spitfire. The local council wanted to rename the airport after R. J. Mitchell, designer of the Spitfire. However, the airport owner at the time, Heathrow Airport Holdings, did not agree.

The military site was transferred to naval command in 1939, renamed RNAS Eastleigh (HMS Raven), and spent most of the war in a ground and air training role for the Royal Navy. Owing to the &#x27;HMS&#x27; designation in the airport&#x27;s name, Nazi propaganda inaccurately reported that HMS Raven had been sunk when a bombing raid hit the airport. It passed back into civilian ownership in April 1946.

=== Development after the Second World War ===
The Cierva Autogiro Company rented portions of the Cunliffe-Owen plants from 1946, but had to move to another location on the field when it was acquired by Briggs. In 1951, Saunders-Roe took over the interests of Cierva Autogyro and built a rotor testing building on the eastern side of the airfield, which is now derelict. They continued operations on the field until about 1960.

During the 1950s, a mainstay of business for the airport was the cross-channel car ferry service operated by Silver City Airways using Bristol Freighters and Superfreighters.

In 1959, Southampton (Eastleigh) Airport was purchased by racing pilot J.N. &#x27;Nat&#x27; Somers, who laid the foundation for the regional airport that exists today by building the concrete runway in 1963 and negotiating with British Rail to build Southampton Airport Parkway railway station next to the airport. Somers also worked with the Department of Transport to plan for the new M27 motorway to pass through the airport just south of the runway and north of Ford&#x27;s plant, at the same time installing a major roundabout outside the airport. This forward-thinking programme encouraged most of the airlines at Bournemouth (Hurn) airport to move to Southampton in the mid-1960s. In 1988 Somers&#x27; company sold the airport to Peter de Savary, who a few years later sold it to the owners of London Heathrow.

In 1993, construction of a new terminal began after an investment of £27 million by BAA. It was completed in 1994 and opened by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, the airport reached one million passengers.

In 2010, the airport arranged a series of events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first flight at the airport. In 2012, the Olympic flame visited the airport as part of the torch relay for the 2012 Olympics, in London. In October 2014, Heathrow Airport Holdings reached an agreement to sell the airport, together with those at Glasgow and Aberdeen, for £1 billion to AGS Airports, a consortium of Ferrovial and Macquarie Group.

In 2016 the airport won the &quot;Airport of the Year&quot; award of the European Regional Airlines Association, having demonstrated extraordinary involvement with the local community and reducing its carbon footprint, whilst growing and expanding in a highly competitive market. In March of the same year, Aer Lingus Regional announced it would fly from Southampton to Cork Airport with an ATR 72, operated by Stobart Air. In 2017, the airport reached two million passengers. In 2019 Southampton was ranked third of 30 airports in the UK for customer satisfaction by &quot;Which?&quot; magazine, with a score of 77%. On 5 June Air Force One touched down in Southampton carrying then president, Donald Trump. He then travelled to Portsmouth to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The Boeing 757 was the biggest jet ever to visit Southampton.

On the 9 December 2020, British Airways (BA CityFlyer) announced they would fly to 13 destinations, mainly holiday destinations, to Spain, Portugal, France, Austria, Italy and Greece. These flights filled the void left by Flybe.

On the 25 May 2023, easyJet announced that they would start flying to two domestic destinations, with twice weekly flights to Glasgow and thrice weekly flights to Belfast International starting at the end of October. On the 7 November 2023, easyJet yet again announced they would start flying to two summer destinations, those being Faro once a week and Alicante once a week. Not long after, easyJet announced the third summer route, a twice weekly service to Palma de Mallorca.

==Operations==

=== Terminal ===
Southampton Airport has one terminal which has twelve stands. None of the stands are equipped with jet bridges. Inside the terminal, there are thirteen check-in desks. Facilities include coffee shops, bars, stationers, a duty-free shop and an upstairs lounge.

=== Airfield ===
Southampton Airport has one main ground handler, Swissport (Servisair), who took over from Aviance. They handle all passenger services and apron operations for all airlines except for Aurigny Air Services who operate their own ground handling.

Southampton has one asphalt runway. Historically, there were three runways: one following the current one, one intersecting the current runway at 90 degrees at the north side of the airfield, and one which crossed through the middle of the current runway. It is clearly visible where the northern runway was: it is why there is a panhandle at the northeast of the airfield. All these runways were grass. The only remaining runway is 02/20 which is now 1887 metres long and 37 metres wide. Only runway 20 has an Instrument Landing System. 02 has VOR/DME and NDB. Visual approach is allowed on both 02 and 20. The airport must close from 23:00 to 06:00, but can operate ten flights monthly between those times. Helicopters are heavily restricted.

In September 2019, the airport announced plans to extend its runway north by 164m to allow it to support larger aircraft which would enable longer routes. The airport stated aims to increase passenger numbers from 2 million to 5 million by 2037. The managing director for Southampton Airport claimed that if the runway extension is not approved, the airport may have to close in 2021. Work commenced on the 164m runway extension on 31 March 2023. The new 164m runway extension became operational on 15 August 2023 with an official opening on 21 September. Attendees included then Aviation Minister Baroness Vere as well as then MP for Eastleigh, Paul Holmes.

==Ground transport==

=== Rail ===
Southampton Airport has a dedicated mainline railway station, . It is on the South West Main Line from (66 minutes away) to Winchester (15 minutes away), Southampton (city centre about 7 minutes away), Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and Weymouth, with a fast and frequent service to those places. The station is a 60-second walk from the terminal, one of the closest airport links in Europe.

=== Bus ===
Unilink buses run to Southampton city centre every 10–15 minutes throughout the day and take about 45 minutes; taxis are available outside Arrivals. Bluestar also runs services between Eastleigh and Hedge End aboard their 24 service hourly on the southside of the train station.

=== Motorway ===
The airport is near the junction between the M3 motorway and M27 motorway, giving easy road access to Southampton, Winchester, Bournemouth, Poole, Portsmouth and places between.

=== Bicycle ===
Southampton Airport has designated parking and storage for bicycles. Southampton cycle route 7 is proposed to run just outside the airport, giving it a direct cycle path to the city centre. National Cycle Route 23 also runs outside the airport, running between Southampton and Reading via Basingstoke, Alresford, Winchester and Eastleigh.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390 suffered an explosive decompression over Didcot, Oxfordshire while flying from Birmingham to Málaga, Spain. With captain Tim Lancaster sucked halfway out of the cockpit, co-pilot Alastair Atchison managed to land the plane safely at Southampton with no fatalities. Two crew members including Lancaster were seriously injured, but all passengers were unharmed. This accident appeared on the National Geographic television programme &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; (known as &quot;Mayday&quot; in some countries).
* On 26 May 1993, a Cessna 550 Citation II landed with a tailwind of , while the operating manual recommended a maximum safe tailwind of ; this resulted in a landing distance requirement greater than that available at the airport. The plane overran the runway through the airport perimeter fence and onto the M27 motorway where it collided with two cars and caught fire. The two flight crew sustained minor whiplash injuries, and the three car occupants also sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was destroyed.

==Notes==
* The airport has a Southampton address, but is located in both Eastleigh and Southampton. Administrative authority is divided between Southampton City Council and Eastleigh Borough Council.

<doc id="293465" wikidata="Q2283886" url="?curid=293465" title="Pulp and paper industry">
<text>The pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood, specifically pulpwood, as raw material and produce pulp, paper, paperboard, and other cellulose-based products. 

== Manufacturing process ==
In the manufacturing process, pulp is introduced into a paper machine where it is shaped into a paper web and water is extracted through pressing and drying stages.
Pressing involves removing water from the sheet by applying force. This process employs a specialized type of felt, distinct from traditional felt, to absorb the water. In contrast, hand-made paper uses a blotter sheet for this purpose.
Drying involves eliminating water from the paper sheets through air or heat. Historically, this was achieved by hanging the sheets to dry, similar to laundry. In modern papermaking, various heated drying mechanisms are employed, with the steam-heated can dryer being the most prevalent on paper machines.

==History==
Papermaking as a craft is ancient, and for centuries it used various fibers, mainly grasses (cereal straws and others), or rags from old clothing made from them, in various preindustrial times and places. The commercial planting of domesticated mulberry trees to make pulp for papermaking is attested as early as the 6th century. Due to advances in printing technology, the Chinese paper industry continued to grow under the Song dynasty to meet the rising demand for printed books. Demand for paper was also stimulated by the Song government, which needed a large supply of paper to print paper money and exchange certificates.

An example of an enterprising paper mill during the late phase of the preindustrial era is the mill by William Rittenhouse and sons at what is now preserved as Historic Rittenhouse Town in Pennsylvania. 

The first mechanized paper machine was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill, Apsley, Hertfordshire in 1803, followed by another in 1804. The site operates currently as a museum.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the paper chemical technologies for making the pulp from wood rather than grasses underwent some major industrial-era upgrades, as first the soda pulping process and then the Kraft process helped reduce the unit cost of paper manufacture. This made paper newly abundant, and along with continual advancements in printing press technologies, as well as in transport technologies (for distribution), during these same centuries, led to greatly increased sales and circulation of newspapers, other periodicals, and books of every kind.

==Environmental effects==
The pulp and paper industry has been criticized by environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council for unsustainable deforestation and clearcutting of old-growth forest. The industry trend is to expand globally to countries like Russia, China and Indonesia with low wages and low environmental oversight. According to Greenpeace, farmers in Central America illegally rip up vast tracts of native forest for cattle and soybean production without any consequences, and companies who buy timber from private land owners contribute to massive deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest. On the other hand, the situation is quite different where forest growth has been on the increase for a number of years. It is estimated for instance that since 1990 forests have grown in Europe by 17 million hectares, which has been supported through the practice of sustainable forest management by the industry. In Sweden, for every tree that is felled, two are planted.

The pulp and paper industry consumes a significant amount of water and energy and produces wastewater with a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), among other contaminants. Recent studies underline coagulation as an appropriate pre-treatment of pulp and paper industrial wastewater and as a cost-effective solution for the removal of COD and the reduction of pressures on the aquatic environment.

==Current production volumes and sales==
The industry is dominated by North American (United States and Canada), northern European (Finland, Sweden, and North-West Russia) and East Asian countries (such as East Siberian Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea). Australasia and Brazil also have significant pulp and paper enterprises. The industry also has a significant presence in a number of European countries including Germany, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. The United States had been the world&#x27;s leading producer of paper until it was overtaken by China in 2009.

===List of main countries by production quantity===
According to data from Statista, 
China produced 110 million metric tons in 2018 followed by the US with 72 million.

According to statistic data by RISI, main producing countries of paper and paperboard, not including pulp, in the world are as follows:


===List of main company groups by production quantity===
The world&#x27;s main paper and paperboard company groups are as follows. (Some figures are estimates.):

===List by net sales===
In 2008, the top 10 forest, paper and packaging products companies were, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers:

==Manufacturers and suppliers for the industry==

<text>Powell Foulk Clayton (August 7, 1833August 25, 1914) was an American politician, diplomat, and businessman who served as the 9th governor of Arkansas from 1868 to 1871, as a Republican United States Senator for Arkansas from 1871 to 1877 and as United States Ambassador to Mexico from 1897 to 1905.

During the American Civil War, he served as a senior officer of United States Volunteers and commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. After the war, he married a woman from Arkansas, purchased a plantation and settled in Jefferson County. He was active in the Arkansas Republican Party and became governor after military rule was lifted and the Arkansas state constitution was ratified by Congress. He was viewed as a carpetbagger and implemented martial law in Arkansas for four months due to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and violence against African-Americans and Republicans. The Arkansas Republican Party splintered during Clayton&#x27;s governorship. Clayton and his followers were known as Minstrels and a more conservative faction led by Joseph Brooks were known as Brindletails. The power struggle between the groups resulted in the impeachment of Clayton in 1871 and the Brooks-Baxter War.

Clayton was elected to the U.S. Senate for Arkansas in March 1871. A U.S. Senate Joint Select Committee investigated him for claims made by his political rivals that he issued fraudulent election credentials during his time as governor. He was acquitted of these charges. In 1877, the legislature came under the control of Democrats after Reconstruction, who voted to replace Clayton. He returned to Arkansas from Washington, D.C., where he remained active in the Republican National Committee. He helped William McKinley receive the Republican nomination for president in 1896. After McKinley&#x27;s victory, Clayton was rewarded for his support with an appointment as Ambassador to Mexico.

In 1882, Clayton established a home in the developing resort town of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. He was president of the Eureka Springs Improvement Company and worked to develop commercial and residential properties. In 1883, he became president of the Eureka Springs Railroad, which provided rail service to the developing community. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1914 and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life and career==
Powell Foulk Clayton was born in Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, to John and Ann (Clarke) Clayton. The Clayton family was descended from early Quaker settlers of Pennsylvania. Clayton&#x27;s ancestor William Clayton emigrated from Chichester, England, was a personal friend and associate of William Penn, and was appointed as one of nine justices who sat at the Upland Court in 1681.

Clayton attended the Forwood School in Wilmington, Delaware and the Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy in Bristol, Pennsylvania. He later studied civil engineering in Wilmington.

In 1855, he moved to Kansas to work as a surveyor. He speculated in land in Kansas. He entered politics when he successfully ran for the office of city engineer in Leavenworth, Kansas, in either 1859 or 1860.

==American Civil War==

In May 1861 Clayton was formally mustered into the U.S. Volunteers as a captain of Company E in the 1st Kansas Infantry. During the war he served primarily in Arkansas and Missouri and fought in several battles in those states. In August 1861, Clayton received a commendation for his leadership when his unit saw action in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek in Missouri. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 5th Kansas Cavalry in December 1861 and to colonel in March 1862.

At the Battle of Helena in Arkansas on July 4, 1863, Clayton was in charge of the cavalry brigade on the right flank of the Union forces. He received commendations for his actions during the battle. In August and September 1863, Clayton&#x27;s regiment accompanied Major General Frederick Steele&#x27;s troops in the campaign against Little Rock.

In October 1863, Clayton commanded federal troops occupying Pine Bluff, Arkansas, using the Boone-Murphy House as his headquarters. During the Battle of Pine Bluff, he successfully repulsed a three-pronged Confederate attack of the forces of Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke. During the battle, his troops piled cotton bales around the Jefferson County Courthouse and surrounding streets to make a barricade for the Union defenders. He also made several forays around Little Rock, including to support Steele during the Camden Expedition in the spring of 1864.

Clayton was idolized by his men and respected by his enemies. John Edwards, a Confederate officer in Joseph O. Shelby&#x27;s command wrote: &quot;Colonel Clayton was an officer of activity and enterprise, clear-headed, quick to conceive, and bold and rapid to execute. His success in the field has caused him...to be considered the ablest Federal commander of Cavalry west of the Mississippi.&quot;

Clayton was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers on August 1, 1864. When he was mustered out of the service in August 1865, he commanded the cavalry division of the Seventh Army Corps. While still in command at Pine Bluff, Clayton invested in cotton. He acquired enough funds to purchase a plantation in Jefferson County, Arkansas, where he resided after the war.

After the war, Clayton became a Companion of the First Class of the Missouri Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Political career==

===Governor of Arkansas: 1868–1871===
In 1867, Clayton participated in the formation of the Arkansas Republican party. He entered Arkansas politics due his belief that Unionists needed additional protection after several confrontations with ex-Rebels on his plantation.

In 1866, Democrats took control of the state legislature and nominated two U.S. Senators. However, the Republican-controlled Congress refused to seat them. In March 1867, Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 declaring the governments of Arkansas and nine other former Confederate states illegal and requiring those states to adopt new constitutions providing civil rights to freedmen. Military rule was established across the South during Congressional Reconstruction. General Edward Ord was appointed military governor of the Fourth Military District which included Arkansas. The Arkansas legislature was disbanded and Ord called for a constitutional convention.

Most of the delegates to the 1868 constitutional convention were Republican since few Democrats could take the &quot;ironclad oath&quot; that they had not served in the Confederacy, or provided aid or comfort to the enemy. Although Clayton was not a delegate to the constitutional convention, he did participate in the Republican state nominating convention which was meeting at the same time.

Clayton was selected as the Republican gubernatorial nominee and James M. Johnson as the candidate for lieutenant governor.

The ratification of the 1868 constitution, providing civil rights and the vote to freedmen, produced a furor among Democrats, who adhered to white supremacist beliefs. That Spring the Ku Klux Klan arose in Arkansas, and was responsible for more than 200 murders leading up to the 1868 election.

On April 1, 1868, the state board of election commissioners announced ratification of the constitution and Clayton&#x27;s election as Governor of Arkansas. Congress accepted the Arkansas constitution of 1868 as legal. Democratic President Andrew Johnson (who had succeeded to office following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination) vetoed it, but the Republican-dominated Congress overrode his veto. The state was readmitted to representation in Congress when Clayton was inaugurated as Governor on July 2, 1868. The new legislature unanimously accepted the Fourteenth Amendment, and Congress declared Arkansas reconstructed.

As governor, Clayton faced fierce opposition from the state&#x27;s conservative political leaders and violence against blacks and members of the Republican party led by the Ku Klux Klan. During this time Arkansas Republican Congressman James Hinds was attacked and killed while on his way to a political event, and Clayton survived an attempt on his life. An agent of Clayton was killed by a group of men led by Dandridge McRae and Jacob Frolich, the leaders of the White County, Arkansas chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. Clayton responded aggressively to the emergence of the Klan in Arkansas by declaring martial law in fourteen counties for four months in late 1868 and early 1869. Clayton organized the state militia and placed General Daniel Phillips Upham in charge to help suppress violence throughout the state.

During his three-year term as governor, Clayton and the Republicans in the legislature passed many laws to improve Arkansas. State bonds were issued to fund the construction of several railroads throughout the state. The first ever free public school system in Arkansas was initiated during Clayton&#x27;s governorship. The Clayton administration also established Arkansas Industrial University, the Arkansas School for the Deaf, and relocated the Arkansas School for the Blind.

===Brooks-Baxter War===

During Clayton&#x27;s Reconstruction governorship, the Arkansas Republican party splintered in the face of serious opposition from conservatives. Clayton and his supporters were known locally as &quot;Minstrels&quot;, they dominated the Republican party and were able to secure recognition from the National Republican organization and control the federal patronage in the state. This position garnered Clayton few friends at the state Republican party level and he faced repeated challenges to his leadership. The affair has become known as the Brooks-Baxter War.

In 1868, Joseph Brooks who had been a partner with Clayton in the formation of the Arkansas Republican party, broke with Clayton and formed a faction known as the &quot;Brindletails&quot;. Brooks&#x27; opposition to Clayton developed partly due to Clayton&#x27;s increasingly moderate stance toward ex-Confederates but also due to Clayton&#x27;s displacement of Brooks as leader of the Arkansas Republican party.

In 1869, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson charged Clayton with corruption in the issuance of railroad bonds and misuse of power in his program to suppress violence. The supporters of Johnson, mostly white Republicans from Northwest Arkansas called themselves Liberal Republicans. The Brindletails impeached Clayton in 1871; however, the legislature never heard the case against him and he withstood the challenge.

===U.S. Senator: 1871–1877===
In January 1871, the Arkansas legislature elected Clayton to the United States Senate which initiated another controversy of Clayton&#x27;s administration. Clayton did not want to accept the Senate seat and have his political opponent and lieutenant governor James M. Johnson succeed him as governor. Instead, Clayton refused the Senate position and negotiated Johnson&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of State of Arkansas and replaced Johnson with Ozra Hadley. In March 1871, the legislature again elected Clayton to the U.S. Senate which he accepted this time.

He served as chairman on the Committee on Enrolled Bills and on the Committee on Civil Service Retrenchment.

In January 1872, the U.S. Senate Joint Select Committee to Inquire into the Condition of the Late Insurrectionary States heard testimony raising questions about Clayton&#x27;s behavior and integrity as governor. A United States district attorney testified that in April 1871, after Clayton became U.S. Senator, a grand jury had indicted him on charges that as governor Clayton issued fraudulent election credentials for the U.S. House of Representatives election to John Edwards.

In response to these allegations, Clayton contended that in eight precincts, there had been two separate sets of polls. One set was overseen by authorized judges and the other under the unauthorized control of opposing political factions. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the legal election had been held at the authorized polling places and that returns from the others were fraudulent. As governor, Clayton discarded the returns from the fraudulent polling places and certified the candidate who won from the genuine votes. The opposing candidate, Thomas Boles, contested the election and replaced John Edwards in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 1872.

The committee judged the issue to be beyond its jurisdiction and turned the matter over to the Senate. At Clayton&#x27;s request, the Senate appointed a special three-member committee to investigate the charges. In June 1872, after interviewing thirty-eight witnesses and generating five thousand pages of transcript, the committee issued a partial report indicating that the testimony appeared to not sustain the charges against Clayton. The committee noted that the charges came from Clayton&#x27;s bitter political rivals and that the indictment against Clayton had been dropped due to lack of evidence. However, the committee members stated that they required additional time and would issue a final report in the next session of the Senate.

In February 1873, the committee issued its final report declaring that the testimony failed to sustain the charges against Clayton and that there was no evidence that he had any fraudulent intent in certifying the election of Edwards as directed by the state supreme court. The Senate voted 33 to 6 to accept the committee&#x27;s findings. Nine senators, mostly Democrats, abstained from voting on the grounds that they were not given enough time to sufficiently review all of the testimony.

While in the Senate, Clayton appealed to his brother, W. H. H. Clayton, the US Attorney in Arkansas, and President Ulysses S. Grant to have Judge Isaac C. Parker reassigned from Utah to Fort Smith, Arkansas, a frontier area with a high rate of violence and crime. Parker, the legendary &quot;Hanging Judge,&quot; along with U.S. Attorney Clayton, are credited with bringing law and order to the region.

In 1877, Clayton lost his Senate seat since the legislature, now dominated by Democrats elected one of their own to the Senate. Clayton moved back to Little Rock, Arkansas where he resumed his law practice and supported economic development.

==Later life and death==
In 1882, Clayton established a home at the developing resort town of Eureka Springs in Carroll County in northwestern Arkansas. He and his wife lived in what is now the Crescent Cottage Inn. As president of the Eureka Springs Improvement Company (ESIC), Clayton worked to develop commercial and residential structures, many which still exist. ESIC sponsored the development of the Eureka Springs Railroad which was key to making the resort accessible to tourists. The ESIC also built the Crescent Hotel, now one of Eureka Springs&#x27; most notable landmarks. A poem on the fireplace in the lobby of the Crescent Hotel is attributed to Clayton. In 1883, Clayton became the president of the Eureka Springs Railway, which provided service to the resort community until 1889, when it was merged into what became the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad. The now-defunct railroad line provided passenger and freight service from Joplin, Missouri, to Helena in Phillips County in eastern Arkansas.

Clayton remained active in the Republican Party. He became a member of the Republican National Committee in 1872 and was still consulted to fill federal patronage positions through 1912. In 1896 and 1897, as a member of the Republican National Committee, he was instrumental in delivering votes from the entire Arkansas delegation for William McKinley&#x27;s Republican nomination as president. Clayton also led the Republican speakers&#x27; bureau for the East Coast. He was appointed as the first ambassador to Mexico by President McKinley when that post was elevated to an embassy post and served until 1905. After resigning as Ambassador of Mexico, he lived in Washington, D.C. but was still able to manage multiple businesses and enterprises in Arkansas. He continued to do this, as well as preserving his status in the Republican party. He died in Washington, D.C., on August 25, 1914, and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==Personal life==
On December 14, 1865, Clayton married Adaline McGraw of Helena, Arkansas. Together they had three daughters and two sons although one son died in early infancy. Their son, Powell Clayton, Jr., became a major in the 16th United States Cavalry and is also buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Two of Clayton&#x27;s daughters married diplomats from Belgium and England. On September 9, 1868, Clayton lost his left hand while hunting outside Little Rock when his rifle discharged.

Clayton had two twin brothers, W. H. H. Clayton and John M. Clayton. These three men made their careers in Arkansas. William was appointed as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and served as the chief prosecutor in the court of &quot;hanging judge&quot; Isaac C. Parker for 14 years. John was elected as an Arkansas Congressman, Arkansas State Senator and U.S. Congressman-elect. John was assassinated in 1889 in Plumerville, Arkansas. He had disputed the election results of a Congressional race with Democrat Clifton R. Breckinridge and was shot through the window of the boarding-house where he was staying. Clayton&#x27;s brother Thomas J. Clayton, became a prominent Philadelphia lawyer and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania for Delaware County, serving for 25 years.

<text>Stora Enso Oyj (from and ) is a Finnish and Swedish forest industry company. It develops and produces various materials, mostly based on wood, for a range of industries and applications worldwide. It has headquarters in Helsinki, Finland, and Stockholm, Sweden. The majority of sales takes place in Europe, but there are also significant operations in Asia and South America. Stora Enso was formed in 1998, when the Swedish mining and forestry products company Stora AB merged with the Finnish forestry products company Enso Oyj. In 2023, there were 20,000 employees. In 2015, Stora Enso was ranked seventh in the world by sales and fourth by earnings, among forest, paper and packaging industry companies. For the first two quarters of 2018, the company was ranked second by net earnings among European forest and paper industry companies. The corporate history can be traced back to the oldest known preserved share certificate in the world, issued in 1288 by &quot;Stora Kopparberg&quot;. Based on this, some observers consider Stora Enso to be the oldest limited liability company in the world.

== History ==
Stora Enso was formed by the merger of Swedish mining and forestry products company Stora and Finnish forestry products company Enso Oyj in 1998.

=== History of Stora ===
The oldest preserved share in the Swedish copper mining company &quot;Stora Kopparberg&quot; (Falun Mine) in Falun was issued in 1288. It granted the Bishop of Västerås 1/8th (12.5%) ownership, and it is also the oldest known preserved share in any company in the world. The corporate status of the company was further recognized in 1347, when King Magnus IV of Sweden granted it a charter. Some observers consider that these facts make Stora and its successor Stora Enso the oldest existing corporation or limited liability company in the world.

For some periods during the 17th century, the mine provided two thirds of the world production of copper. In the 18th century, the copper mining gradually decreased in importance, and therefore, in 1731, the company bought its first iron ore mine. By the 1860s, iron ore was economically more important to the company than copper.

&quot;Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB&quot; was incorporated as a modern shareholder company in 1862. Towards the end of the 19th century, it diversified from mining and entered pulp and paper production. In the 1970s, most of the mining and steel mill operations of the company were divested, and the focus changed to forestry-related activities. In 1984, the company name was shortened to &quot;Stora AB&quot;. The copper mine closed down in 1992.

In 1997, the year before the merger with Enso, Stora had 20,400 employees and a turnover of 44.5 billion SEK. The company owned 2.3 million hectares of forest of which 1.6 million hectares (an area larger than Connecticut) in Sweden and the rest in Canada, Portugal and Brazil. It also produced 7.5 TWh of mostly hydroelectric power.

A 1997 article in Harvard Business Review praised Stora&#x27;s ability to adapt to changing circumstances over the centuries.

In 1998, the company merged with Enso to form Stora Enso.

=== History of Enso ===
====1850–1899====
The roots of Enso go back to the 1850s, when started &quot;Wilh. Gutzeit &amp; Co.&quot; in Norway. He was a native of Königsberg who had moved to Norway to work as a secretary for his step-cousin Benjamin Wegner, an industrialist. Only one of Gutzeit&#x27;s five children survived to adulthood and thus his son started to work with him in the 1860s and inherited the company in 1869. In 1871, he started to operate in Finland, together with Lars J. Bredesen, who was from Norway too. Gutzeit started a sawmill in Kotka in November 1872 and called it W. Gutzeit &amp; Comp. In 1897, the company became a Finnish company, and its name was changed to Aktiebolaget W. Gutzeit &amp; Co.

====1900–1998====

As Gutzeit &amp; Co bought Aktiebolaget Pankakoski in 1908 and Enso Träsliperi Ab in Jääski in 1911, the board production was added to company portfolio.

In 1918, the company shares were bought by Finland which became independent in 1917, and Gutzeit became fully state owned company.

In 1924, the company headquarters were moved from Kotka to Helsinki. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Enso-Gutzeit Osakeyhtiö in 1928.

The company started to build Kaukopää mill in Imatra in 1935. At the time it was the biggest sulfate pulp mill in Europe.

Summa paper mill in Hamina was taken into use in 1955.

The company&#x27;s name was changed to Enso-Gutzeit Oy in 1981.

Enso-Gutzeit bought A. Ahlström Osakeyhtiö&#x27;s forest industries at Varkaus in 1987.

In 1993, the company bought units from Tampella, Tampella Forest Oy and Tambox Europe&#x27;s units from Finland and Sweden.

In 1996, two state owned forest companies were merged and Enso-Gutzeit Oy and Veitsiluoto Oy from North Finland became Enso Oyj.

In 1997, it acquired a majority stake in the German forestry company 

In 1998, the company merged with Stora to form Stora Enso.

=== History of Stora Enso ===
==== 1998–2009 ====
After the merger, Stora Enso expanded its operations by acquiring wood products businesses and bought paper merchant businesses in Europe. In 2000, the company bought Consolidated Papers in North America. Stora Enso also slowly expanded its operations in South America, Asia and Russia.

In 2000, Stora Enso acquired the North American pulp and paper manufacturer Consolidated Papers for EUR 4.9 billion. The acquisition has, in hindsight, been noted in the financial press as a massive value destroyer. In the same year, Stora Enso and AssiDomän formed a joint company, Billerud AB, to produce packaging paper.

In 2002, Stora Enso started investigating the possibility of establishing plantations and production facilities in Guangxi, China.

In recent years, the company has gone through heavy restructuring. The North American operations were divested in 2007 to NewPage Corporation. Stora Enso has sold and closed down some of its mills in Finland, Sweden and Germany. The closure of a plant in Kemijärvi in 2008 and subsequent events were subject to significant Finnish media coverage.

In 2009, Stora Enso entered into a joint venture in Uruguay, called Montes del Plata, with access to 250,000 hectares of woodland and the intention to build a large-capacity mill.

==== 2010–2019 ====
In 2010, Stora Enso acquired a 30 per cent stake in the Chinese printed paper packaging manufacturer Inpac.

In September 2012, Stora Enso signed an agreement with Packages Ltd., the largest packaging company of Pakistan, to set up a joint venture named Bulleh Shah Packaging (Pvt.) Ltd. at Kasur, Pakistan. The ownership stake for Stora Enso was 35 per cent. In 2017, the stake was sold back to Packages Ltd., at a loss of EUR 19 million.

Between 2006 and 2014, the share of paper products of the total sales decreased from 62 per cent to 38 per cent, while packaging and wood products increased their shares of the revenue, as the company, according to Bloomberg News, was &quot;betting on renewable packaging as online shopping grows.&quot; In 2015, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and Bloomberg News reported that Stora Enso was investing in biomaterials and renewable construction products as possible future growth areas.

By 2016 Stora Enso owned 90 per cent of Inpac.

In July 2017, the Financial Times reiterated that a focus on renewable packaging, biomaterials and construction products formed part of the strategic direction of Stora Enso, while also reporting that the revenue from paper had decreased further to 30 per cent of the total sales. It also reported that the current and foreseeable market conditions were such that forestry industry companies in general received and could be expected to receive comparatively low shares of their profits from paper production.

In 2018, Stora Enso, along with 23 other Finnish and Swedish companies, formed a joint venture named &quot;Combient&quot; for research and knowledge sharing in the areas of artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data and automation.

Examples of notable products launched in 2017–2019 were
*cardboard-based packaging under the name &quot;EcoFishBox&quot; as an alternative to polystyrene boxes for transportation of fresh fish,
*industrial-scale supply of lignin under the name &quot;Lineo&quot; as an alternative to phenol-based adhesives,
* prototypes of biodegradable drinking straws, DuraSense biocomposites which enable the use of renewable wood-based fibres which can be used as substitutes for fossil-based plastic, and
*a new retail solution which merges in-store and online shopping through RFID-enabled e-kiosks. The service is offered in co-operation with Atos.

==== 2020–present ====

In the beginning of 2020, Stora Enso started a new division called Forest. It included
*Stora Enso&#x27;s forest assets in Sweden
*the 41% share of Tornator with the majority of its forest assets located in Finland
*wood supply operations in Finland, Sweden, Russia and the Baltic countries.

In July 2021, Stora Enso informed that it was selling its RFID tag technology called ECO to Grupo CCRR.

In March 2022, Stora Enso announced its intention to sell four paper mills located in Anjala in Finland, Hylte and Nymölla in Sweden and Maxau in Germany. If no buyer could be found, the company would continue to run the mills.

=== Headquarters ===
The first Stora Enso headquarters in Helsinki was designed by Alvar Aalto as the head office of Enso-Gutzeit Oy. The building was taken into use in 1961. In 2008, Stora Enso sold the building to the German property company Deka Immobilien GmbH for €30 million and started renting the building, while also declaring its intention to move to other rented premises in the Helsinki area.

In December 2021, it was announced that the construction of Stora Enso&#x27;s new headquarters in Katajanokka had started. Other office space and a hotel were also planned for the building, which is owned by the occupational pension company Varma. The building was due to be completed in spring 2024. Stora Enso moved to a temporary headquarters in a property owned by Varma in Salmisaari.

=== Joint ventures ===

Veracel is a joint venture between Stora Enso (50 percent ownership) and Suzano Papel e Celulose in Brazil.

The five biggest owners on 31 May 2024 were:
#Solidium Oy
#FAM AB
#Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KELA)

=== Language ===

Following the merger, English became the lingua franca of the company. A study of the implications of this for the effectiveness of Stora Enso&#x27;s internal business communication, published in the academic journal Business Communication Quarterly, concluded that the analyzed communication &quot;seemed to work well&quot;.

== Controversies ==

=== Cartel ===
Metsä Group and Stora Enso were fined €500,000 for forming a cartel in 2001.

=== Accusations of wrongful accounting ===
The North American part of the group was sold in 2007 to NewPage Corporation with a net loss of about 4.12 billion dollars. According to a Swedish television documentary, there have been accusations that to cover the loss, the accounting was manipulated, which was revealed in 2010. The documentary also claims that huge dividend payments were made illegally and top management was aware of that fact and on purpose manipulated numbers to be able to pay dividends.

Gerard Goodwyn, the company&#x27;s head of accounting who spoke publicly about the accounting mistake, was fired in 2010.

In 2013, Stora Enso published a report written by independent law firms, which the company had commissioned to investigate the accusations. According to the report, the investigations performed did not find any evidence of illegal acts or wrongful financial reporting, apart from mistakes that had already been communicated and corrected by 2009. The findings of the investigations were also reported to the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, which found no reason to take further action. In articles commenting on the report, the Finnish newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; stated that they had been contacted by the source of the accusations in 2010 but that, after attempting to confirm the accusations, they had not considered that there were sufficient grounds for a news story.

=== Environmental concerns ===
Eucalyptus cultivation by Stora Enso has been discussed critically, especially in relation to the 2011 documentary film &quot;Red Forest Hotel&quot;.

Nova Scotia Forest Industries, the Canadian corporate identity of Stora Forest Industries (as it was known in the day) in 1983 was pursued in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court—case name &quot;Palmer v Nova Scotia Forest Industries&quot;—and did emerge victorious. The case went on to influence the practice of Canadian environmental law. What neighbours objected to was the spraying of the dioxin 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid Agent Orange pesticide.

=== Human rights concerns ===
The Swedish program &quot;Kalla fakta&quot; reported in 2014 that Stora Enso used child labor in its activities in Pakistan, and that the company had been aware of it since 2012. In response, the company denied that child labor existed directly in the operations of its joint venture partner in Pakistan, but admitted that it was present in its supplier networks. It stated that its partner, Bulleh Shah Packaging, was taking short-term action to remedy the situation in areas where child labor was known to exist, and was also working to mitigate child labor in the long term by addressing its root causes. In 2017, Stora Enso divested its business interest in Pakistan.

=== Legionella infection ===
In 2019, at least 32 people got infected and two people died due to legionnaires&#x27; disease after being infected by steam coming from a Legionella pneumophila contaminated cooling tower of the Stora Enso factory located in Ghent, Belgium. The cooling tower had an aerobic count of over 1,000,000, about ten times the urgent action limit of 100,000 micro-organisms per mL at 30 °C

=== Pearl mussel catastrophe ===
In August 2024, logging machines belonging to Stora Enso drove over a critical habitat for freshwater pearl mussels, protected by Finnish environmental laws, at Hukkajoki River in Suomussalmi, Finland. Thousands of these extremely endangered animals were wiped in the river crossing point and downstream. The Police is investigating the case as a severe environmental crime, and the Finnish Minister of Climate and the Environment Kai Mykkänen demanded Stora Enso to take full responsibility and to cover the caused damage and the whole Finnish forest industry to act more to protect the environment. 

== Corporate responsibility ==

In July 2014, Stora Enso started to collaborate with Save the Children around children&#x27;s rights. The collaboration concerned policies and processes with regard to supply chain issues in Pakistan.

In April 2015, Stora Enso entered into a partnership with ILO, with the aims of progressively eliminating child labor from the supply chain in Pakistan and promoting decent work conditions. The experiences in Pakistan prompted Stora Enso to appoint an executive vice president for sustainability to its group leadership team, and to include sustainability managers in its division leadership teams.

In 2016, Stora Enso qualified for inclusion on the &quot;Climate A list&quot; of the CDP environmental organization, a status awarded to 193 of 1,839 companies sampled.

Stora Enso was the main sponsor of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2017 in Lahti. The company provided the games with items made of renewable materials, including two spectator shelters built from cross laminated timber elements, which were subsequently donated to the host city.
