<text>Brentwood School is a selective, independent day and boarding school in Brentwood, Essex, England in the public school tradition. The school comprises a preparatory school, senior school and sixth form, as well as boarding provision for both boys and girls. The school is coeducational, and employs the &quot;Diamond Model&quot;. The school is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, the IAPS, and the AGBIS.

Founded in 1557 and opened in 1558, the school has a Tudor schoolroom, a Victorian chapel and several Grade II listed buildings. Situated on Ingrave Road, astride Middleton Hall Lane and Shenfield Road, the school is set in over of land in the centre of Brentwood. The current headmaster is Michael Bond.

==History==
===16th–18th century===
The licence to found the school as &quot;The Grammar School of Antony Browne, Serjeant at the Law, in Brentwood&quot; was granted by Queen Mary I to Sir Antony (or Anthony) Browne on 5 July 1558. The first schoolmaster, George Otway, was appointed on 28 July 1558.
In 1568, a year after Browne&#x27;s death, the school moved to a purpose-built schoolroom, which is extant. The commemoration stone was laid by Browne&#x27;s stepdaughter, Dorothy Huddleston, and her husband Edward, Browne&#x27;s marriage having been childless.

The school room is beside the site of the execution of nineteen-year-old William Hunter, who was burned at the stake for denying the doctrine of transubstantiation. The &quot;Martyr&#x27;s Elm&quot; grew, allegedly, on the spot of his immolation. It was Browne who, as a Justice of the Peace under Queen Mary, had sentenced Hunter. Some believe the school was founded as Browne&#x27;s penance for Hunter&#x27;s martyrdom when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne; however, the school was already in operation under Mary&#x27;s licence when Elizabeth succeeded.

Although Browne had drawn up statutes for the school, they were never legally adopted and so were re-drawn in 1622 by his descendants and John Donne, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s.

===19th century===

Brentwood School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) was founded in 1861 and so is one of the earliest CCFs in the country.

===20th century===

Sixty Old Brentwoods were killed on active service during the First World War and 173 during the Second World War. Their names are listed in the school chapel, and commemorated by the Memorial Hall for the first war and the pavilion for the second. The school was a direct grant grammar school from the 1960s until the abolition of the scheme in 1977.

Brentwood was originally a boys&#x27; school, but the Governors made the decision to allow a small number of girls to enter the sixth form in 1974. By the early 1980s there were 23 girls in the sixth form. Initially based in &quot;Newnum House&quot;, the girls&#x27; school opened in 1988, admitting girls from ages 11 to 18.

===21st century===
In 2007, Brentwood School celebrated its 450th anniversary with a commemorative service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force (CCF) celebrated its 150th anniversary on 8 October 2011 by holding a special afternoon of events featuring a Guard of Honour by Lt General Brown CBE. The Royal British Legion Youth Band of Brentwood played at the start and end of the afternoon.

In 2012, The Earl of Wessex visited the school to open the new sixth form centre, featuring a 400-seat auditorium, named &quot;The Wessex Auditorium&quot; in his honour.

==School arms==
The arms of Brentwood School are derived from those of the founder, Sir Antony Browne, and his wife.

As part of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the school&#x27;s founding, a special variant of Sir Antony Browne&#x27;s Coat of Arms was granted by the Honourable Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter Principal King of Arms and Sir John Dunamace Heaton-Armstrong, Clarenceux King of Arms on 19 July 1957. A red border was added to the arms to distinguish them as the school&#x27;s, as opposed to those of Browne.

==The school today==

===Academic===
The school is separated into three sections: the preparatory school (ages 3 to 11), the senior school (ages 11 to 16) and the sixth form (ages 16 to 18). Brentwood operates in a &quot;diamond school&quot; format, in which the preparatory school and sixth form are co-educational while the senior school teaches boys and girls separately.

Brentwood Preparatory School teaches children aged 3–11, from Nursery through to Year 6. Classes are usually small, with an average size of 20 per class. The prep school follows the National Curriculum but teaches some supplementary subjects such as French and Latin. There is also a broad extracurricular programme, which all pupils are encouraged to follow, featuring dance, drama and music, as well as sports such as hockey and golf.

The senior school teaches pupils from the age of 11 until the end of GCSE courses at 16+. Many pupils move into the senior school from the preparatory school, but others are drawn from other local primary and preparatory schools; around 1/3 of pupils join the school from the maintained sector. Admission to the senior school is by entrance examination. In addition to core subjects (English, mathematics, sciences, MFL), pupils&#x27; GCSE and IGCSE options include computer science, drama, DT, food technology, geography, Greek, history, Latin, music, RS

The sixth form is for pupils aged 1618 who are studying for &#x27;A&#x27; levels, the International Baccalaureate and BTec Extended Diploma in Sport or Business. There are currently c.300 pupils in the sixth form. &#x27;A&#x27; level options include classics, computer science, DT, economics, English literature, history, mathematics and MFL.

===Sport===
Sports offered include Association football, cricket, fencing, gymnastics, hockey, netball, rifle shooting, Rugby football, squash, swimming and tennis. School teams have met with some success over the years, for example winning the Essex Schools FA Cup three times in four seasons. In netball, the girls&#x27; U13 netball team won the 2015/6 national finals to be crowned National Champions.

In 2008 the school U13 cricket team won the National Schools Cup (Bunbury Cup), to be crowned National Champions, having finished as runners up in 2007.

The school has a 25-metre indoor swimming-pool and learner pool, a fitness suite, 4 additional squash courts and an indoor rifle range. The school is set in of grounds and has two playing-fields; one is situated directly on the school site and another, &quot;The Heseltines&quot;, adjacent to the school. These contain football, rugby, cricket and hockey pitches, an all-weather AstroTurf pitch, tennis and netball courts, an athletics track and field, and woods used for cross-country runs.

Ex-England test cricketer Geraint Jones is the school&#x27;s cricket coach.

===Drama and music===
The school hosts various theatrical performances and shows. In any academic year the theatrical line-up will include a winter/spring play/musical, a sixth-form comedy charity show and a dance show. Recent shows have included &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; and into the Woods also. Every year the school holds inter-house music and drama competitions, often with guest adjudicators.

The school has a link with Brentwood (Roman Catholic) and Chelmsford (Anglican) cathedrals; a number of pupils and staff sing in the choir of each cathedral. The music department has 5 full-time teaching staff and 20 visiting teachers. A Sibelius suite is available in the school&#x27;s music department for student and staff use. The School is one of only 14 Steinway Schools in the country, meaning that all performance and practice pianos are Steinways.

There is a symphony orchestra, brass and string ensembles, a junior choir, a choral society and a barbershop group. Recent choral performances have included &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (Walton), the Requiems of Mozart, Verdi and Fauré, and &quot;Gloria&quot; by Poulenc. The Brentwood School Big Band, which is now in its 34th year, often performs concerts for charity outside school and tours European every other year. The Big Band has released a number of albums, most recently &quot;Music to Drive By&quot; in 2013.

===Model United Nations===
Since 2013, Brentwood has hosted an annual Model United Nations (BREMUN) conference. In the past it has been a one-day conference, however since 2015 it lasted for two days. Students from schools across the south east attend and it has a capacity of approximately 200 students.

===Sir Antony Browne Society (SABS)===
SABS is a society that focuses on furthering the education of sixth formers through a series of guest speakers and debates. Junior SABS is available for the younger pupils. Regular meetings are held in Old Big School, at which students are able to experience lectures on societal issues or topics to concerning science, the arts and sport, or a members&#x27; debate. Old Brentwoods such as Jack Straw and Griff Rhys Jones are regular speakers. Other speakers have been political figures, such as George Galloway and Vicky Pryce, and the philosopher A. C. Grayling.

===Royal visits and connections===
The licence to found the school was granted by Queen Mary to Sir Antony Browne on 5 July 1558. Queen Elizabeth II visited the school in 1957 to open the new science department, now named &quot;The Queens Building&quot;, the foundation stone of which had been laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Col. Sir Francis Whitmore. The Earl of Wessex visited the school in 2011 for the opening ceremony of the new sixth form centre and the naming of the &quot;Wessex Auditorium&quot;, and later to inspect a Combined Cadet Force Guard of Honour. Princess Anne visited the School in November 2012.

===RIBA Award===
In 2012, Brentwood School&#x27;s sixth form centre was winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) East of England Award. The institute described the development as having drawn &quot;inspiration from the existing Victorian vicarage&quot; and that &quot;the new design is expressed in a language that is both contextual and contemporary. The sculpting of the roofs creates non-standard, domestic-scaled classrooms filled with natural light, reminiscent of the gabled roofs of the Victorian vicarage, but with an added measure of playfulness.&quot;

==Sexual abuse==
In 1997, Gareth Stafford-Bull, who taught fencing at the school (and was also a coach for the England under-20s fencing team), went missing and was sacked by the school in his absence following allegations that he had indecently assaulted pupils. The 41-year-old was later found dead in his car near Brighton.

In August 2024, David Pickthall, the school&#x27;s former Head of Music, was charged as part of an investigation into child sexual offences spanning more than forty years. The investigation related to alleged offences against nineteen people between 1980 and 2021 in Brentwood and the Havering area. In October 2024, Pickthall pleaded guilty to all charges. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison with a further four on extended licence at Chelmsford Crown Court on 11 November 2024.

==Notable former pupils==

&quot;Old Brentwoods&quot; are those who have attended the school (preparatory, senior school or sixth form) for any length of time. The logo used to represent Old Brentwoods and the Society of Old Brentwoods is the &quot;wing and claw&quot;, derived from the arms of Sir Antony Browne. A crown was added to the logo in 1957 to celebrate The Queen&#x27;s visit to the school.

The colours of Old Brentwoods are dark blue, light blue and gold. Light blue and dark blue were traditionally featured as stripes on the blazers of Old Brentwoods and are still used today to represent the alumni community. The colours were carried across to the alumni logo, with the addition of gold on the inclusion of the crown in 1957.

<text>Robert Carl Stempel (July 15, 1933 – May 7, 2011) was chairman and CEO of General Motors (GM) from August1990 to November1992. He joined GM in 1958 as a design engineer at Oldsmobile and was key in the development of the front-wheel drive Toronado. He was also involved with the team that created the first catalytic converter.

==Background and personal life==
Stempel was born July 15, 1933, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Carl (a banker) and Eleanor Stempel. He was one of four children. His brother Jack worked in aerospace, brother Ted was a teacher, and a sister, Dorothy, was a social worker.

He graduated from Bloomfield High School in New Jersey in 1951. During his teen years, he worked as a mechanic in Bloomfield, New Jersey, to earn his college tuition by fixing his fellow students&#x27; cars. He received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1955 where he had been a tackle on the football team. He attended night classes and earned an MBA from Michigan State University in 1970 and later received an honorary doctorate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Stempel was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Engineering Society of Detroit. He was the first chairman of the American Quality Foundation, developed by the American Society for Quality Control. He was a member of the board of directors and chairman of the National Industrial Advisory Council to the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America, Inc.; the National Minority Supplier Development Council; and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association; the Highway Users Federation and the United Way of Southeastern Michigan. He was a member of Detroit&#x27;s Conference Board, The Business Roundtable, and The Business Council and he was a trustee of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Detroit Renaissance, and New Detroit, Inc.

In November 1975, Stempel&#x27;s son Timothy, 13, had been kidnapped. Stempel received a ransom demand of $150,000, which he paid. His son was later freed and kidnappers were apprehended and convicted.

Stempel enjoyed attending auto races and motorsports events, and working on his cars, including his 1974 Corvette. He also enjoyed skiing and surf-casting. Prior to his death, the Stempels lived and raised horses in Loxahatchee, Florida, and Oxford, Michigan.

Stempel died in West Palm Beach, Florida, on May 7, 2011, at the age of 77.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/business/11stempel.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife Pat (née Patricia Bachmann), he had three children, a daughter Barbara and sons Timothy and Peter.

==Early career at General Motors==
After serving two years in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Stempel joined GM&#x27;s Oldsmobile Division as a senior detailer in the chassis design department in 1958, later serving as senior designer (1962); transmission design engineer (1964); motor engineer (1969); and assistant chief engineer (1972). Stempel subsequently worked on the team that developed the 1966 Toronado, the first modern American front-wheel-drive car. According to a GM biography, Stempel designed the Toronado&#x27;s front suspension and its engine and transmission mounting system.

Stempel joined the engineering department of the Chevrolet Division as chief engineer in 1974 and was named Chevrolet&#x27;s director of engineering in 1975. In 1978, Stempel was appointed general manager of the Pontiac Motor Division where he worked on the Fiero – which used a plastic-body/space frame technology that became integral to GM&#x27;s subsequent minivans and the Saturn lineup. In 1980, he was moved into the managing director position at Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary of GM. In 1982, he returned to Detroit as general manager of Chevrolet.

In January 1984, he was promoted to the dual responsibility of vice president and group executive in charge of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group. He was elected to the board of directors (February, 1986) and became CEO (August, 1990) where he served until he was voted out in 1992 – shortly after a recession when GM had closed a dozen plants, lost 74,000 jobs and lost $7 billion.

Though he suffered a heart attack soon after leaving GM in 1992, Stempel continued to visit the North American International Auto Show and continued to maintain his interest and passion for automobiles and the automobile industry.

==Later career==
In 1993, Stempel joined Stanford Ovshinsky, founder of Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) as an adviser. Stempel was named chairman in 1995.

Shortly after Stempel became chairman, ECD partnered engineered and provided the nickel-metal hydride batteries powered the EV-1. In 1999, ECD partnered with Intel in a joint-venture called &quot;Ovonyx&quot; which developed nonsilicon-based memory for electronic devices for Intel, Samsung Electronics and BAE Systems. Subsequently, ECD formed joint ventures with Texaco Energy Systems Inc., GE Plastics and Belgium-based N.V. Bekaert S.A. The promising technologies were met with losses. Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years.

Ovshinsky called Stempel &quot;a visionary who saw the need for the U.S. to be independent of foreign oil.&quot; Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years.

At the time of his death, Stempel served on the board of directors of &quot;Envia Systems&quot;, a Newark, California-based company that provided GM&#x27;s battery engineering team with access to advanced lithium-ion cathode technology delivering higher cell energy density and lower cost. In March 2010, he joined the board of directors of Genesis Fluid Solutions Holdings, a water purification company in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<doc id="299532" wikidata="Q257757" url="?curid=299532" title="Patchouli">
<text>Patchouli (also spelled patchouly or pachouli) (; Pogostemon cablin) is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, commonly called the mint or deadnettle family. The plant grows as a bushy perennial herb, with erect stems reaching up to in height and bearing small, pale, pink-white flowers. 

It is native to the island region of Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Malay Peninsula, New Guinea, and the Philippines. It is also found in many parts of Nepal and North East India. Noted for its fragrant essential oil, it has many commercial uses and is now extensively cultivated in tropical climates around the world, especially in Asia, Madagascar, South America, and the Caribbean. , global demand for patchouli oil is over per year, of which over 90% is produced by Indonesia.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Tamil &quot;patchai&quot; () or paccuḷi, meaning &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;ellai&quot; (), meaning &quot;leaf&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Patchouli grows well in warm to tropical climates. It thrives in hot, humid weather but not extended periods of direct sunlight. If the plant withers due to lack of water, it tends to recover quickly after rain or watering. Although rare, the seed-producing flowers are very fragrant and blossom in late autumn. The tiny seeds may be harvested for planting, but they are very delicate and easily crushed. Cuttings and grafts from the mother plant and subsequent rooting in loamy soil are the most common methods for propagation.

==Essential oil==
===Extraction===
Extraction of patchouli&#x27;s essential oil is by steam distillation of the dried leaves and twigs, requiring rupture of its cell walls by steam scalding, light fermentation, or drying. The main chemical component of patchouli oil is patchoulol, a sesquiterpene alcohol.

Leaves and twigs may be harvested several times a year. Some sources say the highest quality oil is produced from fresh, share dried biomass distilled close to where they are harvested; others say that boiling the dried leaves and fermenting them for a period of time is best.

===Components===
* Germacrene-B
* Patchoulol
* Norpatchoulenol

==Uses==
The heavy, strong, woody, and earthy scent of patchouli has been used for centuries in perfumes, and more recently in incense, insect repellents, chewing tobacco, and many alternative medicines.

&quot;Pogostemon cablin&quot;, &quot;P. heyneanus&quot; and &quot;P. plectranthoides&quot; are all cultivated for their essential oil, known as patchouli oil. Although there are some sub-varieties, the most common commercial varieties are native to the islands of Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.

===Perfume===
Patchouli oil is used widely in modern perfumery by individuals who create their own scents, as well as in modern scented personal products, such as bay rum, and industrial products, too, such as paper towels, laundry detergents, and air fresheners. Two important components of its essential oil are patchoulol and norpatchoulenol.

===Insect repellent===
One study suggests that patchouli oil may serve as an all-purpose insect repellent. More specifically, the patchouli plant has been found to be a potent repellent against the Formosan subterranean termite.

===Incense===
Patchouli is an important ingredient in East Asian incense. Both patchouli oil and incense underwent a surge in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, mainly as a result of the hippie movement of those decades.

===Culinary===
Patchouli leaves have been used to make a herbal tea. In some cultures, the leaves are eaten as a vegetable or used as a seasoning. There are also several herbal medicines, both in Indonesia and in China (TCM), that include dry, ground patchouli leaves as one of the key ingredients.

===Toys===
In 1985, American toy manufacturer Mattel used patchouli oil in the plastic used to produce the action figure Stinkor in the Masters of the Universe line of toys.

<doc id="299534" wikidata="Q436955" url="?curid=299534" title="Paula Jones">
<text>Paula Corbin Jones (born Paula Rosalee Corbin; September 17, 1966) is an American civil servant. A former Arkansas state employee, Jones sued United States President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994. In the initial lawsuit, Jones cited Clinton for sexual harassment at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas on May 8, 1991. Following a series of civil suits and appeals through the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals from May 1994 to January 1996, &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot; eventually reached the United States Supreme Court on May 27, 1997. The case was later settled on November 13, 1998.

The Paula Jones case provided the impetus for Independent Counsel Ken Starr to broaden his ongoing investigation into Clinton&#x27;s pre-presidency financial dealings with the Whitewater Land Company, and resulted in Clinton&#x27;s impeachment in the House of Representatives and subsequent acquittal by the Senate on February 12, 1999. Specifically, Clinton was asked under oath about Monica Lewinsky in the Jones suit, denied having ever had sexual relations with her, and was accused of perjury after evidence of sexual contact was exposed. The Jones lawsuit also led to a landmark legal precedent by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that a sitting U.S. president is not exempt from civil litigation for acts committed outside of public office.

Jones&#x27;s suit was dismissed as lacking legal merit prior to Clinton&#x27;s impeachment and the exposure of the Lewinsky affair. But in August 1998, Clinton&#x27;s relationship with Lewinsky, and compelling evidence that he had lied about it under oath in the Jones suit, was brought to light. At that point Jones appealed the ruling, and her appeal gained traction following Clinton&#x27;s admission to having an affair with Lewinsky in August 1998.

On appeal, Clinton agreed to an out-of-court settlement, paying Jones and her lawyers $850,000 to drop the suit. Clinton&#x27;s lawyer said that the President made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. Jones and her lawyers said that the payment was evidence of Clinton&#x27;s guilt. 

Jones continues to maintain that Clinton sexually harassed her. Clinton continues to deny it.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Lonoke, Arkansas. She was the daughter of a minister in the Church of the Nazarene and raised within that congregation.

Jones graduated from a high school in Carlisle, Arkansas, in 1984. She briefly attended a secretarial school in Little Rock, Arkansas. Living in Little Rock, she met her husband, Steve Jones, in 1989. She worked a number of jobs before joining the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC) in March 1991.

== &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot;==

=== Background ===
In a declaration sworn under penalty of felony, Jones alleged that, on May 8, 1991, while working on official business in her capacity as a state employee of the AIDC, she attended the Annual Governor&#x27;s Quality Conference at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock. Jones alleged she was asked by an Arkansas State Police Trooper to report to Arkansas Governor Clinton&#x27;s hotel room in the Excelsior Hotel (now the Little Rock Marriott), where Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. She claimed she kept quiet about the incident until 1994, when a David Brock story in &quot;The American Spectator&quot; magazine printed an account. Jones filed a sexual harassment suit against Clinton on May 6, 1994, two days before the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations, and sought $750,000 in damages.

===Initial lawsuit===

Jones was initially represented by Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata, two Washington, D.C.–area lawyers. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a California conservative commentator, became her press spokesperson. Carpenter-McMillan wasted no time bringing the issue to the press, calling Clinton &quot;un-American&quot;, a &quot;liar&quot;, and a &quot;philanderer&quot; on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, &quot;Equal Time&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Geraldo Rivera Show&quot;, &quot;Burden of Proof&quot;, &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, &quot;Talkback Live&quot;, and other shows. &quot;I do not respect a man who cheats on his wife, and exposes his penis to a stranger,&quot; she said.

Judge Susan Webber Wright granted President Clinton&#x27;s motion for summary judgment, ruling that Jones could not demonstrate that she had suffered any damages. As to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Wright ruled that Jones failed to show that Clinton&#x27;s actions constituted &quot;outrageous conduct&quot; as required of the tort, alongside not showing proof of damages caused by distress. Jones appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, where, at oral argument, two of the three judges on the panel appeared sympathetic to her arguments. Clinton and his defense team then challenged Jones&#x27; right to bring a civil lawsuit against a sitting president for an incident that occurred before the defendant&#x27;s becoming president. The Clinton defense team took the position that the trial should be delayed until the president was no longer in office because the job of the president is unique and does not allow him to take time away from it to deal with a private civil lawsuit. The case went through the courts, eventually reaching the Supreme Court. On May 27, 1997, the Court unanimously ruled against Clinton, and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Clinton dismissed Jones&#x27; story and agreed to move on with the lawsuit.

On August 29, 1997, Jones&#x27; attorneys Davis and Cammarata asked to resign from the case, believing the settlement offer they had secured, which Jones refused, was the appropriate way to end the case. Jones had reportedly told her lawyers she wanted an apology from Clinton, in addition to a settlement. In September, Judge Wright accepted their request.

Jones was then represented by the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal organization, and by a Dallas law firm. Carpenter-McMillan continued to serve as Jones&#x27; spokesperson. In December 1997, Jones reduced the damages sought in her suit against Clinton to $525,000 and agreed to remove Clinton&#x27;s co-defendant and former bodyguard, Danny Ferguson, from the suit.

On April 1, 1998, before the case could reach trial, Judge Wright granted Clinton&#x27;s motion for dismissal, ruling that Jones could not show that she had suffered any damages. Jones soon appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

===Conclusion of case===
On November 13, 1998, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 in exchange for her agreement to drop the appeal. However, in the four page settlement deal, Clinton acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton&#x27;s attorney, still maintained that Jones&#x27;s claim was baseless and that Clinton only settled to end the lawsuit and move on. In March 1999, Judge Wright ruled that Jones would get only $200,000 from the settlement and that the rest of the money would pay for her legal expenses.

Before the end of the entire litigation, her marriage broke apart.

In April 1999, Judge Wright found Clinton in civil contempt of court for misleading testimony in the Jones case. She ordered Clinton to pay $1,202 to the court and an additional $90,000 to Jones&#x27;s lawyers for expenses incurred, far less than the $496,000 that the lawyers originally requested.

Wright then referred Clinton&#x27;s conduct to the Arkansas Bar Association for disciplinary action, and on January 19, 2001, the day before Clinton left the office of president, he entered into an agreement with the Arkansas Bar and independent counsel Robert Ray under which Clinton&#x27;s license to practice law in Arkansas was suspended for a period of five years. His fine was paid from a fund raised for his legal expenses.

===&quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine===
In December 1994, federal judge Peter K. Leisure ordered &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine not to distribute semi-nude photographs of Jones that had been taken by her ex-boyfriend Mike Turner. Owner Bob Guccione argued that the photos counted under &quot;illustrations of newsworthy articles&quot; and called the order prohibiting distribution of the magazine an instance of prior restraint, a position reflected by several law professors; he also said the issue was already out in the hands of distributors. This temporary restraining order was lifted two days later. She later posed for photos illustrating an article, &quot;The Perils of Paula Jones&quot;, in the December 2000 issue, citing the pressures of a large tax bill and two young sons to support.

===Lewinsky scandal connection===
Jones&#x27;s lawyers decided to show to the court a pattern of behavior by Clinton that involved his allegedly repeatedly becoming sexually involved with state or government employees. Jones&#x27;s lawyers therefore subpoenaed women they suspected Clinton had had affairs with, including Arkansas Appeal Tribunal employee Gennifer Flowers, as well as White House employee Monica Lewinsky. In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having &quot;sexual relations&quot; with Monica Lewinsky. Based on testimony provided by Linda Tripp, which identified the existence of a blue dress with Clinton&#x27;s semen on it, Kenneth Starr concluded that Clinton&#x27;s sworn testimony was false and perjurious.

During the deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was asked, &quot;Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court?&quot; The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the definition. It said that &quot;a person engages in sexual relations when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person&quot;. Clinton flatly denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Later, at the Starr Grand Jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of sexual relations agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex. 

It was upon the basis of this statement that the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton on December 19, 1998, on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton was subsequently tried before the Senate, where votes on either charge both fell far short of the 2/3 supermajority required for conviction.

==Politics==
In February 2016, Jones endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 United States presidential election. That same week, she attended a rally for Trump held in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she asked for a selfie with him.

In October 2016, Jones joined Trump for a press conference before the second 2016 Presidential Debate to air grievances against Hillary and Bill Clinton. The conference also included Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey, who had also accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.

==In popular culture==
Jones was portrayed by Annaleigh Ashford in the of the series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;.

<text>James Guy Tucker Jr. (June 13, 1943 – February 13, 2025) was an American politician, businessman and attorney who served as the 43rd governor of Arkansas from 1992 until his resignation in 1996 after his conviction for fraud during the Whitewater affair. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 15th lieutenant governor, state attorney general, and as a U.S. representative.

==Early life==
Tucker was born in Oklahoma City on June 13, 1943, and moved to Arkansas before school age. He attended public schools in Little Rock, graduating from Hall High School in 1961. He had his first taste of politics when he ran for and was elected vice-president of Key Club International (the largest and oldest high school service organization in the United States). He served in that organization from 1960 to 1961. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1964.

==Early career==
Tucker served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1964, but was discharged for medical reasons (chronic ulcers) after finishing the first phase of his officer candidate training class at Camp Upshur at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia. In early 1965, Tucker found passage to southeast Asia by tramp steamer from San Francisco and entered South Vietnam as an accredited freelance war correspondent.

With one brief sojourn home, he remained in the war zone through 1967, personally participating in a number of engagements. Late that year, he published &quot;Arkansas Men at War&quot;, a compendium of interviews with troops from the state he had followed into combat. The book received generally favorable reviews.

Following a brief stint as an assistant professor of American history at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, Tucker returned to the University of Arkansas Law School in 1968 as a second-year student, graduated, and was admitted to the bar that same year.

==Law career ==

Tucker practiced as a junior associate with the Rose Law Firm, from which he ran for prosecuting attorney in 1970. He served as prosecutor for the Sixth Judicial District of Arkansas 1971–1972. In that office, he oversaw the prosecution of more than 1,000 backlogged felony cases inherited from previous administrations. He won convictions in several cases considered by local observers as &quot;impossible&quot; successfully to prosecute, including one kidnapping.

Twelve &quot;guest&quot; judges were temporarily reassigned from other circuits by the state supreme court at Tucker&#x27;s request to clear the docket. He was appointed by the Governor to the Arkansas Criminal Code Revision Commission and served from 1973 to 1975, during which time he was credited with spearheading the group&#x27;s broad revision of the state&#x27;s criminal laws.

An investigation into police corruption he began was stymied by a county grand jury appointed by a circuit judge who was a political ally of the chief of police. However, the following year, a federal grand jury, building on Tucker&#x27;s work, issued a scathing report which led to a shake-up of the department, and the resignation of the chief, senior detectives, and complicit city officials.

==Political career==

Tucker was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and was elected Arkansas Attorney General in November 1972 at the age of 29. He easily defeated the Republican nominee Edwin Bethune, then of Searcy in White County, and later Tucker&#x27;s successor as the U.S. Representative from Arkansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district which is Little Rock–based.

Tucker served two 2-year terms as attorney general, 1973–1977. He and the state&#x27;s chief justice served as co-chairmen of the Arkansas Criminal Code Revision Commission. This was the first effort at codification of the state&#x27;s criminal code and was adopted by the State&#x27;s General Assembly. Tucker also began intervening in utility rate cases before the Arkansas Public Service Commission and fought to require &quot;scrubbers&quot; on a large coal-fired generation plant. He served as co-chairman of the Consumer Protection Committee of the National Association of Attorneys General. Running from his post as attorney general, Tucker was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-fifth Congress and served one term from 1977 to 1979. He served on the Ways and Means Committee, on the Sub-Committee on Social Security, and on a special committee on welfare reform.

He relinquished the seat to wage an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in 1978. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by the sitting governor, David Pryor. In the same election, Bill Clinton, who had replaced Tucker in 1977 as attorney general, was elected governor.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed Tucker the chairman of the White House Conference on Families, in which capacity he served until the end of the administration in January 1981.

Tucker resumed his law practice. A consistent intra-party rival of Clinton, he was defeated by Clinton when both sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1982 following Clinton&#x27;s defeat by Republican Frank White in 1980. He then became a partner in the firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig &amp; Tucker and served as lead trial counsel in complex litigation. Eight years later, Tucker announced his intention to run for the governor&#x27;s office again against Clinton, who was seeking a fifth term and was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president. However, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and ran instead for the post of lieutenant governor.

Tucker recognized that Clinton had his eyes on the presidency and might not serve a full term. Tucker, in accordance with a state constitutional provision barring a governor from executing duties while traveling outside of the state, served as acting governor on a near-constant basis between Clinton&#x27;s campaign launch during the summer of 1991 and the election in November 1992, relinquishing gubernatorial powers and duties only on the few occasions when Clinton returned to the state, such as to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector. Tucker succeeded to the governorship upon Clinton&#x27;s resignation on December 12, 1992, following the latter&#x27;s election to the presidency.

Tucker called a special session of the General Assembly that same week to solve a financial crisis for the state&#x27;s Medicaid system. At his urging, the legislature adopted a soft drink tax, proceeds of which were placed in a trust account for Medicaid matching purposes. The soft drink industry obtained sufficient signatures to attempt a repeal. The soft drink tax prevailed with over 60% of the vote. Tucker won election in 1994 with over 59% of the vote against Republican Sheffield Nelson to a four-year term as governor and was sworn into a full four-year term on January 10, 1995.

==Conviction and resignation==
Tucker was convicted of one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud on May 28, 1996, as part of Kenneth Starr&#x27;s investigation of the Whitewater scandal. Tucker was tried with fellow defendants James B. McDougal and his wife Susan McDougal. The prosecution was conducted primarily by OIC prosecutor Ray Jahn. Tucker chose not to testify in his own defense upon the advice of his attorney. Tucker received a lenient sentence of four years&#x27; probation and house detention in part because of his poor health. He was placed on the Mayo Clinic liver transplant list in June 1996.

Arkansas, like most other states, has a provision in its state constitution barring convicted felons from elective office. As a result, Tucker announced his intention to resign. As lieutenant governor, Mike Huckabee, a Republican, was preparing to be sworn in, Tucker announced he would delay his resignation until the trial court hearing on several grounds, including the post-trial discovery that a juror in his trial was married to a man whose cocaine possession conviction Tucker had twice refused to commute. Furthermore, this juror was the niece of local activist Robert &quot;Say&quot; McIntosh, who had demonstrated against Tucker during the trial. He argued that his conviction was thus tainted, and that the Arkansas Constitution was vague about his status as a convicted felon until his post trial motions were ruled on. However, several hours later he did resign that same day, under the threat of impeachment by the legislature which had informally gathered to witness Huckabee&#x27;s swearing in.

==Business==
Beginning in the early 1980s, while practicing law, Tucker and his wife Betty began building cable television and pay per view systems in Central Arkansas, and later in the Dallas–Fort Worth corridor north of DFW Airport and in southern Florida. In the early 1990s, Tucker partnered with Insight Cable to purchase and expand cable television systems in London. That company later merged with others and was taken public in London. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Tucker and his wife, along with James Riady, established a cable television company in Indonesia. In 1998, in the midst of an Indonesian financial and political crisis, the company almost went bankrupt. Tucker traveled to Indonesia in January 1999 and with the Riady family created a new company called Kabelvision, and built and expanded systems in greater Jakarta (&#x27;Jabotabek&#x27;), in Surabaya, and in Bali. In 2000, the company was merged into new company called AcrossAsia Multimedia Ltd. It was listed on the Global Emerging Markets (GEM) Exchange in Hong Kong that same year. With AcrossAsia Multimedia, they built what was then the largest cable TV and Internet infrastructure in Indonesia.

==Personal life==
In 1975, Tucker married Betty Allen; they had two children and he became stepfather to her two children from a prior marriage.

===Illness and death===
Beginning during his college years at Harvard, Tucker suffered from an autoimmune disease, later diagnosed as Primary sclerosing cholangitis. It created severe liver problems which seriously debilitated him and threatened his life (he had nearly died from gastrointestinal bleeding in 1994, and had steadily worsened since). On Christmas Day 1996, Tucker received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Tucker began hospice care in January 2025, and died at a Little Rock hospital from complications of ulcerative colitis on February 13, 2025, at the age of 81.

===Legacy===
In 2012, Tucker donated the James Guy Tucker Jr. Papers, a collection of manuscripts and materials documenting his personal life and political career, to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. The collection went on display and became open to the public in 2017. A star in the Columba constellation was nicknamed after Tucker in the International Star Registry.

After his death, as a former governor, Tucker will lie in state at the Arkansas State Capitol building on February 21, 2025 and state flags will be lower to half staff.

<text>William Hunter was a Marian martyr burnt to death in Brentwood, England at the age of 19 on 26 March 1555, on Ingrave Road. He had lost his job in London as a silk-weaver because he refused to attend the Catholic mass, despite an order that everyone in the City of London had to attend, and had come to live with his parents in Brentwood, but got into a dispute when discovered reading the Bible for himself in Brentwood Chapel. He refused to accept the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation according to which the bread and wine of the communion become the body and blood of Jesus.

He was taken before Antony Browne, then the local Justice, but later Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, but refused to retract his position. Hunter was then sent to Bishop Bonner in London. He resisted both threats and bribes—Bonner offered to make him a Freeman of the City of London and give him £40—and was eventually returned to Brentwood to be burnt. He was the first Essex martyr of the reign of Mary Tudor.

==Legacy==

The site is now Brentwood School, which was founded by Antony Browne in 1558, under a grant from Queen Mary (not, as some believe, as a penance when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne). The Martyr&#x27;s Elm was grown on the spot of Hunter&#x27;s incineration.

The site is marked by a plaque with the inscription
William Hunter Way, a road in Brentwood, was named after him.

<text>Frederick McCarthy Forsyth (born 25 August 1938) is an English novelist and journalist. He is best known for thrillers such as &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, &quot;The Odessa File&quot;, &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;, &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Alternative&quot;, &quot;The Fist of God&quot;, &quot;Icon&quot;, &quot;The Veteran&quot;, &quot;Avenger&quot;, &quot;The Afghan&quot;, &quot;The Cobra&quot; and &quot;The Kill List&quot;. Forsyth&#x27;s works frequently appear on best-sellers lists and more than a dozen of his titles have been adapted to film. By 2006, he had sold more than 70 million books in more than 30 languages.

==Education==
Forsyth was educated at Tonbridge School, a private boarding and day school in the market town of Tonbridge in Kent.

==Career==
===Military and journalism===
Before becoming a journalist, Forsyth completed his National Service in the Royal Air Force as a pilot, for which he flew the de Havilland Vampire. He joined Reuters in 1961 and in 1965 the BBC, for which he served as an assistant diplomatic correspondent.

Forsyth reported on his early activities as a journalist. His early career was spent covering French affairs and the attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle. He had never been to Africa until reporting on the Nigerian Civil War between Biafra and Nigeria as a BBC correspondent.
He was there for the first six months of 1967, but few expected the war to last very long considering the poor weaponry and preparation of the Biafrans when compared to the British-armed Nigerians. After his six months were over, however, Forsyth—eager to carry on reporting—approached the BBC to ask if he could have more time there. He noted their response:

He thus returned to Biafra as a freelance reporter, writing his first book, &quot;The Biafra Story&quot;, in 1969.

In August 2015, Forsyth revealed that in Biafra he was an informant for MI6, a relationship that continued for 20 years. According to Forsyth, he was not paid.

He is an occasional radio broadcaster on political issues and has also written for newspapers throughout his career, including a weekly page in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. In 2003, he criticised &quot;gay-bashers in the churches&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. He has narrated several documentaries, including &quot;Jesus Christ Airlines&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;I Have Never Forgotten You: The Life &amp; Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal&quot;.

===Writing===
According to Forsyth, his turn to writing fiction was born of financial need; he did not think himself cut out to be a novelist. As a boy, he said, he wanted to be &quot;a fighter jock,&quot; and when he traded his career in the RAF for journalism, it was &quot;to see the world&quot; as a foreign and war correspondent. As for becoming a novelist, he confessed &quot;I never wanted to be a writer,&quot; but wrote his first full-length novel, &quot;The Day of the Jackal,&quot; because he was &quot;skint, stony broke.&quot; He applied similar research techniques to those used in journalism. Published in 1971, the book became an international bestseller and gained its author the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel. In this story, the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; hires an assassin to kill then–French President Charles de Gaulle. It was made into a film of the same name, and subsequently a television series.

In Forsyth&#x27;s second full-length novel, &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1972), a reporter attempts to track down an ex-Nazi SS officer in contemporary Germany. The reporter discovers him via the diary of a Jewish Holocaust survivor who died of suicide earlier, but he is being shielded by an organisation that protects ex-Nazis, called ODESSA. This book was later made into a movie with the same name, starring Jon Voight, but there were substantial alterations. Many of the novel&#x27;s readers assumed that a centralized ODESSA organisation really existed, but historians disagree.

In &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1974) a British mining executive hires a group of mercenaries to overthrow the government of an African country so that he can install a puppet regime that will allow him cheap access to a colossal platinum-ore reserve. This book was also adapted into a 1980 film starring Christopher Walken and Tom Berenger.

&quot;The Shepherd&quot; was an illustrated novella published in 1975. It tells of a nightmare journey by an RAF pilot while flying home for Christmas in the late 1950s. His attempts to find a rational explanation for his eventual rescue prove as troublesome as his experience.

Following this came &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Alternative&quot; in 1979, which was set in 1982. In this book, the Soviet Union faces a disastrous grain harvest. The US is ready to help for some political and military concessions. A Politburo faction fight ensues. War is proposed as a solution. Ukrainian freedom fighters complicate the situation later. In the end, a Swedish oil tanker built in Japan, a Russian airliner hijacked to West Berlin and various governments find themselves involved.

In 1982, &quot;No Comebacks&quot;, a collection of ten short stories, was published. Some of these stories had been written earlier. Many were set in the Republic of Ireland where Forsyth was living at the time. One of them, &quot;There Are No Snakes in Ireland&quot;, won him a second Edgar Allan Poe Award, this time for best short story.

&quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; was published in 1984 and involves renegade elements within the Soviet Union attempting to plant an atomic bomb near an American airbase in the UK, intending to influence the upcoming British elections and lead to the election of an anti-NATO, anti-American, anti-nuclear, pro-soviet Labour government. The 1987 adaptation starred Pierce Brosnan and Michael Caine. Almost all of the political content was removed from the film.

Forsyth&#x27;s tenth book came in 1989 with &quot;The Negotiator&quot;, in which the American President&#x27;s son is kidnapped and one man&#x27;s job is to negotiate his release.

Two years later, in 1991, &quot;The Deceiver&quot; was published. It includes four short stories reviewing the career of British secret agent Sam McCready. At the start of the novel, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State (PUSS) of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office requires the Chief of the SIS to push Sam into early retirement. The four stories are presented to a grievance committee in an attempt to allow Sam to stay on active duty with the SIS.

In 1994, Forsyth published &quot;The Fist of God&quot;, a novel which concerns the first Gulf War, Project Babylon and competition between intelligence agencies. Next, in 1996, he published &quot;Icon&quot;, about the rise of fascists to power in post-Soviet Russia.

In 1999, Forsyth published &quot;The Phantom of Manhattan&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. It was intended as a departure from his usual genre; Forsyth&#x27;s explanation was that &quot;I had done mercenaries, assassins, Nazis, murderers, terrorists, special forces soldiers, fighter pilots, you name it, and I got to think, could I actually write about the human heart?&quot; However, it did not achieve the same success as his other novels, and he subsequently returned to modern-day thrillers.

In 2001, &quot;The Veteran&quot;, another collection of short stories, was published, followed by &quot;Avenger&quot;, published in September 2003, about a Canadian billionaire who hires a Vietnam veteran to bring his grandson&#x27;s killer to the US. The novel was adapted into a film starring Sam Elliott and Timothy Hutton.

&quot;The Afghan&quot;, published in August 2006, is an indirect sequel to &quot;The Fist of God&quot;. Set in the very near future, the threat of a catastrophic assault on the West, discovered on a senior al-Qaeda member&#x27;s computer, compels the leaders of the US and the UK to attempt a desperate gambit—to substitute a seasoned British operative, retired Col. Mike Martin (of &quot;The Fist of God&quot;), for an Afghan Taliban commander being held prisoner at Guantánamo Bay.

&quot;The Cobra&quot;, published in 2010, features some of the characters previously featured in &quot;Avenger&quot;, and has as its subject an attempt to destroy the world trade in cocaine.

On 20 August 2013, his novel &quot;The Kill List&quot; was published. It was announced earlier in June that year that Rupert Sanders would be directing a film version of the story.

On 10 September 2015, Forsyth&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Outsider: My Life in Intrigue&quot;, was published.

In January 2018, it was announced that Forsyth would publish his eighteenth novel, a thriller about computer hackers, inspired by the Lauri Love and Gary McKinnon stories. &quot;The Fox&quot; was published in electronic format in October 2018, and released in hardcover in November. &quot;The Fox&quot; is an espionage thriller about a highly skilled autistic hacker.

== Other awards ==
On 16 February 2012 the Crime Writers Association announced that Forsyth had won its Cartier Diamond Dagger award in recognition of his body of work.

Forsyth was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1997 New Year Honours list for services to literature.

==Other appearances==
In September 2005, Forsyth appeared on the ITV gameshow &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; and raised £250,000 for charity. He offered the answer to the £500,000 question but, despite being correct, he decided to take £250,000. On 8 February 2007, Forsyth appeared on BBC&#x27;s political panel show &quot;Question Time&quot;; on it, he expressed scepticism on the subject of anthropogenic climate change. On 26 March 2008, he also appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;. On 17 June 2008, Forsyth was interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live Midday News in relation to the restoration of the Military Covenant. On 2 February 2015, he appeared on &quot;Eggheads&quot; as a member of Rewarding Talent.

== Political views ==
Forsyth is a Eurosceptic Conservative. He has been Patron of The People&#x27;s Book Prize since 2010. He is Patron of Better Off Out, an organisation calling for Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union, and he supports Brexit. In 2003, he was awarded the One of Us Award from the Conservative Way Forward group for his services to the Conservative movement in Britain. He is also a patron of the Young Britons&#x27; Foundation.

In 2005, he opposed Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party, calling Clarke&#x27;s record in government &quot;unrivalled; a record of failure which at every level has never been matched&quot;. Instead, he endorsed and donated money to David Davis&#x27;s campaign. In the run-up to the 2005 general election, Forsyth called for the impeachment of Tony Blair over the 2003 invasion of Iraq and lent his support to anti-war campaigner Reg Keys who stood in Blair&#x27;s constituency of Sedgefield. In 2016, Forsyth featured as a character in &quot;Reg&quot;, a one-off BBC real-life drama about Reg Keys&#x27; campaign. In the programme, Forsyth was portrayed by Tim Bentinck.

== Personal life ==
Forsyth has been married twice, first to former model Carole Cunningham between 1973 and 1988, with whom he had two sons Stuart and Shane, and then to Sandy Molloy, since 1994. He also had a relationship with actress Faye Dunaway. Forsyth previously resided in a manor house in Hertfordshire with his family before moving to Buckinghamshire in 2010.

In 2016, he said he was giving up writing thrillers because his wife had told him he was too old to travel to dangerous places.

<doc id="299542" wikidata="Q172213" url="?curid=299542" title="Mehmet Shehu">
<text>Mehmet Ismail Shehu (January 10, 1913 – December 18, 1981) was an Albanian communist politician who served as the Prime Minister of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania from 1954 to 1981. He was known as a close confidant of Enver Hoxha and served in various high-ranking positions in the government. 

Shehu was Chief of the General Staff of the Albanian People&#x27;s Army from 1946 to 1948 and later served as Minister of the Interior from 1948 to 1954. He then assumed the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) from 1954 to 1981 and additionally served as Minister of People&#x27;s Defense from 1974 to 1980. Shehu was often regarded as the right hand of Enver Hoxha and played a central role in Albania&#x27;s political leadership during that era. 

In 1938, he joined the International Brigades in Spain and fought as an officer in the 4th Battalion of the Italian Garibaldi Brigade. A member of the Spanish Communist Party, he moved to France after Franco&#x27;s victory and was interned there from 1939 to 1942. He was handed over by the Vichy government to the fascists who sent him to Tirana. He left the company of his escort and joined the maquis and the Albanian Communist Party. Commander of the 1st Brigade of the National Liberation Army since 1943, Mehmet Shehu took part in the Battle of Gjorm on January 1, Liberation of Tepelena on September 10 and liberation of Tirana on November 8, 1944.

As an acknowledged military tactician, without whose leadership the communist partisans may well have failed in their battle to win Albania for the Marxist-Leninist cause, Shehu exhibited an ideological understanding and work ethic that singled him out for rapid promotion in the communist party.

Mehmet Shehu shared power with Enver Hoxha from the end of the Second World War. According to official Albanian government sources, he killed himself on December 18, 1981, after which his family was arrested. Persistent rumors remain, however, that Shehu was actually murdered on orders from Hoxha.

== Early life ==
Mehmet Shehu was born into a Tosk Albanian family, with his father being an Albanian Muslim Imam. He was born in Çorrush, Mallakastër District, southern Albania.

Shehu graduated in 1932 at the Tirana Albanian Vocational High School funded by the American Red Cross. His focus was on agriculture. Unsuccessful in finding employment within the Ministry of Agriculture he managed to get a scholarship to attend the Nunziatella military academy of Naples, Italy. After being expelled from this school for his pro-Communist sympathies in 1936 he gained entry to the Tirana Officers School, but he left the following year after volunteering to fight for the republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He joined the Communist Party of Spain and was a machine-gunner who rose to the command of the Fourth Battalion of the XIIth &quot;Garibaldi&quot; Brigade. After the defeat of the Republican forces he was arrested in France in early 1939 as he was retreating from Spain along with his friends. He was imprisoned in an internment camp in France and later was transferred to an Italian internment camp, where he joined the Italian Communist Party.

== Partisan life ==
Shehu volunteered for the war in Spain, illegally crossing the border between France and Spain in November 1937. Once in Spain, he joined the 13th Interbrigade (the Garibaldi Brigade) and quickly rose to become the Deputy Commander of the 4th Battalion of the Garibaldi Brigade. He became a member of the Spanish Communist Party in December 1937.

After the war in Spain, when the International Brigades and the Spanish Republican Army withdrew to France, Shehu was interned on February 9, 1939, in a French concentration camp by the regimes of Daladier, Paul Reynaud, and Pétain. He remained there for 40 months and became a member of the Party Committee of the camp.

Mehmet Shehu&#x27;s military career began in 1942 when he returned to Albania under Italian occupation and promptly joined the Albanian Communist Party and the Albanian resistance in Mallakastra. He was regarded as highly successful and victorious in battles such as Gjorm, Tepelena, and Tirana. By 1943, he had been elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Due to his military expertise, he quickly rose to become the commander of the 1st Partisan Assault Brigade in August 1943. Subsequently, he led the 1st Partisan Assault Division of the National Liberation Army. He served as a member of the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation, the provisional government, from 1944 to 1945.

In 1944, he was promoted to Major General and became the Second Assistant to the Chief of Staff.

== Military career ==

After Albania was liberated from the German occupation in November 1944, Shehu became the deputy chief of the general staff and, after he studied in Moscow, became the chief of the general staff. Later, he was also a lieutenant general and a full general.

In 1948, Shehu &quot;expurgated&quot; from the party the element who &quot;tried to separate Albania from the Soviet Union and lead her under Belgrade&#x27;s influence&quot;. This made him the nearest person to Enver Hoxha and brought him high offices. After the purge of Koçi Xoxe, he took over the Ministry of Internal Affairs. However, he remained in Hoxha&#x27;s shadow.

From 1948, he was a member of the Central Committee and the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania, and, from 1948 to 1953, he was a secretary of the Central Committee. He lost the latter position on June 24 when Enver Hoxha gave up the posts of Minister of Defence and Minister of Foreign Affairs while retaining the premiership. Hoxha was probably not willing to yield too much power to him. From 1948 to 1954 he was deputy prime minister (deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers) and Minister of Internal Affairs. The latter post made him commander of the secret police, the Sigurimi. In 1954, he succeeded Hoxha as Prime Minister. From 1974 he was also the Minister of People&#x27;s Defence while from 1947 to his death he was a deputy of the People&#x27;s Assembly.

== Hard line man ==
During the war, Shehu won a reputation for brutality. Mike Burke, the American spymaster who set up a 1950 paramilitary project to destabilize and oust the Albanian government, said in 1986 that Shehu was &quot;one tough son of a bitch&quot;, whose security forces gave U.S. agents &quot;a tough time&quot;.

During the discussion at the Meeting of 81 Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties in November 1960, Nikita Khrushchev asked Shehu if he had any criticisms of Joseph Stalin, to which Shehu replied: &quot;Yes, not getting rid of you!&quot;

== Last years ==

Shehu was considered Enver Hoxha&#x27;s right-hand man and he was also considered the second most powerful man in Albania. For 40 years, Hoxha was Shehu&#x27;s friend and closest comrade. On his 50th birthday in 1963, Hoxha honored Shehu by attaching his name to the name of the local military-political academy, it was named the &quot;Mehmet Shehu Military Academy&quot;. Shehu was one of those who formed the Chinese-Albanian alliance and initiated the break with the Soviet Union (December 1961). His relationship with Hoxha was damaged, however, when his son married a woman who had anti-Communist relatives who lived in the United States. This situation led to a meeting of the Politburo with regard to his future.

On December 17, 1981, he was found dead in his bedroom, (lying in his bed, wearing sunglasses, a shirt and pyjamas) with a bullet wound to his chest. According to the official announcement on Radio Tirana, he killed himself in a nervous breakdown. Many of his contemporaries, including his personal bodyguard, have repeatedly claimed that he was murdered. No official investigation into the matter has been conducted since the fall of the regime.

After his death, Shehu was accused of spying, not only was he accused of spying for Yugoslavia, he was also accused of spying for the CIA and the KGB. In Hoxha&#x27;s book &quot;The Titoites&quot; (1982) several chapters are dedicated to Shehu&#x27;s denunciation. In 1982, the Party of Labour issued a second edition of its official history, removing all references to Shehu. 

Reportedly, Shehu had begun to denounce Hoxha&#x27;s isolationism. He had reached out to the governments of some western nations like Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany in an attempt to form diplomatic ties with them. Albanians speculated that Hoxha, who was in the last years of his life, wanted to secure his legacy and he did not want a successor who might outshine him. He was denounced as a “people’s enemy” and he was buried in a wasteland near the village of Ndroq near Tirana. 

Shehu’s family was also punished. His widow, Fiqerete, (born Sanxhaktari) and two of his sons were arrested without any explanation and later, they were imprisoned on different pretexts. One son died by suicide and his widow died in prison in 1988. One of Shehu&#x27;s surviving sons later launched a campaign to prove that his father had, in fact, been murdered. After the fall of Communism and after his release from prison in 1991, Mehmet Shehu&#x27;s younger son Bashkim started a search for his father&#x27;s remains. On November 19, 2001, it was announced that Mehmet Shehu&#x27;s remains had been found.

A fictionalised account of Mehmet Shehu&#x27;s fall and death is the subject of Ismail Kadare&#x27;s novel &quot;The Successor&quot; (2003).

==Ideology==
During his leadership, Shehu was often characterized as a nationalist figure with a staunch anti-Yugoslavist and anti-Russian stance. Additionally, his ideology was sometimes perceived as reflecting elements of bourgeois nationalism, emphasizing the interests of certain elite groups within Albanian society. Moreover, he was seen as holding discriminatory views towards minorities such as the Roma, and in 1960, he attempted to ban Roma from entering Albanian cities.

<doc id="299543" wikidata="Q1171714" url="?curid=299543" title="The Fourth Protocol">
<text>The Fourth Protocol is a thriller novel by British writer Frederick Forsyth, published in August 1984.

==Etymology==
The title refers to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which (at least in the world of the novel) contained four secret protocols. The fourth of these was meant to prohibit non-conventional deliveries of nuclear weapons, i.e. by means other than being dropped from aircraft or carried on ballistic missiles. This included postal delivery or being assembled in secret, close to the target, before being detonated.

==Plot==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1986, professional thief James Rawlings breaks into the apartment of a senior civil servant and inadvertently discovers stolen top secret documents. While a notorious and infamous criminal, he is patriotic enough to anonymously send the documents to MI5 so that they might locate the traitor.

In Moscow, British defector Kim Philby drafts a memorandum for the Soviet General Secretary stating that, should the Labour Party win the next general election in the United Kingdom (scheduled for sometime in the subsequent eighteen months), the &quot;hard left&quot; of the party will oust the moderate populist Neil Kinnock in favour of a radical new leader who will adopt a true Marxist-Leninist manifesto, including the expulsion of all American forces from the United Kingdom and the country&#x27;s withdrawal from (and repudiation of) NATO. In conjunction with a GRU general, an academic named Krilov, and a chess grandmaster and experienced strategist, they devise &quot;Plan Aurora&quot; to secure a Labour victory by exploiting the party&#x27;s support for unilateral disarmament.

John Preston, an ex–Parachute Regiment soldier-turned-MI5 officer, who was exploring hard-left infiltration of the Labour Party, is assigned to investigate the stolen documents and discovers they were leaked by George Berenson, a passionate anti-communist and staunch supporter of apartheid South Africa. Berenson passed on the documents to Jan Marais, who he believed was a South African diplomat, but who was in fact a Soviet false flag operative. SIS chief Sir Nigel Irvine eventually confronts Berenson with the truth and turns him, using him to pass disinformation to the KGB.

As part of Plan Aurora, Soviet agent Valeri Petrofsky arrives under deep cover in the United Kingdom and establishes a base using a house in Ipswich. From there, he travels around the country collecting packages from various couriers who have smuggled them into the country either hidden or disguised as seemingly harmless artefacts.

One of the couriers, masquerading as a sailor, is assaulted by Neds in Glasgow and hospitalised, where he commits suicide rather than submit to interrogation. Preston investigates and finds three out-of-place looking metal discs in a tobacco tin in his gunny sack. He shows the discs to a metallurgist who identifies the outer two as aluminium but the third as polonium, a key element in the initiator of an atomic bomb. Preston reports his findings to his antagonistic MI5 superior, acting Director-General Brian Harcourt-Smith, who ignores them, has Preston taken off the case and requests the human resource department to arrange that Preston take leave. Irvine, however, suspects that a major intelligence operation is underway, and has Preston work unofficially for him to search for other Soviet couriers (his absence from the office being justified by the coincidental order to take leave). Simultaneously, he uses Berenson to pass a deliberate piece of disinformation to the KGB.

In Moscow, the director of foreign operations for the KGB, General Karpov, discovers Aurora&#x27;s existence. He determines that the general secretary is responsible, and blackmails Krilov into revealing the plan: in contravention of the Fourth Protocol, the component parts of a small atomic device are to be smuggled into the United Kingdom, to be assembled and exploded near RAF Bentwaters a week before the general election. Irrefutable evidence will be left that the explosion was an accidental detonation of an American tactical nuclear weapon, leading to a general wave of anti-Americanism, support for unilateral nuclear disarmament and for the only major party committed to disarmament, the Labour Party. The day after they win the election, the hard left will take over and begin to dismantle the Western alliance in Europe.

Preston attempts, albeit fruitlessly, to uncover other couriers connected to the operation. A month into the investigation, a bumbling Czechoslovakian operative, originally believed to be an Austrian, under the name &#x27;Franz Winkler&#x27; arrives at Heathrow with a forged visa in his passport and is shadowed to a house in Chesterfield. Preston&#x27;s patience is rewarded when Petrofsky shows up to use the radio transmitter that is located there. He trails Petrofsky to his rented house, where the bomb has been assembled. An SAS team is called in to storm the house, and wounds Petrofsky before he can detonate the bomb. Despite Preston&#x27;s express wishes, the commanding officer kills Petrofsky during the raid. Before dying, he manages to say one last word: &quot;Philby&quot;.

Preston confronts Irvine with his theory that Philby deliberately blew the operation; the latter did not know Petrofsky&#x27;s location but instead sent Franz Winkler with an obviously fake identity document to the transmitter&#x27;s location and ultimately, to Petrofsky. Irvine admits to compromising the operation by leaking disinformation through Berenson to General Karpov that they were closing in on their suspect. In turn, Karpov (and &quot;not&quot; Philby) sent Winkler, sabotaging Plan Aurora. By sending Winkler, Karpov thwarted a British publicity victory as Irvine understood the implication that Petrofsky must not be caught alive or exposed in the media. Preston, however, is disappointed that Petrofsky was killed outright rather than arrested. Irvine also admits that Philby has indeed been passing intelligence to the British embassy in Moscow (via carrier pigeons), hoping to earn repatriation back to the United Kingdom, but he did not expose Plan Aurora, and even if he had, as far as Irvine is concerned, &quot;he can rot in hell&quot;.

At the novel&#x27;s end, Harcourt-Smith is turned down for the position of Director-General of MI5, owing to his poor judgment in the case, and subsequently resigns from MI5 altogether. Preston also resigns but, through Irvine, finds lucrative private-sector employment that enables him to obtain full custody of his son. Marais is taken into custody by South African intelligence and Berenson&#x27;s efforts are rendered unusable to the KGB, as Irvine intends to use his own spy network and plant the suspicion that Berenson was, in fact, a double agent, so that his information will be considered suspect.

== Locations==
Most of the locations used in the book are real. For example the named streets in Chesterfield, Glasgow and Ipswich are all real. They can still be easily located by using Google street view in 2025. The bus stop where the Russian Seaman is attacked is a real bus stop and located as described in the novel in 2025. Although the numbering of the address in Compton Street, Chesterfield is different to the current numbers. Also Cherryhayes Close in Ipswich is fictional, the housing estate it is located on, really exists. Forsyth just locates it in between to of the real Close locations.

<doc id="299550" wikidata="Q590080" url="?curid=299550" title="Regions of Chile">
<text>Chile is divided into 16 regions (in Spanish, &quot;regiones&quot;; singular ), which are the country&#x27;s first-level administrative division. Each region is headed by directly elected regional governor (&quot;gobernador regional&quot;) and a regional board (&quot;consejo regional&quot;).

The regions are divided into provinces (the second-level administrative division), each headed by a governor (&quot;gobernador&quot;) appointed by the President. There are 56 provinces in total. Provinces are divided into communes (the third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by municipal councils.

==Naming==
Each region was given a Roman numeral, followed by a name (e.g. &quot;IV Región de Coquimbo&quot;, read as &quot;fourth region of Coquimbo&quot; in Spanish). When the regional structure was created, Roman numerals were assigned in ascending order from north to south, with the northernmost region designated as I (first) and the southernmost region as XII (twelfth). The Santiago Metropolitan Region, located in the center of the country and home to the country&#x27;s capital Santiago, was excluded from this naming scheme and given instead the initials RM, standing for &quot;Región Metropolitana&quot; (&quot;Metropolitan Region&quot; in Spanish). With the creation of regions XIV (Los Ríos Region) and XVI (Ñuble Region) in the south and XV (Arica y Parinacota Region) in the north (XIII was not used) in 2007, the north-south Roman numeral order was broken.

In February 2018, the &quot;Strengthening of Regionalization Law&quot; (Law 21074) was enacted. Among other things, it removed the roman numerals from the designations.

==History of the regional structure==
The administrative divisions of Chile were created in 1974 and limited to 13 regions (this limitation was eliminated in 2005 via a constitutional reform). Previously, Chile was divided into 25 provinces, which were further divided into departments, and then into communes. The new territorial organization was implemented in phases with some initial &quot;pilot regions&quot; beginning to operate in 1974, extending the process on January 1, 1976, to the rest of the country. The Santiago Metropolitan Region began to operate in April 1980.

In December 2006, two new regions were created: the northern Arica and Parinacota Region, by taking out the two northernmost provinces from the Tarapacá Region; and Los Ríos Region in the south, encompassing the provinces of Valdivia, formerly part of the Los Lagos Region, and Ranco, formerly part of Valdivia. Both regions became operative in October 2007.

In August 2017, the Ñuble Region was created from what was then the Ñuble Province of the Biobío Region. The old province was divided into three new provinces: Diguillín, Punilla and Itata. The new region&#x27;s capital is Chillán. It became operational in September 2018.

==Administration==
Since their creation, each region is headed by an intendant (intendente) appointed by the President of Chile, and a regional board (consejo regional). The intendants count with the direct collaboration of the SEREMI (Ministerial Regional secretary) in specific matters, such as public health, education, agriculture, among others. The SEREMI are appointed by the President. Thanks to the Strengthening of Regionalization Law, since the 2020 municipal elections each intendant will be elected at the same date along with the mayors and municipal councillors, using a two-round system. If no candidate obtains the minimum threshold 40% of the valid votes, a runoff election is held between the two candidates with the most votes, and the winner is elected by a simple majority. Also the law will change the name &quot;Intendant&quot; to &quot;Regional Governor&quot; (Gobernador regional). The President will appoint a Regional presidential delegate (delegado presidencial regional), who will represent the national government in the region.

The board was elected among the members of the municipal councils (consejo municipal) of each commune of the respective region. Since the 2013 election the regional board members (Consejero regional) are directly elected using an open list proportional representation, with seats allocated using the D&#x27;Hondt method. Each of the 54 provinces are headed by a governor (gobernador) appointed by the President. In 2020, the provincial governors will change their name to &quot;Provincial presidential delegate&quot;&#x27; (delegado presidencial provincial), still appointed by the President.

<doc id="299560" wikidata="Q62888" url="?curid=299560" title="Andrew Yao">
<text>Andrew Chi-Chih Yao (; born December 24, 1946) is a Chinese computer scientist and computational theorist. He is currently a professor and the dean of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University. Yao used the minimax theorem to prove what is now known as Yao&#x27;s principle.

After graduating from National Taiwan University, Yao earned his first Ph.D. from Harvard University and then a second Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

Yao was a naturalized U.S. citizen, and worked for many years in the U.S. In 2015, together with Yang Chen-Ning, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and became an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

==Early life and education==

Yao was born in Shanghai, China. He completed his undergraduate education in physics at the National Taiwan University, before completing a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard University in 1972, and then a second Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1975.

==Academic career==
Yao was an assistant professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1975–1976), assistant professor at Stanford University (1976–1981), and professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1981–1982). From 1982 to 1986, he was a full professor at Stanford University. From 1986 to 2004, Yao was the William and Edna Macaleer Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University, where he continued to work on algorithms and complexity. In 2004, Yao became a professor of the Center for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University (CASTU) and the director of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), Tsinghua University in Beijing. Since 2010, he has served as the Dean of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) in Tsinghua University. In 2010, he initiated the Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS). Yao is also the Distinguished Professor-at-Large in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

In May 2024, Yao joined fellow AI researchers Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and others in publishing an expert consensus paper describing the extreme risks posed by AI. The authors warned that AI safety research is lagging, and outlined &quot;proactive, adaptive governance mechanisms&quot; for policymakers ahead of the AI Seoul Summit.

==Awards==
In 1996, Yao was awarded the Knuth Prize. Yao also received the Turing Award in 2000, considered the &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; of computer science, &quot;in recognition of his fundamental contributions to the theory of computation, including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number generation, cryptography, and communication complexity&quot;.

<doc id="299563" wikidata="Q6094371" url="?curid=299563" title="Itemized deduction">
<text>Under United States tax law, itemized deductions are eligible expenses that individual taxpayers can claim on federal income tax returns and which decrease their taxable income, and are claimable in place of a standard deduction, if available.

Most taxpayers are allowed a choice between itemized deductions and the standard deduction. After computing their adjusted gross income (AGI), taxpayers can itemize deductions (from a list of allowable items) and subtract those itemized deductions from their AGI amount to arrive at the taxable income. Alternatively, they can elect to subtract the standard deduction for their filing status to arrive at the taxable income. In other words, the taxpayer may generally deduct the total itemized deduction amount or the applicable standard deduction amount, whichever is greater.

The choice between the standard deduction and itemizing involves a number of considerations:

* Only a taxpayer eligible for the standard deduction can choose it.
* U.S. citizens and aliens who are resident for tax purposes are eligible to claim the standard deduction. Nonresident aliens are not eligible. 
* If the taxpayer is filing as &quot;married, filing separately,&quot; and his or her spouse itemizes, then the taxpayer cannot claim the standard deduction. In other words, a taxpayer whose spouse itemizes deductions must either itemize as well or claim &quot;0&quot; (zero) as the amount of the standard deduction.
* The taxpayer must have maintained the records required to substantiate the itemized deductions.
* If the amounts of the itemized deductions and the standard deduction do not differ much, the taxpayer may take the standard deduction to reduce the possibility of adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The amount of the standard deduction cannot be changed following an audit unless the taxpayer&#x27;s filing status changes.
* If the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to file a shorter tax form such as 1040EZ or 1040A, he or she would prefer not to prepare (or pay to prepare) the more complicated Form 1040 and the associated Schedule A for itemized deductions.
* The standard deduction is not allowed for calculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT). If the taxpayer claims the standard deduction for regular income tax, he or she cannot itemize deductions for the AMT. Thus, for a taxpayer who pays the AMT (i.e., their AMT is higher than regular tax), it may be better to itemize deductions, even if it produces a result that is less than the standard deduction.

Deductions are reported in the tax year in which the eligible expenses were paid. For example, an annual membership fee for a professional association paid in December 2009 for the year 2010 is deductible in the year 2009.

The United States has a comparatively large and complicated number of deductions owing to policymakers&#x27; preference to pass policy through the tax code.

==Examples of allowable itemized deductions==
Allowable deductions include:
* Medical expenses, only to the extent that the expenses exceed 7.5% (as of the 2018 tax year, when this was reduced from 10%) of the taxpayer&#x27;s adjusted gross income. (For example, a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $20,000 and medical expenses of $5,000 would be eligible to deduct $3,500 of their medical expenses ($20,000 X 7.5% = $1,500; $5,000 - $1,500 = $3,500). Allowable medical expenses include:
** Capital expenditures that are advised by a physician, where the facility is used primarily by the patient alone and the expense is reasonable (e.g., a swimming pool for someone with a degenerative disease, an elevator for someone with heart disease)
** Payments to doctors, dentists, surgeons, chiropractors, psychologists, counselors, physical therapists, osteopaths, podiatrists, home health care nurses, cost of care for chronic cognitive impairment
** Premiums for medical insurance (but not if paid by someone else, or with pre-tax money such as in Cafeteria plans)
** Premiums for qualifying long-term care insurance, depending on the taxpayer&#x27;s age
** Payments for prescription drugs and insulin
** Payments for devices needed to treat or compensate for a medical condition (crutches, wheelchairs, prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids)
** Mileage for travel to and from doctors and medical treatment
** Necessary travel expenses
**Non-deductible medical expenses include:
*** Over-the-counter drugs
*** Health club memberships (to improve general health and fitness)
*** Cosmetic surgery (except to restore normal appearance after an injury or to treat a genetic deformity)
* State and local taxes paid, but the entire sum of this category is capped at $10,000 starting in tax year 2018. These include:
** Either state income tax or state and local general sales taxes paid during the tax year, but not both. 
** Property taxes, including vehicle registration fee, if assessed by reference to the value of the property. This amount is in addition to the previous choice of either income or sales tax.
** but not including:
*** Use taxes
*** Excise taxes
*** Fines or penalties
* Mortgage loan interest expense on debt incurred to purchase up to two homes, subject to limits (up to $1,000,000 in purchase debt, or $100,000 in home equity loans for loans taken out on or before December 15, 2017, or $750,000 in purchase debt for loans taken out after December 15, 2017)
** Discount points paid to discount the interest rate on up to two homes; points paid upon acquisition are immediately deductible, but points paid on a refinance must be amortized (deducted in equal parts over the lifetime of the loan)
* Investment interest expenses (interest paid to borrow money used for investing, including interest paid on margin accounts), up to the amount of income reported from investments; the balance is deferred until more investment income is declared
* Charitable contributions to allowable recipients; this deduction is limited to 30%-60% of AGI, depending on the characterization of the recipient. Donations can be money or goods but the value of donated services provided cannot be deducted. Reasonable expenses necessary to provide donated services such as mileage, special uniforms, or meals can be deducted. Non-cash donations valued at more than $500 require special substantiation on a separate form. Non-cash donations are deductible at the lesser of the donor&#x27;s cost or the current fair market value, unless the non-cash donation has been held for longer than a year, in which case it can only be deducted at fair market value. If appreciated stock is donated, the deduction is the fair market value of the stock on the date of the donation and the taxpayer never has to pay taxes on the inherent gain.
**Eligible recipients for charitable contributions include:
*** Churches, synagogues, mosques, other houses of worship
*** Federal, state, or local government entities
*** Fraternal or veterans&#x27; organizations
**Non-eligible recipients include:
*** Individuals
*** Political campaigns or political action committees (PACs)
* Casualty and theft losses, to the extent that they exceed 10% of the taxpayer&#x27;s AGI (in aggregate), and $100 (per event, $500 starting tax year 2009)
** Many areas of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York were declared disaster areas for tax year 2011, after Hurricane Sandy. This facilitated amendments to 2011 tax returns to claim a casualty tax deduction.
* Gambling losses, but only to the extent of gambling income (For example, a person who wins $1,000 in various gambling activities during the tax year and loses $800 in other gambling activities can deduct the $800 in losses, resulting in net gambling income of $200. By contrast, a person who wins $3,000 in various gambling activities during the year and loses $3,500 in other gambling activities in that year can deduct only $3,000 of the losses against the $3,000 in income, resulting in a break-even gambling activity for tax purposes for that year—with no deduction for the remaining $500 excess loss.) Unused non-professional gambling losses may not be carried forward to subsequent tax years. However, professional gamblers are allowed to deduct losses from other income.

==Miscellaneous itemized deductions (Tax Years 2017 and earlier)==
Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, miscellaneous itemized deductions are not deductible for tax years 2018 to 2025.

For tax years before 2018:

Miscellaneous itemized deductions are subject to a 2% floor, a.k.a. the &quot;2% Haircut&quot;. A taxpayer can only deduct the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions that exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income. For example, if a taxpayer has adjusted gross income of $50,000 with $4,000 in miscellaneous itemized deductions, the taxpayer can only deduct $3,000, since the first $1,000 is below the 2% floor.

There are 12 deductions listed in 26 U.S.C. § 67(b). These are not miscellaneous itemized deductions, and thus not subject to the 2% floor (although they may have their own rules). Any deduction not found in section 67(b) is a miscellaneous itemized deduction. Examples include:

* Job-related clothing or equipment, such as steel-toed boots, hardhats, uniforms (if they are not suited for social wear: suits and tuxedoes are not deductible, even if the taxpayer does not like to wear them, but nurses&#x27; and police uniforms are), tools and equipment required for work
* Union dues 
* Unreimbursed work-related expenses, such as travel or education (so long as the education does not qualify the taxpayer for a new line of work; law school, for example, is not deductible) (repealed, effective January 1, 2018 
* Fees paid to tax preparers, or to purchase books or software used to determine and calculate taxes owed
* Subscriptions to newspapers or other periodicals directly relating to one&#x27;s job

==Limitations==
The amount of itemized deductions was limited and phased out for high income taxpayers for tax years before 2017; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the phaseout and limitations.

<doc id="299592" wikidata="Q4492" url="?curid=299592" title="Optical disc drive">
<text>In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disc drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, while other drives can both read and record. Those drives are called burners or writers since they physically burn the data onto on the discs. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives.

Although most laptop manufacturers no longer have optical drives bundled with their products, external drives are still available for purchase separately.

== Drive types ==
Some drives can only read data where as others can both read data and write data to writable discs. Drives which can read but not write data are &quot;-ROM&quot; (read-only memory) drives, even if they can read from writable formats such as &quot;-R&quot; and &quot;-RW&quot;. Some drives have mixed read and write capabilities, such as the TSST TS-LB23, which can only read Blu-ray discs but read and write CDs and DVDs.

, most of the optical disc drives on the market are DVD and Blu-ray drives which read from and record to those formats, along with having backward compatibility with audio CD, CD-R/-RW, and CD-ROM discs.

Compact disc drives are no longer manufactured outside of audio devices. Read-only DVD and Blu-ray drives are also manufactured, but are less commonly found in the consumer market and mainly limited to media devices such as game consoles and disc media players. Laptop computers used to come with built-in optical drives. Some laptop computers used modular systems (see Lenovo UltraBay). Throughout the 2010s, they ceased to come with built-in optical disc drives in order to reduce costs and make them lighter, requiring consumers to purchase external optical drives.

=== Appliances and functionality ===


Optical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as CD players, DVD players, Blu-ray Disc players, DVD recorders, and video game consoles. As of 2017, the PlayStation and Xbox consoles are the only home video game consoles that are currently using optical discs as its primary storage format, as the Wii U&#x27;s successor, the Nintendo Switch, began using game cartridges, while the PlayStation Portable is the only handheld console to use optical discs, using Sony&#x27;s proprietary UMD format. They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and media distributed on disc and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. Floppy disk drives, with capacity of 1.44 MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy disks, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. USB flash drives, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.

Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances (films, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g. a standard DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes, however, higher-capacity formats such as multi-layer Blu-ray Discs exist) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs by pressing (replication) is cheaper and faster than individual recording (duplication).

To support 8 centimetre diameter discs, drives with mechanical tray loading (desktop computer drives) have an indentation in the tray. It can however only be used in horizontal operation. 
Slot loading drives, frequently used in game consoles and car radios, might be able to accept 8 centimetre discs and center the disc automatically.

Optical discs are used to back up relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical. Large backups are often instead made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic tape drives are also used.

Some optical drives also allow predictively scanning the surface of discs for errors and detecting poor recording quality.

The drive reduces the rotation speed of discs when encountering damage, since a lower reading speed improves readability of damaged media.

With an option in the optical disc authoring software, optical disc writers are able to simulate the writing process on CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R and DVD-RW, which allows for testing such as observing the writing speeds and patterns (e.g. constant angular velocity, constant linear velocity and P-CAV and Z-CLV variants) with different writing speed settings and testing the highest capacity of an individual disc that would be achievable using overburning, without writing any data to the disc.

Few optical drives allow simulating a FAT32 flash drive from optical discs containing ISO9660/Joliet and UDF file systems or audio tracks (simulated as codice_1 files), for compatibility with most USB multimedia appliances.

Optical drives for computers come in two main form factors: &quot;half-height&quot; (also known as &quot;desktop drive&quot;) and &quot;slim type&quot; (used in laptop computers and compact desktop computers). They exist as both internal and external variants.

&quot;Half-height&quot; optical drives are around 4 centimetres tall, while &quot;slim type&quot; optical drives are around 1 cm tall.

&quot;Half-height&quot; optical drives operate upwards of twice the speeds as &quot;slim type&quot; optical drives, because speeds on slim type optical drives are constrained to the physical limitations of the drive motor&#x27;s rotation speed (around 5000rpm) rather than the performance of the optical pickup system.

Because &quot;half-height&quot; demand much more electrical power and a voltage of 12 V DC, while &quot;slim&quot; optical drives run on 5 volts, external &quot;half height&quot; optical drives require separate external power input, while external &quot;slim type&quot; are usually able to operate entirely on power delivered through a computer&#x27;s USB port. (In some slim drives, two USB connectors are required, each supplying power, but only one the data.) Half height drives are also faster than Slim drives due to this, since more power is required to spin the disc at higher speeds.

&quot;Half-height&quot; optical drives hold discs in place from both sides while &quot;slim type&quot; optical drives fasten the disc from the bottom.

Half height drives fasten the disc using 2 spindles containing a magnet each, one under and one above the disc tray. The spindles may be lined with flocking or a texturized silicone material to exert friction on the disc, to keep it from slipping. The upper spindle is left slightly loose and is attracted to the lower spindle because of the magnets they have. When the tray is opened, a mechanism driven by the movement of the tray pulls the lower spindle away from the upper spindle and vice versa when the tray is closed. When the tray is closed, the lower spindle touches the inner circumference of the disc, and slightly raises the disc from the tray to the upper spindle, which is attracted to the magnet on the lower disc, clamping the disc in place. Only the lower spindle is motorized. Trays in half height drives often fully open and close using a motorized mechanism that can be pushed to close, controlled by the computer, or controlled using a button on the drive. Trays on half height and slim drives can also be locked by whatever program is using it, however it can still be ejected by inserting the end of a paper clip into an emergency eject hole on the front of the drive. Early CD players such as the Sony CDP-101 used a separate motorized mechanism to clamp the disc to the motorized spindle.

Slim drives use a special spindle with spring loaded specially shaped studs that radiate outwards, pressing against the inner edge of the disc. The user has to put uniform pressure onto the inner circumference of the disc to clamp it to the spindle and pull from the outer circumference while placing the thumb on the spindle to remove the disc, flexing it slightly in the process and returning to its normal shape after removal. The outer rim of the spindle may have a texturized silicone surface to exert friction keeping the disc from slipping. In slim drives most if not all components are on the disc tray, which pops out using a spring mechanism that can be controlled by the computer. These trays cannot close on their own; they have to be pushed until the tray reaches a stop. 
=== Laser and optics ===

==== Optical pickup system ====


The most important part of an optical disc drive is an &quot;optical path&quot;, which is inside a &quot;pickup head&quot; (&quot;PUH&quot;). The PUH is also known as a laser pickup, optical pickup, pickup, pickup assembly, laser assembly, laser optical assembly, optical pickup head/unit or optical assembly. It usually consists of a semiconductor laser diode, a lens for focusing the laser beam, and photodiodes for detecting the light reflected from the disc&#x27;s surface.

Initially, CD-type lasers with a wavelength of 780 nm (within the infrared) were used. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650 nm (red color), and for Blu-ray Disc this was reduced even further to 405 nm (violet color).

Two main servomechanisms are used, the first to maintain the proper distance between lens and disc, to ensure the laser beam is focused as a small &quot;laser spot&quot; on the disc. The second servo moves the pickup head along the disc&#x27;s radius, keeping the beam on the &quot;track&quot;, a continuous spiral data path. Optical disc media are &#x27;read&#x27; beginning at the inner radius to the outer edge.

Near the laser lens, optical drives are usually equipped with one to three tiny potentiometers (usually separate ones for CDs, DVDs, and usually a third one for Blu-ray Discs if supported by the drive) that can be turned using a fine screwdriver. The potentiometer is in a series circuit with the laser lens.

The laser diode used in DVD writers can have powers of up to 100 milliwatts, such high powers are used during writing. Some CD players have automatic gain control (AGC) to vary the power of the laser to ensure reliable playback of CD-RW discs.

Readability (the ability to read physically damaged or soiled discs) may vary among optical drives due to differences in optical pickup systems, firmwares, and damage patterns.

==== Read-only media ====

On factory-pressed &quot;read only media&quot; (ROM), during the manufacturing process the tracks are formed by pressing a thermoplastic resin into a nickel stamper that was made by plating a glass &#x27;master&#x27; with raised &#x27;bumps&#x27; on a flat surface, thus creating &quot;pits&quot; and &quot;lands&quot; in the plastic disk. Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser&#x27;s wavelength, the reflected beam&#x27;s phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing mutual destructive interference and reducing the reflected beam&#x27;s intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that create corresponding electrical signals.

==== Recordable media ====

An optical disk recorder encodes (also known as burning, since the dye layer is permanently burned) data onto a recordable CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, or BD-R disc (called a &quot;blank&quot;) by selectively heating (burning) parts of an organic dye layer with a laser.

This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, the writing laser is considerably more powerful. DVD lasers operate at voltages of around 2.5 volts.

The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners&#x27; lasers often peak at about 200 mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400 mW before the diode fails.

==== Rewriteable media ====
For rewritable CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, or BD-RE media, the laser is used to melt a crystalline metal alloy in the recording layer of the disc. Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the phase back) into crystalline form or left in an amorphous form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.

==== Double-sided media ====
&quot;Double-sided&quot; media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.

==== Dual layer media ====
&quot;Double layer&quot; or &quot;dual layer&quot; (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser&#x27;s focus. Traditional &quot;single layer&quot; (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective polycarbonate layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove start on the outer edge and extends inwards.

==== Photothermal printing ====
Some drives support Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s LightScribe, or the alternative LabelFlash photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.

====Multi beam drives====
Zen Technology and Sony have developed drives that use several laser beams simultaneously to read discs and write to them at higher speeds than what would be possible with a single laser beam. The limitation with a single laser beam comes from wobbling of the disc that may occur at high rotational speeds; at 25,000 RPMs CDs become unreadable while Blu-rays cannot be written to beyond 5,000 RPMs. With a single laser beam, the only way to increase read and write speeds without reducing the pit length of the disc (which would allow for more pits and thus bits of data per revolution, but may require smaller wavelength light) is by increasing the rotational speed of the disc which reads more pits in less time, increasing data rate; hence why faster drives spin the disc at higher speeds. In addition, CDs at 27,500 RPMs (such as to read the inside of a CD at 52x) may explode causing extensive damage to the disc&#x27;s surroundings, and poor quality or damaged discs may explode at lower speeds.

In Zen&#x27;s system (developed in conjunction with Sanyo and licensed by Kenwood), a diffraction grating is used to split a laser beam into 7 beams, which are then focused into the disc; a central beam is used for focusing and tracking the groove of the disc leaving 6 remaining beams (3 on either side) that are spaced evenly to read 6 separate portions of the groove of the disc in parallel, effectively increasing read speeds at lower RPMs, reducing drive noise and 
stress on the disc. The beams then reflect back from the disc, and are collimated and projected into a special photodiode array to be read. The first drives using the technology could read at 40x, later increasing to 52x and finally 72x. It uses a single optical pickup.

In Sony&#x27;s system (used on their proprietary Optical Disc Archive system which is based on Archival Disc, itself based on Blu-ray) the drive has 4 optical pickups, two on each side of the disc, with each pickup having two lenses for a total of 8 lenses and laser beams. This allows for both sides of the disc to be read and written to at the same time, and for the contents of the disc to be verified during writing.

=== Rotational mechanism ===

The rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive&#x27;s, in that the latter keeps a constant angular velocity (CAV), in other words a constant number of revolutions per minute (RPM). With CAV, a higher throughput is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.

On the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 KiB/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant bit rate. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of the disc. This led to optical drives—until recently—operating with a constant linear velocity (CLV). The spiral &quot;groove&quot; of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200 RPM on the outer rim and 500 RPM on the inner, keeping the data rate constant.

Later CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4× CLV drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 × 150 KiB/s.

For DVDs, base or 1× speed is 1.385 MB/s, equal to 1.32 MiB/s, approximately nine times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74 MB/s, equal to 6.43 MiB/s.

Because keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the zoned constant linear velocity (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at &quot;52×&quot;, for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove, also known as &quot;multi-beam&quot;, but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.

==== Limit ====
In the past, CD-ROMs have exploded when damaged or spun at excessive speeds. This imposes a constraint on the maximum safe speeds (56× CAV for CDs or around 18×CAV in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate. Lite-On estimates the incidence of exploding CDs at one or two discs in 10,000. 

The reading speeds of most half-height optical disc drives released since are limited to ×48 for CDs, ×16 for DVDs and ×12 (angular velocities) for Blu-ray Discs. Writing speeds on selected write-once media are higher.

Some optical drives additionally throttle the reading speed based on the contents of optical discs, such as max. 40× CAV (constant angular velocity) for the Digital Audio Extraction (&quot;“DAE”&quot;) of Audio CD tracks, 16× CAV for Video CD contents and even lower limitations on earlier models such as 4× CLV (constant linear velocity) for Video CDs.

A 2003 MythBusters episode erroneously claims that a CD spinning at &quot;52× speed&quot; spins at 30,000 rotations per minute (rpm). This miscalculation is caused by assuming a linear velocity of 52× at the inner edge of the data area of the disc, which would indeed reach dangerous speeds in excess of 25,000 rpm, therefore optical drives never spin discs at such speeds. In actuality, a CD speed of &quot;52×&quot; are approximately 10,000 rpm (see table, different for DVD and Blu-ray), given that drives are advertised with their angular velocities. The angular velocity is the measured as the linear velocity at the outermost edge of the disc, where the linear velocity (and accordingly the data transfer rate) is roughly 2.5 times higher than at the innermost edge of the data area.
=== Loading mechanisms ===
==== Tray and slot loading ====
Current optical drives use either a &quot;tray-loading&quot; mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized tray (as utilized by half-height, &quot;desktop&quot; drives), a manually operated tray (as utilized in laptop computers, also called &quot;slim type&quot;), or a &quot;slot-loading&quot; mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers. Slot-loading optical drives exist in both half-height (desktop) and slim type (laptop) form factors.

With both types of mechanisms, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc.

Slot-loading optical disc drives are prominently used in game consoles and vehicle audio units. Although allowing more convenient insertion, those have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller 80 mm diameter discs (unless 80 mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally. However, some slot-loading optical drives have been engineered to support miniature discs. The Nintendo Wii, because of backward compatibility with GameCube games, and PlayStation 3 video game consoles are able to load both standard size DVDs and 80 mm discs in the same slot-loading drive. Its successor&#x27;s slot drive however, the Wii U, lacks miniature disc compatibility.

There were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load a CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.

==== Top-load ====
A small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a &quot;top-loading&quot; mechanism where the drive lid is manually opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, PlayStation 2 Slim, PlayStation 3 Super Slim, GameCube consoles, Nintendo Wii Mini, most portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.

Unlike tray and slot loading mechanisms by default, top-load optical drives can be opened without being connected to power.

==== Cartridge load ====
Some early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or caddies, somewhat similar in appearance to a 3.5 inch micro floppy diskette. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns—such drives would also inconveniently require &quot;bare&quot; discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use. Ultra Density Optical (&quot;UDO&quot;), Magneto-optical drives, Universal Media Disc (&quot;UMD&quot;), DataPlay, Professional Disc, MiniDisc, Optical Disc Archive as well as early DVD-RAM and Blu-ray discs use optical disc cartridges.

=== Computer interfaces ===

All optical disc-drives use the SCSI-protocol on a command bus level, and initial systems used either a fully featured SCSI bus or as these were somewhat cost-prohibitive to sell to consumer applications, a proprietary cost-reduced version of the bus. This is because conventional ATA-standards at the time did not support, or have any provisions for any sort of removable media or hot-plugging of disk drives. Most modern internal drives for personal computers, servers, and workstations are designed to fit in a standard -inch (also written as 5.25 inch) drive bay and connect to their host via an ATA or SATA bus interface, but communicate using the SCSI protocol commands on software level as per the ATA Package Interface standard developed for making Parallel ATA/IDE interfaces compatible with removable media. Some devices may support vendor-specific commands such as recording density (&quot;GigaRec&quot;), laser power setting (&quot;VariRec&quot;), ability to manually hard-limit rotation speed in a way that overrides the universal speed setting (separately for reading and writing), and adjusting the lens and tray movement speeds where a lower setting reduces noise, as implmenented on some Plextor drives, as well as the ability to force overspeed burning, meaning beyond speed recommended for the media type, for testing purposes, as implemented on some Lite-On drives. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard or to headphones or an external speaker with a 3.5mm AUX plug cable that many early optical drives are equipped with. At one time, computer software resembling CD players controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is extracted from the disc as digital data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.

Some early optical drives have dedicated buttons for CD playback controls on their front panel, allowing them to act as a standalone compact disc player.

External drives were popular in the beginning, because the drives often required complex electronics to institute, rivaling in complexity the Host computer system itself. External drives using SCSI, Parallel port, USB and FireWire interfaces exist, most modern drives being USB. Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.

Drives with a SCSI interface were originally the only system interface available, but they never became popular in the price sensitive low-end consumer market which constituted majority of the demand. They were less common and tended to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales in comparison to proprietary cost-reduced applications, but most importantly because most consumer market computer systems did not have any sort of SCSI interface in them the market for them was small. However, support for multitude of various cost-reduced proprietary optical drive bus standards were usually embedded with sound cards which were often bundled with the optical drives themselves in the early years. Some sound card and optical drive bundles even featured a full SCSI bus. Modern IDE/ATAPI compliant Parallel ATA and Serial ATA drive control chipsets and their interface technology is more complex to manufacture than a traditional 8bit 50 Mhz SCSI drive interface, because they feature properties of both the SCSI and ATA bus, but are cheaper to make overall due to economies of scale.

When the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the -inch floppy and -inch hard disk and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) ATA drive interface, which by the time the CD-ROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives and were completely incapable of supporting removable media, a drive falling off or being removed from the bus while the system was live, would cause an unrecoverable error and crash the entire system. Early consumer grade laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device. High-end workstation systems and laptops featured a SCSI interface which had a standard for externally connected devices.

 This was solved through several techniques:

* Early sound cards could include a CD-ROM drive interface. Initially, such interfaces were proprietary to each CD-ROM manufacturer. A sound card could often have two or three different interfaces which are able to communicate with the CD-ROM drive.
* A method for using the parallel port to use with external drives was developed at some point. This interface was traditionally used to connect a printer, but despite popular myth it is not its only use and various different external auxiliary devices exist for the IEEE-1278 bus, including but not limited to tape backup drives etc. This was slow but an option for low-to-midrange laptops without integrated or PCMCIA extension bus connected SCSI.
* A PCMCIA optical drive interface was also developed for laptops.
* A SCSI card could be installed in desktop PCs to cater for an external SCSI drive enclosure or to run internally mounted SCSI Hard disk drives and optical drives, though SCSI was typically somewhat more expensive than other options, with some OEMs charging a premium for it.

Due to lack of asynchrony in existing implementations, an optical drive encountering damaged sectors may cause computer programs trying to access the drives, such as Windows Explorer, to lock up.

=== SCSI configuration ===
Drive models may support adjustment of behavioural parameters for performance optimization and testing purposes, such as the read retry count (codice_2), write retry count (codice_3), and the option to deactivate error correction (codice_4). For example, the read retry count specifies how often the drive should attempt reading a damaged sector. A higher value may increase the chance of successfully reading individual damaged sectors, but at the expense of responsiveness, since it adds delays during which the device seems unresponsive to the computer.

The codice_5 command-line utility allows manually controlling such parameters. For example, codice_6 sets the read retry count to 10 for the optical drive device file &quot;sr0&quot;, and codice_7 lists all code pages. The values may be interpreted varyingly among drive models or vendors.

=== Internal mechanism of a drive ===
The optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.

With reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it&#x27;s not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an &quot;outrunner&quot;-style brushless DC motor which has an external rotor – every visible part of it spins.

Two parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the &quot;sled&quot;, the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this &quot;sled&quot; is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the &quot;sled&quot; during continuous read or write operations, a stepper motor rotates a leadscrew to move the &quot;sled&quot; throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the &quot;sled&quot;.

In contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed DC motors to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic rotary encoder to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.

The gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).

In the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.

In the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered mirror that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main photodiode that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.

The irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are &quot;flexible circuits&quot; that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).

== History ==
The first laser disc, demonstrated in 1972, was the &quot;Laservision&quot; 12-inch video disc. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio compact disc (CD) in a read-only format created by Sony and Philips in 1975.

The first erasable optical disc drives were announced in 1983, by Matsushita (Panasonic), Sony, and Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDDI). Sony eventually released the first commercial erasable and rewritable -inch optical disc drive in 1987, with dual-sided discs capable of holding 325 MB per side.

The CD-ROM format was developed by Sony and Denon, introduced in 1984, as an extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio and adapted to hold any form of digital data. The CD-ROM format has a storage capacity of 650 MB. Also in 1984, Sony introduced a LaserDisc data storage format, with a larger data capacity of 3.28 GB.

In September 1992, Sony announced the MiniDisc format, which was supposed to combine the audio clarity of CD&#x27;s and the convenience of a cassette size. The standard capacity holds 80 minutes of audio. In January 2004, Sony revealed an upgraded Hi-MD format, which increased the capacity to 1 GB (48 hours of audio).

The DVD format, developed by Panasonic, Sony, and Toshiba, was released in 1995, and was capable of holding 4.7 GB per layer; with the first DVD players shipping on November 1, 1996, by Panasonic and Toshiba in Japan and the first DVD-ROM compatible computers being shipped on November 6 of that year by Fujitsu. Sales of DVD-ROM drives for computers in the U.S. began on March 24, 1997, when Creative Labs released their PC-DVD kit to the market.

In 1999, Kenwood released a multi-beam optical drive that achieved burning speeds as high as 72×, which would require dangerous spinning speeds to attain with single-beam burning. However, it suffered from reliability issues.

The first Blu-ray prototype was unveiled by Sony in October 2000, and the first commercial recording device was released to market on April 10, 2003. In January 2005, TDK announced that they had developed an ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating (&quot;Durabis&quot;) for Blu-ray Discs; this was a significant technical advance because better protection was desired for the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD. Technically Blu-ray Disc also required a thinner layer for the narrower beam and shorter wavelength &#x27;blue&#x27; laser. The first BD-ROM players (Samsung BD-P1000) were shipped in mid-June 2006. The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released by Sony and MGM on June 20, 2006. The first mass-market Blu-ray Disc rewritable drive for the PC was the BWU-100A, released by Sony on July 18, 2006.

Starting in the mid-2010s, computer manufacturers began to stop including built-in optical disc drives on their products, with the advent of cheap, rugged (scratches can not cause corrupted data, inaccessible files or skipping audio/video), fast and high capacity USB drives and video on demand over the internet. Excluding an optical drive allows for circuit boards in laptops to be larger and less dense, requiring less layers, reducing production costs while also reducing weight and thickness, or for batteries to be larger. Computer case manufacturers also began to stop including -inch bays for installing optical disc drives. However, new optical disc drives are still (as of 2020) available for purchase. Notable optical disc drive OEMs include Hitachi, LG Electronics (merged into Hitachi-LG Data Storage), Toshiba, Samsung Electronics (merged into Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology), Sony, NEC (merged into Optiarc), Lite-On, Philips (merged into Philips &amp; Lite-On Digital Solutions), Pioneer Corporation, Plextor, Panasonic, Yamaha Corporation and Kenwood.

== Compatibility ==
Most optical drives are backward compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.

Compared to a CD&#x27;s 1.2 mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD&#x27;s laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6 mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser. With the newer Blu-ray Disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1 mm of material. Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range. In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.


* Some types of CD-R media with less-reflective dyes may cause problems.
* May not work in non MultiRead-compliant drives.
* May not work in some early-model DVD-ROM drives. CD-R would not work in any drive that did not have a 780 nm laser. CD-RW compatibility varied.
* DVD+RW discs did not work in early video players that played DVD-RW discs. This was not due to any incompatibility with the format but was a deliberate feature built into the firmware by one drive manufacturer.
* Read compatibility with existing DVD drives may vary greatly with the brand of DVD+R DL media used. Also drives that predated the media did not have the book code for DVD+R DL media in their firmware (this was not an issue for DVD-R DL though some drives could only read the first layer).
* Early DVD+RW and DVD+R recorders could not write to DVD-R(W) media (and vice versa).
* Will work in all drives that read DVD-R as compatibility ID byte is the same.
* Recorder firmware may blacklist or otherwise refuse to record to some brands of DVD-RW media.
* DVD+RW format was released before DVD+R. All DVD+RW only drives could be upgraded to write DVD+R discs by a firmware upgrade.
* As of April 2005, all DVD+R DL recorders on the market are Super Multi-capable.
* As of October 2006, recently released BD drives are able to read and write CD media.
* Older CD player models might struggle with the low reflectivity of CD-RW media.
* Also known as &quot;DVD Multi Recorder&quot;
== Recording performance ==
During the times of CD writer drives, they are often marked with three different speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40× (6,000 kbit/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16× (2,400 kbit/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48× (7,200 kbit/s).

During the times of combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives, an additional speed rating (e.g. the 16× in 52×/32×/52×/16×) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.

For DVD writer drives, Blu-ray Disc combo drives, and Blu-ray Disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user&#x27;s manual, or bundled brochures or pamphlets.

In the late 1990s, &quot;buffer underruns&quot; became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which—for a variety of reasons—often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed. The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.

In response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with &quot;buffer underrun protection&quot; (under various trade names, such as Sanyo&#x27;s &quot;BURN-Proof&quot;, Ricoh&#x27;s &quot;JustLink&quot; and Yamaha&#x27;s &quot;Lossless Link&quot;). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the error-correcting logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives. The first of these drives were rated at 12× and 16×.

The first optical drive to support recording DVDs at 16× speed was the Pioneer DVR-108, released in the second half of 2004. At that time however, no recordable DVD media supported that high recording speed yet.

While drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved). Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a &#x27;zoned constant linear velocity&#x27; (&quot;Z-CLV&quot;). This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained. This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.

The internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB or 4 MiB when recording BD-R, BD-R DL, BD-RE, or BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-R DL, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+RW DL, DVD-RAM, CD-R, or CD-RW media.

== Recording schemes ==
CD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised authoring software to create an &quot;image&quot; of the data to record and to record it to disc in the one session. This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a removable storage medium.

Packet writing is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be &quot;closed&quot; at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the operating system and a file system like UDF, can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.

Fixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours. These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is. Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers. The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block. Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.

The DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backward compatibility (a feature dubbed &quot;lossless linking&quot;). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in digital video recorders. Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere. The Blu-ray Disc system also encompasses this technology.

Mount Rainier aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc). As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in Windows Vista. All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does Mac OS X.

=== Recorder Unique Identifier ===
Owing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the IFPI and RIAA, Philips developed the &quot;Recorder Identification Code&quot; (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the Rainbow Books. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. &quot;PHI&quot; for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID &quot;enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory.&quot;

Although the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs. The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.

=== Source Identification Code ===
The Source Identification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.

According to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.

=== Use of RID and SID together in forensics ===
The standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private or corporate investigators.

A significant motivation for introducing the SID code was to identify disc manufacturing plants producing unauthorised copies of commercial CDs. By the 1990s, the production process for CDs had evolved from requiring a &quot;clean-room&quot; environment involving multiple processes, this demanding a substantial investment and likely to be confined to &quot;responsible&quot; organisations, into an activity that could be undertaken with &quot;mono-liner&quot; equipment, this having been developed in the late 1980s and capable of packaging &quot;the whole process into a single box&quot; that could occupy &quot;no more space than a couple of office desks&quot;. Consequently, the CD manufacturing industry had grown to include less reputable organisations and, by 1994, could produce a volume of discs twice that of the estimated demand for &quot;legitimate CDs&quot;, with music industry organisations claiming that illicit copies were outselling legitimate copies by significant margins in some markets. Philips and the IFPI envisaged that combinations of codes, each identifying a disc mastering establishment and the manufacturing plant used to make a particular disc, would assist in identifying those responsible for illicit CD production. However, the scheme relied on existing manufacturing plants upgrading their equipment to support the introduction of this measure, and the accompanying challenge of convincing such facilities was perceived as &quot;a little difficult&quot; in cases where those facilities were already involved in making considerable numbers of illicit discs.

<text>A strobe light or stroboscopic lamp, commonly called a strobe, is a device used to produce regular flashes of light. It is one of a number of devices that can be used as a stroboscope. The word originated from the Ancient Greek (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;act of whirling&quot;.

A typical commercial strobe light has a flash energy in the region of 10 to 150 joules, and discharge times as short as a few milliseconds, often resulting in a flash power of several kilowatts. Larger strobe lights can be used in “continuous” mode, producing extremely intense illumination.

The light source is commonly a xenon flash lamp, or &quot;flashtube&quot;, which has a complex spectrum and a color temperature of approximately 5,600 kelvins. To obtain colored light, colored gels may be used.

== Scientific explanation of flashtubes ==

Strobe lights usually use flashtubes with energy supplied from a capacitor, an energy storage device much like a battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. In a capacitor-based strobe, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, to trigger the flash a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high-voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a path for the capacitor to discharge through, allowing the capacitor to quickly release its energy into the arc. The capacitor&#x27;s energy rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.

A strobe without a capacitor storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it&#x27;s fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time and allows for much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, without which the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially tripping electrical breakers or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.

The duration of a single flash depends on the particular strobe being used and its settings. Strobes for studio lighting often have a range of power settings. For a given strobe, higher light output corresponds to a longer flash duration. For example, the Flashpoint Rapid 1200 HSS Monolight has a flash duration as long as 5.6 ms (1/180 sec) at its highest output setting, or as short as 68 μs (1/14,814 sec) at its lowest output setting. Strobes with significantly shorter flash durations are commercially available, some with flash durations less than 1 μs. For example, the SPOT strobe by Prism Science Works provides a flash duration of order 0.5 μs

Some strobes even offer continuous mode of operation whereby the arc is sustained, providing extremely high intensity light, but usually only for small amounts of time to prevent overheating and eventual breakage of the flash tube.

== Applications ==

===Strobe beacons===

A strobe beacon is a flashing electric lamp used in a variety of industries as an attention-getting device, either to warn of possible hazards, or to attract potential customers. Strobe beacons are similar to rotating beacons, but are more energy efficient, and with no moving parts, are more reliable and less likely to break.

Gas strobe beacons include Xenon flash lamp and halogen varieties. Gas strobe beacons consist of a gas-filled tube surrounded by a lens. When electricity is applied, the tube flashes and is magnified by the lens, and a 360 degree light is emitted. The intensity of the light depends on the amount of electricity provided.

These lenses come in a variant of colors, mainly clear, yellow, amber, red, blue, and green. The lens color can affect the intensity of light.

LED strobe beacons consist of a base, a LED or group of LEDs, and a cover. A solid state flash controller is located within the base, which allows the LED beacon to operate in a variety of flash patterns.

Strobe lights are often used for aircraft anti-collision lighting both on aircraft themselves and also on tall stationary objects, such as television and radio towers. Other applications are in alarm systems, emergency vehicle lighting, theatrical lighting (most notably to simulate lightning), and as high-visibility aircraft collision avoidance lights. They are still widely used in law enforcement and other emergency vehicles, though they are slowly being replaced by LED technology in this application, as they themselves largely replaced halogen lighting. Strobes are used by scuba divers as an emergency signaling device.

=== Stroboscopic effect ===
Special calibrated strobe lights, capable of flashing up to hundreds of times per second, are used in industry to stop the appearance of motion of rotating and other repetitively operating machinery and to measure, or adjust, the rotation speeds or cycle times. Since this stop is only apparent, a marked point on the rotating body will either appear to move backward or forward, or not move, depending on the frequency of the strobe-flash. If the flash occurs equal to the period of rotation (or an even multiple, i.e. 2*π*n/ω, where n is an integer and ω the angular frequency), the marked point will appear to not move. Any non-integer flash setting will make the mark appear to move forward or backward, e.g. a slight increase of the flash frequency will make the point appear to move backward.

A common use of a strobe flash is to optimize a car engine&#x27;s efficiency at a certain rotational period by directing the strobe-light towards a mark on the flywheel on the engine&#x27;s main axle. The strobe-light tool for such ignition timing is called a timing light. Strobe lighting has also been used to see the movements of the vocal cords in slow motion during speech, a procedure known as video-stroboscopy.

=== Other ===
Strobelights are often used to give an illusion of slow motion in nightclubs and raves, and are available for home use for special effects or entertainment.

== History ==
The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene &quot;Doc&quot; Edgerton employed a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope for the study of moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.

EG&amp;G [&quot;now a division of URS&quot;] was founded by Harold E. Edgerton, Kenneth J. Germeshausen and Herbert E. Grier in 1947 as Edgerton, Germeshausen and Grier, Inc. and today bears their initials. In 1931, Edgerton and Germeshausen had formed a partnership to study high-speed photographic and stroboscopic techniques and their applications. Grier joined them in 1934, and in 1947, EG&amp;G was incorporated.

During World War II, the government&#x27;s Manhattan Project made use of Edgerton&#x27;s discoveries to photograph atomic explosions; it was a natural evolution that the company would support the Atomic Energy Commission in its weapons research and development after the war. This work for the Commission provided the historic foundation to the Company&#x27;s present-day technology base.

Internally triggered &quot;Strobotrons&quot; (light-output optimized thyratrons) were available as well as flood-beam-CRT-type, grid-controlled &quot;Vacuum stroboscopic light sources&quot; with fast phosphors.

The strobe light was popularized on the club scene during the 1960s when it was used to reproduce and enhance the effects of LSD trips. Ken Kesey used strobe lighting in coordination with the music of the Grateful Dead during his Acid Tests. In early 1966, Andy Warhol&#x27;s lights engineer, Danny Williams, pioneered the use of multiple stroboscopes, slides and film projections simultaneously onstage during the 1966 Exploding Plastic Inevitable shows, and at Bill Graham&#x27;s request, Williams built an enhanced stroboscopic light show to be used at Fillmore West.

== Fechner color ==
Rapid flashing of a stroboscopic light can give the illusion that white light is tinged with color, known as Fechner color. Within certain ranges, the apparent color can be controlled by the frequency of the flash. Effective stimuli frequencies go from 3 Hz upwards, with optimal frequencies of about 4–6 Hz. The colours are an illusion generated in the mind of the observer and not a real color. The Benham&#x27;s top demonstrates the effect.    

== Seizures ==
Sometimes strobe lighting can trigger seizures. Several public incidents of photosensitive epilepsy have occurred. Studies have shown that the majority of people that are susceptible to the strobing effects can have symptoms, albeit rarely, at 15 Hz-70 Hz. Other studies have shown epileptic symptoms at the 15 Hz rate with over 90 seconds of continuous staring at a strobe light. 

While no specific legal requirements are known for public usage, relevant safety control measures should be employed to minimize epileptic seizures and potential trips or falls from disturbed vision. Strobe light flash rates should not exceed 4 flashes per second; when multiple strobe lights are used, flashes should be synchronized. Warnings should be posted at venue entryways, e.g., &quot;“WARNING: Strobe lights are used during this performance”&quot;. Staff, crew, audiences and viewers should be informed prior to any usage of flickering lights or high contrast image changes.

The strobe rate of fire alarms in schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc. for any emergency notification should be maintained between 1.0 - 2.0 Hertz as a seizure precaution.

Most strobe lights on sale to the public are factory-limited to about 10–12 Hz (10–12 flashes per second) in their internal oscillators, although externally triggered strobe lights will often flash as frequently as possible.

<text>The Black Rock Desert is a semi-arid region (in the Great Basin shrub steppe ecoregion) of lava beds and playa, or alkali flats, situated in the Black Rock Desert–High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area, a silt playa north of Reno, Nevada, that encompasses more than of land and contains more than of historic trails. It is in the northern Nevada section of the Great Basin with a lakebed that is a dry remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan.

The Great Basin, named for the geography in which water is unable to flow out and remains in the basin, is a rugged land serrated by hundreds of mountain ranges, dried by wind and sun, with spectacular skies and scenic landscapes. The average annual precipitation (in the years 1971–2000) at Gerlach (in the extreme south-west of the desert) is .

The region is notable for its paleogeologic features, as an area of 19th-century Emigrant Trails to California, as a venue for rocketry, and as an alternative to the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah for setting land speed records (Mach 1.02 in 1997). It is also the location for the annual Burning Man event.

The Black Rock Desert is part of the National Conservation Area (NCA), a unit of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NCA is located in northwest Nevada and was established by legislation in 2000. It is a unique combination of the desert playa, narrow canyons, and mountainous areas.

Humans have been in Black Rock Desert since approximately 10,000 B.P. Around 1300 CE, the area was settled by the Paiute people. The Desert&#x27;s namesake large, black rock formation was used as a landmark by the Paiute and later emigrants crossing the area. The landmark is a conical outcrop composed of interbedded Permian marine limestone and volcanic rocks. At its base is a large hot spring and grassy meadow, which was an important place for those crossing the desert headed for California and Oregon. In 1843, John Frémont and his party were the first white men to cross the desert, and his trail was used by over half of the 22,000 gold seekers headed to California after 1849. In 1867, Hardin City, a short-lived silver mill town, was established (now a ghost town).

==Geography==

The Black Rock Desert region is in northwestern Nevada and the northwestern Great Basin. The playa extends for approximately northeast from the towns of Gerlach and Empire, between the Jackson Mountains to the east and the Calico Hills to the west.

The Black Rock Desert is separated into two arms by the Black Rock Range. It lies at an elevation of and has an area of about .
There are several possible definitions of the extent of the Black Rock Desert. Often, people refer only to the playa surface. Sometimes, terrain which can be seen from the playa is included. The widest definition of the Black Rock Desert region is the watershed of the basin that drains into the playa.

The intermittent Quinn River is the largest river in the region, starting in the Santa Rosa Range and ending in the Quinn River Sink on the playa south of the Black Rock Range. The watershed covers , including the Upper and Lower Quinn River, Smoke Creek Desert, Massacre Lake, and Thousand Creek/Virgin Valley watersheds of northwestern Nevada as well as small parts across the borders of California and Oregon.

If the playa is wet for a month or so, then the shallow waters teem with fairy shrimp, or anostraca born of eggs that lie dormant in the silt crust for long periods of time—sometimes for many years. The edges of the playa and the Quinn River Sink stay wet longer than the rest of the playa, which concentrates the fairy shrimp and migratory birds in those areas.

More than 250 species of neo-tropical migrant birds and many other water birds stop in Black Rock–High Rock Country for varying lengths of time. When wet, especially in spring, the playa is a favorite place for these winged visitors to rest and feed.

When it rains, the playa can become extremely sticky, bogging down four-wheel-drive vehicles. Some areas of the Black Rock are environmentally sensitive and closed to all vehicles.

Nevada&#x27;s Humboldt, Pershing, and Washoe Counties intersect in the Black Rock Desert.

===Mountain ranges===

* Calico Hills
* Division Range
* Fox Range
* Granite Range
* Hannan Range
* High Rock Canyon Hills
* Hog Ranch Mountains

===Geologic features===
The desert has numerous volcanic and geothermal features of the northwest Nevada volcanic region, including two Black Rock Points (west and east) at the southern end of the Black Rock Range and which have dark Permian volcanic rocks similar to another Permian black diabase dike formation in Nevada.

The portion of the Lake Lahontan lakebed in the Black Rock Desert is generally flat with Lahontan salt shrub vegetation, widely scattered hot springs, and a playa. In areas of the lakebed along mountains, rain shadow results in desert precipitation levels.

The playa of the Black Rock Desert lakebed is ~ within an area bounded by the Calico Mountains Wilderness (north), Gerlach (west), the Applegate National Historic Trail (northeast), and the Union Pacific Railroad (south). The &quot;South Playa&quot; (~30 sq mi, with ~ in Washoe County) is between Gerlach and the southwest boundary of the National Conservation Area (NCA), while the northeast NCA portion of the playa (including ~ in Humboldt County) is between the NCA boundary and the Applegate National Historic Trail. A Nobles route between Gerlach and Black Rock Hot Springs extends through the length of the playa. The playa&#x27;s Quinn River Sink of ~ is where the Quinn River discharges/evaporates ~ south-southwest of Black Rock Hot Springs.

===Mining===
Prospecting and mining have occurred in the Black Rock region since the mid-19th century. US Gypsum Corporation operated a gypsum mine and drywall manufacturing plant in Empire, which employed 107 people and produced 266,300 tons of gypsum in 2008.

Allied Nevada Gold Corporation re-opened the Hycroft Gold Mine in 2008 after acquiring it from Vista Gold Corp. Hycroft is an open-pit mining operation in the Kamma Mountains near Sulphur on the east side of the Black Rock Desert. An opal mine is at the base of the Calico Hills on the west side of the desert.

===Paleontology===
Bones of the mammoths that roamed the area around 20,000 BCE have been recovered. In 1979, a fossilized Columbian mammoth was found. Copies of the bones are now exhibited at the Nevada State Museum, Carson City.

==Land speed records==
The flatness of the Black Rock Desert&#x27;s lakebed surface has led to the area&#x27;s use as a proving ground for experimental land vehicles. It was the site of two successful attempts on the world land speed record:
* In 1983, Richard Noble drove the jet-powered Thrust2 car to a new record of . Noble also headed up the team that beat the Thrust 2 record.
* In 1997, ThrustSSC, driven by Andy Green, became the world&#x27;s first, and so far only, supersonic car, reaching .

==Rocketry records and attempts==
In addition to the flat surface, distance from populated areas and uncontrolled airspace over the area also attract experimentation with rockets. The following are highlights of amateur rocketry records set at Black Rock:
* On November 23, 1996, the Reaction Research Society launched a rocket to in altitude, a significant leap in amateur rocket altitude records at the time.
* On May 17, 2004, the Civilian Space eXploration Team (CSXT) launched a rocket to in altitude, which was the first amateur rocket to exceed the Kármán line required to claim a space flight.

Other rocket launches attempting various altitude records or space flights have occurred at Black Rock. In May 1999, JP Aerospace used a rockoon (balloon-launched rocket) in an unsuccessful suborbital space flight attempt covered by CNN. The rocket reached , far less than the intended Kármán Line to reach space. CSXT made unsuccessful space launch attempts in 2000 and 2002 before the successful 2004 space flight. JP Aerospace returned to the desert in 2009, launching an armchair to the edge of space for &quot;Space Chair&quot;, an advertisement for Toshiba electronic products. On September 21, 2013, the University of Southern California&#x27;s Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (USCRPL) launched its first space shot attempt, Traveler, intended to achieve a max altitude of . The rocket experienced a catastrophic failure 3.5 seconds into the flight at an altitude of approximately . If successful, Traveler would have been the first university/student-designed and built rocket to exceed the Kármán line required to claim a space flight. RPL&#x27;s second attempt, Traveler II, flew in May 2014. It also failed catastrophically, approximately one second into the flight.

==History==
More than ~15,000 years ago (15 tya), the Humboldt River flowed to the Smoke Creek–Black Rock Desert sub-basin, and during the recession of Lake Lahontan, the river diverted to the Carson Desert sub-basin. During the highest Lahontan water level (~12.7 kya), the lakebed was under about of water, under which sediment accumulated to form a flat lakebed.

Great Basin tribes inhabited the area approximately 10,000 B.P., and a Frémont Expedition encountered the site in 1843, but the Fortieth Parallel Survey (1867) conducted the first official exploration. In the late 1840s, Peter Lassen led California Trail emigrants through the desert&#x27;s Applegate-Lassen Cutoff, an arduous route that took them hundreds of miles away from the gold lands of California. By 1910, Western Pacific&#x27;s Feather River Route (Oakland to Salt Lake City) had been completed across the east side of the lakebed on the &quot;general route first explored by Lieutenant E.G. Beckwith in 1854&quot;. By 1927, the desert had been used for filming &quot;The Winning of Barbara Worth&quot; (the 2003 &quot;Mythbusters&quot; pilot episode was also filmed in the area).

In World War II, of the Black Rock Desert was used for a USAAF aerial gunnery training range, and post-war, the north region of the United States Navy&#x27;s Lovelock Aerial Gunnery Range was in the Black Rock Desert area (the Black Rock Desert Gunnery Range had closed by 1964). In 1979, a fossilized Columbian Mammoth was found along the side of the lakebed.

The Dooby Lane art installation was created by DeWayne &quot;Doobie&quot; Williams between 1978 and 1992. Guru Road, located about 2 miles north of Gerlach on Highway 34, consists of a series of art installations that include aphorisms and the names of local residents carved in to rocks. Larger installations such as &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, Elvis, Imagination Station – Desert Broadcasting System (where the windows are TV frames with different panoramas) are also present.

The first &quot;Balls&quot; rocket event was held at the desert in 1993, and in 1998, the first annual Gerlach Dash glider race from Reno to the desert was held. For its 30th anniversary in 1994, the Black Rock Press (University of Nevada, Reno) published a book of desert photographs. The Friends of the Black Rock/High Rock organized in 1999, and a National Conservation Area Act the next year created several protected areas of the desert. Also in 2000, Lisa O&#x27;Shea died seven days after being scalded in Double Hot Springs when she attempted to rescue two dogs, and the Bureau of Land Management subsequently fenced &quot;Double Hot&quot;.

===21st century===
Jack Lee Harelson was fined $2.5 million in 2002 for archaeological looting of Elephant Mountain Cave. In 2010, the Bureau of Land Management Winnemucca District Office completed a roundup of 1,922 wild horses in the Calico Mountains Complex, of which 39 died of malnutrition due to overgrazing.

From 1990 to 2019, and starting again in 2022, the Black Rock Desert playa has been the location for the Burning Man festival.

==Transportation==

Nevada State Route 447 is the area&#x27;s main highway and connects Gerlach to SR 427 at Wadsworth, Nevada, near Interstate 80. The desert&#x27;s dirt roads are generally not usable in wet or snowy conditions. Old Highway 34 provides access to the playa on the west side and to the Hualapai Flat. Old Highway 48 (dirt) connects the playa to Lovelock, and Old Highway 49 (Jungo Road, dirt) provides access to the lakebed from the Sulphur and Jungo ghost towns.

The Union Pacific Railroad Elko Subdivision runs along the lakebed&#x27;s east side between Sulphur and Gerlach. The railroad was constructed in the early 1900s as the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route.

Light aircraft have landed on the lakebed for events (the nearby Empire and Reno-Tahoe International Airports provide commercial service for the area).

<text>A slipped half hitch is a knot in which the weight of the load the rope carries depresses the loop sufficiently to keep it in place until the load item is placed in its location. When no longer required the free end may be pulled and draw the loop through and so release the load.
The Overhand Noose
is sometimes used as a Slip Knot to form the loops of a Trucker&#x27;s Hitch, or as a Stopper. Double Noose is used in arboriculture to fix a rope to a carabiner. Today this knot is mistakenly named like Barrel Hitch.

<text>Psychological projection is a defence mechanism of alterity concerning &quot;inside&quot; &quot;content&quot; mistaken to be coming from the &quot;outside&quot; Other. It forms the basis of empathy by the projection of personal experiences to understand someone else&#x27;s subjective world. In its malignant forms, it is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against disowned and highly negative parts of the self by denying their existence in themselves and attributing them to others, breeding misunderstanding and causing interpersonal damage. Projection incorporates blame shifting and can manifest as shame dumping. Projection has been described as an early phase of introjection.

==Historical precursors==
A prominent precursor in the formulation of the projection principle was Giambattista Vico. In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first enlightenment thinker to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.

The Babylonian Talmud (500 AD) notes the human tendency toward projection and warns against it: &quot;Do not taunt your neighbour with the blemish you yourself have.&quot; In the parable of the Mote and the Beam in the New Testament, Jesus warned against projection: &quot;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&#x27;s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, &#x27;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&#x27; when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother&#x27;s eye.&quot;

==Psychoanalytic developments==
Projection () was conceptualised by Sigmund Freud in his letters to Wilhelm Fliess, and further refined by Karl Abraham and Anna Freud. Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one&#x27;s own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else. What the ego refuses to accept is split off and placed in another.

Freud would later come to believe that projection did not take place arbitrarily, but rather seized on and exaggerated an element that already existed on a small scale in the other person. The related defence of projective identification differs from projection in that the other person is expected to become identified with the impulse or desire projected outside, so that the self maintains a connection with what is projected, in contrast to the total repudiation of projection proper.

Melanie Klein saw the projection of good parts of the self as leading potentially to over-idealisation of the object. Equally, it may be one&#x27;s conscience that is projected, in an attempt to escape its control: a more benign version of this allows one to come to terms with outside authority.

== Theoretical examples ==

Projection tends to come to the fore in normal people at times of personal or political crisis and is commonly found in narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder or paranoid personalities.

Carl Jung considered that the unacceptable parts of the personality represented by the Shadow archetype were particularly likely to give rise to projection, both small-scale and on a national/international basis. Marie-Louise Von Franz extended her view of projection, stating that &quot;wherever known reality stops, where we touch the unknown, there we project an archetypal image&quot;.

Psychological projection is one of the medical explanations of bewitchment used to explain the behavior of the afflicted children at Salem in 1692. The historian John Demos wrote in 1970 that the symptoms of bewitchment displayed by the afflicted girls could have been due to the girls undergoing psychological projection of repressed aggression.

== Practical examples ==

*Victim blaming: The victim of someone else&#x27;s actions or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person&#x27;s hostility. In such cases, the psyche projects the experiences of weakness or vulnerability with the aim of ridding itself of the feelings and, through its disdain for them or the act of blaming, their conflict with the ego.
*Projection of marital guilt: Thoughts of infidelity to a partner may be unconsciously projected in self-defence on to the partner in question, so that the guilt attached to the thoughts can be repudiated or turned to blame instead, in a process linked to denial. For example, a person who is having a sexual affair may fear that their spouse is planning an affair or may accuse the innocent spouse of adultery.
*Bullying: A bully may project their own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully&#x27;s typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully&#x27;s targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully&#x27;s own sense of personal insecurity or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.
* People in love &quot;reading&quot; each other&#x27;s mind involves a projection of the self into the other.
*Projection of general guilt: Projection of a severe conscience is another form of defense, one which may be linked to the making of false accusations, personal or political.
*Projection of hope: Also, in a more positive light, a patient may sometimes project their feelings of hope onto the therapist.

== Counter-projection ==

Jung wrote, &quot;All projections provoke counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject.&quot; Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual acting out.

In a rather different usage, Harry Stack Sullivan saw counter-projection in the therapeutic context as a way of warding off the compulsive re-enactment of a psychological trauma, by emphasizing the difference between the current situation and the projected obsession with the perceived perpetrator of the original trauma.

== Clinical approaches ==

Drawing on Gordon Allport&#x27;s idea of the expression of self onto activities and objects, projective techniques have been devised to aid personality assessment, including the Rorschach ink-blots and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).

Projection may help a fragile ego reduce anxiety, but at the cost of a certain dissociation, as in dissociative identity disorder. In extreme cases, an individual&#x27;s personality may end up becoming critically depleted. In such cases, therapy may be required which would include the slow rebuilding of the personality through the &quot;taking back&quot; of such projections.

The method of managed projection is a projective technique. The basic principle of this method is that a subject is presented with their own verbal portrait named by the name of another person, as well as with a portrait of their fictional opposition (V. V. Stolin, 1981).

The technique is suitable for application in psychological counseling and might provide valuable information about the form and nature of their self-esteem 

== Criticism ==

Some studies were critical of Freud&#x27;s theory. Research on social projection supports the existence of a false-consensus effect whereby humans have a broad tendency to believe that others are similar to themselves, and thus &quot;project&quot; their personal traits onto others. This applies to both good and bad traits; it is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the trait within the self. A study of the empirical evidence for a range of defense mechanisms by Baumeister, Dale, and Sommer (1998) concluded, &quot;The view that people defensively project specific bad traits of their own onto others as a means of denying that they have them is not well supported.&quot; However, Newman, Duff, and Baumeister (1997) proposed a new model of defensive projection in which the repressor&#x27;s efforts to suppress thoughts of their undesirable traits make those trait categories highly accessible—so that they are then used all the more often when forming impressions of others. The projection is then only a byproduct of the real defensive mechanism.

<text>Due diligence is the investigation or exercise of care that a reasonable business or person is normally expected to take before entering into an agreement or contract with another party or an act with a certain standard of care.

Due diligence can be a legal obligation, but the term more commonly applies to voluntary investigations. It may also offer a defence against legal action. A common example of due diligence is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets in advance of a merger or acquisition. The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks.

==Development of the term==
The term &quot;due diligence&quot; can be read as &quot;required carefulness&quot; or &quot;reasonable care&quot; in general usage, and has been used in the literal sense of &quot;requisite effort&quot; since at least the mid-fifteenth century. It became a specialized legal term and later a common business term due to the United States&#x27; Securities Act of 1933, where the process is called &quot;reasonable investigation&quot;. Under Section 11b3, a person could avoid liability for an untrue statement of a material fact if they had, &quot;after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe and did believe, at the time&quot;, the truth of the statement. The defense at Section 11, referred to later in legal usage as the &quot;due diligence&quot; defense, could be used by broker-dealers when accused of inadequate disclosure to investors of material information with respect to the purchase of securities. In legal and business use, the term was soon used for the process itself instead of how it was to be performed, so that the original expressions such as &quot;exercise due diligence in investigating&quot; and &quot;investigation carried out with due diligence&quot; were soon shortened to &quot;due diligence investigation&quot; and finally &quot;due diligence&quot;.

As long as broker-dealers exercised &quot;due diligence&quot; (required carefulness) in their investigation into the company whose equity they were selling, and as long as they disclosed to the investor what they found, they would not be found liable for non-disclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation.

The broker-dealer community quickly institutionalized, as a standard practice, the conducting of due diligence investigations of any stock offerings in which they involved themselves. Originally the term was limited to public offerings of equity investments, but over time it has become associated with investigations of private mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as well.

== Examples ==
=== Business transactions and corporate finance ===
Due diligence takes different forms depending on its purpose:
# The examination of a potential target for merger, acquisition, privatization, or similar corporate finance transaction normally by a buyer. (This can include self due diligence or &quot;reverse due diligence&quot;, i.e. an assessment of a company, usually by a third party on behalf of the company, prior to taking the company to market.)
# A reasonable investigation focusing on material future matters.
# An examination being achieved by asking certain key questions, including, how do we buy, how do we structure an acquisition, and how much do we pay?
# An investigation of current practices of process and policies.
# An examination aiming to make an acquisition decision via the principles of valuation and shareholder value analysis.

A due diligence process can be divided into nine distinct areas:
# Compatibility audit.
# Financial audit.
# Macro-environment audit.
# Legal/environmental audit.
# Marketing audit.
# Production audit.
# Management audit.
# Information systems audit.
# Reconciliation audit.

It is essential that the concepts of valuations (shareholder value analysis) be considered in a due diligence process. This is in order to reduce the number of failed mergers and acquisitions.

In this regard, two new audit areas have been incorporated into the Due Diligence framework:
* the Compatibility Audit which deals with the strategic components of the transaction and in particular the need to add shareholder value and
* the Reconciliation audit, which links/consolidates other audit areas together via a formal valuation in order to test whether shareholder value will be added.

The relevant areas of concern may include the financial, legal, labor, tax, IT, environment and market/commercial situation of the company. Other areas include intellectual property, real and personal property, insurance and liability coverage, debt instrument review, employee benefits (including the Affordable Care Act) and labor matters, immigration, and international transactions. Areas of focus in due diligence continue to develop with cybersecurity emerging as an area of concern for business acquirers. Risk is a key factor in determining &#x27;duty of care&#x27;. Regulations require &#x27;reasonable security&#x27; in cybersecurity programs, and litigators examine whether &#x27;due care&#x27; was practiced. Due diligence findings impact a number of aspects of the transaction including the purchase price, the representations and warranties negotiated in the transaction agreement, and the indemnification provided by the sellers.

Due Diligence has emerged as a separate profession for accounting and auditing experts and is typically referred to as Transaction Services.

===Legislation===

With the number and size of penalties increasing, the United States&#x27; Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) has caused many U.S. institutions to look into how they evaluate all of their relationships overseas. The lack of a due diligence of a company&#x27;s agents, vendors, and suppliers, as well as merger and acquisition partners in foreign countries could lead to doing business with an organization linked to a foreign official or state owned enterprises and their executives. This link could be perceived as leading to the bribing of the foreign officials and as a result lead to noncompliance with the FCPA. Due diligence in regard to FCPA compliance is required in two aspects:

# Initial due diligence – this step is necessary in evaluating what risk is involved in doing business with an entity prior to establishing a relationship and assesses risk at that point in time.
# Ongoing due diligence – this is the process of periodically evaluating each relationship overseas to find links between current business relationships overseas and ties to a foreign official or illicit activities linked to corruption. This process will be performed indefinitely as long as a relationship exists, and usually involves comparing the companies and executives to a database of foreign officials. This process should be performed on all relationships regardless of location and is often part of a wider Integrity Management initiative.

In the M&amp;A context, buyers can use the due diligence phase to integrate a target into their internal FCPA controls, focusing initial efforts on necessary revisions to the target&#x27;s business activities with a high-risk of corruption.

While financial institutions are among the most aggressive in defining FCPA best practices, manufacturing, retailing and energy industries are highly active in managing FCPA compliance programs.

In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010 requires companies using an &quot;adequate procedures&quot; defence to a charge of bribery to have undertaken due diligence on their business partners. Due diligence is described as &quot;knowing exactly who you are dealing with&quot;. Official guidance suggests that &quot;ask[ing] a few questions and do[ing] a few checks&quot; can help to protect an organisation from taking on untrustworthy partners.

===Human rights===
Passed on May 25, 2011, the OECD member countries agreed to revise their guidelines promoting tougher standards of corporate behavior, including human rights. As part of this new definition, they utilized a new aspect of due diligence that requires a corporation to investigate third party partners for potential abuse of human rights.

The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (a government-backed international agreement that provides guidance on responsible business conduct) state that multinational enterprises will &quot;Seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations, products or services by a business relationship, even if they do not contribute to those impacts&quot;.

The term &#x27;due diligence&#x27; was originally put forward in this context by UN Special Representative for Human Rights and Business John Ruggie, who used it as an umbrella to cover the steps and processes by which a company understands, monitors and mitigates its human rights impacts. Human Rights Impact Assessment is a component of this.

The UN formalized guidelines for Human Rights Due Diligence on June 16, 2011, with the endorsement of Ruggie&#x27;s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.

=== Civil litigation ===

Due diligence in civil procedure is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of relief are requested. For example, duly diligent efforts to locate and/or serve a party with civil process is frequently a requirement for a party seeking to use means other than personal service to obtain jurisdiction over a party. Similarly, in areas of the law such as bankruptcy, an attorney representing someone filing a bankruptcy petition must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made in the bankruptcy petition are factually accurate. Due diligence is also generally prerequisite to a request for relief in states where civil litigants are permitted to conduct pre-litigation discovery of facts necessary to determine whether or not a party has a factual basis for a cause of action.

In civil actions seeking a foreclosure or seizure of property, a party requesting this relief is frequently required to engage in due diligence to determine who may claim an interest in the property by reviewing public records concerning the property and sometimes by a physical inspection of the property that would reveal a possible interest in the property of a tenant or other person.

Due diligence is also a concept found in the civil litigation concept of a statute of limitations. Frequently, a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when that plaintiff knew or should have known had that plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant. In this context, the term &quot;due diligence&quot; determines the scope of a party&#x27;s constructive knowledge, upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute &quot;inquiry notice&quot; that alerts a would-be plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action.

=== Criminal law ===
In criminal law, due diligence is the only available defense to a crime that is one of strict liability (i.e., a crime that only requires an actus reus and no mens rea). Once a criminal offence is proven, the defendant must prove on balance that they did everything possible to prevent the act from happening. It is not enough that they met the normal standard of care in their industry – they must show that they took every reasonable precaution.

The term &quot;due diligence&quot; is also used in criminal law to describe the scope of the duty of a prosecutor to make efforts to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to (accused) criminal defendants.

In criminal law, &quot;due diligence&quot; also identifies the standard a prosecuting entity must satisfy in pursuing an action against a defendant, especially with regard to the provision of the Federal and State Constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial or to have a warrant or detainer served in an action. In cases where a defendant is in any type of custodial situation where their freedom is constrained, it is solely the prosecuting entity&#x27;s duty to ensure the provision of such rights and present the citizen before the court with jurisdiction. This also applies where the respective judicial system and/or prosecuting entity has current address or contact information on the named party and said party has made no attempt to evade notice of the prosecution of the action.

==Due diligence defence==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;proper use of a due diligence system&quot; may be used as a defence against a charge of breach of regulations: for example, under the Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013 and the Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, businesses may be able to defend a charge of non-compliance with regulations if they can show that they have undertaken supplier due diligence to a necessary standard. References to &quot;due diligence&quot; and the maintenance of a &quot;due diligence system&quot; in the regulation concerning timber are drawn from the European Union&#x27;s Regulation 995/2010, which covers the legal obligations of &quot;operators who place timber and timber products on the market&quot;.

<text>The Church of Jesus Christ–Christian is an American Christian Identity, white supremacist church, which was founded in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan organizer Wesley A. Swift in Lancaster, California. Swift was the son of a Methodist Episcopal Church, South minister and is considered a significant figure in the early years of the Christian Identity movement in the United States. Swift&#x27;s work and copyrights are carried on by Kingdom Identity Ministries.

==History==
The church was originally known as the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation in Lancaster, California, assuming its present name in 1957. The hyphenated name was used to express the false idea that Jesus was not a Jew.

After Wesley Swift&#x27;s death in 1970, the ministry was continued by his wife Lorraine Swift. Roy Gillaspie and Arnold Murray were in leadership positions between 1950 and the 1970s.

In February 2001, the names Church of Jesus Christ–Christian and Aryan Nations were transferred to Victoria and Jason Keenan when the Keenans won a US $6.3 million lawsuit against the organizations after being attacked by Aryan Nations paramilitary soldiers; the Aryan Nations compound was also transferred to the Keenans. In March 2001, the Keenans sold the compound to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Carr Foundation, a human rights organization which plans to build a human rights center on the property.

The church resurfaced in August 2009, five years after the death of Richard Butler, who resumed the ministry after the death of Swift. The church is now headed by a council of three men, including Senior Pastor Paul R. Mullet.

<text>The National Assembly (, ) is the lower house of the bicameral French Parliament under the Fifth Republic, the upper house being the Senate (). The National Assembly&#x27;s legislators are known as () or deputies.

There are 577 , each elected by a single-member constituency (at least one per department) through a two-round system; thus, 289 seats are required for a majority. The president of the National Assembly, currently Yaël Braun-Pivet, presides over the body. The officeholder is usually a member of the largest party represented, assisted by vice presidents from across the represented political spectrum. The National Assembly&#x27;s term is five years; however, the president of France may dissolve the assembly, thereby calling for early elections, unless it has been dissolved in the preceding twelve months. This measure has become rarer since the 2000 French constitutional referendum reduced the presidential term from seven to five years; in the four elections between 2002 and 2017, the president of the Republic has always had a coattail effect delivering a majority in the assembly election two months after the presidential election, and it was accordingly of little benefit to dissolve it. In 2024, it was dissolved following the announcement of the results of the European Parliament election. Due to the separation of powers, the president of the Republic may not take part in parliamentary debates. They can address the Congress of the French Parliament, which meets at the Palace of Versailles, or have the address read by the presidents of both chambers of Parliament, with no subsequent debate.

Following a tradition started by the first National Assembly during the French Revolution, the left-wing parties sit to the left as seen from the president&#x27;s seat and the right-wing parties to the right; the seating arrangement thus directly indicates the left–right political spectrum as represented in the assembly. The official seat of the National Assembly is the Palais Bourbon on the Rive Gauche of the Seine in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. The Assembly also uses other neighbouring buildings, including the Immeuble Chaban-Delmas on the Rue de l&#x27;Université, Paris. Like most institutions of importance in Paris, it is guarded by Republican Guards.

==Relations with the executive==

Following the May 1958 crisis, the Constitution of France in the Fifth Republic greatly increased the power of the executive at the expense of Parliament, compared with the previous constitutions of the Third and Fourth Republics.

The president of the Republic can decide to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new legislative elections. This is meant as a way to resolve stalemates where the Assembly cannot decide on a clear political direction. This possibility is seldom exercised. In 1997, President Jacques Chirac dissolved the National Assembly due to the lack of popularity of Prime Minister Alain Juppé. However, the plan backfired, as the newly elected majority was opposed to Chirac.

The National Assembly can dismiss the executive government (that is, the prime minister and other ministers) by a motion of no confidence (). For this reason, prime ministers and their government are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president of the Republic and National Assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as &quot;cohabitation&quot;; this situation, which has occurred three times (twice under François Mitterrand, once under Jacques Chirac), is likely to be rarer now that terms of the president and Assembly are the same length (5 years since the 2000 referendum) and are elected in the same year.

While are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the Government is never dismissed by the Assembly, at least when the governing party/coalition holds a working majority in the Chamber (which was no longer the case following the 2022 election). Since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958, there have been only two successful . The first occurred on October 5, 1962, when the National Assembly voted against President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s proposal to elect the President by direct universal suffrage. De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly within days. The second motion of censure was passed on December 4, 2024, with 331 deputies voting against the government of President Emmanuel Macron.

The Government (the prime minister and the minister in charge of relations with Parliament) used to set the priorities of the agenda for the Assembly&#x27;s sessions, except for a single day each month. In practice, given the number of priority items, it meant that the schedule of the assembly was almost entirely set by the executive; bills generally only have a chance to be examined if proposed or supported by the executive. This, however, was amended on 23 July 2008. Under the amended Constitution, the Government sets the priorities for two weeks in a month. Another week is designated for the Assembly&#x27;s &quot;control&quot; prerogatives (consisting mainly of oral questions addressed to the Government). The fourth one is also set by the Assembly. Furthermore, one day per month is set by a &quot;minority&quot; (group supporting the Government but which is not the largest group) or &quot;opposition&quot; group (having officially declared it did not support the Government).

Legislators of the assembly can ask written or oral questions to ministers. The Wednesday afternoon 3 p.m. session of &quot;questions to the government&quot; is broadcast live on television. Like Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the United Kingdom, it is largely a show for the viewers, with members of the majority asking flattering questions, while the opposition tries to embarrass the government.

==Elections==

Since 1988, the 577 deputies are elected by direct universal suffrage with a two-round system by constituency, for a five-year mandate, subject to dissolution. The constituencies each have about 100,000 inhabitants. The electoral law of 1986 specifies their variance of population within a department should not exceed 20%, when conducting any redistribution. However, none were redrawn between 1982 and 2009. As a result of population movements, births and deaths inequalities between the less populous rural districts and the urban districts arose. The deputy for the most populous (within Val-d&#x27;Oise), represented 188,000 voters, while that for the other extreme (for Lozère at-large), represented 34,000. That for Saint Pierre and Miquelon serves fewer than 6,000. Most were redrawn in 2009 (boundaries officially adopted in 2010, effective in 2012), but this redistribution was controversial, such as the creation of eleven constituencies for French residents overseas without increasing the number of seats. The electoral map is drawn by an independent commission.

To be elected in the first round of voting, a candidate must obtain at least 50% of the votes cast, with a turnout of at least 25% of the registered voters on the electoral rolls. If no candidate is elected in the first round, those who account for in excess of 12.5% () of the registered voters are entered in the second round of voting. If no three or more meet such conditions, the two highest-placing candidates automatically advance to the second round of voting – at which, the candidate who receives the most votes is elected. Each candidate is enrolled along with a substitute, who takes the candidate&#x27;s place if during tenure incapacitated or barred – if the deputy becomes a government member, most notably.

The organic law of 10 July 1985 established a system of party-list proportional representation within the framework of the . It was necessary within this framework to obtain at least 5% of the vote to elect an official. However, the legislative election of 1986, carried out under this system, gave France a new majority which returned the National Assembly to the aforementioned two-round system.

Of the 577 elected deputies, 539 represent metropolitan France, 27 represent the overseas departments and overseas collectivities; 11 represent French residents overseas.

==Procedure==
The agenda of the National Assembly is mostly decided by the Government, although the Assembly can also enforce its own agenda. Indeed, article 48 of the Constitution guarantees at least a monthly session decided by the Assembly.

===Law proposal===
A law proposal is a document divided into three distinct parts: a title, an &quot;exposé des motifs&quot; and a &quot;dispositif&quot;. The &quot;exposé des motifs&quot; describes the arguments in favour of a modification of a given law or new measurements that are proposed. The &quot;dispositif&quot; is the normative part, which is developed within articles.

A proposal for a law can originate from the Government (&quot;projet de loi&quot;) or a member of Parliament (&quot;proposition de loi&quot;). Certain laws must come from the Government, including financial regulations. The law proposals may pass through the National Assembly and Senate in an indifferent order, except for financial laws which must go through the Assembly first, or territorial organisational laws or laws for French citizens living in foreign countries, which must first pass through the Senate.

===Deposit of a law===
For an ordinary proposition of law, texts must be first reviewed by a permanent parliamentary commission, or a special commission designated for this purpose. During the discussion in the commission, or in plenary sessions in the assembly, the Government and Parliament can add, modify or delete articles of the proposal. The text is thus amended. Amendments proposed by a parliamentarian cannot mobilise further public funding. The Government has the right to ask the Assembly to pronounce itself in one vote only with the amendments proposed or accepted by the Government itself.

Projects of propositions of laws will be examined succinctly by the two chambers of Parliament (National Assembly and Senate) until the text is identical. After two lectures by the two chambers (or just one if the Government chooses to engage an acceleration of the text adoption, which can happen only in certain conditions) and without any accord, the Prime Minister or the two presidents of the chambers, conjointly with first, can convoke a special commission composed by an equal number of members of Assembly and Senators to reach a compromise and propose a new text. The new proposition has to be approved by the Government before being re-proposed to the two chambers. No new amendments can be added except on the Government&#x27;s approval. If the new proposal of law fails to be approved by the two chambers, the Government can, after a new lecture by the National Assembly and the Senate, ask the National Assembly to rule a final judgement. In that case, the National Assembly can either take back the text elaborated by the special commission or the last one that they voted for – possibly modified by several amendments by the Senate.

The president of the Republic, on the Government or the two chambers&#x27; proposal, can submit every law proposal as a referendum if it concerns the organisation of public powers, reforms on the economy, social and environmental measures, or every proposition that would have an impact on the functioning of the institutions. A referendum on the previous conditions can also be initiated by a fifth of the membership of Parliament, supported by a tenth of the voters inscribed on the electoral lists. Finally, the laws are promulgated by the president of the Republic&#x27;s signature. The officeholder may call for a new legislative deliberation of the law or one of its articles in front of the National Assembly, which cannot be denied.

==Conditions and benefits of deputies==
===Remuneration===

Assembly legislators receive a salary of €7,043.69 per month. There is also the &quot;compensation representing official expenses&quot; (, IRFM) of €5,867.39 per month to pay costs related to the office, as well as a total of €8,949 per month to pay up to five employees. They also have an office in the assembly, various perquisites in terms of transport and communications, social security, a pension fund and unemployment insurance. Under article 26 of the Constitution, deputies, like Senators, are protected by parliamentary immunity. In the case of an accumulation of mandates, a deputy cannot receive a wage of more than €9,779.11. Deputies&#x27; expenses can be scrutinised by a commission; sanctions can be pronounced if expenses were undue.

===Accumulation of mandates and minimum age===

The position of deputy of the National Assembly is incompatible with that of any other elected legislative position (Senator or since 2000, Member of European Parliament) or with some administrative functions (members of the Constitutional Council and senior officials such as prefects, magistrates, or officers who are ineligible for department where they are stationed).

Deputies may not have more than one local mandate (in a municipal, intercommunal, general, or regional council) in addition to their incumbent mandate. Since the 2017 legislative election, deputies cannot hold an executive position in any local government (municipality, department, region). However, they can hold a part-time councillor mandate. In July 2017, 58% of deputies held such a seat. Since 1958, the mandate is also incompatible with a ministerial function. Upon appointment to the Government, the elected deputy has one month to choose between the mandate and the office. If they choose the second option, then they are replaced by their substitute. Since a change validated by the National Assembly in 2008, deputies can return to their seat in the assembly one month after the end of their cabinet position. Previously, a special election had to be held.

To be eligible to be elected to the National Assembly, one must be at least 18 years old, of French citizenship, as well as not subject to a sentence of deprivation of civil rights or to personal bankruptcy.

Eligibility conditions

&quot;1. Eligibility due to personal requirements&quot;

The essential conditions to run for elections are the following. First, a candidate must have French citizenship. Secondly, the minimum age required to run for a seat at the National Assembly is set at 18 years old. The candidate must also have fulfilled his National Civic Day, a special day created to replace the military service. Finally, a candidate under guardianship and curatorship cannot be elected to the assembly.

Furthermore, a person cannot be elected if they were declared ineligible following fraudulent funding of a previous electoral campaign. Indeed, the voter could be considered as highly influenced and their decision making could be impacted. The sincerity of the results could thus not be regarded as viable and legitimate.

&quot;2. Eligibility due to positions that a person may occupy&quot;

The deputy mandate cannot be cumulated with a mandate of Senator, MEP, member of the Government or of the Constitutional Council.

The deputy mandate is also incompatible with being a member of the military corps on duty, as well as with the exercise of one of the following mandates: regional council executive, Corsican Assembly executive, departmental council executive or municipal council executive in a municipality of a least or more than 3,500 inhabitants. Prefects are also unable to be elected in France in every district they are exercising power or exercised power for less than three years before the date of the election.

Since 31 March 2017, being elected deputy is incompatible with most executive local mandates such as mayors, president of a regional council or member of the departmental council.

<doc id="299617" wikidata="Q6722344" url="?curid=299617" title="Classic Mac OS memory management">
<text>Historically, the classic Mac OS used a form of memory management that has fallen out of favor in modern systems. Criticism of this approach was one of the key areas addressed by the change to .

The original problem for the engineers of the Macintosh was how to make optimum use of the 128 KB of RAM with which the machine was equipped, on Motorola 68000-based computer hardware that does not support virtual memory. Since at that time the machine could only run one application program at a time, and there was no fixed secondary storage, the engineers implemented a simple scheme that worked well with those particular constraints. That design choice did not scale well with the development of the machine, creating various difficulties for both programmers and users.

==Fragmentation==
The primary concern of the original engineers appears to have been fragmentation – that is, the repeated allocation and deallocation of memory through pointers leading to many small isolated areas of memory which cannot be used because they are too small, even though the total free memory may be sufficient to satisfy a particular request for memory. To solve this, Apple engineers used the concept of a relocatable handle, a reference to memory which allowed the actual data referred to be moved without invalidating the handle. Apple&#x27;s scheme was simple – a handle was simply a pointer into a (non-relocatable) table of further pointers, which in turn pointed to the data. If a memory request required compaction of memory, this was done and the table, called the master pointer block, was updated. The machine itself implemented two areas in memory available for this scheme – the system heap (used for the OS), and the application heap. As long as only one application at a time was run, the system worked well. Since the entire application heap was dissolved when the application quit, fragmentation was minimized.

The memory management system had weaknesses; the system heap was not protected from errant applications, as would have been possible if the system architecture had supported memory protection, and this was frequently the cause of system problems and crashes. In addition, the handle-based approach also opened up a source of programming errors, where pointers to data within such relocatable blocks could not be guaranteed to remain valid across calls that might cause memory to move. This was a real problem for almost every system API that existed. Because of the transparency of system-owned data structures at the time, the APIs could do little to solve this. Thus the onus was on the programmer not to create such pointers, or at least manage them very carefully by dereferencing all handles after every such API call. Since many programmers were not generally familiar with this approach, early Mac programs suffered frequently from faults arising from this.

Palm OS and 16-bit Windows use a similar scheme for memory management, but the Palm and Windows versions make programmer error more difficult. For instance, in Mac OS, to convert a handle to a pointer, a program just de-references the handle directly, but if the handle is not locked, the pointer can become invalid quickly. Calls to lock and unlock handles are not balanced; ten calls to are undone by a single call to . In Palm OS and Windows, handles are an opaque type and must be de-referenced with on Palm OS or on Windows. When a Palm or Windows application is finished with a handle, it calls or . Palm OS and Windows keep a lock count for blocks; after three calls to , a block will only become unlocked after three calls to .

Addressing the problem of nested locks and unlocks can be straightforward (although tedious) by employing various methods, but these intrude upon the readability of the associated code block and require awareness and discipline on the part of the coder.

==Memory leaks and stale references==
Awareness and discipline are also necessary to avoid memory &quot;leaks&quot; (failure to deallocate within the scope of the allocation) and to avoid references to stale handles after release (which usually resulted in a hard crash—annoying on a single-tasking system, potentially disastrous if other programs are running).

==Switcher==
The situation worsened with the advent of Switcher, which was a way for a Mac with 512 KB or more of memory to run multiple applications at once. This was a necessary step forward for users, who found the one-app-at-a-time approach very limiting. Because Apple was now committed to its memory management model, as well as compatibility with existing applications, it was forced to adopt a scheme where each application was allocated its own heap from the available RAM.
The amount of actual RAM allocated to each heap was set by a value coded into the metadata of each application, set by the programmer. Sometimes this value wasn&#x27;t enough for particular kinds of work, so the value setting had to be exposed to the user to allow them to tweak the heap size to suit their own requirements. While popular among &quot;power users&quot;, this exposure of a technical implementation detail was against the grain of the Mac user philosophy. Apart from exposing users to esoteric technicalities, it was inefficient, since an application would be made to grab all of its allotted RAM, even if it left most of it subsequently unused. Another application might be memory starved, but would be unable to utilize the free memory &quot;owned&quot; by another application.

While an application could not beneficially utilize another application&#x27;s heap, it could certainly destroy it, typically by inadvertently writing to a nonsense address. An application accidentally treating a fragment of text or image, or an unassigned location as a pointer could easily overwrite the code or data of other applications or even the OS, leaving &quot;lurkers&quot; even after the program was exited. Such problems could be extremely difficult to analyze and correct.

Switcher evolved into MultiFinder in System 4.2, which became the Process Manager in System 7, and by then the scheme was long entrenched. Apple made some attempts to work around the obvious limitations – temporary memory was one, where an application could &quot;borrow&quot; free RAM that lay outside of its heap for short periods, but this was unpopular with programmers so it largely failed to solve the problems. Apple&#x27;s System 7 Tune-up addon added a &quot;minimum&quot; memory size and a &quot;preferred&quot; size—if the preferred amount of memory was not available, the program could launch in the minimum space, possibly with reduced functionality. This was incorporated into the standard OS starting with System 7.1, but still did not address the root problem.

Virtual memory schemes, which made more memory available by paging unused portions of memory to disk, were made available by third-party utilities like Connectix Virtual, and then by Apple in System 7. This increased Macintosh memory capacity at a performance cost, but did not add protected memory or prevent the memory manager&#x27;s heap compaction that would invalidate some pointers.

==32-bit clean==
Originally the Macintosh had 128 KB of RAM, with a true limit of 4 MB, despite being soldered. This limit was first reached with the Macintosh Plus and its user upgradable memory. These first few Macintosh computers use the 68000 CPU, a 32-bit processor, which has only 24 physical address lines. The 24 lines allow the processor to address up to 16 MB of memory (224 bytes), which was seen as a sufficient amount at the time. The RAM limit in the Macintosh design was 4 MB of RAM and 4 MB of ROM with the remaining 8 MB addresses split between the SCC, IWM and VIA chips, because of the structure of the memory map. This was fixed by changing the memory map with the Macintosh II, allowing up to 8 MB of RAM, by shrinking ROM and I/O addresses to 1 MB each and allocating the remaining 6 MB addresses to the NuBus slots. Connectix products MAXIMA, RAM Doubler, and Virtual allowed accessing and reallocating the 6 MB addresses allocated to the NuBus cards for a total of 14 MB, minus 1 MB per slot occupied.

Because memory was a scarce resource, the authors of Classic Mac OS decided to take advantage of the unused byte in each address. The original Memory Manager (up until the advent of System 7) placed flags in the high 8 bits of each 32-bit pointer and handle. Each address contained flags such as &quot;locked&quot;, &quot;purgeable&quot;, or &quot;resource&quot;, which were stored in the master pointer table. When used as an actual address, these flags were masked off and ignored by the CPU.

While a good use of very limited RAM space, this design caused problems when Apple introduced the Macintosh II, which used the 32-bit Motorola 68020 CPU. The 68020 had 32 physical address lines which could address up to 4 GB of memory. The flags that the Memory Manager stored in the high byte of each pointer and handle were significant now, and could lead to addressing errors.

On the Macintosh IIci and later machines, and other APIs were rewritten to implement handle locking in a way other than flagging the high bits of handles. But many Macintosh application programmers and a great deal of the Macintosh system software code itself accessed the flags directly rather than using the APIs, such as , which had been provided to manipulate them. By doing this they rendered their applications incompatible with true 32-bit addressing, and this became known as not being &quot;32-bit clean&quot;.

In order to stop continual system crashes caused by this issue, System 6 and earlier running on a 68020 or a 68030 would force the machine into 24-bit mode, and would only recognize and address the first 8 megabytes of RAM, an obvious flaw in machines whose hardware was wired to accept up to 128 MB RAM – and whose product literature advertised this capability. With System 7, the Mac system software was finally made 32-bit clean, but there were still the problem of dirty ROMs. The problem was that the decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made very early in the boot process, when the ROM routines initialized the Memory Manager to set up a basic Mac environment where NuBus ROMs and disk drivers are loaded and executed. Older ROMs did not have any 32-bit Memory Manager support and so was not possible to boot into 32-bit mode. Surprisingly, the first solution to this flaw was published by software utility company Connectix, whose System 6 extension, OPTIMA, reinitialized the Memory Manager and repeated early parts of the Mac boot process, allowing the system to boot into 32-bit mode and enabling the use of all the RAM in the machine. OPTIMA would later evolve into the more familiar 1991 product, MODE32, for System 7. Apple licensed the software from Connectix later in 1991 and distributed it for free. The Macintosh IIci and later Motorola based Macintosh computers had 32-bit clean ROMs.

It was quite a while before applications were updated to remove all 24-bit dependencies, and System 7 provided a way to switch back to 24-bit mode if application incompatibilities were found. By the time of migration to the PowerPC and System 7.1.2, 32-bit cleanliness was mandatory for creating native applications and even later Motorola 68040 based Macs could not support 24-bit mode.

==Object orientation==
The rise of object-oriented languages for programming the Mac – first Object Pascal, then later C++ – also caused problems for the memory model adopted. At first, it would seem natural that objects would be implemented via handles, to gain the advantage of being relocatable. These languages, as they were originally designed, used pointers for objects, which would lead to fragmentation issues. A solution, implemented by the THINK (later Symantec) compilers, was to use Handles internally for objects, but use a pointer syntax to access them. This seemed a good idea at first, but soon deep problems emerged, since programmers could not tell whether they were dealing with a relocatable or fixed block, and so had no way to know whether to take on the task of locking objects or not. Needless to say this led to huge numbers of bugs and problems with these early object implementations. Later compilers did not attempt to do this, but used real pointers, often implementing their own memory allocation schemes to work around the Mac OS memory model.

While the Mac OS memory model, with all its inherent problems, remained this way right through to Mac OS 9, due to severe application compatibility constraints, the increasing availability of cheap RAM meant that by and large most users could upgrade their way out of a corner. The memory was not used efficiently, but it was abundant enough that the issue never became critical. This is ironic given that the purpose of the original design was to maximise the use of very limited amounts of memory. finally did away with the whole scheme, implementing a modern paged virtual memory scheme. A subset of the older memory model APIs still exists for compatibility as part of Carbon, but maps to the modern memory manager (a thread-safe  implementation) underneath. Apple recommends that code use and &quot;almost exclusively&quot;.

<doc id="299619" wikidata="Q14913195" url="?curid=299619" title="Ketogenesis">
<text>Ketogenesis is the biochemical process through which organisms produce ketone bodies by breaking down fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids. The process supplies energy to certain organs, particularly the brain, heart and skeletal muscle, under specific scenarios including fasting, caloric restriction, sleep, or others. (In rare metabolic diseases, insufficient gluconeogenesis can cause excessive ketogenesis and hypoglycemia, which may lead to the life-threatening condition known as non-diabetic ketoacidosis.)

Ketone bodies are not obligately produced from fatty acids; rather a meaningful amount of them is synthesized only in a situation of carbohydrate and protein insufficiency, where only fatty acids are readily available as fuel for their production.

Recent evidence suggests that glial cells are ketogenic, supplying neurons with locally synthesized ketone bodies to sustain cognitive processes.

==Production==
Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells, and synthesis can occur in response to an unavailability of blood glucose, such as during fasting. Other cells, e.g. human astrocytes, are capable of carrying out ketogenesis, but they are not as effective at doing so. Ketogenesis occurs constantly in a healthy individual. Ketogenesis in healthy individuals is ultimately under the control of the master regulatory protein AMPK, which is activated during times of metabolic stress, such as carbohydrate insufficiency. Its activation in the liver inhibits lipogenesis, promotes fatty acid oxidation, switches off acetyl-CoA carboxylase, turns on malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and consequently induces ketogenesis. Ethanol is a potent AMPK inhibitor and therefore can cause significant disruptions in the metabolic state of the liver, including halting of ketogenesis, even in the context of hypoglycemia.

Ketogenesis takes place in the setting of low glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of other cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. It can also take place when there is insufficient insulin (e.g. in type 1 (and less commonly type 2) diabetes), particularly during periods of &quot;ketogenic stress&quot; such as intercurrent illness.

The production of ketone bodies is then initiated to make available energy that is stored as fatty acids. Fatty acids are enzymatically broken down in β-oxidation to form acetyl-CoA. Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized by the citric acid cycle (TCA/Krebs cycle) and then by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to release energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid β-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle; i.e. if activity in TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacetyl-CoA and β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). Furthermore, since there is only a limited amount of coenzyme A in the liver, the production of ketogenesis allows some of the coenzyme to be freed to continue fatty-acid β-oxidation. Depletion of glucose and oxaloacetate can be triggered by fasting, vigorous exercise, high-fat diets or other medical conditions, all of which enhance ketone production. Deaminated amino acids that are ketogenic, such as leucine, also feed TCA cycle, forming acetoacetate &amp; ACoA and thereby produce ketones. Besides its role in the synthesis of ketone bodies, HMG-CoA is also an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol, but the steps are compartmentalised. Ketogenesis occurs in the mitochondria, whereas cholesterol synthesis occurs in the cytosol, hence both processes are independently regulated.

==Ketone bodies==
The three ketone bodies, each synthesized from acetyl-CoA molecules, are:
* Acetoacetate, which can be converted by the liver into β-hydroxybutyrate, or spontaneously turn into acetone. Most acetoacetate is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate, which serves to additionally ferry reducing electrons to the tissues, especially the brain, where they are stripped back off and used for metabolism.
* Acetone, which is generated through the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, either spontaneously or through the enzyme acetoacetate decarboxylase. It can then be further metabolized either by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol) and then via propylene glycol to pyruvate, lactate and acetate (usable for energy) and propionaldehyde, or via methylglyoxal to pyruvate and lactate.
* β-hydroxybutyrate (not technically a ketone according to IUPAC nomenclature) is generated through the action of the enzyme D-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase on acetoacetate. Upon entering the tissues, beta-hydroxybutyrate is converted by D-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase back to acetoacetate along with a proton and a molecule of NADH, the latter of which goes on to power the electron transport chain and other redox reactions. β-Hydroxybutyrate is the most abundant of the ketone bodies, followed by acetoacetate and finally acetone.
β-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate can pass through membranes easily, and are therefore a source of energy for the brain, which cannot directly metabolize fatty acids. The brain receives 60-70% of its required energy from ketone bodies when blood glucose levels are low. These bodies are transported into the brain by monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 2. Therefore, ketone bodies are a way to move energy from the liver to other cells. The liver does not have the critical enzyme, succinyl CoA transferase, to process ketone bodies, and therefore cannot undergo ketolysis. The result is that the liver only produces ketone bodies, but does not use a significant amount of them.

==Regulation==
Ketogenesis may or may not occur, depending on levels of available carbohydrates in the cell or body. This is closely related to the paths of acetyl-CoA:
* When the body has ample carbohydrates available as energy source, glucose is completely oxidized to CO2; acetyl-CoA is formed as an intermediate in this process, first entering the citric acid cycle followed by complete conversion of its chemical energy to ATP in oxidative phosphorylation.
* When the body has excess carbohydrates available, some glucose is fully metabolized, and some of it is stored in the form of glycogen or, upon citrate excess, as fatty acids (see lipogenesis). Coenzyme A is recycled at this step.
* When the body has no free carbohydrates available, fat must be broken down into acetyl-CoA in order to get energy. Under these conditions, acetyl-CoA cannot be metabolized through the citric acid cycle because the citric acid cycle intermediates (mainly oxaloacetate) have been depleted to feed the gluconeogenesis pathway. The resulting accumulation of acetyl-CoA activates ketogenesis.

Insulin and glucagon are key regulating hormones of ketogenesis, with insulin being the primary regulator. Both hormones regulate hormone-sensitive lipase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Hormone-sensitive lipase produces diglycerides from triglycerides, freeing a fatty acid molecule for oxidation. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA reduces the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, an enzyme that brings fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase and activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby reducing the amount of starting materials for fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting their capacity to enter the mitochondria. Glucagon activates hormone-sensitive lipase and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby stimulating ketone body production, and making passage into the mitochondria for β-oxidation easier. Insulin also inhibits HMG-CoA lyase, further inhibiting ketone body production. Similarly, cortisol, catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the amount of ketone bodies produced, by activating lipolysis (the mobilization of fatty acids out of fat tissue) and thereby increasing the concentration of fatty acids available for β-oxidation. Unlike glucagon, catecholamines are capable of inducing lipolysis even in the presence of insulin for use by peripheral tissues during acute stress.

Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor alpha (PPARα) also has the ability to upregulate ketogenesis, as it has some control over a number of genes involved in ketogenesis. For example, monocarboxylate transporter 1, which is involved in transporting ketone bodies over membranes (including the blood–brain barrier), is regulated by PPARα, thus affecting ketone body transportation into the brain. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase is also upregulated by PPARα, which can affect fatty acid transportation into the mitochondria.

==Pathology==
Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are acidic, and, if levels of these ketone bodies are too high, the pH of the blood drops, resulting in ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is known to occur in untreated type I diabetes (see diabetic ketoacidosis) and in alcoholics after prolonged binge-drinking without intake of sufficient carbohydrates (see alcoholic ketoacidosis).

The production and use of ketones can be ineffective in people with defects in the pathway for beta-oxidation, in the genes for ketogenesis (HMGCS2 and HMGCL), for ketolysis (OXCT1, ACAT1). Defects in this pathway can cause varying degrees of inability to cope with fasting. HMGCS2 deficiency, for example, can cause hypoglycemic crises that lead to brain damage, and death.

Individuals with diabetes mellitus can experience overproduction of ketone bodies due to a lack of insulin. Without insulin to help extract glucose from the blood, tissues the levels of malonyl-CoA are reduced, and it becomes easier for fatty acids to be transported into mitochondria, causing the accumulation of excess acetyl-CoA. The accumulation of acetyl-CoA in turn produces excess ketone bodies through ketogenesis. The result is a rate of ketone production higher than the rate of ketone disposal, and a decrease in blood pH. In extreme cases the resulting acetone can be detected in the patient&#x27;s breath as a faint, sweet odor.

There are some health benefits to ketone bodies and ketogenesis as well. It has been suggested that a low-carb, high fat ketogenic diet can be used to help treat epilepsy in children. Additionally, ketone bodies can be anti-inflammatory. Some kinds of cancer cells are unable to use ketone bodies, as they do not have the necessary enzymes to engage in ketolysis. It has been proposed that actively engaging in behaviors that promote ketogenesis could help manage the effects of some cancers.

<text>Vicki Lynch, known professionally as Hyapatia Lee, is an American former adult film actress. She was one of the best-known actresses of the Golden Age of Porn. Lee is an AVN and XRCO Hall of Fame inductee.

==Early life and education==
Lee was born to teenage parents in the Haughville neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana, and is of Irish and Cherokee descent. She attended the local high school, where she performed in several musicals.

==Career==
In 1984, Lee appeared in &quot;Sweet Young Foxes&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine.

Over time, her husband Bud Lee joined the cast and crew of her films. Together they created the second-most-expensive pornographic film (at the time), &quot;The Ribald Tales of Canterbury&quot; (1985), a version of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

In 1993, she was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame, and the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1994. She was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Free Speech Coalition in 1995.

In 1998, members of her fan club received a report that she had died due to diabetes. The report was inaccurate.

Like many adult performers of the era, she retained no rights to her films.

===Music===
For SRO Records, Lee recorded the 7-inch single &quot;Telephone Man&quot;, released in 1988; and the album &quot;Two Sides Of Hyapatia Lee&quot; in 1989. &quot;Rub-a-Dub-Dub&quot; from the album featured on Dr. Demento&#x27;s &#x27;Funny Five&#x27; playlist, airing April 30, 1989.

In 1994, Lee recorded the album &quot;Double Euphoric&quot; with her band W4IK. She toured with the same band, which was based in Los Angeles, and also with another band, based in Indiana, called Vision Quest.

In 1999, one of Lee&#x27;s tracks from her 1994 release appeared on the music CD &quot;Porn to Rock&quot;.

&quot;Double Euphoric&quot; was re-released in September 2010, both in physical and digital versions, via outlets such as CD Baby, Amazon, and Apple iTunes.

===Writing===
Lee is an online columnist for &quot;High Times&quot;. In 1993, Lee co-wrote an autobiography comic book with Jay Allen Sanford, &quot;Carnal Comics: Hyapatia Lee,&quot; featuring her true life story illustrated by the Vampirella artist Louis Small Jr.. She also took part in and appeared within the Carnal Comics title &quot;Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History,&quot; as well as co-starring with her friend Porsche Lynn in another issue of the adult comic book line. In 2000, Lee self-published an autobiography, &quot;The Secret Lives of Hyapatia Lee&quot;. In 2016, she authored a self-help book, &quot;Native Strength – The First Step on the Path to an Indomitable Life&quot;, the first in a series.

==Personal life==
Lee views Hyapatia as a particular personality that allowed her to perform. She met and married Bud Lee, with whom she bought land in rural southern Indiana, where she has lived since. The couple had two children, whom she homeschooled at their Indiana home. In 1993, she retired from the industry and separated from Bud the same year. She has since remarried and had another child. Lee has referred to herself as a &quot;Blessed Woman&quot; of the Lost River Band of the Cherokees, an unrecognized Cherokee heritage group in Mitchell, Indiana.

<text>Under United States tax law, the standard deduction is a dollar amount that non-itemizers may subtract from their income before income tax (but not other kinds of tax, such as payroll tax) is applied. Taxpayers may choose either itemized deductions or the standard deduction, but usually choose whichever results in the lesser amount of tax payable. The standard deduction is available to individuals who are US citizens or resident aliens. The standard deduction is based on filing status and typically increases each year, based on inflation measurements from the previous year. It is not available to nonresident aliens residing in the United States (with few exceptions, for example, students from India on F1 visa status can use the standard deduction). Additional amounts are available for persons who are blind and/or are at least 65 years of age.

The standard deduction is distinct from the personal exemption, which was set to $0 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for tax years 2018–2025.

==Federal standard deduction==

The applicable federal (individual states will have different amounts for state income tax) basic standard deduction amounts for recent tax years are as follows:

===Other standard deductions in certain cases===

The standard deduction may be higher than the basic standard deduction if any of the following conditions are met:

* The taxpayer is 65 years of age or older.
* The taxpayer&#x27;s spouse is 65 years of age or older.
* The taxpayer is blind (generally defined as not having corrected vision of at least 20/200 or as having extreme &quot;limitation in the fields of vision&quot;).
* The taxpayer&#x27;s spouse is blind (see definition above).

For each applicable condition, a taxpayer adds $1,500 to his/her standard deductions (for 2023). However, the additional deduction is $1,850 for unmarried individuals who are not qualifying surviving spouses.

For dependents, the standard deduction is equal to earned income (that is, compensation for services, such as wages, salaries, or tips) plus a certain amount ($400 in 2023). A dependent&#x27;s standard deduction cannot be more than the basic standard deduction for non-dependents, or less than a certain minimum ($1,250 in 2023).

<text>Epithelium or epithelial tissue is a thin, continuous, protective layer of cells with little extracellular matrix. An example is the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Epithelial (mesothelial) tissues line the outer surfaces of many internal organs, the corresponding inner surfaces of body cavities, and the inner surfaces of blood vessels. Epithelial tissue is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. These tissues also lack blood or lymph supply. The tissue is supplied by nerves.

There are three principal shapes of epithelial cell: squamous (scaly), columnar, and cuboidal. These can be arranged in a singular layer of cells as simple epithelium, either simple squamous, simple columnar, or simple cuboidal, or in layers of two or more cells deep as stratified (layered), or &quot;compound&quot;, either squamous, columnar or cuboidal. In some tissues, a layer of columnar cells may appear to be stratified due to the placement of the nuclei. This sort of tissue is called pseudostratified. All glands are made up of epithelial cells. Functions of epithelial cells include diffusion, filtration, secretion, selective absorption, germination, and transcellular transport. Compound epithelium has protective functions.

Epithelial layers contain no blood vessels (avascular), so they must receive nourishment via diffusion of substances from the underlying connective tissue, through the basement membrane. Cell junctions are especially abundant in epithelial tissues.

== Classification ==
=== Simple epithelium ===

Simple epithelium is a single layer of cells with every cell in direct contact with the basement membrane that separates it from the underlying connective tissue. In general, it is found where absorption and filtration occur. The thinness of the epithelial barrier facilitates these processes.

In general, epithelial tissues are classified by the number of their layers and by the shape and function of the cells. The basic cell types are squamous, cuboidal, and columnar, classed by their shape.

By layer, epithelium is classed as either simple epithelium, only one cell thick (unilayered), or stratified epithelium having two or more cells in thickness, or multi-layered – as stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium, and both types of layering can be made up of any of the cell shapes. However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as pseudostratified columnar epithelium.

Transitional epithelium has cells that can change from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium.

=== Stratified epithelium ===
Stratified or compound epithelium differs from simple epithelium in that it is multilayered. It is therefore found where body linings have to withstand mechanical or chemical insult such that layers can be abraded and lost without exposing subepithelial layers. Cells flatten as the layers become more apical, though in their most basal layers, the cells can be squamous, cuboidal, or columnar.

Stratified epithelia (of columnar, cuboidal, or squamous type) can have the following specializations:

== Structure ==
Epithelial tissue cells can adopt shapes of varying complexity from polyhedral to scutoidal to punakoidal. They are tightly packed and form a continuous sheet with almost no intercellular spaces. All epithelia is usually separated from underlying tissues by an extracellular fibrous basement membrane.
The lining of the mouth, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. The lining of the blood and lymphatic vessels are of a specialised form of epithelium called endothelium.

=== Location ===
Epithelium lines both the outside (skin) and the inside cavities and lumina of bodies. The outermost layer of human skin is composed of dead stratified squamous, keratinized epithelial cells.

Tissues that line the inside of the mouth, the esophagus, the vagina, and part of the rectum are composed of nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Other surfaces that separate body cavities from the outside environment are lined by simple squamous, columnar, or pseudostratified epithelial cells. Other epithelial cells line the insides of the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, the reproductive and urinary tracts, and make up the exocrine and endocrine glands. The outer surface of the cornea is covered with fast-growing, easily regenerated epithelial cells. A specialised form of epithelium, endothelium, forms the inner lining of blood vessels and the heart, and is known as vascular endothelium, and lining lymphatic vessels as lymphatic endothelium. Another type, mesothelium, forms the walls of the pericardium, pleurae, and peritoneum.

In arthropods, the integument, or external &quot;skin&quot;, consists of a single layer of epithelial ectoderm from which arises the cuticle, an outer covering of chitin, the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

=== Basement membrane ===
The basal surface of epithelial tissue rests on a basement membrane and the free/apical surface faces body fluid or outside. The basement membrane acts as a scaffolding on which epithelium can grow and regenerate after injuries. Epithelial tissue has a nerve supply, but no blood supply and must be nourished by substances diffusing from the blood vessels in the underlying tissue. The basement membrane acts as a selectively permeable membrane that determines which substances will be able to enter the epithelium.

The basal lamina is made up of laminin (glycoproteins) secreted by epithelial cells. The reticular lamina beneath the basal lamina is made up of collagen proteins secreted by connective tissue.

=== Cell junctions ===
Cell junctions are especially abundant in epithelial tissues. They consist of protein complexes and provide contact between neighbouring cells, between a cell and the extracellular matrix, or they build up the paracellular barrier of epithelia and control the paracellular transport.

Cell junctions are the contact points between plasma membrane and tissue cells. There are mainly 5 different types of cell junctions: tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and gap junctions.
Tight junctions are a pair of trans-membrane protein fused on outer plasma membrane.
Adherens junctions are a plaque (protein layer on the inside plasma membrane) which attaches both cells&#x27; microfilaments.
Desmosomes attach to the microfilaments of cytoskeleton made up of keratin protein.
Hemidesmosomes resemble desmosomes on a section. They are made up of the integrin (a transmembrane protein) instead of cadherin. They attach the epithelial cell to the basement membrane.
Gap junctions connect the cytoplasm of two cells and are made up of proteins called connexins (six of which come together to make a connexion).

=== Development ===
Epithelial tissues are derived from all of the embryological germ layers:
* from ectoderm (e.g., the epidermis);
* from endoderm (e.g., the lining of the gastrointestinal tract);
* from mesoderm (e.g., the inner linings of body cavities).

However, pathologists do not consider endothelium and mesothelium (both derived from mesoderm) to be true epithelium. This is because such tissues present very different pathology. For that reason, pathologists label cancers in endothelium and mesothelium sarcomas, whereas true epithelial cancers are called carcinomas. Additionally, the filaments that support these mesoderm-derived tissues are very distinct. Outside of the field of pathology, it is generally accepted that the epithelium arises from all three germ layers.

=== Cell turnover ===
Epithelia turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. For epithelial layers to maintain constant cell numbers essential to their functions, the number of cells that divide must match those that die. They do this mechanically. If there are too few of the cells, the stretch that they experience rapidly activates cell division. Alternatively, when too many cells accumulate, crowding triggers their death by activation epithelial cell extrusion. Here, cells fated for elimination are seamlessly squeezed out by contracting a band of actin and myosin around and below the cell, preventing any gaps from forming that could disrupt their barriers. Failure to do so can result in aggressive tumors and their invasion by aberrant basal cell extrusion.

== Functions ==

Epithelial tissues have as their primary functions:

# to protect the tissues that lie beneath from radiation, desiccation, toxins, invasion by pathogens, and physical trauma
# the regulation and exchange of chemicals between the underlying tissues and a body cavity
# the secretion of hormones into the circulatory system, as well as the secretion of sweat, mucus, enzymes, and other products that are delivered by ducts
# to provide sensation
#Absorb water and digested food in the lining of digestive canal.

=== Glandular tissue ===
Glandular tissue is the type of epithelium that forms the glands from the infolding of epithelium and subsequent growth in the underlying connective tissue. They may be specialized columnar or cuboidal tissues consisting of goblet cells, which secrete mucus. There are two major classifications of glands: endocrine glands and exocrine glands:

* Endocrine glands secrete their product into the extracellular space where it is rapidly taken up by the circulatory system.
* Exocrine glands secrete their products into a duct that then delivers the product to the lumen of an organ or onto the free surface of the epithelium. Their secretions include tears, saliva, oil (sebum), enzyme, digestive juices, sweat, etc.

=== Sensing the extracellular environment ===
Some epithelial cells are ciliated, especially in respiratory epithelium, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarised cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the lumen.&quot; Primary cilia on epithelial cells provide chemosensation, thermoception, and mechanosensation of the extracellular environment by playing &quot;a sensory role mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a secretory role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are motile.

=== Host immune response ===
Epithelial cells express many genes that encode immune mediators and proteins involved in cell-cell communication with hematopoietic immune cells. The resulting immune functions of these non-hematopoietic, structural cells contribute to the mammalian immune system (&quot;structural immunity&quot;). Relevant aspects of the epithelial cell response to infections are encoded in the epigenome of these cells, which enables a rapid response to immunological challenges.

== Clinical significance ==
The slide shows at (1) an epithelial cell infected by &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;; their inclusion bodies shown at (3); an uninfected cell shown at (2) and (4) showing the difference between an infected cell nucleus and an uninfected cell nucleus.

Epithelium grown in culture can be identified by examining its morphological characteristics. Epithelial cells tend to cluster together, and have a &quot;characteristic tight pavement-like appearance&quot;. But this is not always the case, such as when the cells are derived from a tumor. In these cases, it is often necessary to use certain biochemical markers to make a positive identification. The intermediate filament proteins in the cytokeratin group are almost exclusively found in epithelial cells, so they are often used for this purpose.

Cancers originating from the epithelium are classified as carcinomas. In contrast, sarcomas develop in connective tissue.

When epithelial cells or tissues are damaged from cystic fibrosis, sweat glands are also damaged, causing a frosty coating of the skin. 

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
The word &quot;epithelium&quot; uses the Greek roots ἐπί (&quot;epi&quot;), &quot;on&quot; or &quot;upon&quot;, and θηλή (&quot;thēlē&quot;), &quot;nipple&quot;. Epithelium is so called because the name was originally used to describe the translucent covering of small &quot;nipples&quot; of tissue on the lip. The word has both mass and count senses; the plural form is epithelia.

<doc id="299648" wikidata="Q26629" url="?curid=299648" title="Great black-backed gull">
<text>The great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) is the largest member of the gull family. It is a very aggressive hunter, pirate, and scavenger which breeds on the coasts and islands of the North Atlantic in northern Europe and northeastern North America. Southern populations are generally sedentary, while those breeding in the far north (northern Norway, northwest Russia) move farther south in winter. A few also move inland to large lakes and reservoirs. The adult has a white head, neck and underparts, dark blackish-grey wings and back, pink legs and the bill yellow with a red spot.

==Taxonomy==
The great black-backed gull was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and it still bears its original name of &quot;Larus marinus&quot;. The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Larus&quot; appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific name &quot;marinus&quot; means &quot;marine&quot;, or when taken together, &quot;sea gull&quot;. This predates Linnean taxonomy, as it had been called &quot;Larus ingens marinus&quot; by Carolus Clusius.

The terms &quot;swaabie&quot; (from ), &quot;baagie&quot; and &quot;baigie&quot; (, from ) are local names from the Shetland Islands. Francis Willughby called it the &quot;great black and white gull&quot; in the 17th century, noting that it was called the &quot;swarth-back&quot; in the Faroe Islands.

==Description==
This is the largest gull in the world, considerably larger than a herring gull (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;); only two other gulls, glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;) and Pallas&#x27;s gull (&quot;Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus&quot;), come close to matching this species in size. It is long with a wingspan and a body weight of . In a sample of 2009 adults from the North Atlantic, males were on average and females were on average . Some adult gulls with access to fisheries in the North Sea can weigh up to roughly and averaged . An exceptionally large glaucous gull was found to outweigh any known great black-backed gull, although usually that species is slightly smaller. The great black-backed gull is bulky and imposing in appearance with a large, powerful bill. The standard measurements are: the bill is , the wing chord is and the tarsus is .
The adult great black-backed gull is fairly distinctive, as no other very large gull with black on its upper-wings generally occurs in the North Atlantic. In other white-headed North Atlantic gulls, the mantle is generally a lighter grey and, in some species, it is a light powdery grey or even pinkish. It is greyish-black on the wings and back, with conspicuous, contrasting white &quot;mirrors&quot; at the wing tips. The legs are pinkish, and the bill is yellow or yellow-pink with some orange or red near tip of lower bill. The adult lesser black-backed gull (&quot;L. fuscus&quot;) is distinctly smaller, typically weighing about half as much as a great black-back. The lesser black-back has yellowish legs and a mantle that can range from slate-grey to brownish but it is never as dark as the larger species. A few superficially similar dark-backed, fairly large gulls occur in the Pacific Ocean or in the tropics, all generally far outside this species&#x27; range, such as the slaty-backed (&quot;L. schistisagus&quot;), the western (&quot;L. occidentalis&quot;) and the kelp gull (&quot;L. dominicanus&quot;).

Juvenile birds of under a year old have scaly, checkered black-brown upper parts, the head and underparts streaked with grey brown, and a neat wing pattern. The face and nape are paler and the wing flight feathers are blackish-brown. The juvenile&#x27;s tail is white with zigzag bars and spots at base and a broken blackish band near the tip. The bill of the juvenile is brownish-black with white tip and the legs dark bluish-grey with some pink tones. As the young gull ages, the grey-brown colour gradually fades to more contrasting plumage and the bill darkens to black before growing paler. By the third year, the young gulls resemble a streakier, dirtier-looking version of the adult. They take at least four years to reach maturity, development in this species being somewhat slower than that of other large gulls. The call is a deep &quot;laughing&quot; cry, &quot;kaa-ga-ga&quot;, with the first note sometimes drawn out in an almost bovid-like sound. The voice is distinctly deeper than most other gull species.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species can be found breeding in coastal areas from the extreme northwest portion of Russia, through much of coastal Scandinavia, on the Baltic Sea coasts, to the coasts of northwestern France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Across the northern portion of the Atlantic, this gull is distributed in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, southern Greenland and on the Atlantic coasts of Canada and the United States. Though formerly mainly just a non-breeding visitor south of Canada in North America, the species has spread to include several colonies in the New England states and now breeds as far south as North Carolina. Individuals breeding in harsher environments will migrate south, wintering on northern coasts of Europe from the Baltic Sea to southern Portugal, and regularly down to coastal Florida in North America. During the winter in the Baltic Sea, the bird usually stays close to the ice boundary. North of the Åland islands, the sea often freezes all the way from Sweden to Finland, and then the bird migrates to open waters. Exceptionally, the species can range as far south as the Caribbean and off the coast of northern South America.

The great black-backed gull is found in a variety of coastal habitats, including rocky and sandy coasts and estuaries, as well as inland wetland habitats, such as lakes, ponds, rivers, wet fields and moorland. They are generally found within striking distance of large bodies of water while ranging inland. Today, it is a common fixture at refuse dumps both along coasts and relatively far inland. The species also makes extensive use of dredge spoils, which, in the state of New Jersey, are their most prevalent nesting sites. It generally breeds in areas free of or largely inaccessible to terrestrial predators, such as vegetated islands, sand dunes, flat-topped stacks, building roofs and sometimes amongst bushes on salt marsh islands. During the winter, the great black-backed gull often travels far out to sea to feed.

==Diet==
Great black-backed gulls are opportunistic feeders, apex predators, and are very curious. They will investigate any small organism they encounter and will readily eat almost anything that they can swallow. They get much of their dietary energy from scavenging, with refuse, most provided directly by humans, locally constituting more than half of their diet. The proliferation of garbage or refuse dumps has become a major attractant to this and all other non-specialised gull species in its range. A study to investigate how much time they spend foraging at refuse dumps in Massachusetts found great black-backed gulls were only observed actively foraging 19% of their time there, eating less garbage than other common gulls, and spent most of their time roosting or loafing.

Like most gulls, Great Black-backed Gulls regularly capture fish and any fish smaller than itself found close to the surface of the water are potential prey. Stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents consisted of fish, but 96% of the regurgitations given to young consisted of fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus&quot;), Atlantic cod (&quot;Gadus morhua&quot;), Atlantic tomcod (&quot;Microgadus tomcod&quot;), Atlantic mackerel (&quot;Scomber scombrus&quot;), Atlantic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus&quot;) and sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes hexapterus&quot;). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (&quot;Cancer borealis&quot;), rock crabs (&quot;Cancer irroratus&quot;), sea urchins, green crabs (&quot;Carcinus maenas&quot;), starfish (&quot;Asterias forbesi&quot; and &quot;Asterias rubens&quot;) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.

Unlike most other &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, they are highly predatory and frequently hunt and kill any prey smaller than themselves, behaving more like a raptor than a typical larid gull. Lacking the razor-sharp talons and curved, tearing beak of a raptor, the great black-backed gull relies on aggression, physical strength and endurance when hunting. When attacking other animals, they usually attack seabird eggs, nestlings or fledglings at the nest, perhaps most numerously terns, but also including smaller gull species as well as eiders, gannets and various alcids. In Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, 10% of the stomach contents of great black-backed gulls was made up of birds, while a further 17% of stomach contents was made up of tern eggs alone. Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked. Some fully-fledged or adult birds observed to be hunted in flight or on the ground by great black-backed gulls have included &quot;Anas&quot; ducks, ruddy ducks (&quot;Oxyura jamaicensis&quot;), buffleheads (&quot;Bucephala albeola&quot;), Manx shearwaters (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), pied-billed grebes (&quot;Podilymbus podiceps&quot;), common moorhens (&quot;Gallinula chloropus&quot;), terns, Atlantic puffins (&quot;Fratercula arctica&quot;), Little auks (&quot;Alle alle&quot;), coots (&quot;Fulica&quot; ssp.), glossy ibises (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;), rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) and even predatory birds such as hen harriers (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;). When attacking other flying birds, the great black-backed gulls often pursue them on the wing and attack them by jabbing with their bill, hoping to bring down the other bird either by creating an open wound or simply via exhaustion. They may kill healthy adult birds weighing up to at least but take exclusively the small young of larger birds such as common eider (&quot;Somateria mollissima&quot;) and cormorants. They will also catch flying passerines, which they typically target while the small birds are exhausted from migration and swallow them immediately. Great black-backed gull also feed on land animals, including rats (&quot;Rattus&quot; ssp.) at garbage dumps, rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) and even sickly lambs (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;).
Most foods are swallowed whole, including most fish and even other gulls. When foods are too large to be swallowed at once, they will sometimes be shaken in the bill until they fall apart into pieces. Like some other gulls, when capturing molluscs or other hard-surfaced foods such as eggs, they will fly into the air with it and drop it on rocks or hard earth to crack it open. Alternate foods, including berries and insects, are eaten when available. They will readily exploit easy food sources, including chum lines made by boats at sea. They are skilled kleptoparasites who will readily pirate fish and other prey captured by other birds and dominate over other gulls when they encounter them. At tern colonies in coastal Maine, American herring gulls (&quot;L. smithsonianus&quot;) occasionally also attack nestling and fledgling terns but in a great majority of cases were immediately pirated of their catch by great black-backs. In one observation, an adult great black-back was seen to rob a female peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) of a freshly caught gadwall (&quot;Anas strepera&quot;). In another case, a third-year great black-back was observed fighting an adult female northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;) off its kill, although the goshawk attempted to strike the gull before leaving. Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species has been referred to as a &quot;merciless tyrant&quot;. Naturally, these gulls are attracted to the surface activity of large marine animals, from Atlantic bluefin tuna (&quot;Thunnus thynnus&quot;) to humpback whales (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;), to capture fish driven to the surface by such creatures.

==Breeding==

This species breeds singly or in small colonies, sometimes in the middle of a &quot;Larus argentatus&quot; colony. Young adult pair formation occurs in March or April. The following spring the same birds usually form a pair again, meeting at the previous year&#x27;s nest. If one of the birds does not appear, the other bird begins looking for a new mate. Usually a single bird does not breed successfully in that season.

They make a lined nest on the ground often on top of a rocky stack, fallen log or other obstructing object which can protect the eggs from the elements. Usually, several nest scrapes are made before the one deemed best by the parents is selected and then lined with grass, seaweed or moss or objects such as rope or plastic. When nesting on roofs in urban environments, previous year&#x27;s nests are often reused over and over again. The female lays usually three eggs sometime between late April and late June. When only two eggs are found in a nest, the reason is almost always that one egg, for one reason or another, has been destroyed. It takes around one week for the female to produce the three eggs, and the incubation does not begin until all three eggs are laid, so all three chicks hatch on the same day. The birds are usually successful in bringing up all the three chicks.

The eggs are greenish-brown with dark speckles and blotches. Both parents participate in the incubation stage, which lasts for approximately 28 days. During this time, the birds attempt to avoid being noticed and stay silent. The breeding pair are devoted parents who both take shifts brooding the young, defending the nest and gathering food. Young great black-backed gulls leave the nest area at 50 days of age and may remain with their parents for an overall period of around six months, though most fledglings choose to congregate with other immature gulls in the search for food by fall. These gulls reach breeding maturity when they obtain adult plumage at four years, though may not successfully breed until they are six years old.

==Longevity and mortality==
This is a relatively long-lived bird. The maximum recorded age for a wild great black-backed gull is 27.1 years. This species is rarely kept in captivity, but domestically kept European herring gulls have been known to live for over 44 years and generally larger birds can outlive smaller ones. Mortality typically occurs in the early stages of life, when harsh weather conditions (including flooding) and starvation can threaten them, as well as predators. Chicks and eggs are preyed on by crows (&quot;Corvus&quot; ssp.), cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), other gulls, raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) and rats (&quot;Rattus&quot; ssp.). The bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), white-tailed eagle (&quot;H. albicilla&quot;) and golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) are the only birds known to habitually predate healthy, fully grown great black-backed gulls. In one study from Norway, great black-backed gulls were the fifth highest frequency prey item for white-tailed eagles and gulls are prone to mobbing these huge eagles. The great black-backed gull has also been observed engaging in aerial combat with bald eagles, attacking the eagles and chasing them away. A great skua (&quot;Stercorarius skua&quot;) was filmed in Scotland unsuccessfully attempting to kill a second or third year great black-backed gull. In Norway, great black-backed gulls have also been reported to fall prey to Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;). Killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and sharks also reportedly prey upon adult and juvenile birds at sea. In some biomes, where large eagles are absent the great black-backed gull may be considered the apex predator.

==Status==

Historically, the great black-backed gull was shot as a hunting trophy (&quot;after about 1850 ... smaller gulls were shot remorselessly for little more than target practice but the Great Black-backed Gull was a prize worth displaying&quot;) and harvested for its feathers, which were used in the hat-making trade; as a result the species became locally extinct from particularly southern parts of its range as a result of this exploitation. Today, however, its adaptability to human presence and the use of urban environments as artificial nesting sites has resulted in the great black-backed gull rapidly increasing in number and range. It is now a widespread and abundant species in its range and its numbers have increased to such high levels in some areas that it is often seen as a pest species, especially near airports where it risks collisions with airplanes, and in some coastal areas where it sometimes outcompetes or hunts rarer seabirds, such as Atlantic puffins, possibly resulting in conservationist intervention. The increase and expansion of great black-backed gulls has been attributed to increasing winter fishery activities in the North Sea. Although there are no known major threats to the great black-backed gull, high levels of toxic pollutants, which are ingested with contaminated prey, are often found in individuals and eggs, reducing reproductive success. Breeding is also interrupted by human disturbance, which can lead to eggs being abandoned, leaving them vulnerable to exposure and predation.

<text>Felix Weihs de Weldon (April 12, 1907 – June 3, 2003) was an Austrian sculptor. His most famous pieces include the United States Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial, 1954) in the Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, US, and the Malaysian National Monument (1966) in Kuala Lumpur.

==Biography==

Felix de Weldon was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on April 12, 1907. He received his early education at St. Egichin&#x27;s Grammar School. In 1925, he earned an AB from Marchetti College, a preparatory college. From the University of Vienna&#x27;s Academy of Creative Arts and School of Architecture, he earned his M.A. and M.S. degrees in 1927 and his PhD in 1929.

De Weldon first received notice as a sculptor at the age of 17, with his statue of Austrian educator and diplomat Professor Ludo Hartman. In the 1920s, he joined artist&#x27;s communes in France, Italy and Spain. De Weldon eventually moved to London, where he gained a number of commissions, among them a portrait sculpture of George V.

A consequential trip to Canada to sculpt Prime Minister Mackenzie King brought De Weldon to North America. He settled in the United States in 1937. De Weldon enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II and was discharged with the rank of Painter Second Class (PTR 2). He became a United States citizen in 1945.

In 1950, President Harry Truman appointed de Weldon to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. In 1956, he was re-appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower, and again in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. In 1959, he received an honorary knighthood for his service to the British Crown.

In 1951, De Weldon acquired the historic Beacon Rock estate in Newport, Rhode Island, where he lived until 1996 when he lost the property and most of his assets to financial hardship.

De Weldon was a long time Member of the Arts Club of Washington.

Felix de Weldon died on June 3, 2003, at the age of 96, in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. de Weldon was survived by two sons, including actor Daniel de Weldon. Daniel is collaborating with Barry Krost Management on a biopic of his father&#x27;s life.

==Work==

Approximately 1,200 de Weldon sculptures are located on seven countries. (A de Weldon monument of Richard Byrd is on McMurdo Sound, in Antarctica).

At the conclusion of the war in 1945, the Congress of the United States commissioned de Weldon to construct the statue for the Marine Corps War Memorial (called Iwo Jima Memorial) in the realist tradition, based upon the famous photograph of Joe Rosenthal, of the Associated Press agency, taken on February 23, 1945. De Weldon made sculptures from life of three (on June 23, 2016, John Bradley was not believed to be in the photo) of the six servicemen raising the replacement United States flag on Mount Suribachi, on Iwo Jima. The other three flag-raisers who were killed in action (on June 23, 2016, Harold Schultz was identified as a flag-raiser in the photo and was not KIA) later on the island were sculpted from photographs. De Weldon took nine years to make the memorial which was dedicated on November 10, 1954, and was assisted by hundreds of other sculptors. The result is the 100-ton bronze statue which is on display in Arlington, Virginia.

De Weldon also contributed in creating Malaysia&#x27;s Tugu Negara (National Monument) when the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman saw the Marine Corps War Memorial statue in his visit to America in October 1960 and personally met him for favour to design the monument. De Weldon was later conferred with the title Tan Sri, the Malaysian equivalent of a high-ranking knighthood.

<doc id="299650" wikidata="Q368337" url="?curid=299650" title="Jon Krakauer">
<text>Jon Krakauer (born April 12, 1954) is an American writer and mountaineer. He is the author of bestselling nonfiction books—&quot;Into the Wild&quot;; &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;; &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot;; and &quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman&quot;—as well as numerous magazine articles. He was a member of an ill-fated expedition to summit Mount Everest in 1996, one of the deadliest disasters in the history of climbing Everest.

== Early life ==

Krakauer was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, as the third of five children of Carol Ann (née Jones) and Lewis Joseph Krakauer. His father was Jewish and his mother was a Unitarian of Scandinavian descent. He was raised in Corvallis, Oregon. His father introduced the young Krakauer to mountaineering at the age of eight. His father was &quot;relentlessly competitive and ambitious in the extreme&quot; and placed high expectations on Krakauer, wishing for his son to attend Harvard Medical School and become a doctor. Krakauer wrote that this was his father&#x27;s view of &quot;life&#x27;s one sure path to meaningful success and lasting happiness.&quot; He competed in tennis at Corvallis High School, and graduated in 1972. He went on to study at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, where in 1976 he received his degree in environmental studies. In 1977, he met former climber Linda Mariam Moore, and they married in 1980. They lived in Seattle, Washington, but moved to Boulder, Colorado, after the release of Krakauer&#x27;s book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;.

== Mountaineering ==
After graduating from college in 1977, Krakauer spent three weeks alone in the wilderness of the Stikine Icecap region of Alaska and climbed a new route on the Devils Thumb, an experience he described in &quot;Eiger Dreams&quot; and in &quot;Into the Wild&quot;. In 1992, he made his way to Cerro Torre in the Andes of Patagonia—a sheer granite peak considered to be one of the most difficult technical climbs in the world.

In 1996, Krakauer took part in a guided ascent of Mount Everest. His group was one of those caught in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which a violent storm trapped a number of climbers high on the slopes of the mountain. Krakauer reached the peak and returned to camp, but four of his teammates (including group leader Rob Hall) died while making their descent in the storm.

A candid recollection of the event was published in &quot;Outside&quot; magazine and, later, in the book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. By the end of the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people had died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history to that point. This has since been exceeded by the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche, and the 2015 earthquake avalanche disaster in which twenty-two people were killed. Krakauer has publicly criticized the commercialization of Mount Everest.

== Journalism ==
Much of Krakauer&#x27;s popularity as a writer came from his work as a journalist for &quot;Outside&quot;. In November 1983, he was able to give up his part-time work as a fisherman and carpenter to become a full-time writer. In addition to his work on mountain climbing, the topics he covered as a freelance writer varied greatly; his writing has also appeared in &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Smithsonian.&quot; Krakauer&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Eiger Dreams&quot; collects some of his articles written between 1982 and 1989&quot;.&quot;

On assignment for &quot;Outside&quot;, Krakauer wrote an article focusing on two parties during his ascent of Mt. Everest: the one he was in, led by Rob Hall, and the one led by Scott Fischer, both of whom successfully guided clients to the summit but experienced severe difficulty during the descent. The storm, and, in his estimation, irresponsible choices by guides of both parties, led to a number of deaths, including both head guides. Krakauer felt the short account did not accurately cover the event, and clarified his initial statements—especially those regarding the death of Andy Harris—in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, which also includes extensive interviews with fellow survivors.

In 1999, he received an Arts and Letters award for Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Books ==

=== &quot;Eiger Dreams&quot; ===

&quot;Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains&quot; (1990) is a nonfiction collection of articles and essays by Jon Krakauer on mountaineering and rock climbing. It concerns a variety of topics, from ascending the Eiger &quot;Nordwand&quot; in the Swiss Alps, Denali in Alaska or K2 in the Karakoram, to the well-known rock climbers Krakauer has met on his trips, such as John Gill.

=== &quot;Into the Wild&quot; ===

&quot;Into the Wild&quot; was published in 1996 and spent two years on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List. The book employs a non-linear narrative that documents the travels of Christopher McCandless, a young man from a well-to-do East Coast family who, in 1990, after graduating from Emory University, donated all of the money ($24,000) in his bank account to the humanitarian charity Oxfam, renamed himself &quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot;, and began a journey in the American West. McCandless&#x27; remains were found in September 1992; he had died of starvation in Alaska on the Stampede Trail at . In the book, Krakauer draws parallels between McCandless&#x27; experiences and his own, and the experiences of other adventurers. &quot;Into The Wild&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name, which was released on September 21, 2007.

=== &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; ===

In 1997, Krakauer expanded his September 1996 &quot;Outside&quot; article into &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. The book describes the climbing parties&#x27; experiences and the general state of Everest mountaineering at the time. Hired as a journalist by the magazine, Krakauer had participated as a client of the 1996 Everest climbing team led by Rob Hall—the team which ended up suffering the greatest casualties in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster.

The book reached the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; nonfiction bestseller list, was honored as &quot;Book of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and was among three books considered for the Pulitzer Prize for General NonFiction in 1998. The American Academy of Arts and Letters gave Krakauer an Academy Award in Literature in 1999 for his work, commenting that the writer &quot;combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport.&quot;

Krakauer has contributed royalties from this book to the Everest &#x27;96 Memorial Fund at the Boulder Community Foundation, which he founded as a tribute to his deceased climbing partners.

In a TV-movie version of the book, Krakauer was played by Christopher McDonald. &quot;Everest&quot;, a feature film based on the events of the disaster directed by Baltasar Kormákur, was released in 2015. In the film, Krakauer is portrayed by Michael Kelly. Krakauer denounced the movie, saying some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony&#x27;s rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director Baltasar Kormákur responded, claiming Krakauer&#x27;s first-person account was not used as source material for the film, and alleged that his version of events conflicted with the plot.

In the book, Krakauer noted that Russian-Kazakhstani guide Anatoli Boukreev, Scott Fischer&#x27;s top guide on the expedition, ascended the summit without supplemental oxygen, &quot;which didn&#x27;t seem to be in [the] clients&#x27; best interest&quot;. He also wrote that Boukreev descended from the summit several hours ahead of his clients, and that this was &quot;extremely unorthodox behavior for a guide&quot;. He noted however that, once he had descended to the top camp, Boukreev was heroic in his tireless attempts to rescue the missing climbers. Five months after &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; was published, Boukreev gave his own account of the Everest disaster in the book &quot;The Climb&quot;, co-written with G. Weston DeWalt.

Differences centered on what experienced mountaineers thought about the facts of Boukreev&#x27;s performance. As Galen Rowell from the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; wrote to Krakauer, &quot;the fact [is] that every one of Boukreev&#x27;s clients survived without major injuries while the clients who died or received major injuries were members of your party. Could you explain how Anatoli [Boukreev]&#x27;s shortcomings as a guide led to the survival of his clients…?&quot; In an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Rowell cited numerous inconsistencies in Krakauer&#x27;s narrative, observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that Boukreev&#x27;s actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: &quot;[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.&quot; Conversely, Scott Fischer, the leader of Boukreev&#x27;s team who died on the mountain, had complained continuously about Boukreev&#x27;s shirking responsibility and his inability to meet the demands put upon him as the top guide—complaints documented in transcripts of radio transmissions between Fischer and his base-camp managers. After the publication of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot;, DeWalt, Boukreev, and Krakauer became embroiled in disagreements about Krakauer&#x27;s portrayal of Boukreev. Krakauer had reached a détente with Boukreev in November 1997, but the Russian climber was killed by an avalanche only a few weeks later while climbing Annapurna.

=== &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; ===

In 2003, &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; became Krakauer&#x27;s third nonfiction bestseller. The book examines extremes of religious belief, specifically fundamentalist offshoots of Mormonism. Krakauer looks at the practice of polygamy in these offshoots and scrutinizes it in the context of the Latter Day Saints religion throughout its history. Much of the focus of the book is on the Lafferty brothers, who murdered Erica and Brenda Lafferty on July 24, 1984 in the name of their fundamentalist faith.

In 2006, Tom Elliott and Pawel Gula produced a documentary inspired by the book, &quot;Damned to Heaven&quot;.

Robert Millet, Professor of Religious Understanding at Brigham Young University, an LDS institution, reviewed the book and described it as confusing, poorly organized, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial and insulting. Mike Otterson, Director of Media Relations for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), told the Associated Press, &quot;This book is not history, and Krakauer is no historian. He is a storyteller who cuts corners to make the story sound good. His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things.&quot;

In response, Krakauer criticized the LDS Church hierarchy, citing the opinion of D. Michael Quinn, a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that &quot;The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials.&quot; Krakauer wrote, &quot;I happen to share Dr. Quinn&#x27;s perspective&quot;.

In April 2022, a limited series of &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; was released by Hulu starring Andrew Garfield and Daisy Edgar-Jones.

=== &quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman&quot; ===

In the October 25, 2007, season premiere of &quot;Iconoclasts&quot; on the Sundance Channel, Krakauer mentioned being deeply embroiled in the writing of a new book, but did not reveal the title, subject, or expected date of completion. Doubleday Publishing originally planned to release the book in the fall of 2008, but postponed the launch in June of that year, announcing that Krakauer was &quot;unhappy with the manuscript.&quot;

The book, &quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman&quot;, was released by Doubleday on September 15, 2009. It draws on the journals and letters of Pat Tillman, an NFL professional football player and U.S. Army Ranger whose death in Afghanistan made him a symbol of American sacrifice and heroism, though it also became a subject of controversy because of the U.S. Army&#x27;s cover-up of the fact that Tillman died by friendly fire. The book draws on the journals and letters of Tillman, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and research Krakauer performed in Afghanistan. It also serves in part as a historical narrative, providing a general history of the civil wars in Afghanistan.

Writing about the book in the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Book&quot; &quot;Review&quot;, Dexter Filkins said that &quot;too many of the details of Tillman’s life recounted here are mostly banal and inconsequential,&quot; but also stated, concerning Tillman&#x27;s death, &quot;While most of the facts have been reported before, Krakauer performs a valuable service by bringing them all together—particularly those about the cover-up. The details, even five years later, are nauseating to read.&quot; In his review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Dan Neil wrote that the book is &quot;a beautiful bit of reporting&quot; and &quot;the definitive version of events surrounding Tillman&#x27;s death.&quot;.

=== &quot;Three Cups of Deceit: How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way&quot; ===

&quot;Three Cups of Deceit&quot; is a 2011 e-book that made claims of mismanagement and accounting fraud by Greg Mortenson, a humanitarian who built schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan; and his charity, the Central Asia Institute (CAI). It was later released in paperback by Anchor Books.

The book—and a related &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview broadcast the day before the book&#x27;s release—were controversial. Some CAI donors filed a class-action lawsuit against Mortenson for having allegedly defrauded them with false claims in his books. The suit was eventually rejected. In December 2011, CAI produced a comprehensive list of projects completed over a period of years and projects CAI is currently working on.

Mortenson and CAI were investigated by the Montana attorney general, who determined that they had made financial &quot;missteps&quot;, and the Attorney General reached a settlement for restitution from Mortenson to CAI in excess of $1 million.

The 2016 documentary &quot;3000 Cups of Tea&quot; by Jennifer Jordan and Jeff Rhoads claims that the accusations against Mortenson put forward by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and Jon Krakauer are largely untrue. Jordan said in 2014: &quot;We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission.&quot;

=== &quot;Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town&quot; ===

&quot;&quot; (2015) explores how rape is handled by colleges and the criminal justice system. The book follows several case studies of women raped in Missoula, Montana, many of them linked in some way to the University of Montana. Krakauer attempts to illuminate why many victims do not want to report their rapes to the police, and he criticizes the justice system for giving the benefit of the doubt to assailants but not to victims. Krakauer was inspired to write the book when a friend of his, a young woman, revealed to him that she had been raped.

Emily Bazelon, writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot; Book Review, gave the book a lukewarm review, criticizing it for not fully exploring its characters or appreciating the difficulty colleges face in handling and trying to prevent sexual assault. &quot;Instead of delving deeply into questions of fairness as universities try to fulfill a recent government mandate to conduct their own investigations and hearings—apart from the police and the courts—Krakauer settles for bromides,&quot; Bazelon wrote. &quot;University procedures should &#x27;swiftly identify student offenders and prevent them from reoffending, while simultaneously safeguarding the rights of the accused,&#x27; he writes, asserting that this &#x27;will be difficult, but it&#x27;s not rocket science.&#x27;&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Lacy M. Johnson gave the book a positive review, describing the writing as &quot;compelling&quot; and the research as &quot;meticulous&quot;. &quot;I wish women didn’t need a voice such as his to corroborate our experience of violence, but I am glad we have him as an ally in this work,&quot; Johnson wrote. &quot;&quot;Missoula&quot; will undoubtedly fortify those of us who have already broken our silence and may rally those who have not dared to. There is some justice in that, no matter how complicated and faint.&quot;

<text>Carcinoma is a malignancy that develops from epithelial cells. Specifically, a carcinoma is a cancer that begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer surfaces of the body, and that arises from cells originating in the endodermal, mesodermal or ectodermal germ layer during embryogenesis.

Carcinomas occur when the DNA of a cell is damaged or altered and the cell begins to grow uncontrollably and becomes malignant. It is from the (itself derived from meaning &quot;crab&quot;).
==Classification==
As of 2004, no simple and comprehensive classification system has been devised and accepted within the scientific community. Traditionally, however, malignancies have generally been classified into various types using a combination of criteria, including:

The cell type from which they start; specifically:

* Epithelial cells ⇨ carcinoma
* Non-hematopoietic mesenchymal cells ⇨ sarcoma
* Hematopoietic cells
** Bone marrow–derived cells that normally mature in the bloodstream ⇨ leukemia
** Bone marrow-derived cells that normally mature in the lymphatic system ⇨ lymphoma
* Germ cells ⇨ germinoma

Other criteria that play a role include:

* The degree to which the malignant cells resemble their normal, untransformed counterparts
* The appearance of the local tissue and stromal architecture
* The anatomical location from which tumors arise
* Genetic, epigenetic, and molecular features

===Histological types===


; Adenocarcinoma (&quot;adeno&quot; = gland): Refers to a carcinoma featuring microscopic glandular-related tissue cytology, tissue architecture, and/or gland-related molecular products, e.g., mucin.
; Squamous cell carcinoma: Refers to a carcinoma with observable features and characteristics indicative of squamous differentiation (intercellular bridges, keratinization, squamous pearls).
; Adenosquamous carcinoma: Refers to a mixed tumor containing both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, wherein each of these cell types comprise at least 10% of the tumor volume.
; Anaplastic carcinoma: Refers to a heterogeneous group of high-grade carcinomas that feature cells lacking distinct histological or cytological evidence of any of the more specifically differentiated neoplasms. These tumors are referred to as anaplastic or undifferentiated carcinomas.
; Large cell carcinoma: Composed of large, monotonous rounded or overtly polygonal-shaped cells with abundant cytoplasm.
; Small cell carcinoma: Cells are usually round and are less than approximately three times the diameter of a resting lymphocyte and with little evident cytoplasm. Occasionally, small cell malignancies may themselves have significant components of slightly polygonal and/or spindle-shaped cells.

There are a large number of rare subtypes of anaplastic, undifferentiated carcinoma. Some of the more well known include the lesions containing pseudo-sarcomatous components: spindle cell carcinoma (containing elongated cells resembling connective tissue cancers), giant cell carcinoma (containing huge, bizarre, multinucleated cells), and sarcomatoid carcinoma (mixtures of spindle and giant cell carcinoma). Pleomorphic carcinoma contains spindle cell and/or giant cell components, plus at least a 10% component of cells characteristic of more highly differentiated types (i.e. adenocarcinoma and/or squamous cell carcinoma). Very rarely, tumors may contain individual components resembling both carcinoma and true sarcoma, including carcinosarcoma and pulmonary blastoma. A history of cigarette smoking is the most common cause of large cell carcinoma.

===Carcinoma of unknown primary site===
The term carcinoma has also come to encompass malignant tumors composed of transformed cells whose origin or developmental lineage is unknown (see cancer of unknown primary origin; CUP), but that possess certain specific molecular, cellular, and histological characteristics typical of epithelial cells. This may include the production of one or more forms of cytokeratin or other intermediate filaments, intercellular bridge structures, keratin pearls, and/or tissue architectural motifs such as stratification or pseudo-stratification.

===Carcinoma &quot;In situ&quot;===
The term &quot;carcinoma in situ&quot; (or CIS) is a term for cells that are significantly abnormal but not cancer. They are thus not typically carcinomas.

==Pathogenesis==
Cancer occurs when a single progenitor cell accumulates mutations and other changes in the DNA, histones, and other biochemical compounds that make up the cell&#x27;s genome. The cell genome controls the structure of the cell&#x27;s biochemical components, the biochemical reactions that occur within the cell, and the biological interactions of that cell with other cells. Certain combinations of mutations in the given progenitor cell ultimately result in that cell (also called a cancer stem cell) displaying a number of abnormal, malignant cellular properties that, when taken together, are considered characteristic of cancer, including:

*the ability to continue to divide perpetually, producing an exponentially (or near-exponentially) increasing number of new malignant cancerous &quot;daughter cells&quot; (uncontrolled mitosis);
*the ability to penetrate normal body surfaces and barriers, and to bore into or through nearby body structures and tissues (local invasiveness);
*the ability to spread to other sites within the body (metastasize) by penetrating or entering into the lymphatic vessels (regional metastasis) and/or the blood vessels (distant metastasis).

If this process of continuous growth, local invasion, and regional and distant metastasis is not halted via a combination of stimulation of immunological defenses and medical treatment interventions, the result is that the host has a continuously increasing burden of tumor cells throughout the body. Eventually, the tumor burden increasingly interferes with normal biochemical functions carried out by the host&#x27;s organs, and death ultimately ensues.

Carcinoma is but one form of cancer—one composed of cells that have developed the cytological appearance, histological architecture, or molecular characteristics of epithelial cells. A progenitor carcinoma stem cell can be formed from any of a number of oncogenic combinations of mutations in a totipotent cell, a multipotent cell, or a mature differentiated cell.

===Metastatic carcinoma===

Metastatic carcinoma is cancer that is able to grow at sites distant from the primary site of origin; thus, dissemination to the skin may occur with any malignant neoplasm, and these infiltrates may result from direct invasion of the skin from underlying tumors, may extend by lymphatic or hematogenous spread, or may be introduced by therapeutic procedures.

===Mutation===
Whole genome sequencing has established the mutation frequency for whole human genomes. The mutation frequency in the whole genome between generations for humans (parent to child) is about 70 new mutations per generation.

Carcinomas, however, have much higher mutation frequencies. The particular frequency depends on tissue type, whether a mis-match DNA repair deficiency is present, and exposure to DNA damaging agents such as components of tobacco smoke. Tuna and Amos have summarized the mutation frequencies per megabase (Mb) in some carcinomas, as shown in the table (along with the indicated frequencies of mutations per genome).

====Cause of mutations====

The likely major underlying cause of mutations in carcinomas is DNA damage. For example, in the case of lung cancer, DNA damage is caused by agents in exogenous genotoxic tobacco smoke (e.g. acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene). Endogenous (metabolically caused) DNA damage is also very frequent, occurring on average more than 60,000 times a day in the genomes of human cells. Externally and endogenously caused damages may be converted into mutations by inaccurate translesion synthesis or inaccurate DNA repair (e.g. by non-homologous end joining).

=====High frequency=====
The high frequency of mutations in the total genome within carcinomas suggests that, often, an early carcinogenic alteration may be a deficiency in DNA repair. For instance, mutation rates substantially increase (sometimes by 100-fold) in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair.

A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epigenetic alterations or epimutations. While a mutation or epimutation in a DNA repair gene, itself, would not confer a selective advantage, such a repair defect may be carried along as a passenger in a cell when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage. Such cells, with both proliferative advantages and one or more DNA repair defects (causing a very high mutation rate), likely give rise to the high frequency of total genome mutations seen in carcinomas.

====DNA repair====
In somatic cells, deficiencies in DNA repair sometimes arise by mutations in DNA repair genes, but much more often are due to epigenetic reductions in expression of DNA repair genes. Thus, in a sequence of 113 colorectal carcinomas, only four had somatic missense mutations in the DNA repair gene &quot;MGMT&quot;, while the majority of these cancers had reduced MGMT protein expression due to methylation of the &quot;MGMT&quot; promoter region.

==Diagnosis==
Carcinomas can be definitively diagnosed through biopsy, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA), core biopsy, or subtotal removal of single node. Microscopic examination by a pathologist is then necessary to identify molecular, cellular, or tissue architectural characteristics of epithelial cells.

===Types===
*Oral: Most oral cancers are squamous-cell carcinoma
*Lung: Carcinoma comprises &gt;98% of all lung cancers.
*Breast: Nearly all breast cancers are ductal carcinoma.
*Prostate: The most common form of carcinoma of the prostate is adenocarcinoma.
*Colon and rectum: Nearly all malignancies of the colon and rectum are either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
*Pancreas: Pancreatic carcinoma is almost always of the adenocarcinoma type and is highly lethal.
*Ovaries: One of the most deadly forms due to late detection.

Some carcinomas are named for their or the putative cell of origin, (e.g.hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma).

===Staging===
Staging of carcinoma refers to the process of combining physical/clinical examination, pathological review of cells and tissues, surgical techniques, laboratory tests, and imaging studies in a logical fashion to obtain information about the size of the neoplasm and the extent of its invasion and metastasis. Carcinoma stage is the variable that has been most consistently and tightly linked to the prognosis of the malignancy.

Carcinomas are usually staged with Roman numerals. In most classifications, Stage I and Stage II carcinomas are confirmed when the tumor has been found to be small and/or to have spread to local structures only. Stage III carcinomas typically have been found to have spread to regional lymph nodes, tissues, and/or organ structures, while Stage IV tumors have already metastasized through the blood to distant sites, tissues, or organs.

In some types of carcinomas, Stage 0 carcinoma has been used to describe carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;, and occult carcinomas detectable only via examination of sputum for malignant cells (in lung carcinomas).

In more recent staging systems, substages (a, b, c) are becoming more commonly used to better define groups of patients with similar prognosis or treatment options.

The criteria for staging can differ dramatically based upon the organ system in which the tumor arises. For example, the colon and bladder cancer staging system relies on depth of invasion, staging of breast carcinoma is more dependent on the size of the tumor, and in renal carcinoma, staging is based on both the size of the tumor and the depth of the tumor invasion into the renal sinus. Carcinoma of the lung has a more complicated staging system, taking into account a number of size and anatomic variables.

The UICC/AJCC TNM systems are most often used. For some common tumors, however, classical staging methods (such as the Dukes classification for colon cancer) are still used.

===Grading===
Grading of carcinomas refers to the employment of criteria intended to semi-quantify the degree of cellular and tissue maturity seen in the transformed cells relative to the appearance of the normal parent epithelial tissue from which the carcinoma derives.

Grading of carcinoma is most often done after a treating physician and/or surgeon obtains a sample of suspected tumor tissue using surgical resection, needle or surgical biopsy, direct washing or brushing of tumor tissue, sputum cytopathology, etc. A pathologist then examines the tumor and its stroma, perhaps utilizing staining, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, or other methods. Finally, the pathologist classifies the tumor semi-quantitatively into one of three or four grades, including:

*Grade 1, or well differentiated: there is a close, or very close, resemblance to the normal parent tissue, and the tumor cells are easily identified and classified as a particular malignant histological entity;
*Grade 2, or moderately differentiated: there is considerable resemblance to the parent cells and tissues, but abnormalities can commonly be seen and the more complex features are not particularly well-formed;
*Grade 3, or poorly differentiated: there is very little resemblance between the malignant tissue and the normal parent tissue, abnormalities are evident, and the more complex architectural features are usually rudimentary or primitive;
*Grade 4, or undifferentiated carcinoma: these carcinomas bear no significant resemblance to the corresponding parent cells and tissues, with no visible formation of glands, ducts, bridges, stratified layers, keratin pearls, or other notable characteristics consistent with a more highly differentiated neoplasm.

Although there is definite and convincing statistical correlation between carcinoma grade and tumor prognosis for some tumor types and sites of origin, the strength of this association can be highly variable. It may be stated generally, however, that the higher the grade of the lesion, the worse is its prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
While cancer is generally considered a disease of old age, children can also develop cancer. In contrast to adults, carcinomas are exceptionally rare in children. Less than 1% of carcinoma diagnoses are in children.

The two biggest risk factors for ovarian carcinoma are age and family history.

<text>The lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) is a large gull that breeds on the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is migratory, wintering from the British Isles south to West Africa. However, it has increased dramatically in North America, especially along the east coast. Formerly just a winter visitor to North America, it has increased and occurs in large numbers some winters and birds are now recorded year-round. However, there is serious concern about decline in many parts of its range. The species is on the UK Amber List because the UK is home to 40 per cent of the European population and more than half of these are found at fewer than ten breeding sites.

==Taxonomy==
The lesser black-backed gull was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and it still bears its original name &quot;Larus fuscus&quot;. The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Larus&quot; appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and &quot;fuscus&quot; meant black or brown.

===Subspecies===
The five recognized subspecies are:
==Description==
The lesser black-backed gull is smaller than the European herring gull. The taxonomy of the herring gull / lesser black-backed gull complex is very complicated; different authorities recognise between two and eight species. This group has a ring species distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small, but by the time the circuit is completed, the end members, herring gull and lesser black-backed gull, are clearly different species. The lesser black-backed gull measures , across the wings, and weighs , with the nominate race averaging slightly smaller than the other two subspecies. Males, at an average weight of , are slightly larger than females, at an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is , and the tarsus is . A confusable species is the great black-backed gull. The lesser is a much smaller bird, with slimmer build, yellow rather than pinkish legs, and smaller white &quot;mirrors&quot; at the wing tips. The adults have black or dark grey wings (depending on race) and back. The bill is yellow with a red spot at which the young peck, inducing feeding (see fixed action pattern). The head is greyer in winter, unlike great black-backed gulls. Annual moult for adults begins between May and August and is not complete on some birds until November. Partial prebreeding moult occurs between January and April.

Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern. They take four years to reach maturity. Identification from juvenile herring gulls is most readily done by the more solidly dark (unbarred) tertial feathers.

Their call is a &quot;laughing&quot; cry like that of the herring gull, but with a markedly deeper pitch.

== Distribution ==
Lesser black-backed gulls have expanded their range westwards, first colonising Greenland in the 1980s. The species has not yet bred in the United States, although hybrid pairs with American herring gulls have been recorded twice.

==Breeding==
This species breeds colonially on coasts and lakes, making a lined nest on the ground or a cliff. Normally, three eggs are laid. In some cities, the species nests within the urban environment, often in association with herring gulls.

==Feeding==
They are omnivores like most &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, and they eat fish, insects, crustaceans, worms, starfish, molluscs, seeds, berries, small mammals, eggs, small birds, chicks, scraps, offal, and carrion.

<text>De La Salle University (), also referred to as DLSU, De La Salle or La Salle, is a private, Catholic coeducational research university run by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools with main campus in Taft Avenue, Malate, Manila, Philippines. It was established by the Christian Brothers in 1911 as De La Salle College (DLSC) in Nozaleda Street, Paco, Manila with Blimond Pierre Eilenbecker, FSC serving as director, and is the first De La Salle school in the Philippines. The college was granted university status on February 19, 1975, and is the oldest constituent of De La Salle Philippines (DLSP), a network of 16 educational institutions, established in 2006 replacing the De La Salle University System.

The institution started as an exclusive all-boys elementary and high school. In 1920, it began offering a two-year Associate in Arts Commerce program, which was later discontinued in 1931 in favor of a Bachelor of Science in Commerce program. De La Salle University is widely regarded as one of the leading universities in the Philippines, offering over a hundred coeducational undergraduate and graduate degree programs through its seven colleges and one school specializing in the disciplines of business, computer studies, economics, education, engineering, law, liberal arts, and science. The patron of the university is St. John Baptist de La Salle, the Vatican&#x27;s patron saint for those who work in education. He was the founder of the De La Salle Christian Brothers and a network of over 1,100 Lasallian educational institutions in 80 countries.

De La Salle University has been cited by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as a Center of Excellence in 14 of its programs, and a Center of Development in 5. The university is among 40 institutions granted autonomous status by CHED as of 2010. It is the first of only two institutions granted the highest-level accreditation (Level IV) by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The university is a member of the ASEAN University Network (AUN) and International Association of Universities (IAU) as well as the local South Manila Inter-Institutional Consortium.

==History==

The Philippines was one of the last Southeast Asian countries in which the De La Salle Christian Brothers established themselves. The De La Salle Christian Brothers had established several De La Salle schools in British and French Southeast Asian colonial territories a century before settling in the new American colony. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were reluctant in establishing a school in the Philippines due to the Americans&#x27; insistence that the first school should only educate the children of the ruling Filipino elite. The Americans instructed the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American demand ran contrary to the original spiritual teachings and charism of St. John Baptist de La Salle, the Vatican&#x27;s patron saint of Christian educators whose main religious vocation was to &quot;Teach Minds, Touch Hearts and Transform Lives&quot; while providing tuition-free education to the poor. The De La Salle Christian Brothers eventually agreed to establish a school in Manila, conceding that the &quot;upper-class children of the ruling elite families also needed good Catholic moral and spiritual training.&quot;

De La Salle University traces its founding roots to Manila Archbishop Jeremiah James Harty. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother–Lasallian school in St. Louis, Missouri, believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental in preempting the spread of Protestantism in the Philippines through the arrival of the Thomasites and American Protestant church missions. His request was endorsed in 1907 by Pope Pius X. An envoy of the De La Salle Christian Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Christian Brothers searched for a suitable campus location. A property in Nozaleda Street, Paco, Manila was purchased for this purpose.


===Early history===
De La Salle College was established by nine De La Salle Christian Brothers. Three, Blimond Pierre Eilenbecker, Aloysius Gonzaga McGiverin and Augusto Correge, arrived on March 10, 1911, and the remaining six, Ptolomee Louis Duffaux, Goslin Camillus Henri, D. Joseph, Celba John Lynam, Imar William Reale, and Martin, on May 13. De La Salle College formally opened on June 16, 1911, with 125 students. By July 10, the number of students reached 175.

On February 12, 1912, the college was incorporated under the sole ownership of the college director, Br. Eilenbecker. In March 1912, four more Brothers arrived, Wilfrid, Basilian Coin, Dorotheus Joseph and Egbert Xavier Kelly. The college was permitted to confer high school diplomas in the same year. It received a charter from the Governor-General of the Philippines, allowing the college to confer associate degrees in commerce. It started offering the degree as a two-year program in 1920. Brothers Donatian Felix, V. Andrew, Albinus Peter, Flavius Leo, Alphonsus Henry, Felix and David King were sent to the school to teach various subjects from 1917 to 1929.

The college had 425 students by 1921. Due to the lack of space on the original Nozaleda Campus in Paco, Manila, it moved to 2401 Taft Avenue in Malate, its present location. Brother Acisclus Michael, FSC was able to secure a lot at the southernmost boundary of Manila. In 1931, the college discontinued its two-year commerce program in favor of a three-year Bachelor of Science in Commerce program, which was approved a year earlier.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, the American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Baños Internment Camp for the duration of the three-year Japanese occupation of the Philippines while the other non-American Brothers were allowed to stay on and continue to teach at the Taft Campus.

Initially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, nearby families, wounded soldiers, and some Filipino guerilla freedom fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, it was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942. Several bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued during the Japanese occupation. During this time, several Lasallites and Ateneans set their school rivalry aside to share their De La Salle College classrooms together with students from various neighboring schools. The DLSC high school classes were later transferred to St. Scholastica&#x27;s College, Manila in 1943.

Classes were eventually discontinued at the De La Salle campus. On February 1, 1945, Japanese forces ordered the occupants of the DLSC and the surrounding vicinity to vacate the college. However, Br. Egbert Xavier Kelly, FSC refused the order to vacate. On February 7, 1945, he was abducted by Japanese soldiers and was believed to have been tortured and killed. On February 12 shortly after noon, 20 Japanese soldiers forcibly entered the DLSC campus and massacred 16 of the 17 De La Salle Brothers residing in the chapel of the campus, along with 25 other residents. Only one Brother (Antonius von Jesus) and 21 others survived.

===Post–war period===

Classes resumed in July 1945 with a class of incoming freshmen that was composed of 60 high school graduates. One year later, the College of Commerce reopened with its three-year BS Commerce program extended to a four-year program. 

The High School Department of De La Salle College on Taft Avenue, Manila was dissolved in 1968 and transferred to La Salle Green Hills on Ortigas Avenue, Mandaluyong, which was then a part of Rizal province. 

The College of Commerce, together with Ateneo de Manila University, gave birth to the Asian Institute of Management in the same year with assistance from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University. Several other units were established in the following years.

===During the Martial Law era===

The school continued to undergo changes even as the nation went through the difficulties of the Marcos dictatorship era. It became co-educational in 1973. On February 19, 1975, De La Salle College was granted university status and became known as De La Salle University (DLSU). Since 2008, it has referred to itself as De La Salle University, its registered name in the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission. The Grade School Department was deprecated in 1978.

In 1981, De La Salle University shifted from the traditional semestral academic calendar to a trimestral one. Prior to this, students were referred to as &quot;Lasallites&quot;, but this was replaced with &quot;Lasallian&quot;, the present term. 

In comparison to other schools in the capital, where massive protests were typical, the De La Salle campus was relatively quiet during the First Quarter Storm and Martial Law years. However, there were some constituents who were active in the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship, even in its early years. At one point, soldiers went into the campus hunting for student activist (and later La Sallian editor in chief) William Chua, who was forced to hide in the trunk of a sympathetic faculty member&#x27;s car. Outside of the campus, a number of alumni actively resisted the regime, such as prominent businessman and De La Salle high school alumnus Alfonso Yuchengco, who became an important part of the Light-A-Fire Movement.

The broader student population became more active in protests against the authoritarian regime in 1983, becoming part of what was called the &quot;middle force opposition&quot; that grew across the nation after the Assassination of Ninoy Aquino. A particular leader during this time was Immanuel “Imo” Obispo, a student activist who was a junior when he was killed under mysterious circumstances in October 1984.

Chua, Yuchengco, and Obispo are all honored at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial, which honors the martyrs and heroes of the resistance against the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos.

===Later 20th century===
In 1987, the university, together with four other Lasallian institutions, became part of the De La Salle University System. The system was later dissolved in favor of De La Salle Philippines, a network of 16 Lasallian institutions. De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde (DLS–CSB) became independent of the university in 1988.

===Recent history===

A Mk 2 grenade was detonated outside the southern portion of the DLSU campus in front of a popular burger shop along Taft Avenue on September 26, 2010, at around 5:05 pm by opposing rival Law fraternities, the same day as the Philippine Bar exams conducted by the university. The blast injured 47 individuals, two of whom required limbs to be amputated. Anthony Leal Nepomuceno was indicted by the Philippine Department of Justice on April 29, 2011, on the charge of detonating the device.

In 2012, De La Salle Canlubang was formally integrated with De La Salle University and became an extension of DLSU. It was inaugurated as the De La Salle University – Science &amp; Technology Complex (DLSU–STC), and later renamed as the De La Salle University – Laguna Campus. In 2015, DLSU announced that it would open its Manila campus for senior high school students in response to the K–12 implementation. The Senior High School (SHS) classes officially opened on June 1, 2016. In December 2018, DLSU announced its plan to launch a new Learning Management System (LMS) called AnimoSpace, built based on the Canvas LMS software. AnimoSpace was officially launched on January 15, 2019.

==Campuses==
===Manila===


The main campus is situated on a lot at 2401 Taft Avenue, Malate, Manila. It is part of the University Belt with several other colleges and universities, including St. Scholastica&#x27;s College, Manila and Philippine Women&#x27;s University, which are both located nearby. Some buildings that are part of the campus are also situated at other nearby lots along Taft Avenue and at the nearby Fidel Reyes Street, formerly named as Agno Street.

The buildings have a combined floor area of . Six of the DLSU Manila campus buildings – Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall, Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall, Enrique M. Razon Sports Center, Gokongwei Hall, Henry Sy Sr. Hall, and Velasco Hall – were funded and provided by DLSU alumni. Most of the buildings in the DLSU campus feature neoclassical design. These include:

*St. La Salle Hall, the first building in the campus. A four-story building, its construction started in 1921 and was completed in 1924. The classic H-shaped LS main building was designed by Cornell University alumnus Tomás Mapúa, the first Filipino registered architect and subsequent founder of Mapúa Institute of Technology. St. La Salle Hall was one of the very few buildings that survived the near total destruction of Manila during the 1945 Battle of Manila. It has undergone retrofitting since 2011, and was completed in 2012. It is the only Philippine structure featured in &quot;1001 Buildings You Must See Before You Die: The World&#x27;s Architectural Masterpieces&quot;, a book published by Quintessence Editions Ltd. in 2007. St. La Salle Hall also houses the College of Business and School of Economics.
*St. Joseph Hall, a six-story building completed in 1956. It was the location of the DLSU library from 1956 to 1985. It houses the College of Science and DLSU&#x27;s Discipline Office.
*St. Miguel Febres Cordero Hall, a four-story building completed in 1969. Originally known as the St. Benilde Hall, it was renamed in 1989 and houses the College of Liberal Arts, academic offices, and some laboratories belonging to the College of Engineering.
*Urbano J. Velasco Hall, a five-story building completed in 1981. It houses the College of Engineering.
*Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall, a nine-story building completed in 2002. The building has 20 classrooms, six conference rooms, DLSU&#x27;s administrative offices and the Teresa G. Yuchengco Auditorium.
*John Gokongwei Sr. Hall, a four-story building completed in the 1990s. Originally named the INTELLECT (Information Technology Lecture) Building, the building houses the College of Computer Studies, the university&#x27;s Information Technology Services (ITS) facilities, National Service Training Program and Formations Office, and 24-hour study hall. The ground floor of the building underwent renovation from 2019 to 2021, which includes additional classrooms, and study spaces.
*William J. Shaw Hall, a seven-story building that houses the College of Science and the William Shaw Little Theater.
*Br. Gabriel Connon Hall, a five-story building that houses the university clinic, Waldo Perfecto Seminar Room, discussion rooms, and office of various university departments and student organizations.
*Br. Alphonsus Bloemen Hall, a building that houses food stalls and the studio of Green Giant FM.
*Br. Celba John Hall, a three-story building south of St. La Salle Hall that houses the offices of foundations and non-government organizations including De La Salle University Science Foundation, Inc. and DLSU-Parents of the University Students Organization (DLSU-PUSO).
*Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall, a 20-story, tall building, making it the tallest academic building in the Philippines. The building, completed in 2006, houses more than 100 classrooms and faculty rooms, a satellite library called Br. Benedict Learning Resource Center, the Natividad Fajardo–Rosario Gonzalez Auditorium, a retreat facility called Center for Lasallian Formation, and offices of various colleges especially the College of Education.
*Enrique M. Razon Sports Center, a 10-story building that is the main sports facility of De La Salle University. It was built in 1998 to replace the old Br. Athanasius Sports Complex that was demolished in 2000 to give way for the construction of the Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall. The Sports Center stands on a lot located at the corner of Fidel Reyes (formerly named Agno) and Noli Streets. It has an Olympic-sized pool and track and field oval with a balcony. It has basketball and volleyball courts, table tennis courts, a dance and martial arts studio, and weight training rooms. The George T. Yang Performing Arts Studios are located on the sixth floor of the building. The sixth floor also houses the Gold&#x27;s Gym Taft branch which opened in late 2016.
*The Faculty Center, a four-story building built in 1985. Located behind the St. Joseph Hall, it houses the offices of departments belonging to the College of Liberal Arts and to the College of Business, respectively, and formerly the university library.
*The Science &amp; Technology Research Center, a four-story research center along Fidel Reyes (formerly named Agno) Street that houses various research facilities and laboratories belonging to the Colleges of Science and Engineering, respectively.
*Henry Sy Sr. Hall, a 14-story building housing the academic services hub, administrative offices, and the university library, now called the Learning Commons. Construction of the Henry Sy Sr. Hall began on December 2, 2010, as part of the university&#x27;s Centennial Renewal Plan. Named after its first donor and businessman Henry Sy, the building was constructed on the location of the former DLSU football field adjacent to Velasco Hall. It was completed by December 2012 and inaugurated on February 13, 2013. The project had an estimated cost of (). In line with this, DLSU entered an eight-year agreement with the Philippine Sports Commission. Under the contract, DLSU would fund the () renovation of the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium. DLSU would get to use the facilities in return.

The campus will also open the following facilities as part of its ongoing development:
*St. Mutien-Marie Wiaux Hall, a 10-story building behind Miguel Hall that broke ground on July 6, 2023 and topped off on July 29, 2024. It will house art and music facilities, collaboration areas, and more classrooms and offices. Expected to be complete by January 2025, it would replace its previous incarnation, which was demolished alongside the adjacent Eco/Solar Car shed. The old building was also where the university&#x27;s Harlequin Theatre Guild annually stage their &quot;Haunted Hall&quot; production due to its reputation for its ghostly rumors.

The DLSU–Manila campus, which is relatively small in size for its large student population suffers from limited space. According to &quot;The LaSallian&quot;, each student had only for himself in 2009. Crowding is expected to only get worse. It has also expressed concerns regarding fire safety, citing possible evacuation difficulties should a fire occur at the Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall, and accessibility issues for fire trucks given the lack of wide roads to major buildings. At least three fires have occurred in the campus, including two at St. Joseph Hall. To address the problem of limited space, DLSU has resolved to vertical expansion. However, this has resulted in overcrowded elevators.

===Laguna===
The Laguna campus is an extension of De La Salle University since 2012 and is located adjacent to Laguna Technopark in Biñan, Laguna, Philippines. The campus was built on land donated by the family of the late National Artist for Architecture and De La Salle alumnus Leandro Locsin. It was originally known as De La Salle Canlubang (DLSC), a district school of De La Salle Philippines that provided science-and-technology-based primary, secondary, and tertiary education. In 2012, the administrations of DLSU and DLSC approved the integration of DLSC into DLSU, becoming the De La Salle University – Science &amp; Technology Complex (DLSU–STC), and later renamed as the De La Salle University – Laguna Campus. By 2010, of the campus had been developed. The Laguna campus offered 18 undergraduate degree programs by 2017, as well as pre-school, primary, and secondary education at the DLSU Integrated School (DLSU IS). Its college division is called the School of Innovation and Sustainability.

In 2016, DLSU signed an agreement with Ubisoft to open a new studio in the Philippines and to offer two new undergraduate courses in game development, as well as entertainment and multimedia computing. The Laguna campus was selected as the site of the studio. The studio opened two years later in 2018, and is the first AAA game studio in the country. However, Ubisoft Philippines transferred its office to Bonifacio Global City in 2024 to address staffing challenges caused by its remote location.

===Athletics===


De La Salle has several varsity teams and sport clubs participating in different sports competitions, most notably basketball, volleyball, football and cheerleading. In 1924, De La Salle College (DLSC) became a pre-war founding member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), in which it won five General Championships (1972–73, 1974–75, 1976–77, 1977–78, and 1980–81) until La Salle announced its decision to withdraw from the league in September 1980. Irish-American Br. Celba John Lynam, FSC organized the first De La Salle sports teams and the first La Salle &amp; LSC Yell Command Spirit Team. In 1924, he established the pre-war NCAA as the first and oldest collegiate athletic association in the Philippines composed of De La Salle, San Beda, Ateneo de Manila, University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Institute of Accounts (now as Far Eastern University), National University, and University of Manila. In 1986, De La Salle University was admitted into the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), an intercollegiate sporting association formed in 1938. Ever since joining the UAAP in 1986, DLSU has won three UAAP General Championships – Season 75 (2012–13), Season 76 (2013–14), and Season 78 (2015–16), giving the university a combined eight General Championship titles in the seniors&#x27; division in the NCAA and UAAP. Notable Lasallian athletes and alumni are inducted into the De La Salle Alumni Association (DLSAA) Sports Hall of Fame.

===Alma Mater Hymn===
In 1961, Br. Stephen Malachy, FSC took out a small harmonica during a class and shared a song that he and Br. Bonaventure Richard, FSC had recently composed to his students. The melody originated in San Joaquin Memorial High School (a Christian Brother school), in Fresno, California where Br. Malachy was assigned as a lyricist in the 1950s. The words were modified but the tune is the same. The song was first sung during a graduation in 1964. It was later adopted by the NCAA basketball team and cheerleaders in 1965 when La Salle lost to Mapua Tech, but the Lasallites stayed to sing the Alma Mater Hymn at the end of the game. The song eventually became the alma mater theme of De La Salle College and other Lasallian institutions in the Philippines. The hymn is sung by students and alumni at the end of all La Salle gatherings with the gesture of continuously raising a clenched fist into the air. The De La Salle Alma Mater Song has since the 1960s been sung traditionally by all Lasallians in every Lasallian sports, alumni and school event in all 16 La Salle schools in the Philippines. De La Salle was the first school in any Philippine collegiate league to sing its Alma Mater Song after the end of each La Salle match in the NCAA – a practice now done by all schools in the NCAA and the UAAP.

===Animo La Salle===
&quot;Animo&quot; is the traditional Lasallian word for &quot;Spirit to Fight&quot; and it is also known as the &quot;La Salle Spirit&quot;. &quot;Animo La Salle&quot;, the school battle cry, was derived from the Lasallian spirit of &quot;Faith &amp; Zeal&quot; of St. John Baptist de La Salle and his Christian Brothers. The Lasallian spirit of &quot;Faith&quot; is symbolized by a radiant &quot;Signum Fidei&quot; Christmas Nativity Star of Bethlehem. The Lasallian spirit of &quot;&quot; on the other hand, is symbolized by three broken chevrons that represent the three broken leg bones suffered by Warrior Chieftain Johan Salla of Atphonus the Chaste, king of Oviedo Spain, who was the great-grandfather of Saint La Salle who fought several battles to defend Christian Spain from invading Eastern Moorish armies. The ancient broken chevrons can be seen on the 1000-year-old royal coat of arms of the De La Salle family. The coat of arms contains the Latin motto &quot;Indivisa Manent&quot; which translates to being &quot;Permanently Indivisible&quot;. This ancient motto of the De La Salle family was carried over and presently translated into the modern tagline of De La Salle Philippines as &quot;One La Salle&quot;.

<doc id="299663" wikidata="Q1430520" url="?curid=299663" title="Compound document">
<text>In computing, a compound document is a document that &quot;combines multiple document formats, either by reference, by inclusion, or both.&quot; Compound documents are often produced using word processing software, and may include text and non-text elements such as barcodes, spreadsheets, pictures, digital videos, digital audio, and other multimedia features.

Compound document technologies are commonly utilized on top of a software componentry framework, but the idea of software componentry includes several other concepts apart from compound documents, and software components alone do not enable compound documents. Well-known technologies for compound documents include:
*ActiveX Documents
*Bonobo by Ximian (primarily used by GNOME)
*KParts in KDE
*Mixed Object Document Content Architecture
*Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
*Object linking and embedding (OLE) by Microsoft; see Compound File Binary Format
*Open Document Architecture from ITU-T (not used)
*OpenDoc by IBM and Apple Computer (now defunct)
*RagTime
*Verdantuim
*XML and XSL are encapsulation formats used for compound documents of all kinds

The first public implementation of compound documents was on the Xerox Star workstation, released in 1981.

<doc id="299666" wikidata="Q475353" url="?curid=299666" title="Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory">
<text>The al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory () in Kafouri, Khartoum North, Sudan, was constructed between 1992 and 1996 with components imported from Germany, India, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United States. It was opened on 12 July 1997 and bombed by the United States on 20 August 1998. The industrial complex was composed of four buildings. It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use.

The factory was destroyed in 1998 by a missile attack launched by the United States, killing one employee and wounding eleven. The U.S. government claimed that the factory was used for the processing of VX nerve agent and that the owners of the plant had ties to the terrorist group al-Qaeda.

These justifications for the bombing were disputed by the owners of the plant, the Sudanese government, and other governments. American officials later acknowledged &quot;that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Officials would later state that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas - as initially suspected by the Americans - or that it had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.&quot; The attack took place a week after the Monica Lewinsky scandal and two months after release of the film &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, prompting some commentators to describe the attack as a distraction for the public from the scandal.

==Destruction==

On 20 August 1998, the factory was destroyed in cruise missile strikes launched by the United States military allegedly in retaliation for the truck bomb attacks on its embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on 7 August. The administration of President Bill Clinton justified the attacks, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach, on the grounds that the al-Shifa plant was involved with processing the deadly nerve agent VX, and had ties with the Islamist al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden, which was believed to be behind the embassy bombings and Operation Bojinka, an alleged large-scale terrorist plot. U.S. action on 20 August also hit al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, where bin Laden had moved following his May 1996 expulsion from Sudan.

The German ambassador in Sudan from 1996 to 2000, Werner Daum, informed the German Foreign Ministry on the day of the bombing that the plant could not be called a factory for chemical weapons. Rather, the factory “mainly produced human medicines, such as antibiotics, antimalarial medication, anti-diarrheal medicines, infusion fluids and some veterinary medicines.”

==Evidence==

The key piece of physical evidence linking the Al-Shifa facility to production of chemical weapons was the discovery of EMPTA in a soil sample taken from the plant during a CIA clandestine operation. EMPTA, or O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, is classified as a Schedule 2B compound under the Chemical Weapons Convention, meaning that while it is a chemical weapons (it can be used to manufacture VX nerve agent), it also has legitimate small-scale applications outside of chemical warfare and so is permitted to be manufactured in small quantities. Although potential uses and patented processes using EMPTA existed, such as the manufacture of plastic, no known industrial uses of EMPTA were ever documented, nor were any products that contained EMPTA. It is, however, not banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, as originally claimed by the U.S. government. Moreover, the presence of EMPTA near the boundary of Al-Shifa does not prove that it was produced in the factory; EMPTA could have been &quot;stored in or transported near Al-Shifa, instead of being produced by it&quot;, according to a report by Michael Barletta.

Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering claimed to have sufficient evidence against Sudan, including contacts between officials at Al-Shifa plant and Iraqi chemical weapons experts, with the Iraq chemical weapons program the only one identified with using EMPTA for VX production. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a Sudanese opposition in Cairo led by Mubarak Al-Mahdi, also insisted that the plant was producing ingredients for chemical weapons. According to Clinton Administration officials, the plant, moreover, was heavily guarded, and showed no signs of ordinary commercial activities. However, a British engineer, Thomas Carnaffin, who worked as a technical manager during the plant&#x27;s construction between 1992 and 1996, stated that the plant was neither heavily guarded nor secret, and that he never observed evidence of the production of an ingredient needed for nerve gas. The group that monitors compliance with the treaty banning chemical weapons announced that EMPTA did have legitimate commercial purposes in the manufacture of fungicides and antibiotics, and the owner of the factory stated emphatically in interviews that the plant was not used for anything other than pharmaceuticals, and that there was no evidence to the contrary. Former Clinton administration counter terrorism advisor Richard Clarke and former national security advisor Sandy Berger also noted the facilities alleged ties with the former Iraqi government. Clarke also cited Iraq&#x27;s $199,000 contract with al Shifa for veterinary medicine under the UN&#x27;s Oil-for-Food Programme. David Kay, a former UN weapons inspector also said that Iraq may have assisted in the construction of the Al-Shifa plant, noting also that Sudan would be unlikely to have the technical knowledge to produce VX.

Officials later acknowledged, however, &quot;that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.&quot;

However, a Clinton State Department official stated that a money manager for bin Laden claimed that bin Laden had invested in Al Shifa. The Al Shifa manager lived in the same Sudan house where bin Laden had previously lived.

The U.S. State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate. James Risen reported in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.&#x27;s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.&quot; The Chairman of El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, who is critical of the Sudanese government, told reporters: &quot;I had inventories of every chemical and records of every employee&#x27;s history. There were no such [nerve gas] chemicals being made here.&quot;

In 2004, nonetheless, Clinton&#x27;s Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the 9/11 Commission by characterizing Al Shifa as a &quot;WMD-related facility&quot;, which played a &quot;chemical weapons role&quot; such as to pose a risk that it, with the help of the alleged Iraqi chemical weapons program connections, might help Al Qaeda get chemical weapons technology.

The Sudanese government wants the plant preserved in its destroyed condition as a reminder of the American attack and have called on the United Nations to investigate the incident, which the U.S. opposed. Sudan has asked the U.S. for an apology for the attack but the U.S. has refused on the grounds it has not ruled out the possibility the plant had some connection to chemical weapons development.

Directly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the United Nations Security Council conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was opposed by the U.S., which has also blocked an independent laboratory analysis of the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the Al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial U.S. allegations were wrong.

==Consequences==
&quot;The Observer&quot; noted that &quot;[T]he loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines&quot; quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with &quot;intimate knowledge&quot; of the destroyed plant. A month later, &quot;Guardian&quot; correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant &quot;provided 50 per cent of Sudan’s medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria&quot;. He also noted that the British government (who publicly supported the U.S. decision to bomb the factory) refused requests &quot;to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production&quot;. The factory was a principal source of Sudan&#x27;s anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW (Chemical &amp; Biological Weapons) Conventions Bulletin.

Germany&#x27;s ambassador to Sudan at the time of the airstrike, Werner Daum, wrote an article in 2001, in which he called &quot;several tens of thousands of deaths&quot; of Sudanese civilians caused by a medicine shortage a &quot;reasonable guess&quot;.

Human Rights Watch reported that the bombing had the unintended effect of stopping relief efforts aimed at supplying food to areas of Sudan gripped by famine caused by that country&#x27;s ongoing civil war. Many of these agencies had been wholly or partially manned by Americans who subsequently evacuated the country out of fear of retaliation. A letter by that agency to President Clinton stated &quot;many relief efforts have been postponed indefinitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based International Rescue Committee where more than fifty southerners are dying daily&quot;. Mark Huband in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that the attack &quot;shattered ... the expected benefits of a political shift at the heart of Sudan&#x27;s Islamicist government&quot; towards a &quot;pragmatic engagement with the outside world&quot;.

Journalist Jason Burke, in the book &quot;Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror&quot;, claims that Operation Infinite Reach &quot;merely confirmed to [bin Laden and his close associates], and others with similar views worldwide, that their conception of the world as a cosmic struggle between good and evil was the right one&quot;.

==Criticism==

Christopher Hitchens wrote that the factory &quot;could not have been folded like a tent and spirited away in a day or so. And the United States has diplomatic relations with Sudan. ... Well then, what was the hurry? ... There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look &#x27;presidential&#x27; for a day.&quot;

The 9/11 Commission Report evaluated such so-called &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; theories (the strikes being motivated to deflect attention from domestic, political troubles), and found no reason to believe them, nor disbelieve the testimony and assertions of former President Clinton, former Vice President Gore, CIA Chief Tenet, nor former security advisors Berger and Clarke that the destruction of Al Shifa was still, as of 2004, a justifiable national security target.

The U.S. Justice Department, under President George W. Bush, produced an alleged al-Qaeda defector as a witness on 13 February 2001, in its ongoing case against Osama Bin Laden. The witness, Jamal al-Fadl, testified that Al Qaeda operatives he was involved with had been engaged in manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum, Sudan, around 1993 or 1994.

In 2001, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;the factory&#x27;s owner, Salah Idris, vigorously denied that he or the factory had any link with such weapons or any terrorist group. He attempted to sue the U.S. government for £35 million after hiring experts to show that the plant made only medicines. Despite growing support for Idris&#x27;s case in the U.S. and Britain, Washington refused to retract any of its claims and contested the lawsuit. The court dismissed the case under the political question doctrine, and Idris appealed unsuccessfully.

The bombing of the al-Shifa factory resurfaced in the news in April 2006 after the firing of former CIA analyst Mary McCarthy. McCarthy was against the bombing of the factory in 1998, and had written a formal letter of protest to President Clinton. According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, she had voiced doubts that the factory had ties to al Qaeda or was producing chemical weapons. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;In the case of the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, her concerns may have been well-founded. Sudanese officials and the plant&#x27;s owner denied any connection to Al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, the internal White House debate over whether the intelligence reports about the plant were accurate spilled into the press. Eventually, Clinton administration officials conceded that the hardest evidence used to justify striking the plant was a single soil sample that seemed to indicate the presence of a chemical used in making VX gas.&quot;

==Responsibility==

Thomas Joscelyn quotes Daniel Benjamin, a former U.S. National Security Council staffer: &quot;The report of the 9/11 Commission notes that the National Security staff reviewed the intelligence in April 2000 and concluded that the CIA&#x27;s assessment of its intelligence on bin Laden and al-Shifa had been valid; the memo to Clinton on this was cosigned by Richard Clarke and Mary McCarthy, the NSC senior director for intelligence programs, who opposed the bombing of al-Shifa in 1998. The report also notes that in their testimony before the commission, Al Gore, Sandy Berger, George Tenet, and Richard Clarke all stood by the decision to bomb al-Shifa.&quot;

Former Secretary of Defense Cohen defended, in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission in 2004, along with other cited Clinton security cabinet members in their separate 9/11 Commission testimony, the decision to destroy Al-Shifa: &quot;At the time, the intelligence community at the highest level repeatedly assured us that &#x27;it never gets better than this&#x27; in terms of confidence in an intelligence conclusion regarding a hard target. There was a good reason for this confidence, including multiple, reinforcing elements of information ranging from links that the organization that built the facility had both with Bin Laden and with the leadership of the Iraqi chemical weapons program; extraordinary security when the facility was constructed; physical evidence from the site; and other information from HUMINT and technical sources. Given what we knew regarding terrorists’ interest in acquiring and using chemical weapons against Americans, and given the intelligence assessment provided us regarding the al-Shifa facility, I continue to believe that destroying it was the right decision.&quot;

<text>Judith Milhon (March 12, 1939 – July 19, 2003), best known by her pseudonym St. Jude, was a self-taught programmer, civil rights advocate, writer, editor, advocate for women in computing, hacker and author in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Milhon coined the term cypherpunk and was a founding member of the cypherpunks. On July 19, 2003, Milhon died of cancer.

== Life ==
Judith Milhon was born March 12, 1939, in Washington, D.C., raised in Indiana, to a military family of the Marine Corps. She married Robert Behling in 1961 and had one daughter, Tresca Behling, with him. Attracted to the growing countercultural movement, Milhon moved near Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and established a communal household with her husband, young daughter, and friends. In 1968 she moved to San Francisco with her friend and partner Efrem Lipkin and divorced her husband in 1970. At the time of her death in 2003 from cancer, she was survived by at least one child, Tresca Behling, and one grandchild, Emilio Zuniga, as well as her partner of over 40 years, Efrem Lipkin.

==Professional projects==

Milhon taught herself programming in 1967 and landed her first job at the Horn and Hardart vending machine company of New York before she moved away to California to join the counterculture movement. She worked at the Berkeley Computer Company (an outgrowth of Project Genie), and she helped implement the communications controller of the BCC timesharing system. In 1971 she partnered with other local activists and technologists at Project One, where she was particularly drawn to the Resource One project, with the goal of creating the Bay Area&#x27;s first public computerized bulletin board system.

In 1973, a subset of the Resource One group, including Milhon, broke away to create Community Memory in Berkeley. Later, she also worked on BSD, a Unix-based operating system developed by the Computer Systems Research Group at UC Berkeley.

She was a member of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, and the author of several books. She was a senior editor at the magazine &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; and frequent contributor to Boing Boing.

==Activism and Vision==

St. Jude had her hand in many different causes. She was active in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement helping to organize the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Dedicated to protest, Milhon was jailed for trespassing in Montgomery, Alabama as well as for civil disobedience in Jackson, Mississippi.

Activism within the cyber community was important to Milhon as well. She frequently urged women toward the internet and hacking while encouraging them to have &quot;tough skin&quot; in the face of harassment. At a time when the internet was dominated by men, she was an ardent advocate of the joys of hacking, cybersex and a woman&#x27;s right to technology. She often said, &quot;Girls need modems. Women may not be great at physical altercations, but we sure excel at rapid-fire keyboarding.&quot; Milhon once noted that there was a conspicuous lack of female hardware hackers, and while working at Community Memory she worked against this exclusion and worked to get new, inexperienced users to experiment with Community Memory. She did so by writing open-ended questions in the system about available resources in the region (such as “Where can I get a decent bagel in the Bay Area (Berkeley particularly)?”), which would get curious users to try out the system.

She also wrote &quot;The Cyberpunk Handbook&quot; and coined the term &quot;cypherpunk&quot; for computer users dedicated to online privacy through encryption.

<text>Annie Jump Cannon (; December 11, 1863 – April 13, 1941) was an American astronomer whose cataloging work was instrumental in the development of contemporary stellar classification. With Edward C. Pickering, she is credited with the creation of the Harvard Classification Scheme, which was the first serious attempt to organize and classify stars based on their temperatures and spectral types. She was nearly deaf throughout her career after 1893, as a result of scarlet fever. She was a suffragist and a member of the National Women&#x27;s Party.

==Personal life==
Cannon was born on December 11, 1863, in Dover, Delaware. She was the eldest of three daughters born to Wilson Cannon, a Delaware shipbuilder and state senator, and his second wife, Mary Jump. Cannon&#x27;s mother was the first person to teach her the constellations and she encouraged her to follow her own interests, suggesting that she pursue studies in mathematics, chemistry, and biology at Wellesley College. Cannon and her mother used an old astronomy textbook to identify stars seen from their attic. Cannon&#x27;s mother also taught her daughter household economics, which Cannon would later use to organize her research.

Cannon took her mother&#x27;s advice and pursued her love of astronomy. She lost most of her hearing sometime during her early adult years. Sources vary on the time frame and actual cause, although it is often attributed to scarlet fever. Cannon&#x27;s personality has been described as &quot;ebullient&quot;. She chose not to marry or have children.

==Education, 1880–1896==
At Wilmington Conference Academy (later known as Wesley College), Cannon was a promising student, particularly in mathematics. In 1880, Cannon was sent to Wellesley College in Massachusetts, one of the top academic schools for women in the US, where she studied physics and astronomy.

Cannon studied under Sarah Frances Whiting, one of the few women physicists in the United States at the time, and went on to become the valedictorian at Wellesley College. She graduated with a degree in physics in 1884 and returned home to Delaware for a decade.

During these years, Cannon developed her skills in the new art of photography. In 1892, she traveled through Europe taking photographs with her Blair box camera. After she returned home her prose and photos from Spain were published in a pamphlet called &quot;In the Footsteps of Columbus&quot;, published by the Blair Company and distributed as a souvenir at the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893.

Soon afterward, Cannon was stricken with scarlet fever that rendered her nearly deaf. This hearing loss made it difficult for Cannon to socialize. As a result, she immersed herself in her work. In 1894, Cannon&#x27;s mother died and life at home grew more difficult. She wrote to her former instructor at Wellesley, professor Sarah Frances Whiting, to see if there was a job opening. Whiting hired her as a junior physics teacher at the college. This opportunity allowed Cannon to take graduate courses at the college in physics and astronomy. Whiting also inspired Cannon to learn about spectroscopy.

In order to gain access to a better telescope, Cannon enrolled at Radcliffe College in 1894 as a &quot;special student&quot;, continuing her studies of astronomy. Radcliffe was set up near Harvard College for Harvard professors to repeat their lectures to the young Radcliffe women. This relationship gave Cannon access to the Harvard College Observatory. In 1896, Edward C. Pickering hired her as his assistant at the Observatory. In 1907, Cannon finished her studies and received her master&#x27;s degree from Wellesley College.

==Career, 1896–1940==
In 1896, Cannon became a member of the Harvard Computers, a group of women hired by Harvard Observatory director Edward C. Pickering to complete the Henry Draper Catalogue, with the goal of mapping and defining every star in the sky to a photographic magnitude of about 9. In her notes, she referred to brightness as &quot;Int&quot; which was short for &quot;intensity&quot;. In 1927, Pickering said that she was able to classify stars very quickly, &quot;Miss Cannon is the only person in the world—man or woman—who can do this work so quickly.&quot; Mary Anna Draper, the widow of wealthy physician and amateur astronomer Henry Draper, had set up a fund to support the work. Men at the laboratory did the labor of operating the telescopes and taking photographs while the women examined the data, carried out astronomical calculations, and cataloged those photographs during the day. Pickering made the Catalogue a long-term project to obtain the optical spectra of as many stars as possible and to index and classify stars by spectra.

When Cannon first started cataloging the stars, she was able to classify 1,000 stars in three years, but by 1913, she was able to work on 200 stars an hour. Cannon could classify three stars a minute just by looking at their spectral patterns and, if using a magnifying glass, could classify stars down to the ninth magnitude, around 16 times fainter than the human eye can see. Her work was also highly accurate.

Not long after work began on the Draper Catalogue, a disagreement developed as to how to classify the stars. The analysis was first started by Nettie Farrar, who left a few months later to be married. This left the problem to the ideas of Henry Draper&#x27;s niece Antonia Maury (who insisted on a complex classification system) and Williamina Fleming (who was overseeing the project for Pickering, and wanted a much more simple, straightforward approach). Cannon negotiated a compromise: she started by examining the bright southern hemisphere stars. To these stars, she applied a third system, a division of stars into the spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Her scheme was based on the strength of the Balmer absorption lines. After absorption lines were understood in terms of stellar temperatures, her initial classification system was rearranged to avoid having to update star catalogs.

In 1901, Cannon published her first catalog of stellar spectra.

Cannon and the other women at the observatory, including Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Antonia Maury, and Florence Cushman, were criticized at first for being &quot;out of their place&quot; and not being housewives. Women did not commonly rise beyond the level of assistant in this line of work at the time and many were paid only 25 cents an hour to work seven hours a day, six days a week. Leavitt, another woman in the observatory who made significant contributions, shared with Cannon the experience of being deaf. Cannon dominated this field because of her &quot;tidiness&quot; and patience for the tedious work and even helped the men in the observatory gain popularity. Cannon helped broker partnerships and exchanges of equipment between men in the international community and assumed an ambassador-like role outside of it.

In 1911 she was made the Curator of Astronomical Photographs at Harvard. In 1914, she was admitted as an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1921, she became one of the first women to receive an honorary doctorate from a European university when she was awarded an honorary doctor&#x27;s degree in math and astronomy from Groningen University.

On May 9, 1922, the International Astronomical Union passed the resolution to formally adopt Cannon&#x27;s stellar classification system; with only minor changes, it is still being used for classification today. Also in 1922, Cannon spent six months in Arequipa, Peru, to photograph stars in the Southern hemisphere.

In 1925, she became the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate of science from Oxford University. 

In 1933, she represented professional women at the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago (Century of Progress).In 1935, she created the Annie J. Cannon Prize for &quot;the woman of any country, whose contributions to the science of astronomy are the most distinguished.&quot;

In 1938, she became the William C. Bond Astronomer at Harvard University.

The astronomer Cecilia Payne collaborated with Cannon and used Cannon&#x27;s data to show that the stars were composed mainly of hydrogen and helium.

==Later life and death, 1940–1941==
Annie Jump Cannon&#x27;s career in astronomy lasted for more than 40 years, until her retirement in 1940. After retirement she continued to actively work on astronomy in the observatory up until a few weeks before she died. During her career, Cannon helped women gain acceptance and respect within the scientific community. Her calm and hardworking attitude and demeanor helped her gain respect throughout her lifetime and paved the path for future women astronomers.

Cannon died on April 13, 1941, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 77. She died in a hospital after being ill for more than a month. The American Astronomical Society presents the Annie Jump Cannon Award annually to female astronomers for distinguished work in astronomy.

==Work==
Cannon manually classified more stars in a lifetime than anyone else, with a total of around 350,000 stars. She discovered 300 variable stars, five novas, and one spectroscopic binary, creating a bibliography that included about 200,000 references.

<text>Guy Lewis Steele Jr. (; born October 2, 1954) is an American computer scientist who has played an important role in designing and documenting several computer programming languages and technical standards.

==Biography==
Steele was born in Missouri and graduated from the Boston Latin School in 1972. He received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in applied mathematics from Harvard University (1975) and a Master&#x27;s degree (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in computer science (1977, 1980). He then worked as an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a compiler implementer at Tartan Laboratories. Then he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, where he helped define and promote a parallel computing version of the Lisp programming language named *Lisp (Star Lisp) and a parallel version of the language C named C*.

In 1994, Steele joined Sun Microsystems and was invited by Bill Joy to become a member of the Java team after the language had been designed, since he had a track record of writing good specifications for extant languages. He was named a Sun Fellow in 2003. Steele joined Oracle in 2010 when Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems.

==Works==
While at MIT, Steele published more than two dozen papers with Gerald Jay Sussman on the subject of the language Lisp and its implementation (the Lambda Papers). One of their most notable contributions was the design of the language Scheme.

Steele also designed the original command set of Emacs and was the first to port TeX (from WAITS to ITS). He has published papers on other subjects, including compilers, parallel processing, and constraint languages. One song he composed has been published in the official journal of the Association for Computing Machinery &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; (CACM) (&quot;The Telnet Song&quot;, April 1984, a parody of the behavior of a series of PDP-10 TELNET implementations written by Mark Crispin).

Steele has served on accredited technical standards committees, including: Ecma International (formerly European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)) TC39 (for the language ECMAScript, for which he was editor of the first edition), X3J11 (for C), and X3J3 (for Fortran) and is, , chairman of X3J13 (for Common Lisp). He was also a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) working group that produced the IEEE Standard for the language Scheme, IEEE Std 1178-1990. He represented Sun Microsystems in the High Performance Fortran Forum, which produced the High Performance Fortran specification in May, 1993.

In addition to specifications of the language Java, Steele&#x27;s work at Sun Microsystems has included research in parallel algorithms, implementation strategies, and architecture and software support. In 2005, Steele began leading a team of researchers at Sun developing a new language named Fortress, a high-performance language designed to obsolete Fortran.

Steele participated in the development of the Verse programming language designed by Epic Games.

===Books===
In 1982, Steele edited &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1983; ), which was a print version of the Jargon File.

Steele and Samuel P. Harbison wrote &quot;C: A Reference Manual&quot;, (Prentice-Hall, 1984; ), to provide a precise description of the language C, which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems. Both authors participated in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C standardization process; several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard.

On 16 March 1984, Steele published &quot;Common Lisp the Language&quot; (Digital Press; ; 465 pages). This first edition was the original specification of Common Lisp (CLtL1) and served as the basis for the ANSI standard. Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in 1990, (1029 pages) which documented a near-final version of the ANSI standard.

Steele, along with Charles H. Koelbel, David B. Loveman, Robert S. Schreiber, and Mary E. Zosel wrote &quot;The High Performance Fortran Handbook&quot; (MIT Press, 1994; ).

Steele also coauthored the original &quot;The Java Language Specification&quot; with James Gosling and Bill Joy.

==Awards==
Steele received the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1988. He was named a Founding AAAI Fellow in 1990, an ACM Fellow in 1994, a member of the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America in 2001 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. He received the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Excellence in Programming Award in 2005.

==Other activities==
Steele is a modern western square dancer and caller from Mainstream up through C3A, a member of Tech Squares, and a member of Callerlab.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Great Quux&quot;, which was an old student nickname at the Boston Latin School and MIT, he has published light verse and &quot;Crunchly&quot; cartoons; a few of the latter appeared in &quot;The New Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. He has also used his initials (GLS).

In 1998, Steele solved the game Teeko via computer, showing what must occur if both players play wisely; he found that neither player can force a win. He also showed that the Advanced Teeko variant is a win for Black (again, assuming perfect play), as is one other variant, but the other fourteen variants are draws.

<doc id="299675" wikidata="Q59078" url="?curid=299675" title="Lactone">
<text>Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters. They are derived from the corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acids by esterification. They can be saturated or unsaturated.

Lactones are formed by lactonization, the intramolecular esterification of the corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acids.

==Nomenclature==
Greek prefixes in alphabetical order indicate ring size.

Lactones are usually named according to the precursor acid molecule (&quot;aceto&quot; = 2 carbon atoms, &quot;propio&quot; = 3, &quot;butyro&quot; = 4, &quot;valero&quot; = 5, &quot;capro&quot; = 6, etc.), with a &quot;-lactone&quot; suffix and a Greek letter prefix that specifies the number of carbon atoms in the heterocycle — that is, the distance between the relevant -OH and the -COOH groups along said backbone. The first carbon atom after the carbon in the -COOH group on the parent compound is labelled α, the second will be labeled β, and so forth. Therefore, the prefixes also indicate the size of the lactone ring: α-lactone = 3-membered ring, β-lactone = 4-membered, γ-lactone = 5-membered, δ-lactone = 6-membered, etc. Macrocyclic lactones are known as macrolactones.

The other suffix used to denote a lactone is &quot;-olide&quot;, used in substance class names like &quot;butenolide&quot;, &quot;macrolide&quot;, &quot;cardenolide&quot; or &quot;bufadienolide&quot;.

To obtain the preferred IUPAC names, lactones are named as heterocyclic pseudoketones by adding the suffix &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;dione&#x27;, &#x27;thione&#x27;, etc. and the appropriate multiplicative prefixes to the name of the heterocyclic parent hydride.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;lactone&quot; derives from the ring compound called lactide, which is formed from the dehydration of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Lactic acid, in turn, derives its name from its original isolation from soured milk (Latin: lac, lactis). The name was coined in 1844 by the French chemist Théophile-Jules Pelouze, who first obtained it as a derivative of lactic acid. An internal dehydration reaction within the same molecule of lactic acid would have produced alpha-propiolactone, a lactone with a 3-membered ring.

In 1880 the German chemist Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig extended the name &quot;lactone&quot; to all intramolecular carboxylic esters.

== Occurrence ==

Lactone rings occur widely as building blocks in nature, such as in ascorbic acid, kavain, nepetalactone, gluconolactone, hormones (spironolactone, mevalonolactone), enzymes (lactonase), neurotransmitters (butyrolactone, avermectins), antibiotics (macrolides like erythromycin; amphotericin B), anticancer drugs (vernolepin, epothilones), phytoestrogens (resorcylic acid lactones, cardiac glycosides).

5-Membered γ-lactones and 6-membered δ-lactones are prevalent. β-lactones appear in a number of natural products. αLactones can be detected as transient species in mass spectrometry experiments. 

Macrocyclic lactones are also important natural products. Lactones are present in oak wood, and they contribute to the flavour profile of barrel-aged beers.

==Synthesis==
Many methods in ester synthesis can also be applied to that of lactones. Lactonization competes with polymerization for longer hydroxy acids, or the strained βlactones. γLactones, on the other hand, are so stable that 4-hydroxy acids (R-CH(OH)-(CH2)2-CO2H) spontaneously cyclize.

In one industrial synthesis of oxandrolone the key lactone-forming step is an organic reaction – esterification.
In halolactonization, an alkene is attacked by a halogen via electrophilic addition with the cationic intermediate captured intramolecularly by an adjacent carboxylic acid.

Specific methods include Yamaguchi esterification, Shiina macrolactonization, Corey-Nicolaou macrolactonization, Baeyer–Villiger oxidation and nucleophilic abstraction.

An alternative radical reaction yielding γ-lactones is the manganese-mediated coupling.

==Reactions==
Lactones exhibit the reactions characteristic of esters.

===Hydrolysis and aminolysis===
Heating a lactone with a base (sodium hydroxide) will hydrolyse the lactone to its parent compound, the straight chained bifunctional compound. Like straight-chained esters, the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of lactones is a reversible reaction, with an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis reaction of the lactone is lower than that of the straight-chained ester i.e. the products (hydroxyacids) are less favored in the case of the lactones. This is because although the enthalpies of the hydrolysis of esters and lactones are about the same, the entropy of the hydrolysis of lactones is less than the entropy of straight-chained esters. Straight-chained esters give two products upon hydrolysis, making the entropy change more favorable than in the case of lactones which gives only a single product.

Lactones also react with amines to give the ring-opened alcohol and amide.

===Reduction===
Lactones can be reduced to diols using lithium aluminium hydride. For instance, gamma-lactones is reduced to butane-1,4-diol, (CH2(OH)-(CH2)2-CH2(OH).

=== Polymerization ===
Some lactones convert to polyesters: For example the double lactone called lactide polymerizes to polylactic acid (polylactide). The resulting polylactic acid has been heavily investigated for commercial applications.

== Uses ==

=== Flavors and fragrances ===
Lactones contribute significantly to the flavor of fruit, and of unfermented and fermented dairy products, and are therefore used as flavors and fragrances. Some examples are γ-decalactone (4-decanolide), which has a characteristic peach flavor; δ-decalactone (5-decanolide), which has a creamy coconut/peach flavour; γ-dodecalactone (4-dodecanolide), which also has a coconut/fruity flavor, a description which also fits γ-octalactone (4-octanolide), although it also has a herbaceous character; γ-nonalactone, which has an intense coconut flavor of this series, despite not occurring in coconut, and γ-undecalactone.

Macrocyclic lactones (cyclopentadecanolide, 15-pentadec-11/12-enolide) have odors similar to macrocyclic ketones of animal origin (muscone, civetone).

=== Plastics ===
Polycaprolactone is an important plastic. Its formation has even been considered in the context of the origin of life.

== Dilactones ==
*Ellagic acid (Hexahydroxydiphenic acid dilactone)
*Flavogallonic acid dilactone can be found in &quot;Rhynchosia volubilis&quot; seeds and in &quot;Shorea laeviforia&quot;
*Lactide
*Tergallic acid dilactone can be found in &quot;Rhynchosia volubilis&quot; seeds
*Valoneic acid dilactone can be isolated from the heartwood of &quot;Shorea laeviforia&quot;
*Ethylene brassylate (Musk T), a widely used synthetic musk

<text>Antonio Yapsutco Fortich (11 August 1913 – 2 July 2003) was the third bishop of the Diocese of Bacolod. He is noted for being a social activist who fought for social justice in Negros. In 2018, Fortich was recognized by the Human Rights Victims&#x27; Claims Board as a Motu Proprio victim of the Martial Law Era.

==Early years==
Fortich was born on 11 August 1913, in Sibulan, Negros Oriental. He attended elementary and high school in Dumaguete, and pursued his college and theological studies at Ateneo de Manila (San Jose Minor and San Jose Major seminaries). His parents, Ignacio and Rosalia Yapsutco Fortich, were well-to-do farmers and he was the eldest and only son in their family of two.
==Priestly Ministry==
On 4 March 1944, at the height of World War II, Fortich was ordained by Michael J. O&#x27;Doherty, Archbishop of Manila. He served the Diocese of Bacolod under Bishop Casimiro Lladoc, assigning him as assistant parish priest of the San Sebastian Cathedral. In 1949, he was made parish priest of the San Isidro Labrador Parish in Binalbagan (which was then under the Diocese of Bacolod) until after a year and eight months when he was assigned back to Bacolod as parish priest of the diocesan cathedral. He was then appointed as Vicar General of the diocese under Bishop Manuel Yap on 31 December 1952.

==Bishop of Bacolod==
When Bishop Yap died on 16 October 1966, Fortich was assigned diocesan administrator while waiting the appointment of a new bishop. On 13 January 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed him as bishop of the diocese. His episcopate was marked with great concern and action towards the poor and oppressed of his diocese, which is in line with the church teaching of &quot;preferential option for the poor&quot;.

He was one of the first people to alert the government to the illegal activities of timber poachers, who had stripped hundreds of acres of forest in Negros. He set up co-operatives composed of small landowners and sugar workers, to break the debt cycle suffered by Filipino sugar workers. In doing so, the bishop antagonized large landowners, including congressman Armando Gustilo, who at one stage tried to intimidate him by lobbing a hand grenade into his house.&#x27;

His efforts was encouraged by Pope John Paul II, who personally came to Bacolod and gave a speech to sugarcane workers, landowners, and the faithful of the diocese on 20 February 1981.

In 1983, he led the diocese in celebration of its Golden Jubilee, with Cardinal Jaime Sin giving a speech for the occasion.

==Retirement and death==
Bishop Fortich resigned on 31 January 1989 after reaching the mandatory age of 75. He was succeeded by Bishop Camilo Gregorio, then Auxiliary Bishop of Cebu.

He supported the election of Joseph Estrada as president of the Philippines, and when it became clear that Estrada was using his position to accumulate personal wealth, the bishop withdrew his support.

He died on 2 July 2003, aged 89. His requiem mass was attended by thousands of people, including former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He is buried in a tomb at the right side of the San Sebastian Cathedral in Bacolod. In 2013, his remains were transferred to a side chapel of the same cathedral.
==Legacy==
He was honoured as Domestic Prelate in 1958.

Awarded by the University of Negros Occidental – Recoletos the Honoris Causa: doctor of Philosophy for Humanitarian service in 1969.

His name is inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of Heroes), in recognition of his opposition to the excesses of the 21-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.

<text>Rathcroghan () is a complex of archaeological sites near Tulsk in County Roscommon, Ireland. It is identified as the site of Cruachan, the traditional capital of the Connachta, the prehistoric and early historic rulers of the western territory. The Rathcroghan Complex (Crúachan Aí) is a unique archaeological landscape with many references found in early Irish medieval manuscripts.

Located on the plains of Connacht (Mag nAí/Machaire Connacht), Rathcroghan is one of the six Royal Sites of Ireland. This landscape which extends over , consists of over 240 archaeological sites, 60 of which are protected national monuments.

These monuments range from the Neolithic (4000–2500 BC), through the Bronze (2500–500 BC) and Iron Age (500 BC–400 AD), to the early medieval period and beyond. These monuments include burial mounds, ringforts and medieval field boundaries amongst others. The most fascinating of these are the multi period Rathcroghan Mound, the mysterious cave of Oweynagat, the Mucklaghs – a set of linear earthworks – as well as the Carns medieval complex.

There are many historic references to Rathcroghan (Ráth Crúachan) recorded in early medieval manuscripts, including the 12th-century Lebor na hUidre. Rathcroghan is recorded as the location of one of the great fairs of Ireland, as well as being one of the island&#x27;s three great heathen cemeteries. It is also the location for the beginning and end of a national epic tale – an &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, and the royal seat of Medb (Maeve), Connacht&#x27;s Warrior Queen.

Rathcroghan is said to provide entrance to the Otherworld, described in the medieval period as &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Gate to Hell&quot; (not to be confused with St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory), via Oweynagat (the Cave of the Cats). The cave has associations with the pagan festival of Samhain, Halloween, as well as being described as the &quot;fit abode&quot; of Morrígan, a Celtic goddess of pre-Christian Ireland.

== Importance ==
According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, the site may be &quot;Europe&#x27;s largest unexcavated royal complex&quot;. It is designated a Royal Site of Ireland by the Irish government. Ireland applied for UNESCO World Heritage status for the site in 2021.

==Mythology==

===Origin===
According to a &quot;Dindshenchas&quot; poem, Cruachan was named after Crochen, the handmaid of Étaín, a &quot;sídhe&quot; maiden reborn as a mortal. When Étaín is brought back to the Otherworld by her original &quot;sídhe&quot; lover Midir, Crochen accompanies them and on their way to Midir&#x27;s underground palace they spend some time in a mound known as Síd Sinche.

Crochen is so impressed by this &quot;&quot; (fairy mound) that she asks Midir if this is his palace. Because of her loyalty to Étaín and her respect to this dwelling, Midir gives it to her and names it in her honour before bringing Étaín to his palace at Bri Leith. At the end of the poem Crochen is mentioned as the mother of Medb.

The same poem mentions Cruachan as a royal cemetery: &quot;Listen, ye warriors about Cruachu! With its barrow for every noble couple&quot;.

===Ulster Cycle===
Cruachan features heavily in the Ulster Cycle as it was the home of one of its chief characters Queen Medb. She had been given the kingdom of Connacht by her High-King father Eochaid Feidlech who had de-throned the previous king Tindi Mac Conra over an act of treachery. It is unclear if Tindi had actually ruled the province from Cruachan or if had been built Medb.

Another story states that Cruachan had been ruled by the queen&#x27;s sister, Clothru, before Medb herself had her killed. Vivid descriptions of the Western capital are given in &quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot; (&quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot;), and this one in &quot;Táin Bó Fraích&quot;:
:&quot;Of pine the house was made; it is a covering of shingle it had externally. There were sixteen windows in the house, and a frame of brass, to each of them; a tie of brass across the roof-light. Four beams of brass on the apartment of Ailill and Medb, adorned all with bronze, and it in the exact centre of the house. Two rails of silver around it under gilding. In the front a wand of silver that reached the middle rafters of the house. The house was encircled all round from the door to the other.&quot;

Cruachan features at the start and end of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailgne&quot; with the pillow talk in the royal residence, and concluding with the fight of the bulls, supposed to have taken place at Rath na dTarbh, one of the largest ring-forts on the site. Aside from the Ulster tales there are not many mythical descriptions of Connacht&#x27;s main fort with one of the best examples occurring in a &quot;Dindshenchas&quot; poem on Carn Fráich. This poem deals with two figures of this name, one being the Fráech of Medb&#x27;s time and one who was a Connacht prince preceding Irelands division into Conn&#x27;s and Eoghan&#x27;s half, with this section of the poem describing Cruachan as a stone-built fortress.

===Samhain===

Cruachan seems to have heavy associations with the feast of Samhain, as it was during this time that the Irish believed that the prehistoric graves from before their time opened and their gods and spirits, who dwelt inside, walked the earth. The emerging of creatures from Oweynagat would be part of this belief. A legend based on this is &quot;The Adventures of Nera&quot;, in which the warrior of the title is challenged to tie a twig around the ankle of a condemned man on Samhain night. After agreeing to get some water for the condemned man he discovers strange houses and when he finally gets him some water at the third house he returns him to captivity only to witness Rathcroghan&#x27;s royal buildings being destroyed by the spirits. He follows the fairy host to the &quot;&quot; where he meets a woman who tells him that what he saw was a vision of what will happen a year from now unless his mortal comrades are warned. He leaves the &quot;síd&quot; and informs Ailill mac Máta of his vision who then has the Sidhe destroyed.

===Oweynagat===

Oweynagat is a cave on the site. According to National Geographic it is the birthplace of Queen Medb, also known as Queen Maeve.

It is unclear whether what is referred to as the &quot;&quot; is &quot;Oweynagat&quot; or the mound of Rathcroghan itself.

On the inner lintel is an ogham inscription. The full phrasing is unclear but the words &quot; and &quot; have been translated; it is unclear if this is the same &quot;Fraech&quot; associated with Queen Medb.

A tale from the 18th century tells of a woman who on trying to catch a run-away cow, follows it into the cave and emerges miles away in Keshcorran, County Sligo.

Various destructive creatures emerged from Oweynagat in during Samhain in traditional tales. These included:
* The name &quot;Oweynagat&quot; may come from the magical wildcats featured in &quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot; that emerge from the cave to attack the three Ulster warriors before being tamed by Cúchulainn.
* The &quot;Ellen Trechen&quot; was a triple headed monster that went on a rampage across the country before being killed by Amergin, the father of Conall Cernach.
* Small red birds came from the cave withering every plant they breathed on, before being hunted by the Red Branch.
* Herds of pigs with similar decaying powers emerged from the cave with Ailill and Medb themselves desperately trying to hunt them down, but having to deal with the pigs&#x27; power of vanishing and ability to shed captured flesh.

===The Morrígan===
The Morrígan emerges from this cave in the Táin Bó Regamna on a chariot pulled by a one-legged chestnut horse. She brings a cow, guided by a giant with a forked staff, to breed with the Brown Bull. In another story the Morrígan takes the cows of a woman named Odras who follows her into the cave before falling under an enchanted sleep, upon awakening she sees the Morrígan who whispers a spell over her, turning Odras into a river.

==History==

Like the other royal sites there are not any great historical references or archaeological evidence to prove it was a royal residence or fortress as described in the myths, with some of the best examples of ring-forts in the area dating from Christian times. It was certainly an important cemetery with the amount of ring barrows backing up the scribes who mention it alongside Tailtiu and Tara as one of the three great burial sites also a gathering place or &quot;oenach&quot;. All assemblies and &quot;oenach&quot;s were part of religious and funerary traditions and just as an assembly was held at the cemetery of Tailtiu (even into the 19th century) there would surely have been one at Cruachan. It is believed by many that queen Medb was actually the local earth goddess, much like Medb Lethderg at Tara, and that becoming king meant marrying the earth, becoming one with Cruachan with the inauguration more than likely taking place on Rathcroghan mound itself. Cruachan&#x27;s religious importance diminished after the arrival of Christianity, highlighted by the prologue in the Martyrology of Oengus that contrasts the end of Cruachan&#x27;s power with the emergence of Clonmacnoise.

The new emerging writers didn&#x27;t really record what actually happened at sites like this, developing stories which feature the &quot;&quot; of Cruachan being attacked by Ailill and Medb while referring to Owenagat as the hell&#x27;s gate of Ireland. At the end of the first century, a number of raths were built on the site. Some of these later included souterrains with an entrance for one built over Oweynagat using standing Ogham stones from the site that were unique to Connacht, usually only appearing in the south-west of Ireland. The area is peppered with medieval field banks, the best examples being around Reilig na Ri, showing that Cruachan became key grazing land possibly attached initially to the early medieval fort built at neighbouring Tulsk, with another nearby feature – Carnfree mound – being used as the inauguration site of the O&#x27;Conor kings of Connacht. There is evidence of small house clusters or &quot;sean bhaile&quot; between the monuments that could have been lived in well past the Middle Ages; however, the next important development was surveying that began in the mid-eighteenth century, highlighted by Gabriel Beranger&#x27;s colour drawing of Cruachan mound. This work was continued by the ordnance survey in the 1830s who, with local help, assigned the names to the monuments that are used to this day. Not much physical excavation has been done around Rathcroghan mound, but technologies such as radar and magnetic surveys have revealed features that show great similarities between Rathcroghan, Tara, and Emain Macha. In 1999 the Cruachan Ai visitor centre was completed in Tulsk, showcasing all the latest research updates done on Rathcroghan as well as Carnfree and Tulsk itself.

A historical reference to the cave is to be found in the Triads of Ireland, dating from the 14th to the 19th century, where &quot;, and &quot; are listed under the heading, &quot;the three darkest places in Ireland&quot;. The last, meaning the &#x27;Cave of the Alders&#x27;, is generally thought to be the present Dunmore Cave, while the first two translate as the caves of Knowth and the caves of Slaney. is not known which exact system of caves/passage tombs near the river Slaney is being referred to, with the most likely, those at Baltinglass. Other sources translate the listed locations as Rath Croghan, the cave or crypt of Slane and the &quot;Cave of the Ferns&quot;.

== Archaeology ==
The Rathcroghan complex has over 240 archaeological sites – 60 of which are classed as national monuments – scattered over approximately . They range in date from the Neolithic to the medieval period and the monument categories include burial mounds, ringforts, linear earthworks and enclosures.

==Main sites==

===Rathcroghan mound===

The focal point of the complex, Rathcroghan mound is a broad, flat-topped circular mound with an average diameter of at the base and a height of . Gently sloping ramps to the east and west give access to the summit on which there are traces of a small mound. Surveying has revealed that Rathcroghan mound was built on top of an existing monument that was made of two concentric stone built ring banks. A huge enclosure measuring in diameter and in depth was also discovered during surveying. This enclosure surrounds the great mound and various other monuments, facilitating comparisons with other royal sites in Ireland such as Tara, Emain Macha and Dún Ailinne, which have similar enclosures.

===Rathmore===
The name of this mound translates directly to &quot;Big Fort&quot;. It is convex in shape with a diameter of and surrounded by a wide ditch. This grass-covered, steep-sided mound is suggested to date from the late phase in the Iron Age into the early medieval period. Although it is similar to a ringfort, the apex of the mound is considered too small. Potential post holes found at the top of the mound may suggest that this was the site of an Iron Age communal hall or similar circular structure. Geophysical surveys indicate evidence of hearths, pits and ovens on the interior which accords with the use of the mound for habitation.

===Rath na dTarbh===
The anglicised spelling is Rathnadarve and the name means &#x27;Fort of the bulls&#x27; in English. West of Rathcroghan mound is a large circular ring fort with a considerable bank and external ditch. There are several breaks in the bank, one at the north east being a possible entrance. This is traditionally the site of the fight between the bulls Donn Cuailnge and Finnbennach at the end of the epic Táin Bó Cúailnge.

===Reilig na Rí===
The anglicised spelling is Relignaree and translated from Irish means &#x27;burial place of the Kings&#x27;. This is a large circular enclosure with a diameter of and a stone and earth bank of high. In the interior of the enclosure there are traces of a smaller circular enclosure, with a diameter of . Ancient field boundary banks run across this site, seeming to divide it into four unequal segments, and the remains of five rectangular houses are visible in and around the site. In 1872 the remains of a souterrain in the south-west quadrant were excavated and animal bones were found.

===Oweynagat===

The Irish name for this site is Uaimh na gCat which translates as &#x27;Cave of the Cats&#x27;. This is a natural narrow limestone cave with a man-made souterrain at the entrance. Originally the entrance to the souterrain was contained within an earthen mound, which was disturbed by the construction of a road in the 1930s. The souterrain is constructed of drystone walling, orthostats and lintels (with Ogham inscriptions), and measures a total of approximately from the entrance to the natural cave. The natural cave extends for a further . 

There is an ogham inscription on the overhead lintel just inside the entrance to the souterrain which reads &#x27;VRAICCI...MAQI MEDVVI&#x27;. In translation this would read &#x27;of Fraech, son of Medb&#x27;, Fraech being associated with Cruachan and Medb in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Fraech is also associated with the nearby monument of Carnfee (Carn Fraích). There is a second ogham inscription on another lintel inside the passageway, barely visible, which reads &#x27;QR G SMU&#x27;. This inscription is too incomplete to enable a confident reading.

===Dathí&#x27;s Mound===
This mound was supposed to be the burial place of Dathí, the last pagan High King of Ireland. It appears to be an embanked burial mound with an overall diameter of , with opposed entrances on the east and west. There is a pillar stone of red sandstone atop the mound, the stone standing high. Macalister&#x27;s investigations in 1913 revealed that the mound was carved out of a natural gravel ridge, and furthermore, limited excavation in 1981 confirmed this. No graves were found at this excavation, although charcoal samples retrieved suggest a building date of between 200 BC – 200 AD. This date conflicts with the legend of this being Dathí&#x27;s final resting place, as he was supposed to have died around 429 AD, at least 200 years later than the creation of this site.

===The Mucklaghs===
Folklore tells us that these huge earthworks are the results of the rooting of a giant boar, with &quot;muic&quot; being the Irish word for pig. They are two linear earthworks which consist of double banks with three accompanying ditches which run north-east and south-west in a curving parallel course at a distance of apart. The Northern Mucklagh is the shorter of the two, measuring , but is impressively massive in its construction. The Southern Mucklagh is significantly longer, measuring approximately . The function of these earthworks is unclear.

===Rathbeg===
Rathbeg, &quot;Small Fort&quot;, has been categorised as a Ring Barrow with three concentric rings that encircle the barrow in a tiered effect. The mound is located north west of Rathcroghan mound. It has a double ditch on three sides of the monument and an extra ditch on the western side. There is a small cairn at the summit surrounded by small banks and ditches, which creates the terracing. The mound is approximately in diameter. Worked flint discovered on the mound dates from the Iron Age and possibly the Bronze Age, however the structure itself would be consistent with Neolithic monuments.

=== Cashelmanannan ===
The Irish spelling of the name is Caiseal Mhanannán, which means Manannan’s Fort, referring to a deity from Irish mythology, Manannán mac Lir. These are the foundation remains of a trivallate oval stone fort, with three closely spaced concentric banks of earth and stone measuring an average of in width each. The internal diameter measures with the external measurements being north/south and east/west. Attached to the main enclosure on the north and east sides are two rectangular enclosures, each defined by a singular bank. The exact use of Cashelmanannan is unknown, as excavation has not taken place, but the fact that it is the only structure in the complex built of stone suggests a high-status building with good defensive features.

===Other sites===
* &quot;Misguan Medb&quot; – A fallen standing stone located near Rathcroghan Mound.
* &quot;Ancient Avenue&quot; – A sunken avenue or trackway surrounded by two low, parallel banks. Part of it intersects with the outer circular bank and ditch of Rathscreig, a site with a small mound at the center. The avenue which is roughly wide seems to end at Flanagan&#x27;s Fort, another ringfort with a small mound at the center. Both these forts were built at a later date than the avenue.

==Annalistic references==
A part of information source for the Rathcroghan complex comes from annalistic references. These references can give an indication of events, and the earliest annalistic reference to Rathcroghan occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters and is described as being 1681 BC. Up until the 8th century AD we can suggest that these earlier references were proto-historical.

The promulgation of St. Patrick&#x27;s law and St. Ciaran&#x27;s law at Crúachan in 783 AD and 814 AD respectively shows the importance of this site well into the medieval period, and possibly is the earliest genuinely historical reference to Rathcroghan.

<text>Moritz Hermann von Jacobi (; 21 September 1801 – 10 March 1874), also known as Boris Semyonovich Yakobi (), was a German-Russian electrical engineer and physicist.

==Motors==
Jacobi began to study magnetic motors in 1834. In 1835 moved to Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) to lecture at Dorpat University. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1837 to research the usage of electromagnetic forces for moving machines at the Russian Academy of Sciences. He investigated the power of an electromagnet in motors and generators. While studying the transfer of power from a battery to an electric motor, he deduced the maximum power theorem. Jacobi tested the output of motors by determining the amount of zinc consumed by the battery. With the financial assistance of Tsar Nicholas I, in 1839 Jacobi constructed a 28-foot electric motor boat powered by battery cells, which carried 14 passengers on the Neva river against the current at three miles per hour.

==Jacobi&#x27;s law==

 &quot;Circuit Diagram&quot;

The law known as the maximum power theorem states:

The transfer of maximum power from a source with a fixed internal resistance to a load, the resistance of the load must be the same as that of the source. This law is of use when driving a load such as an electric motor from a battery.

==Electrotyping and telegraphy==

In 1838 he discovered galvanoplastics, or electrotyping, a method of making printing plates by electroplating. The way this works is analogous to a battery acting in reverse. The &quot;stereotype&quot; was an impression taken from a form of movable lead type and used for printing instead of the original type. This technique is used in relief printing.

He also worked on the development of the electric telegraph. In 1842-1845 he built a telegraph line between Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo using an underground cable. In 1867 he was a Russian delegate to the Commission on Measurement Units at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair. He was a strong proponent of the metric system.

==Naval mine==
In 1853 Jacobi developed the Jacobi naval mine.

The mine was tied to the sea bottom by an anchor, a cable connected it to a galvanic cell which powered it from the shore. The power of its explosive charge was equal to of black powder. Its production was approved by the Committee for Mines of the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire.

In 1854 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and Alexander (Kronstadt).

==Family==
Von Jacobi&#x27;s brother was the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

Jacobi was born into an Ashkenazi Jewish family.

<doc id="299682" wikidata="Q6464279" url="?curid=299682" title="La Pandilla">
<text>La Pandilla were a Spanish a teen music group of the 1970s, founded in 1970 by Pepa Aguirre. The group had members of both sexes, unlike most pop groups at the time.

Aguirre&#x27;s son, daughter, and niece formed the band; later, two more boys were added. Their first album, &quot;Villancicos&quot;, was released in late 1970.

&quot;La Pandilla&quot; had initially a big impact in their home country of Spain. After a personnel change as some of the original members grew up, they experienced some backlash in the country for their song &quot;El Alacrán&quot; (&quot;The Scorpion&quot;), an innocent pop tune that made a coincidental reference to a clandestine group that was one of Francisco Franco&#x27;s staunchest opponents. Franco&#x27;s censors objected to the group, so they started touring Latin America more frequently.

Their appeal to youth in some Latin American countries bordered on collective hysteria, a reaction that evoked that of Beatlemania in the mid-1960s. During the 1970s, it was common to see &quot;La Pandilla&quot;-related items such as notebooks, posters, magazines, notebook covers, rulers, and dolls at department stores all over the Spanish-speaking countries. There were also two movies which were primarily centered around the band, named &quot;Operacion Alacran&quot; and &quot;La Pandilla en Apuros&quot;. La Pandilla&#x27;s film debut took place in 1972&#x27;s &quot;En un mundo nuevo&quot; but in this film, the band played secondary roles.

&quot;La Pandilla&quot; was chiefly instrumental in the later success and development of one of history&#x27;s most legendary boy bands: Menudo. In 1973, the future founder of Menudo, Edgardo Diaz, who was a medical student in Spain and lived next door to the Aguirreses, joined the band&#x27;s entourage as a sound expert. Diaz turned out to be the bridge between &quot;La Pandilla&quot; and Puerto Rico, the country where La Pandilla&#x27;s success was longest-lived. Thanks in part to him, Alfred D. Herger—who became known as &quot;the biggest pandillero&quot; in Puerto Rico—and Felix Santiesteban, the group became a teen favorite in the Caribbean island. Diaz became manager in 1974. In 1975, the band was received by a huge crowd of Puerto Rican fans at the Iberia Airlines terminal at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport at San Juan. Similar receptions took place in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela and other countries.

The definitive lineup of close-knit group La Pandilla literally grew up together, along with their fans. This eventually became a liability, as the youngest members&#x27; voices matured which made their original sound difficult to produce. Another liability, at least in Diaz&#x27;s view, was that of having a female singer, Mari Blanca, for whom separate lodging, security, and chaperone arrangements were always necessary. This prompted Díaz to leave the management of the group and set up yet another, this time in his native Puerto Rico, in which only young males under age 15 would be used, to be replaced as they aged. After Diaz left and formed Menudo, La Pandilla&#x27;s popularity slowly declined.

Former member Javier Martínez died from cancer on 29 June 2023, at the age of 63.

==Television series==
Puerto Rican actor and singer Juan Carlos Morales, who himself was once accepted by Menudo but who had to pull out of the group because his mother did not allow him to join it, announced in 2016, that he and Spaniard producing company &quot;El Trampolin&quot; are developing a television series largely based on both La Pandilla and Menudo&#x27;s hits, about a male homosexual couple who adopt four boys and one girl and form a tribute band named &quot;#La Pandilla&quot;. The series, a sitcom named #La Pandilla, was tentatively set to debut on Spanish television during 2017.

<text>The Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a network protocol for encapsulating Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames inside Ethernet frames. It appeared in 1999, in the context of the boom of DSL as the solution for tunneling packets over the DSL connection to the ISP&#x27;s IP network, and from there to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that &quot;Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression.&quot; Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, via the PAP protocol or via CHAP. PAP was dominant in 2007 but service providers have been transitioning to the more secure CHAP, because PAP is a plain-text protocol. Around 2000, PPPoE was also starting to become a replacement method for talking to a modem connected to a computer or router over an Ethernet LAN displacing the older method, which had been USB. This use-case, connecting routers to modems over Ethernet is still extremely common today.

On the customer-premises equipment, PPPoE may be implemented either in a unified residential gateway device that handles both DSL modem and IP routing functions or in the case of a simple DSL modem (without routing support), PPPoE may be handled behind it on a separate Ethernet-only router or even directly on a user&#x27;s computer. (Support for PPPoE is present in most operating systems, ranging from Windows XP, Linux to Mac OS X.) More recently, some GPON-based (instead of DSL-based) residential gateways also use PPPoE, although the status of PPPoE in the GPON standards is marginal though mentioned in ITU-T recommendation G.984.1 &quot;Gigabit-capable passive optical networks (GPON): General characteristics&quot;.

PPPoE was developed by UUNET, Redback Networks (now Ericsson) and RouterWare (now Wind River Systems) and is available as an informational .

In the world of DSL, PPP is commonly understood to be running on top of ATM (as PPPoA) with ATM as the underlying Layer 2 protocol and a version of DSL the Layer 1 protocol, although no such limitation exists in the PPP protocol itself. 

Other usage scenarios are sometimes distinguished by tacking as a suffix another underlying protocol. For example, PPPoEoE, when the transport is Ethernet itself, as in the case of Metro Ethernet networks. (In this notation, the original use of PPPoE would be labeled PPPoEoA, although it should not be confused with PPPoA, which has a different encapsulation of the PPP protocol.)

PPPoE has been described in some books as a &quot;layer 2.5&quot; protocol, in some rudimentary sense similar to MPLS because it can be used to distinguish different IP flows sharing an Ethernet infrastructure, although the lack of PPPoE switches making routing decisions based on PPPoE headers limits applicability in that respect.

==Original rationale==

In late 1998, the DSL service model had yet to reach the large scale that would bring prices down to household levels. ADSL technology had been proposed a decade earlier. Potential equipment vendors and carriers alike recognized that broadband such as cable modem or DSL would eventually replace dialup service, but the hardware (both customer premises and LEC) faced a significant low-quantity cost barrier. Initial estimates for low-quantity deployment of DSL showed costs in the ( in ) range for a DSL modem and /month access fee from the telco, which was well beyond what a home user would pay. Thus the initial focus was on small and home business customers for whom a ~ T1 line (at the time per month) was not economical, but who needed more than dialup or ISDN could deliver. If enough of these customers paved the way, quantities would drive the prices down to where the home-use dialup user might be interested.

===Different usage profile===
The problem was that small business customers had a different usage profile than a home-use dialup user, including:
* Connecting an entire LAN to the Internet;
* Providing services on a local LAN accessible from the far side of the connection;
* Simultaneous access to multiple external data sources, such as a company VPN and a general purpose ISP;
* Continuous usage throughout the workday, or even around the clock.

These requirements didn&#x27;t lend themselves to the connection establishment lag of a dial-up process nor its one-computer-to-one-ISP model, nor even the many-to-one that NAT plus dial-up provided. A new model was required.

PPPoE is used mainly either:
* with PPPoE-speaking Internet DSL services where a PPPoE-speaking modem-router (residential gateway) connects to the DSL service. Here both ISP and modem-router need to speak PPPoE. (Note that in this case, the PPPoE-over-DSL side of things is occasionally referred to as &quot;PPPoEoA&quot;, for ‘PPPoE over ATM’.)
* or when a PPPoE-speaking &quot;DSL modem&quot; is connected to a PPPoE-speaking Ethernet-only router using an Ethernet cable.

===Time to market: simpler is better===
One problem with creating a completely new protocol to fill these needs was time. The equipment was available immediately, as was the service, and developing a whole new protocol stack (Microsoft at the time was advocating fiber-based atm-cells-to-the-desktop, and L2TP was brewing as well, but was not near completion) would take so long to implement that the window of opportunity might slip by. Several decisions were made to simplify implementation and standardization in an effort to deliver a complete solution quickly and at a lower cost.

====Reuse existing software stacks====
PPPoE hoped to merge the widespread Ethernet infrastructure with the ubiquitous PPP, allowing vendors to reuse their existing software and deliver products in the very near term. Essentially all operating systems at the time had a PPP stack, and the design of PPPoE allowed for a simple wrapper/shim to allow the encapsulation of PPP frames inside Ethernet frames.

====Simplify hardware requirements====
Competing WAN technologies (T1, ISDN) required a router on the customer premises. PPPoE used a different Ethernet frame type, which allowed the DSL hardware to function as simply a bridge, passing some frames to the WAN and ignoring the others. Implementation of such a bridge is multiple orders of magnitude simpler than a router.

====Informational RFC====
RFC 2516 was initially released as an informational (rather than standards-track) RFC for the same reason: the adoption period for a standards-track RFC was prohibitively long.

==Modern-day use-cases==

Around 2000, the PPPoE protocol was used either (i) to connect a DSL modem to a computer or router, displacing the earlier method of using USB, or (ii) the PPP+PPPoE trio of protocol headers was used to connect a router to a network node, a protocol converter, somewhat further upstream belonging either to the ISP or to a wholesale long-distance carrier who in turn connects to the ISP’s IP networks and then to the internet.

The first use-case, router-to-modem connection, involving so-called ‘PPPoEoE’ (the PPPoE protocol trio over a physical Ethernet LAN), is still very much in use today for connecting modems to routers if PPP is used.

The second use-case, where the PPPoE protocol trio is used over one or more internet access links reaching upstream to a greater or lesser depth, is, according to consensus, only still used for historical reasons. However since PPP remains popular with some ISPs either as a tunnelling protocol, needed where an ISP uses a wholesale access carrier/reseller or because the features of PPP are desired, or both.

As mentioned earlier, strangely, Ethernet MAC &quot;headers &quot;are in fact sometimes found in use with PPPoE headers even when the Ethernet protocol is not in use, not physically present on an Ethernet network. This seems to serve no purpose apart from adding further unnecessary header overhead, so-called &quot;bloat&quot;. For example in the case, discussed below, of PPPoEoA, where there was no physical Ethernet, only ATM, not only an unnecessary Ethernet MAC layer of header overhead was added but also an additional Ethernet adaptation layer too to make Ethernet fit on top of ATM.

In the second use-case, these additional protocol headers add a serious amount of bloat and so harm performance by a small amount.

In the second use case, the use of PPP+PPPoE+Ethernet MAC extends to a variable distance upstream. It may be confined to the ‘first mile’: a copper twisted pair in ADSL or VDSL2/FTTC involving modems and no further, or it may also be used further upstream extending to a BRAS ‘Broadband Remote Access Server’ or ‘access concentrator’ which may or may not handle login but will certainly be a protocol converter of some sort. In one example case PPPoE extends upstream to and terminates at such a node operated by a wholesale carrier which converts to the L2TP tunnelling protocol which tunnels to the ISP’s IP POPs (‘point of presence’).

==Stages==
The PPPoE has two distinct stages:

===PPPoE discovery===
Since traditional PPP connections are established between two end points over a serial link or over an ATM virtual circuit that has already been established during dial-up, all PPP frames sent on the wire are sure to reach the other end. But Ethernet networks are multi-access where each node in the network can access every other node. An Ethernet frame contains the hardware address of the destination node (MAC address). This helps the frame reach the intended destination.

Hence before exchanging PPP control packets to establish the connection over Ethernet, the MAC addresses of the two end points should be known to each other so that they can be encoded in these control packets. The PPPoE Discovery stage does exactly this. It also helps establish a Session ID that can be used for further exchange of packets, and is also used to indicate termination of the session.

PPPoE discovery packets are carried in Ethernet frames with EtherType set to 0x8863.

===PPP session===
Once the MAC address of the peer is known and a session has been established, the session stage will start. In this stage, chunks of PPP data are encapsulated in PPPoE packets and sent to the other peer. The first session packets will negotiate the PPP session as usual, and after that most session packets will contain PPP data chunks.

Encapsulation is done by prepending the PPP chunks with the 6-byte PPPoE header and carrying them in Ethernet frames with EtherType set to 0x8864.

==PPPoE discovery (PPPoED) ==
Although traditional PPP is a peer-to-peer protocol, PPPoE is inherently a client-server relationship since multiple hosts can connect to a service provider over a single physical connection.

The discovery process consists of four steps between the host computer which acts as the client and the access concentrator at the Internet service provider&#x27;s end acts as the server. They are outlined below. The fifth and last step is the way to close an existing session.

===Client to server: Initiation (PADI)===
PADI stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation.

If a user wants to &quot;dial up&quot; to the Internet using DSL, then their computer first must find the DSL access concentrator (DSL-AC) at the user&#x27;s Internet service provider&#x27;s point of presence (POP). Communication over Ethernet is only possible via MAC addresses. As the computer does not know the MAC address of the DSL-AC, it sends out a PADI packet via an Ethernet broadcast (MAC: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). This PADI packet contains the MAC address of the computer sending it.

Example of a PADI-packet:
&quot;Src.&quot; (=source) holds the MAC address of the computer sending the PADI.
&quot;Dst.&quot; (=destination) is the Ethernet broadcast address. 
The PADI packet can be received by more than one DSL-AC.
Only DSL-AC equipment that can serve the &quot;Service-Name&quot; tag should reply.

===Server to client: Offer (PADO)===
PADO stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Offer.

Once the user&#x27;s computer has sent the PADI packet, the DSL-AC replies with a PADO packet, using the MAC address supplied in the PADI. The PADO packet contains the MAC address of the DSL-AC, its name (e.g. LEIX11-erx for the T-Com DSL-AC in Leipzig) and the name of the service. If more than one POP&#x27;s DSL-AC replies with a PADO packet, the user&#x27;s computer selects the DSL-AC for a particular POP using the supplied name or service.

Here is an example of a PADO packet:
&quot;AC-Name -&gt; String data&quot; holds the AC name, in this case “lpzbr001” (the Arcor DSL-AC in Leipzig)
&quot;Src.&quot; holds the MAC address of the DSL-AC.
The MAC address of the DSL-AC also reveals the manufacturer of the DSL-AC (in this case Nortel Networks).

===Client to server: request (PADR)===
PADR stands for PPPoE active discovery request.

A PADR packet is sent by the user&#x27;s computer to the DSL-AC following receipt of an acceptable PADO packet from the DSL-AC. It confirms acceptance of the offer of a PPPoE connection made by the DSL-AC issuing the PADO packet.

===Server to client: session-confirmation (PADS)===
PADS stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation.

The PADR packet above is confirmed by the DSL-AC with a PADS packet, and a Session ID is given out with it. The connection with the DSL-AC for that POP has now been fully established.

===Either end to other end: termination (PADT)===
PADT stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Termination. This packet terminates the connection to the POP. It may be sent either from the user&#x27;s computer or from the DSL-AC.

==Protocol overhead==
PPPoE is used to connect a PC or a router to a modem via an Ethernet link and it can also be used in Internet access over DSL on a telephone line in the &quot;PPPoE over ATM&quot; (PPPoEoA) over ADSL protocol stack.
PPPoE over ATM has the highest overhead of the popular DSL delivery methods, when compared with for example PPPoA (RFC 2364).

===Use with DSL – PPPoE over ATM (PPPoEoA)===
The amount of overhead added by PPPoEoA on a DSL link depends on the packet size because of (i) the absorbing effect of ATM cell-padding (discussed below), which completely cancels out additional overhead of PPPoEoA in some cases, (ii) PPPoEoA + AAL5 overhead which can cause an entire additional 53-byte ATM cell to be required, and (iii) in the case of IP packets, PPPoE overhead added to packets that are near maximum length (&quot;‘MRU’&quot;) may cause IP fragmentation, which also involves the first two considerations for both of the resulting IP fragments. However ignoring ATM and IP fragmentation for the moment, the protocol header overheads for ATM payload due to choosing PPP + PPPoEoA can be as high as 44 bytes = 2 bytes (for PPP) + 6 (for PPPoE) + 18 (Ethernet MAC, variable) + 10 (RFC 2684 LLC, variable) + 8 (AAL5 CPCS). This overhead is that obtained when using the LLC header option described in RFC 2684 for PPPoEoA.

Compare this with a vastly more header-efficient protocol, PPP + PPPoA RFC 2364 VC-MUX over ATM+DSL, which has a mere 10-byte overhead within the ATM payload. (In fact, just simply 10 bytes = 2 bytes for PPP + zero for RFC 2364 + 8 (AAL5 CPCS).)

This figure of 44 bytes AAL5 payload overhead can be reduced in two ways: (i) by choosing the RFC 2684 option of discarding the 4-byte Ethernet MAC FCS, which reduces the figure of 18 bytes above to 14, and (ii) by using the RFC 2684 VC-MUX option, whose overhead contribution is a mere 2 bytes compared with the 10 byte overhead of the LLC alternative. It turns out that this overhead reduction can be a valuable efficiency improvement. Using VC-MUX instead of LLC, the ATM payload overhead is either 32 bytes (without Ethernet FCS) or 36 bytes (with FCS).

ATM AAL5 requires that an 8-byte-long ‘CPCS’ trailer must always be present at the very end of the final cell (‘right justified’) of the run of ATM cells that make up the AAL5 payload packet. In the LLC case, the total ATM payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 = 44 bytes if the Ethernet MAC FCS is present, or 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no FCS. In the more efficient VC-MUX case the ATM payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 2 + 8 = 36 bytes (with FCS), or 2 + 6 + 14 + 2 + 8 = 32 bytes (no FCS).

However, the true overhead in terms of the total amount of ATM payload data sent is not simply a fixed additional value – it can &quot;only be either zero or 48 bytes&quot; (leaving aside scenario (iii) mentioned earlier, IP fragmentation). This is because ATM cells are fixed length with a payload capacity of 48 bytes, and adding a greater extra amount of AAL5 payload due to additional headers may require one more whole ATM cell to be sent containing the excess. The last one or two ATM cells contain padding bytes as required to ensure that each cell&#x27;s payload is 48 bytes long.

An example: In the case of a 1500-byte IP packet sent over AAL5/ATM with PPPoEoA and RFC2684-LLC, neglecting final cell padding for the moment, one starts with 1500 + 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 (AAL5 CPCS trailer) = 1544 bytes if the Ethernet FCS is present, or else + 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no FCS. To send 1544 bytes over ATM requires 33 48-byte ATM cells, since the available payload capacity of 32 cells × 48 bytes per cell = 1536 bytes is not quite enough. Compare this to the case of PPP + PPPoA which at 1500 + 2 (PPP) + 0 (PPPoA: RFC 2364 VC-MUX) + 8 (CPCS trailer) = 1510 bytes fits in 32 cells. So the real cost of choosing PPPoEoA plus RFC2684-LLC for 1500-byte IP packets is one additional ATM cell per IP packet, a ratio of 33:32. So for 1500 byte packets, PPPoEoA with LLC is ~3.125% slower than PPPoA or optimal choices of PPPoEoA header options.

For some packet lengths the true additional effective DSL overhead due to choosing PPPoEoA compared with PPPoA will be zero if the extra header overhead is not enough to need an additional ATM cell at that particular packet length. For example, a 1492 byte long packet sent with PPP + PPPoEoA using RFC2684-LLC plus FCS gives us a total ATM payload of 1492 + 44 = 1536 bytes = 32 cells exactly, and the overhead in this special case is no greater than if we were using the header-efficient PPPoA protocol, which would require 1492 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 1502 bytes ATM payload = 32 cells also. The case where the packet length is 1492 represents the optimum efficiency for PPPoEoA with RFC2684-LLC in ratio terms, unless even longer packets are allowed.

Using PPPoEoA with the RFC2684 VC-MUX header option is always much more efficient than the LLC option, since the ATM overhead, as mentioned earlier, is only 32 or 36 bytes (depending on whether this is without or with the Ethernet FCS option in PPPoEoA) so that a 1500 byte long packet including all overheads of PPP + PPPoEoA using VC-MUX equates to a total 1500 + 36 = 1536 bytes ATM payload if the FCS is present = 32 ATM cells exactly, thus saving an entire ATM cell.

With short packets, the longer the header overheads the greater the likelihood of generating an additional ATM cell. A worst case might be sending 3 ATM cells instead of two because of a 44 byte header overhead compared with a 10 byte header overhead, so 50% more time taken to transmit the data. For example, a TCP ACK packet over IPv6 is 60 bytes long, and with overhead of 40 or 44 bytes for PPPoEoA + LLC this requires three 48 byte ATM cells’ payloads. As a comparison, PPPoA with overheads of 10 bytes so 70 bytes total fits into two cells. So the extra cost of choosing PPPoE/LLC over PPPoA is 50% extra data sent. PPPoEoA + VC-MUX would be fine though: with 32 or 36 byte overhead, our IP packet still fits in two cells.

In all cases the most efficient option for ATM-based ADSL internet access is to choose PPPoA (RFC2364) VC-MUX. However, if PPPoEoA is required, then the best choice is always to use VC-MUX (as opposed to LLC) with no Ethernet FCS, giving an ATM payload overhead of 32 bytes = 2 bytes (for PPP) + 6 (for PPPoE) + 14 (Ethernet MAC, no FCS) + 2 (RFC 2684 VC-MUX) + 8 (AAL5 CPCS trailer).

Unfortunately some DSL services require the use of wasteful LLC headers with PPPoE and do not allow the more efficient VC-MUX option. In that case, using a reduced packet length, such as enforcing a maximum MTU of 1492 regains efficiency with long packets even with LLC headers and, as mentioned earlier, in that case no extra wasteful ATM cell is generated.

===Overhead on Ethernet===
On an Ethernet LAN, the overhead for PPP + PPPoE is a fixed 2 + 6 = 8 bytes, unless IP fragmentation is produced.

==MTU/MRU==
When a PPPoE-speaking DSL modem sends or receives Ethernet frames containing PPP + PPPoE payload &quot;across the Ethernet link to a router&quot; (or PPPoE-speaking single PC), PPP + PPPoE contributes an additional overhead of 8 bytes = 2 (PPP) + 6 (PPPoE) included within the payload of each Ethernet frame. This added overhead can mean that a reduced maximum length limit (so-called &quot;‘MTU’&quot; or &quot;‘MRU’&quot;) of 1500 − 8 = 1492 bytes is imposed on (for example) IP packets sent or received, as opposed to the usual 1500-byte Ethernet frame payload length limit which applies to standard Ethernet networks. Some devices support RFC 4638, which allows negotiation for the use of non-standard Ethernet frames with a 1508-byte Ethernet payload, sometimes called ‘baby jumbo frames’, so allowing a full 1500-byte PPPoE payload. This capability is advantageous for many users in cases where companies receiving IP packets have (incorrectly) chosen to block all ICMP responses from exiting their network, a bad practice which prevents path MTU discovery from working correctly and which can cause problems for users accessing such networks if they have an MTU of less than 1500 bytes.

==PPPoE-to-PPPoA converting ADSL modem==
The following diagram shows a scenario where an Ethernet-connected ADSL modem acts as a PPPoE-to-PPPoA protocol converter and the service provider offers a PPPoA service and does not understand PPPoE. There is no PPPoEoA in this protocol chain. This is an optimally protocol-efficient design for a separate ADSL modem connected to a router by Ethernet.

In this alternative technology, PPPoE is merely a means of connecting DSL-modems to an Ethernet-only router (again, or to a single host PC). Here it is not concerned with the mechanism employed by an ISP to offer broadband services.

The Draytek Vigor 110, 120 and 130 modems work in this way.

When transmitting packets bound for the Internet, the PPPoE-speaking Ethernet router sends Ethernet frames to the (also PPPoE-speaking) DSL modem. The modem extracts PPP frames from within the received PPPoE frames, and sends the PPP frames onwards to the DSLAM by encapsulating them according to RFC 2364 (PPPoA), thus converting PPPoE into PPPoA.

On the diagram, the area shown as ‘backbone’ could also be ATM on older networks, however its architecture is service provider-dependent. On a more detailed, more service-provider specific diagram there would be additional table cells in this area.

==Quirks==
Since the point-to-point connection established has a MTU lower than that of standard Ethernet (typically 1492 vs Ethernet&#x27;s 1500), it can sometimes cause problems when Path MTU Discovery is defeated by poorly configured firewalls. Although higher MTUs are becoming more common in providers&#x27; networks, usually the workaround is to use TCP MSS (Maximum Segment Size) &quot;clamping&quot; or &quot;rewrite&quot;, whereby the access concentrator rewrites the MSS to ensure TCP peers send smaller datagrams. Although TCP MSS clamping solves the MTU issue for TCP, other protocols such as ICMP and UDP may still be affected.

RFC 4638 allows PPPoE devices to negotiate an MTU of greater than 1492 if the underlying Ethernet layer is capable of jumbo frames.

Some vendors (Cisco and Juniper, for example) distinguish PPPoE[oA] from PPPoEoE (PPPoE over Ethernet), which is PPPoE running directly over Ethernet or other IEEE 802 networks or over Ethernet bridged over ATM, in order to distinguish it from PPPoEoA (PPPoE over ATM), which is PPPoE running over an ATM virtual circuit using RFC 2684 and SNAP encapsulation of PPPoE. (PPPoEoA is not the same as Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA), which doesn&#x27;t use SNAP).

According to a Cisco document &quot;PPPoEoE is a variant of PPPoE where the Layer 2 transport protocol is now Ethernet or 802.1q VLAN instead of ATM. This encapsulation method is generally found in Metro Ethernet or Ethernet digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) environments. The common deployment model is that this encapsulation method is typically found in multi-tenant buildings or hotels. By delivering Ethernet to the subscriber, the available bandwidth is much more abundant and the ease of further service delivery is increased.&quot;

It is possible to find DSL modems, such as the Draytek Vigor 120, where PPPoE is confined to the Ethernet link between a DSL modem and a partnering router, and the ISP does not speak PPPoE at all (but rather PPPoA).

== Post-DSL uses and some alternatives in these contexts ==
A certain method of using PPPoE in conjunction with GPON (which involves creating a VLAN via OMCI) has been patented by ZTE.

PPPoE over GPON is reportedly used by retail service providers such as Internode of Australia&#x27;s National Broadband Network, Orange of France, the Philippines&#x27; Globe Telecom and Italy&#x27;s Aruba FTTH on OpenFiber public GPON networks.

RFC 6934, &quot;Applicability of Access Node Control Mechanism to PON based Broadband Networks&quot;, which argues for the use of Access Node Control Protocol in PONs for—among other things—authenticating subscriber access and managing their IP addresses, and the first author of which is a Verizon employee, excludes PPPoE as an acceptable encapsulation for GPON: &quot;The protocol encapsulation on BPON is based on multi-protocol encapsulation over ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5), defined in [RFC2684]. This covers PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE, defined in [RFC2516]) or IP over Ethernet (IPoE). The protocol encapsulation on GPON is always IPoE.&quot;

The 10G-PON (XG-PON) standard (G.987) provides for 802.1X mutual authentication of the ONU and OLT, besides the OMCI method carried forward from G.984. G.987 also adds support for authenticating other customer-premises equipment beyond the ONU (e.g. in a MDU), although this is limited to Ethernet ports, also handled via 802.1X. (The ONU is supposed snoop EAP-encapsulated RADIUS messages in this scenario and determine if the authentication was successful or not.) There is some modicum support for PPPoE specified in the OMCI standards, but only in terms of the ONU being able to filter and add VLAN tags for traffic based on its encapsulation (and other parameters), which includes PPPoE among the protocols that ONU must be able to discern.

The Broadband Forum&#x27;s TR-200 &quot;Using EPON in the Context of TR-101&quot; (2011), which also pertains to 10G-EPON, says &quot;The OLT and the multiple-subscriber ONU MUST be able to perform the PPPoE Intermediate Agent function, as specified in Section 3.9.2/TR-101.&quot;

A book on Ethernet in the first mile notes that DHCP can obviously be used instead of PPPoE to configure a host for an IP session, although it points out that DHCP is not a complete replacement for PPPoE if some encapsulation is also desired (although VLAN bridges can fulfill this function) and that furthermore, DHCP does not provide (subscriber) authentication, suggesting that IEEE 802.1X is also needed for a &quot;complete solution&quot; without PPPoE. (This book assumes that PPPoE is leveraged for other features of PPP besides encapsulation, including IPCP for host configuration, and PAP or CHAP for authentication.)

There are security reasons to use PPPoE in a (non-DSL/ATM) shared-medium environment, such as power line communication networks, in order to create separate tunnels for each customer.

PPPoE is widely used on WAN lines, including FTTx. Many FTTx residential gateway provided by ISP has integrated the routing functions.

<text>Paul Yaw Boateng, Baron Boateng, (born 14 June 1951) is a British Labour Party politician, a former civil rights lawyer and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brent South from 1987 to 2005, becoming the UK&#x27;s first Black Cabinet Minister in May 2002, when he was appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Following his departure from the House of Commons, he served as the British High Commissioner to South Africa from March 2005 to May 2009. He was introduced as a member of the House of Lords on 1 July 2010.

==Background and early life==
Boateng was born in Hackney, London, of mixed Ghanaian and Scottish heritage; his family later moved to Ghana when Boateng was four years old. His father, Kwaku Boateng, was a lawyer and Cabinet Minister during Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s regime. Boateng had his early education at Ghana International School and attended Accra Academy, a high school in Ghana. Boateng&#x27;s life in Ghana came to an abrupt end after his father went to jail in 1966 following a military coup, which toppled the Ghanaian government. His father was imprisoned without trial for four years. Boateng, then aged 15, and his sister, Rosemary, fled to the UK with their mother.

They settled in Hemel Hempstead, where he attended Apsley Grammar School. He later read law at the University of Bristol, where he resided at Wills Hall and was a member of the Barneys Club. He began his career in civil rights, originally as a solicitor, though he later retrained as a barrister. He worked primarily on social and community cases, starting under renowned civil rights advocate Benedict Birnberg, involving women&#x27;s rights, housing and police complaints, including a period from 1977 to 1981 as the legal advisor for the Scrap Sus Campaign. Boateng was also an executive member of the National Council for Civil Liberties. He represented Cherry Groce, a mother of six who was shot and paralysed by a police officer during a raid on her home, in search of her son. He became a partner at the firm B. M. Birnberg &amp; Co., and as a barrister, he practised at Eight King&#x27;s Bench Walk.

==Political career==
In 1981, Boateng was elected to represent Walthamstow on the Greater London Council, of which Ken Livingstone became leader shortly after the election. As chair of the GLC&#x27;s police committee and vice-chair of its ethnic minorities committee, Boateng advocated greater accountability in the Metropolitan Police and spoke out against racism in relation to their dealings with the African Caribbean and Asian communities.

===Member of Parliament===
He unsuccessfully stood as a parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire West (which included his former home town of Hemel Hempstead) at the 1983 general election. He was elected at the general election of 1987, when he became the MP for Brent South in succession to Laurence Pavitt, being one of the first non-white British MPs elected since the 1920s and the first black MP since Peter McLagan in the 19th century, elected alongside fellow Labour Party Black Sections members Bernie Grant, Diane Abbott and Keith Vaz. During his victory speech, Boateng said: &quot;We can never be free in Brent until South Africa is free too.&quot; He then declared: &quot;Today Brent South, tomorrow Soweto!&quot;

Like many other members of Labour&#x27;s left-wing in the 1980s, he became more moderate under the leadership of Neil Kinnock. For instance, Boateng refused to join the Parliamentary Black Caucus founded by Diane Abbott, Bernie Grant, Keith Vaz and Lord David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead in 1988, which eventually collapsed. Kinnock rewarded Boateng by making him a junior Treasury spokesman in 1989, and then the first Black person to join the front bench as a party spokesperson. Boateng&#x27;s portfolio included economics, industrial strategies and corporate responsibility. In 1992, he became shadow minister for the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, a post he held until the 1997 general election, where he was a strong advocate for increasing pro bono legal services among UK law firms.

===Ministerial career===
With Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in 1997, Boateng became the UK&#x27;s first black government minister as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health, where he was responsible for social services, mental health and disabled people. In that position, he published guidelines to end the denial of adoptions purely on the basis of race.

In 1998, Boateng became a Minister of State at the Home Office and subsequently became Number 2 Minister there. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1999. He earned a reputation for being tough on crime, particularly with regard to aggressive begging on the streets. He also worked with Eric Holder, then United States Deputy Attorney-General, and Louis Freeh, then Director of the FBI, on issues related to international drug trafficking and interdiction.

Boateng&#x27;s portfolio was expanded in 2000, and he became the first Minister for Young People, where his priority was to listen to and be a voice for Britain&#x27;s youth. He launched the Youth, Citizenship and Social Change programme, then the UK&#x27;s largest research project designed to examine social exclusion and promoting citizenship among young people. He also played a leading role in establishing and launching the £450,000,000 Children&#x27;s Fund designed to tackle child poverty. Boateng&#x27;s ministerial colleagues encouraged him to stand as the Labour candidate to be the Mayor of London; however, he ruled himself out and strongly criticised his former GLC colleague Ken Livingstone. Boateng supported the candidacy of Frank Dobson, with whom he had served in the Department of Health.

===Cabinet history===
In 2001, Boateng was made Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted to the position of Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2002, becoming Britain&#x27;s first black cabinet minister. He was quoted as saying: &quot;My colour is part of me but I do not choose to be defined by my colour.&quot; His appointment was greeted with praise by civil rights activists who said that his appointment gave hope to young black youths, and would inspire them to become involved in politics. To commemorate this historic achievement, Parliament commissioned a painting of Boateng by Jonathan Yeo, which is displayed in the collection of 21st Century Parliamentarians.

In his role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Boateng was responsible for finalising the Spending Review of 2002 and leading the Spending Review of 2004. Coordinating with Sir Peter Gershon&#x27;s report, Boateng announced in 2004 the government&#x27;s efficiency programme to save more than £20,000,000,000 in the public sector.

Boateng played a leading role in coordinating the Every Child Matters policy paper, which called for the reform of children&#x27;s services, including greater accountability and coordination among government agencies. He was also a passionate advocate for increasing development aid to Africa and the developing nations. Foreshadowing his future role, he made numerous trips to Africa, meeting with business and government leaders in an effort to highlight the fact that international aid and the Millennium Development Goals were key priorities for the government. Boateng also assisted Gordon Brown in drafting the Africa Commission report, which called for increasing aid to Africa from Western nations to $50 billion a year.

In March 2005, Boateng announced that he would not stand for re-election as an MP at the general election. Dawn Butler was selected by the Constituency Labour Party to replace him and was elected in Brent South.

===High Commissioner to South Africa===
Due to Boateng&#x27;s passion and enthusiasm for the government&#x27;s Africa Commission Report and his associations with African leaders, Tony Blair named him to be the next High Commissioner to South Africa for a term of four years, making him the first black ambassador in British history. Many Africans praised the appointment, stating that it was an important symbolic break from Britain&#x27;s colonial past and saw it as a symbol of Tony Blair&#x27;s commitment to the continent. Boateng is credited with building a close relationship with the African National Congress government in South Africa, and it was reported that he privately worked to bring together bitter rivals in the crisis in Zimbabwe, although he publicly condemned the Zimbabwean government&#x27;s illegal occupation of land from white farmers and the resulting turmoil, which Boateng labelled a &quot;human rights crisis.&quot;
He has also addressed the World Economic Forum on issues concerning Africa. In 2008, he participated in a number of talks with political leaders in the United States to encourage them to support the Doha Development Round trade negotiations that would open Western markets to goods from Africa and other developing countries.

===Appointment to the House of Lords===
On 28 May 2010, it was announced in the 2010 Dissolution Honours that Boateng would become a member of the House of Lords. On 27 June 2010 he was created Baron Boateng, &quot;of Akyem in the Republic of Ghana and of Wembley in the London Borough of Brent&quot; and was introduced to the Lords on 1 July 2010; he was supported by Lord Ouseley and Lord Janner. Boateng&#x27;s maiden speech to the House of Lords highlighted the needs of poor and disadvantaged children, both in rural and urban areas. He called on the Government to examine the impact that the Budget and forthcoming Spending Review would have on children at risk.
In December 2011, he initiated a debate in the House of Lords to discuss cuts in funding to the Citizens Advice Bureau centres, which he vehemently opposed.

He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

==Roles outside politics==

Boateng is an active Methodist and is a lay preacher; he served as a Methodist delegate to the World Council of Churches and as Vice-Moderator of its programme to combat racism. During the South African General Elections of 1994, which ended apartheid, he was a member of the delegation sent by the Association of Western European Parliamentarians Against Apartheid to monitor the elections.

He previously served on the board of the English National Opera (1984 to 1997) and the English Touring Opera (1993 to 1997). In 1993, he wrote the foreword to the HarperCollins collected works edition of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. He has been a commentator and television presenter on programmes including Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot; and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Looking Forward to the Past&quot;.

In 2011, he was a non-executive Director of Aegis Defence Services, a private security, military and risk management company founded by controversial arms dealer Lt Colonel Tim Spicer, who was at the heart of the Sandline affair but had left by 2013.

Boateng was serving on the executive board of the international Christian charity Food for the Hungry, in 2012 and is a trustee of the Planet Earth Institute along with chairman Álvaro Sobrinho.

Boateng is a vice-president of The London Library.

In 2014, he became the chair of charity BookAid International.

In 2019, he became Chancellor of the University of Greenwich.

==Honours and awards==
In 1988, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference honoured Boateng as the recipient of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Award for his contributions to the field of civil rights.

In 2003, Boateng was named on the list of &quot;100 Great Black Britons&quot;.

He received honorary Doctor of Law degrees from West London University on 25 July 2018, Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in 2004 and the University of Bristol in 2007.

Boateng was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services as a trustee of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award.

==Personal life==
Boateng is married to Janet, a former councillor in Lambeth. They have two sons and three daughters. In November 2011, Boateng&#x27;s son Benjamin, then aged 27, was jailed for almost four years for a sex attack on a woman.

<doc id="299690" wikidata="Q617804" url="?curid=299690" title="Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM">
<text>In computer networking, the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] (PPPoA) is a layer 2 data-link protocol typically used to connect domestic broadband modems to ISPs via phone lines. It is used mainly with DOCSIS and DSL carriers, by encapsulating PPP frames in ATM AAL5. Point-to-Point Protocol over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA) is specified by The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 2364.

It offers standard PPP features such as authentication, encryption, and compression. It also supports the encapsulation types: VC-MUX and LLC - see RFC 2364.

If it is used as the connection encapsulation method on an ATM based network it can reduce overhead significantly compared with PPPoEoA – by between 0 and ~3.125% for long packets, depending on the packet length and also on the choices of header options in PPPoEoA – see PPPoEoA protocol overheads. This is because it uses headers that are short so imposes minimal overheads, 2 bytes for PPP and 8 bytes for PPPoA (with the RFC2364 VC-MUX option) = 10 bytes.

It also avoids the issues that PPPoE suffers from, related to sometimes needing to use an IP MTU of 1492 bytes or less, lower than the standard 1500 bytes.

The use of PPPoA over PPPoE is not geographically significant; rather, it varies by the provider&#x27;s preference.

== Configuration ==
Configuration of a PPPoA requires PPP configuration and ATM configuration. These data are generally stored in a cable modem or DSL modem, and may or may not be visible to—or configurable by—an end-user.

PPP configuration generally includes: user credentials, user name and password, and is unique to each user.

ATM configuration includes:

* Virtual channel link (VCL) – virtual path identifier and virtual channel identifier (VPI/VCI), such as 0/32 (analogous to a phone number)
* Modulation (Type): such as G.dmt
* Multiplexing (Method): such as VC-MUX or LLC

ATM configuration can either be performed manually, or it may be hard-coded (or pre-set) into the firmware of a DSL modem provided by the user&#x27;s ISP; it cannot be automatically negotiated.

<text>Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky (, ; born 26 June 1963), sometimes known by his initials MBK, is an exiled Russian businessman, oligarch, and opposition activist, now residing in London. In 2003, Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15billion, and was ranked 16th on &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires. He had worked his way up the Komsomol apparatus, during the Soviet years, and started several businesses during the period of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; in the late 1980s. In 1989, he became Chairman of the Board of Bank Menatep, which he founded. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the mid-1990s, he accumulated considerable wealth by obtaining control of a number of Siberian oil fields unified under the name Yukos, one of the major companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s (a scheme known as &quot;Loans for Shares&quot;).

In 2001, Khodorkovsky founded Open Russia, a reform-minded organization intending to &quot;build and strengthen civil society&quot; in the country. In October 2003, he was arrested by Russian authorities and charged with fraud. The government of President Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. Putin&#x27;s government took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company&#x27;s share price and the evaporation of much of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s wealth. In May 2005, he was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison. In December 2010, while he was still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged with and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering. Khodorkovsky&#x27;s prison sentence was extended to 2014. After Hans-Dietrich Genscher lobbied for his release, Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky, releasing him from jail on 20 December 2013.

There was widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. The trial was criticized abroad for the lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications with the European Court of Human Rights, seeking redress for alleged violations by Russia of his human rights. In response to his first application, which concerned events from 2003 to 2005, the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky. Despite these findings, the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated, but rather &quot;that the charges against him were grounded in &#x27;reasonable suspicion&#x27;&quot;. He was considered to be a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.

On being pardoned by Putin and released from prison at the end of 2013, Khodorkovsky immediately left Russia and was granted residency in Switzerland. At the end of 2013, his personal estate was believed to be worth, as a rough estimate, $100–250 million. At the end of 2014, he was said to be worth about $500 million. In 2015, he moved to London. In December 2016, the Dublin District Court unfroze $100m of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s assets that had been held in the Republic of Ireland.

In 2014, Khodorkovsky re-launched Open Russia to promote several reforms to Russian civil society, including free and fair elections, political education, protection of journalists and activists, endorsing the rule of law, and ensuring media independence. He was described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as &quot;the Kremlin&#x27;s leading critic-in-exile&quot;.

==Early years and entrepreneurship in Soviet Union==
===Early life and education===
Khodorkovsky&#x27;s parents, Boris and Marina Khodorkovsky, were engineers at a factory making measuring instruments in Moscow. Khodorkovsky&#x27;s father was Jewish, and his mother was Orthodox Christian. They were both opponents of communism, though they kept this from their son, who was born in 1963. Having experienced a rise in state anti-Semitism and the death of Stalin, the Khodorkovskys were part of a generation of well-educated Soviets who were silently supportive of dissidents.

The family were moderately well off, living in a two-room flat in a concrete block in the suburbs of Moscow. Masha Gessen wrote that they faced a dilemma raising Mikhail: “Speak your mind about the Soviet Union and risk making your child miserable, with the constant need for doublethink and doublespeak, or try to raise a contented conformist. They chose the second path, with results that far exceeded their expectations. Mikhail became a fervent Communist and Soviet patriot, a member of a species that had seemed all but extinct.&quot;

The young Khodorkovsky was ambitious and received excellent grades. He became deputy head of Komsomol (the Communist Youth League) at his university, the D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, from which he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1986. While in college, Khodorkovsky married a fellow student, Yelena. They had a son, Pavel. In 1986, he met an 18-year-old, Inna, a student at the Mendeleev Institute who was a colleague of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s at the Komsomol organization. He courted her and slept in his car until she took him in. They had a daughter and twin sons. He and his first wife remained on good terms, and she would later take an active part in the campaign for his release from prison.

===First business activities===
After his graduation in 1986, Khodorkovsky began to work full-time for the Komsomol, which was a typical way of entering upon a Soviet political career. &quot;After several years of working mostly to collect Komsomol dues from fellow students&quot;, noted Gessen, &quot;he could expect to be appointed to a junior position in city management someplace far from the capital.&quot;

But instead of following this path, he exploited &quot;quasi-official and often extra-legal business opportunities&quot; and began to make a business career for himself. With partners from Komsomol, and technically operating under its authority, Khodorkovsky opened his first business in 1986, a private café. The enterprise was made possible by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s programme of perestroika and glasnost.

The introduction of perestroika enabled Khodorkovsky to use his connections within the communist structures to gain a foothold in the developing free market. With the help of some powerful people, he started his business activities under the cover of Komsomol. Friendship with another Komsomol leader, Alexey Golubovich, had a significant impact on his growing success, since Golubovich&#x27;s parents held top positions in Gosbank, the State Bank of the USSR. Among the businesses in which Khodorkovsky &quot;tried his hand&quot; were &quot;importing personal computers and, according to some sources, counterfeit alcohol.&quot; In addition, he &quot;ventured into finance, devising ways to squeeze cash out of the Soviet planned-economy behemoth.&quot;

===Menatep===

In 1987, Khodorkovsky and his partners opened a Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of the Youth. In addition to importing and reselling computers, the &quot;scientific&quot; center was involved in trading a wide range of other products. The opening of the center eventually made possible the founding of Bank Menatep.

Employees of the Bank of New York, which was closely associated with Bruce Rappaport, worked very closely with his Menatep helping Menatep to list its stock in the United States. Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovskaya, who is married to a former senior executive at Bank Menatep Konstantin Kagalovsky, supervised the Bank of New York&#x27;s Eastern European business beginning in 1992. She had been a banker with Irving Trust since 1986 which was acquired by the Bank of New York in 1988. Vladimir Kirillovich Golitsyn or &quot;Mickey&quot; Galitzine had previously headed the Eastern European business at the Bank of New York and travelled for the first time to Russia in 1990.

He and his partners obtained a banking license, supposedly from money made from selling secondhand computers, to create Bank Menatep in 1989. As one of Russia&#x27;s first privately owned banks, Menatep expanded quickly, by using most of the deposits raised to finance Khodorkovsky&#x27;s import-export operations, which is a questionable 
practice in itself. Moreover, the government granted Bank Menatep the right to manage funds allocated for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Khodorkovsky said:

Many years later I talked with people and asked them, why didn&#x27;t you start doing the same thing? Why didn&#x27;t you go into it? Because any head of an institute had more possibilities than I had, by an order of magnitude. They explained that they had all gone through the period when the same system was allowed. And then, at best, people were unable to succeed in their career and, at worst, found themselves in jail. They were all sure that would be the case this time, and that is why they did not go into it. And I...I did not remember this! I was too young! And I went for it.&quot;

It was during this period that Khodorkovsky acquired the Yukos oil company for about $300 million through a rigged auction. Khodorkovsky subsequently went on a campaign to raise investment funds abroad, borrowing hundreds of millions. When the 1998 financial crisis struck Russia, Khodorkovsky defaulted on some of his foreign debt and took his Yukos shares offshore to protect them from creditors.

===Yeltsin adviser===
Khodorkovsky also served as an economic adviser to the first government of Boris Yeltsin. &quot;During the failed 1991 coup by Communist hard-liners&quot;, Gessen wrote, &quot;he was on the barricades in front of Moscow&#x27;s White House, helping to defend the government.&quot; Shortly thereafter, having lost his faith in Communism, he and his business associate Leonid Nevzlin wrote a &quot;capitalist manifesto&quot; entitled &quot;The Man with the Ruble&quot;, which stated in part: &quot;It is time to stop living according to Lenin! ... Our guiding light is Profit, acquired in a strictly legal way. Our Lord is His Majesty, Money, for it is only He who can lead us to wealth as the norm in life.&quot;

===Yukos acquisition===
In 1992, Khodorkovsky was appointed chairman of the Investment Promotion Fund of the fuel and power industry. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy of Russia in March 1993. In 1996, Menatep acquired a major Russian oil producer, Yukos, which had debts exceeding $3.5 billion, for $309 million.

In the 1990s, noted Gessen, &quot;Khodorkovsky made millions in currency trading. He also bought up privatization vouchers—documents distributed to every Russian citizen and entitling them to a share of the national wealth—which many Russians were happy to unload at a discount for ready cash. Khodorkovsky eventually acquired controlling stakes in some 30 companies. When Russia staged its greatest property giveaway ever, in 1995, Khodorkovsky was poised to take advantage of that too.&quot; As Gessen explained, the Russian government, after the fall of Communism, &quot;still nominally controlled Russia&#x27;s largest companies, though they had been variously re-structured, abandoned, or looted by their own executives.&quot; A dozen men, the &quot;new oligarchs&quot;, including Khodorkovsky, hit upon the stratagem of lending the government money against collateral consisting of blocks of stock that amounted to controlling interests in those companies. The oligarchs and government both knew that the government would eventually default and that the firms would thus pass into the oligarchs&#x27; hands. &quot;By this maneuver&quot;, wrote Gessen, &quot;the Yeltsin administration privatized oil, gas, minerals, and other enterprises without parliamentary approval.&quot; This was how Khodorkovsky came to own Yukos.

When he came into possession of Yukos, a conglomerate consisting of over 20 firms, most of them were &quot;in terrible condition&quot;, and he enjoyed the job of turning them into well-functioning units. According to Gellin, Khodorkovsky was &quot;the most reticent among the oligarchs&quot;, choosing not to &quot;buy yachts or villas on the Côte d’Azur&quot; or to become a fixture of &quot;the Moscow playboy scene&quot;. To be sure, he did buy &quot;a gated compound of seven houses on 50 forested acres about half an hour outside Moscow&quot; in the late 1990s, calling it Apple Orchard and housing Yukos&#x27;s leading executives, who lived together as &quot;one large happy family&quot;. His social life consisted mostly of &quot;Barbecuing for fellow Yukos managers&quot;. At nights he would stay up and &quot;read until two&quot;. He later wrote that during this period &quot;I saw business as a game. ... It was a game in which you wanted to win but losing was also an option. It was a game in which hundreds of thousands of people came to work in the morning to play with me.&quot;

Nevzlin told Gessen about a time when Khodorkovsky was in Poland on business and the Soviet economic-crimes unit began harassing Nevzlin, who feared arrest under Soviet-era laws. He found the situation &quot;terrifying&quot;, but when Khodorkovsky returned from Poland he said, &quot;Let me go home, take a shower, get some sleep, and we&#x27;ll talk about it tomorrow morning.&quot; Nevzlin told Gessen: &quot;There was just no way to shake him, ever.&quot; Nevzlin described Khodorkovsky as a &quot;data addict&quot;, a man with &quot;an iron will,&quot; and &quot;someone dependent on human stimulus for information and ideas.&quot; Although Khodorkovsky &quot;has strong emotions,&quot; Nevzlin said, he is capable of turning them off.

===European Union Bank in Antigua===
For one week in 1994, he was the director of an online internet bank known as the European Union Bank based in Antigua after which it collapsed. Numerous banking regulators claimed it was a scam.

===Bank failure===
By 1998, Khodorkovsky had built an import-export business with an annual turnover of 80 million rubles (about US$10 million). In the 1998 Russian crash, however, his bank went under and Yukos had serious problems owing to a drop in the price of oil. Realizing that &quot;business could no longer be just a game&quot; and that &quot;capitalism could make people not only rich and happy but also poor and powerless&quot;, he &quot;swore off his absolute faith in wealth just as he had sworn off his absolute faith in Communism.&quot;

===Early philanthropic activities===

After the price of oil began to rise again, he established the Open Russia Foundation, in 2001. It was based at Somerset House in London with Henry Kissinger as one of its trustees. The Foundation&#x27;s mission statement declared: &quot;The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between the people of Russia and the rest of the world.&quot; The following year it had its United States launch in Washington, D.C.

In addition to founding Open Russia, Khodorkovsky &quot;funded Internet cafés in the provinces, to get people to talk to one another. He funded training sessions for journalists all over the country. [In 1994] He established a boarding school for disadvantaged children and pulled his own parents out of retirement to run it. By some estimates, he was supporting half of all non-governmental organizations in Russia, by others, he was funding 80 percent of them. In 2003, Yukos pledged $100 million over 10 years to the Russian State Humanities University, the best liberal-arts school in the country—the first time a private company had contributed a significant amount of money to a Russian educational institution.&quot;

He also founded internet-training centres for teachers, a forum for the discussion by journalists of reform and democracy, and foundations which finance archaeological digs, cultural exchanges, summer camps for children and a boarding school for orphans.

===Merger with Sibneft===
In April 2003, Khodorkovsky announced that Yukos would merge with Sibneft, creating an oil company with reserves equal to those of Western petroleum multinationals. Khodorkovsky had been reported to be involved in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco to sell one or the other of them a large stake in Yukos. Sibneft was created in 1995, at the suggestion of Boris Berezovsky, comprising some of the most valuable assets of a state-owned oil company. In a controversial auction process, Berezovsky acquired 50% of the company at what most agree was a very low price.

When Berezovsky had a confrontation with Putin, and felt compelled to leave Russia for London (where he was granted asylum), he assigned his shares in Sibneft to Roman Abramovich. Abramovich subsequently agreed to the merger. With 19.5 billion barrels (3 km3) of oil and gas, the merged entity would have owned the second-largest oil and gas reserves in the world after ExxonMobil and would have been the fourth largest in the world in terms of production, pumping 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) of crude a day. The combination of the companies closed in October 2003, just prior to the arrest of Khodorkovsky, but through a series of questionable legal maneuvers, the former Sibneft shareholders were able to get the transaction negated.

===2003: Richest man in Russia===
Khodorkovsky hired McKinsey &amp; Company to reform Yukos&#x27;s management structure, and Pricewaterhouse to establish an accounting system. Thanks partly to the rising oil prices, partly to modernized operations, and partly to its &quot;new transparency&quot;, Yukos thrived. &quot;By 2003, Khodorkovsky was the richest man in Russia, and potentially on his way to becoming the richest man in the world. In 2004, Forbes placed him 16th on its list of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people, with a fortune estimated at $16 billion.&quot;

==Criminal charges and incarceration==
===2003 arrest===
In early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky&#x27;s partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994. The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission&#x27;s approval of its merger with Sibneft.

On the morning of 25 October 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at Novosibirsk airport. He was taken to Moscow and charged with fraud, tax evasion, and other economic crimes. Gessen describes the trial as a &quot;travesty&quot; and &quot;a Kafka-esque procedure&quot;, with the government spending months &quot;on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.&quot; In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning. Pavel Ivlev, a tax lawyer who went along as their attorney, later explained that officials had illegally interrogated him and threatened to arrest him. After leaving the prosecutor&#x27;s office, he immediately fled the country. He and his family ended up settling in the U.S.

The arrest was preceded by the publication of an analytical report titled &quot;An oligarchic coup is being prepared in Russia&quot;, prepared under the guidance of political strategist Stanislav Belkovsky, in which the Yukos leadership was accused of preparing a &quot;plot of oligarchs&quot; to overthrow Putin and establish a presidential-parliamentary republic in Russia instead of a presidential one. It was for this reason that Khodorkovsky and his colleagues allegedly sponsored several political parties at once - Yabloko, the Union of Right Forces, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (although they refused to allocate money to United Russia), maintained close ties with journalists from various publications, and financed the annual Energy Prize and many educational programs.

===Reactions in Russia and abroad===
Initially news of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s arrest had a significant effect on the share price of Yukos. The Moscow stock market was closed for the first time ever for an hour to ensure stable trading as prices collapsed. Russia&#x27;s currency, the ruble, was also hit as some foreign investors questioned the stability of the Russian market. Media reaction in Moscow was almost universally negative in blanket coverage, some of the more enthusiastic pro-business press discussed the end of capitalism, while even the government-owned press criticised the &quot;absurd&quot; method of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s arrest.

Yukos moved quickly to replace Khodorkovsky with a Russian-born U.S. citizen, Simon Kukes. Kukes, who became the CEO of Yukos, was already an experienced oil executive.

The U.S. State Department said Khodorkovsky&#x27;s arrest &quot;raised a number of concerns over the arbitrary use of the judicial system&quot; and was likely to be very damaging to foreign investment in Russia, as it appeared there were &quot;selective&quot; prosecutions occurring against Yukos officials but not against others.

A week after the arrest, the Prosecutor-General froze Khodorkovsky&#x27;s shares in Yukos to prevent Khodorkovsky from selling his shares although he retained all the shares&#x27; voting rights and received dividends. In 2003, Khodorkovsky&#x27;s shares in Yukos passed to Jacob Rothschild under a deal that they had concluded prior to Khodorkovsky&#x27;s arrest.

On 28 June 2005, the &quot;Izvestia&quot; newspaper published as an advertisement a &quot;letter of the fifty&quot; - &quot;Appeal of cultural figures, scientists, members of the public in connection with the verdict passed on the former leaders of the Yukos Oil Company&quot;, expressing support for the guilty verdict. The authors of the letter expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that &quot;the voices of those who doubt the fairness of the decisions made sounded with renewed vigor&quot;, and the discussion of the verdict, in their opinion, &quot;has the character of discrediting the entire judicial system, the state, and society and calls into question the foundations of law and order in the country&quot;. On 11 September 2009, four years after the publication of the &quot;letter of the fifty&quot;, the famous figure skater Irina Rodnina stated that she did not put her signature under this letter and condemned the very form of such an appeal. Another of the signatories, Anastasia Volochkova, on 2 February 2011, in an interview with Radio Liberty, explained her signature as a misunderstanding and that United Russia misled her about the letter&#x27;s content. As part of the same Radio Liberty project, on 4 February 2011, Alexander Buinov expressed regret about his signature under this letter: &quot;I have a feeling that I got into trouble then. In any case, there are insane acts that I am ashamed of ... If the interview with Radio Liberty is enough for my abdication, I am ready to say it now.&quot;

===The first trial, 2004–2005===
The charges against Khodorkovsky and his associates were that, in 1994, while chairman of Menatep, he &quot;created an organized group of individuals with the intention of taking control of the shares in Russian companies during the privatisation process through deceit.&quot; This was with particular reference to supposedly &quot;illegal actions&quot; he had taken in the privatisation of the State-owned mining and fertiliser company Apatit.

Khodorkovsky&#x27;s longtime business partner, Platon Lebedev, was arrested on 2 July 2003, and they were put on trial together. A few weeks later, Yukos&#x27;s security head Alexei Pichugin was arrested and became the subject of a separate prosecution. Leonid Nevzlin of Menatep reportedly suggested at this moment that he and Khodorkovsky should

&quot;leave the country and try to bargain from a position of freedom. We should take our money out and start a new business and a new life.&quot;

Nevzlin did just that and moved to Israel. Khodorkovsky remained in Russia. &quot;In his value system, fleeing the country once Lebedev was in jail would have been immoral&quot;, Gessen wrote, &quot;regardless of whether he could do anything to help his friend.&quot; Instead, Khodorkovsky began to give speeches arguing that Russia must modernize socially and espouse an open and transparent economy, promoting technology over purely natural resources.

Khodorkovsky was defended in court by an experienced team led by Yury Schmidt and including Karinna Moskalenko. The prosecutors claimed they were operating independently of the presidential administration. The Prosecutor-General, Vladimir Ustinov, was appointed by the former President Boris Yeltsin. He was not seen as particularly close to Putin, who had once tried to remove him. However, he was politically ambitious and prosecuting Russia&#x27;s most prominent and successful tycoon was perceived as a boost to his political career and intended candidacy for the Duma.

The first Khodorkovsky-Lebedev trial lasted 10 months. There were few defense witnesses, noted Gessen, &quot;not only because the court turned down most of its motions but also because the prosecution&#x27;s case seemed so flimsy.&quot; Also, it was perceived as risky to testify for the defense. &quot;Ten people affiliated with Yukos, including two lawyers, had already been arrested. Nine more had evaded arrest only by fleeing the country.&quot;

Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were both declared guilty and sentenced to nine years in penal colonies. The verdict of the trial, repeating the prosecutors&#x27; indictments almost verbatim, was 662 pages long. As is customary in Russian trials, the judges read the verdict aloud, beginning on 16 May 2005 and finishing on 31 May. Khodorkovsky&#x27;s lawyers alleged that it was read as slowly as possible to minimize public attention.

====Independent support====
Khodorkovsky received support from independent third parties who believed that he was a victim of a politicized judicial system. On 29 November 2004, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights published a report, which concluded, &quot;the circumstances of the arrest and prosecution of leading Yukos executives suggest that the interest of the State&#x27;s action in these cases goes beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice, to include such elements as to weaken an outspoken political opponent, to intimidate other wealthy individuals and to regain control of strategic economic assets.&quot;

In addition, Khodorkovsky has received admiration and support from members of the UK parliament who have noted the decline of human rights in Russia.

In June 2009, the Council of Europe published a report which criticized the Russian government&#x27;s handling of the Yukos case, entitled &quot;Allegations of Politically Motivated Abuses of the Criminal Justice System in Council of Europe Member States&quot;:

&quot;The Yukos affair epitomises this authoritarian abuse of the system. I wish to recall here the excellent work done by Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, in her two reports on this subject. I do not intend to comment on the ins and outs of this case which saw Yukos, a privately owned oil company, made bankrupt and broken up for the benefit of the state owned company Rosneft. The assets were bought at auction by a rather obscure financial group, Baikalfinansgroup, for almost €7 billion. It is still not known who is behind this financial group. A number of experts believe that the state-owned company Gazprom had a hand in the matter. The former heads of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, were sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment for fraud and tax evasion. Vasiliy Aleksanyan, former vice-chairman of the company, who is suffering from Aids, was released on bail in January 2009 after being held in inhuman conditions condemned by the European Court of Human Rights.3 Lastly, Svetlana Bakhmina, deputy head of Yukos&#x27;s legal department, who was sentenced in 2005 to six and a half years&#x27; imprisonment for tax fraud, saw her application for early release turned down in October 2008, even though she had served half of her sentence, had expressed &quot;remorse&quot; and was seven months pregnant. Thanks to the support of thousands of people around the world and the personal intervention of the United States President, George W. Bush, she was released in April 2009 after giving birth to a girl on 28 November 2008.&quot;

Statements of support for Khodorkovsky and criticism of the state&#x27;s persecution have been passed by the Italian Parliament, the German Bundestag, and the U.S. House of Representatives, among many other official bodies.

In June 2010, Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and human rights activist, began a campaign to raise awareness of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s trial and advocate for his release.

In November 2010, Amnesty International Germany began a petition campaign demanding that President Medvedev get an independent review of all criminal charges against Khodorkovsky, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights. On 24 May 2011, Amnesty International criticized Lebedev and Khodorkovsky&#x27;s second trial, named them prisoners of conscience, and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences.

A two-hour documentary about his plight was released in 2011.

Yelena Bonner, the widow of Andrei Sakharov, never stopped defending Khodorkhovsky: &quot;I think that any person becomes a political prisoner if the law is applied to him selectively, and this is an absolutely clear case. This is a glaringly lawless action.&quot;

A cartoonist present at the trial created a cartoon series depicting the events. These cartoons compared Khodorkovsky&#x27;s trial to the trial of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;. As of August 2015, these cartoons are on display at the Dox Gallery of Prague.

===In prison===
On 30 May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in a medium security prison. At the time, he was detained at Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in Moscow. On 1 August 2005, a political essay written by Khodorkovsky in his prison cell, titled &quot;Left Turn&quot;, was published in &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, calling for a turn to a more socially responsible state. He stated:
&quot;The next Russian administration will have to include the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Motherland Party, or the historical successors to these parties. The left-wing liberals, including Yabloko, and right-wing Ryzhkov, Khakamada and others should decide whether to join the broad social-democratic coalition or to remain grumpy and without relevance on the political sidelines. In my opinion, they have to join because only the broadest composition of a coalition in which liberal-socialist (social-democratic) views will play the key role can save us from the emergence, in the process of this turn to the left turn, from a new ultra-authoritarian regime. The new Russian authorities will have to address a left-wing agenda and meet an irrepressible demand by the people for justice. This will mean in the first instance the problems of legalizing privatization and restoring paternalistic programs and approaches in several areas.&quot;

On 19 August 2005, Khodorkovsky announced that he was on a hunger strike in protest against his friend and associate Platon Lebedev&#x27;s placement in the &quot;punishment cell&quot; of the jail. According to Khodorkovsky, Lebedev had diabetes mellitus and heart problems, and keeping him in the punishment cell would be equivalent to murder.

On 31 August 2005, he announced that he would run for parliament. This initiative was made possible by the legal loophole: a convicted felon cannot vote or stand for a parliament, but if his case is lodged with the Court of Appeal he still enjoys all electoral rights. Usually it takes around a year for an appeal to make its way through the Appeal Court, so there should have been enough time for Khodorkovsky to be elected. For a member of Russian parliament to be imprisoned, the parliament needs to vote to lift his or her immunity. Thus he had a hope of avoiding prosecution. But the Court of Appeal, unusually, took only a couple of weeks to process Khodorkovsky&#x27;s appeal, reducing his sentence by one year and invalidating any electoral plans on his part until the end of his sentence.

As reported on 20 October 2005, Khodorkovsky was delivered to the labor camp YaG-14/10 (Исправительное учреждение общего режима ЯГ-14/10) in the town of Krasnokamensk in Zabaykalsky Krai. The labor camp is adjacent to a uranium mine, which it once served. Khodorkovsky was put to work in the colony&#x27;s mitten factory. He slept in a barracks and often spent his days in a cold solitary cell in retribution for his supposed violating of various rules.

The second part of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s essay &quot;Left Turn&quot; was published in &quot;Kommersant&quot; on 11 November 2005, in which he expressed social democratic views.

On 13 April 2006, Khodorkovsky was attacked by prison inmate Alexander Kuchma while he was asleep after a heated conversation. Kuchma cut Khodorkovsky&#x27;s face with a knife and said that it was a response to sexual advances by the businessman. Western media accused the Russian authorities of trying to play down the incident. In January 2009, the same prisoner filed a lawsuit for 500,000 rubles (about $15,000) against Khodorkovsky, accusing him of homosexual harassment. Kuchma said in an interview that he was compelled to attack Khodorkovsky by two officers, beaten and threatened with death to commit the attack. In 2011, Kuchma admitted that he had been told to attack Khodorkovsky &quot;by unknown persons who had come to the prison colony and beaten and threatened him.&quot;

On 5 February 2007, new charges of embezzlement and money laundering were brought against both Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. Khodorkovsky&#x27;s supporters pointed out that the charges came just months before Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were to become eligible for parole, as well as a year before the next Russian presidential election.

On 28 January 2008, Khodorkovsky began a hunger strike to help his associate Vasily Aleksanyan, who is ill and was held in jail and who was denied the medical treatment he needed. Aleksanyan was transferred from a pre-trial prison to an oncological hospital on 8 February 2008, after which Khodorkovsky called off his strike.

&quot;No single cause has done more than Khodorkovsky&#x27;s to inspire Russian speakers everywhere&quot;, Gessen wrote in 2012. &quot;Three of Russia&#x27;s best-selling writers have published their correspondence with Khodorkovsky; composers have dedicated symphonies to him, a dozen artists attended his trial and put together an exhibition of courtroom drawings.&quot; Gessen noted that &quot;a group of Soviet-born classical musicians traveled to Strasbourg to mount a concert in honor of Khodorkovsky.&quot; While Khodorkovsky was imprisoned, Arvo Pärt, the Estonian composer, wrote his Symphony no. 4, and dedicated it to him. The symphony had its premiere on 10 January 2009 in Los Angeles at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.

Khodorkovsky spent more than half of his prison time in the Matrosskaya Tishina Detention Facility in Moscow, where, according to Gessen, &quot;living conditions are far more punishing than those in a distant penal colony.&quot; Yet, Gessen noted, he &quot;declined to describe&quot; in any detail the conditions under which he was imprisoned, &quot;arguing that he is no different from other inmates.&quot;

In prison, Khodorkovsky announced that he would research and write a PhD dissertation on the topic of Russian oil policy. The third part of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s essay/thesis &quot;Left Turn&quot; with the subheading &quot;Global Perestroika&quot; was published in &quot;Vedomosti&quot; on 7 November 2008. In it he stated:

&quot;Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the US presidential elections is not simply the latest change of power in one individual country, albeit a superpower. We are standing on the threshold of a change in the paradigm of world development. The era whose foundations were laid by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher three decades ago is ending. Unconditionally including myself in that part of society that has liberal views, I see: ahead – is a Turn to the Left.&quot;

In May 2010, Khodorkovsky went on a two-day hunger-strike to protest what he said was a violation of the recent law against imprisonment of persons accused of financial crimes. The law was pushed by President Medvedev after the death of Sergei Magnitsky who died in pre-trial detention in a Moscow prison in 2009.

On appeal, Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev&#x27;s sentences were reduced from 11 years to 10 years and 10 months meaning they could be released in August 2014 and May 2014, respectively. Khodorkovsky&#x27;s appeal read: &quot;In this case, the usual mantra that everything is legal and well-grounded just won&#x27;t do.&quot;

He wrote a book, &quot;My Fellow Prisoners&quot;, detailing his time incarcerated. Khodorkovsky has spoken about how his incarceration has changed his &quot;value system&quot; in life, and that there are now, for an example, more important things for him than business pursuits.

===Political transformation===

&quot;The Economist&quot; asserted in April 2010 that after six years in prison, Khodorkovsky had politically transformed from an oligarch into a political prisoner and freedom fighter: &quot;He speaks with the authority of a chief executive of what was once Russia&#x27;s largest oil company. He explains how Yukos and Russia&#x27;s oil industry functioned, but he goes beyond business matters. What he is defending is not his long-lost business, but his human rights. The transformation of Mr. Khodorkovsky from a ruthless oligarch, operating in a virtually lawless climate, into a political prisoner and freedom fighter is one of the more intriguing tales in post-communist Russia.&quot;

Khodorkovsky asserts his political transformation in many of his own writings from prison. On 26 October 2009, he published a response to Dmitri Medvedev&#x27;s &quot;Forward, Russia!&quot; article in &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, arguing that &quot;authoritarianism in its current Russian form does not meet many key humanitarian requirements customary for any country that wishes to consider itself modern and European.&quot;

In a 28 January 2010, op-ed for the&quot; New York Times&quot; and &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, Khodorkovsky argued that &quot;Russia must make a historic choice. Either we turn back from the dead end toward which we have been heading in recent years – and we do it soon – or else we continue in this direction and Russia in its current form simply ceases to exist.&quot;

On 3 March 2010, Khodorkovsky published an article in &quot;Nezavisimaya Gazeta&quot; about the &quot;conveyor belt&quot; of Russian justice. In this article, he states that the &quot;siloviki conveyor belt, which has undermined justice is truly the gravedigger of modern Russian statehood. Because it turns many thousands of the country&#x27;s most active, sensible and independent citizens against this statehood – with enviable regularity.&quot;

In conclusion, &quot;The Economist&quot; opined, &quot;any talk by the Kremlin of the rule of law or about modernisation will be puffery so long as Mr Khodorkovsky remains in jail.&quot;

===Second trial, 2009–2010===
====Charges====
Khodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009.

Prosecutors filed new charges against Khodorkovsky, alleging that he stole 350 million tons of oil, charges which &quot;Kommersant&quot; described as &quot;Compared with the previous version, only stylistic inaccuracy has been improved, and some of the paragraphs have been swapped.&quot; Others pointed out that the new charges were impossible given that he was previously convicted on tax evasion of the same allegedly stolen oil. According to Khodorkovsky&#x27;s lawyer Karinna Moskalenko, &quot;The position of the prosecutors is also self-contradictory. ... Khodorkovsky is now serving a sentence for tax evasion, and if they are asserting that he stole all the oil his company produced, what did he go to prison for the first time if there was nothing to be taxed?&quot;

&quot;If the first set of charges was thin, the second was absurd&quot;, Gessen later wrote. &quot;Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were now accused of having stolen all the oil that Yukos had produced in the years 1998 to 2003.&quot; At the end of the trial, in December 2010, both defendants were sentenced to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment. Gessen cited leading Russian lawyers as saying that Russian laws had been &quot;passed specifically to enable [Khodorkovsky&#x27;s] persecution, or adjusted retroactively to sustain it.&quot; Many former Yukos employees were arrested and imprisoned and were therefore unemployable after their release, and Khodorkovsky &quot;tried to provide financial support to those who have not found a way to make a living.&quot;

Khodorkovsky delivered his own summation at his second trial. He spoke of his countrymen&#x27;s hopes &quot;that Russia will finally become a land of freedom and the law, and the law will be more important than the bureaucrats&quot;, a country where &quot;human rights will no longer be contingent on the whim of the czar, whether he be kind or mean. Where the government will be accountable to the people and the courts will be accountable only to God and the law.&quot; He said, &quot;I am not an ideal man, far from it. But I am a man of ideas. Like anyone, I have a hard time living in prison and I do not want to die here. But I will, if I need to, without a second thought.&quot;

During a visit to Moscow in July 2009, President Barack Obama said: &quot;it does seem odd to me that these new charges, which appear to be a repackaging of the old charges, should be surfacing now, years after these two individuals have been in prison and as they become eligible for parole.&quot;

The verdict was originally scheduled for 15 December, but was delayed without explanation until 27 December. Just a few days before the verdict was read by the judge before the court, Vladimir Putin made public comments with regard to his opinion of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s guilt, saying &quot;a thief should sit in jail&quot;.

On 14 January 2020, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia violated Article 6, Article 7 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

====Judicial controversy====
On 14 February 2011, Natalya Vasilyeva, an assistant to Judge Viktor Danilkin, said that the judge did not write the verdict, and had read it against his will. Essentially, Natalya Vasilyeva said the judge&#x27;s verdict was &quot;brought from the Moscow City Court&quot;.

In her statement she also noted that &quot;everyone in the judicial community understands perfectly that this is a rigged case, a fixed trial&quot;. On 24 February Vasilyeva underwent a polygraph test, which indicated that she likely believes that Danilkin acted under pressure. Judge Danilkin responded that &quot;the assertion by Natalya Vasilyeva was nothing more than slander&quot;.

===Appeal and Amnesty International statement===
On 24 May 2011, Khodorkovsky&#x27;s appeal hearing was held, and Judge Danilkin rejected the challenge. Following the rejection of the appeal, the human rights group Amnesty International declared Khodorkovsky and Lebedev as &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot;, remarking in a statement that &quot;Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev&#x27;s first convictions there can no longer be any doubt that their second trial was deeply flawed and politically motivated.&quot; On 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and all political prisoners in Russia.

In June 2011, Khodorkovsky was sent to prison colony No. 7 of Segezha, in the northern region of Karelia near the Finnish border.

===Release===

According to his official site, Khodorkovsky would have been eligible for early release, but an alleged conspiracy involving jail guards and a cellmate resulted in a statement that he had violated one of the prison rules. This was sufficient for him to forfeit his rights, once the statement was logged in his file.

It was predicted that he might be released by the middle of 2011, although Khodorkovsky was found guilty on 27 December 2010 of fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering, which had the potential of leading to a new sentence of up to 22.5 years. &quot;The second as well as the first case were organized by Igor Sechin&quot;, he said in an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from a remand prison in the Siberian city of Chita, east of Moscow.

On 22 August 2008, he was denied parole by Judge Igor Faliliyev, at the Ingodinsky district court in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai. The basis for this was in part because Khodorkovsky &quot;refused to attend jail sewing classes&quot;.

In the second trial, the prosecutors asked the judge for a 14-year sentence, which was just one year less than the maximum. The judge, Danilkin, handed down the verdict on 30 December 2010 in which he upheld the prosecutors&#x27; statements. Taking into account the time already served, Khodorkovsky was to be released in 2017. U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned or expressed concern over Khodorkovsky&#x27;s extended sentence. The White House said it brought Russia&#x27;s legal system into question.

On 15 February 2011, Vyacheslav Lebedev, chairman of Russia&#x27;s Supreme Court, suggested reviving an old Soviet practice under which a maximum sentence for a person charged with different crimes should not exceed the sentence attached to the most serious charge: in Khodorkovsky&#x27;s case, nine years. Since he has been in jail since October 2003, this would have meant releasing him in October 2012, which did not happen.

On 5 March 2012, the day after Putin won his third term as president of Russia, President Medvedev ordered a review of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s sentence.

In December 2012, a Moscow court reduced Khodorkovsky&#x27;s prison sentence by two years, so that he was due to be released in 2014. In the same court case Khodorkovsky&#x27;s business partner Platon Lebedev had his prison sentence reduced by two years. The 2010 case would have had them released 13 years after the day of their arrests in 2003.

====Upon release from prison (2013)====

On 19 December 2013, president Vladimir Putin said he intended to pardon Khodorkovsky in the near future. He did so on the following day, stating that Khodorkovsky&#x27;s mother was ill and Khodorkovsky had asked for clemency. Putin also felt that ten years in jail was still &quot;a significant punishment&quot;. Some opposition leaders suggested that the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi might have played a role in the granting of the pardon. His guards told him to pack his things and he was flown at once to St. Petersburg, where he was given &quot;a parka and a passport&quot; and, switching planes on the tarmac, put on a flight to Berlin. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in December 2014 that Khodorkovsky had &quot;promised Putin three things in a handwritten letter&quot; in which he asked to be freed: &quot;that he would leave Russia to spend time with his family, would stay away from politics, and would not attempt to win back his shares in Yukos ... or get involved in any court cases.&quot; However Khodorkovsky maintains that he had made no such promise.

After gaining his freedom, Khodorkovsky released a written statement in which he thanked former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who had played a critical role in diplomatic negotiations, for securing his release.

On 22 December 2013, two days after his release, he appeared at a news conference at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin. Reporting on his comments, the Associated Press stated that &quot;The 50-year-old appeared composed at his first public appearance since his release, saying he shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as a symbol that there are no more political prisoners in Russia. He added that he would do &#x27;all I can do&#x27; to ensure the release of others.&quot; He again thanked Genscher, as well as the media, and German chancellor Angela Merkel, for their roles in securing his release. On 24 December, Khodorkovsky was interviewed in his Berlin hotel room on the BBC television program &quot;Hardtalk&quot;.

After his release Khodorkovsky acknowledged the support he had received from the Swiss Federal Court which ruled in 2008 against the release of documents to the Russian authorities, that tied him and Yukos, the largest Russian oil company at the time, to prominent banks and financial institutions. The Swiss court argued that handing over the documents would endanger his chance for a fair trial. Khodorkovsky also has personal ties to Switzerland where his wife Inna and two of his children reside. Soon after his step to freedom, he applied for a Swiss visa, which would allow him to travel to most European countries. This visa was approved by Swiss authorities, and Khodorkovsky arrived in Basel, Switzerland, on 5 January 2014. Yukos shareholders were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague in July 2014, however Khodorkovsky was not a party to the legal action. In 2015, he moved to London.

On 23 December 2015, a Russian court issued an international arrest warrant for Khodorkovsky whom the Investigative Committee of Russia charged with ordering the murder of Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, who was murdered in June 1998. Speaking on the same day on BBC, which claimed Khodorkovsky &quot;spent much of his time in London&quot;, he said he was &quot;definitely considering&quot; applying for political asylum in the UK and felt safe in London.

In December 2016, a court unfroze $100m of Khodorkovsky&#x27;s assets that had been held in Ireland.

==Life in exile (2013–present)==

Following his pardon and release from prison on 20 December 2013 at the same time as members of the protest group Pussy Riot, Khodorkovsky made only a few public appearances until the revolution broke out in Ukraine. On 9 March 2014, Khodorkovsky spoke at Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kyiv, where he accused the Russian government of complicity in the killing of protesters.

In March 2014, Khodorkovsky was presented with the &quot;Man of the Year&quot; award by the Polish newspaper &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;. Khodorkovsky also delivered keynote speeches at the Le Monde Festival, the Freedom House Awards Dinner, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Oslo Freedom Forum, Forum 2000, the Vilnius Forum, Chatham House, the World Economic Forum, Stanford University, and the Atlantic Council.

In May 2014, Khodorkovsky was praised by former Polish president Lech Wałęsa and received an award for his efforts to reform Russian civil society.

Khodorkovsky&#x27;s mother died in the summer of 2014.

In July 2014, Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled the Russian government deliberately bankrupted Yukos to seize its assets and ordered it to repay Yukos shareholders a sum of roughly $50 billion. Roughly 30,000 former Yukos employees were to receive a large pension from the government. As of January 2015 the Russian government has not made any payments to Yukos shareholders or employees. On 20 April 2016 the District Court of The Hague quashed the decisions of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, ruling that it had no jurisdiction as provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty arbitration clause violated Russian law.

On 20 September 2014, Khodorkovsky officially relaunched the Open Russia movement, with a live teleconference broadcast featuring groups of civil society activists and pro-democracy opposition in Kaliningrad, St Petersburg, Voronezh and Ekaterinburg, among others. According to media around the time of the launch event, Open Russia was intended to unite pro-European Russians in a bid to challenge Putin&#x27;s grip on power. Khodorkovsky said that the organization would promote independent media, political education, rule of law, support for activists and journalists, free and fair elections, and a program to reform law enforcement and the Russian judicial system. He said that Putin&#x27;s actions were &quot;clearly leading Russia along the patriarchal Asian path to development&quot; and called the State Duma “a bulwark of reactionaries”. He said that Open Russia was willing to support any candidate that sought to develop Russia along the European model.

In October 2014, Khodorkovsky visited the U.S., delivering the keynote address at a Washington, D.C., meeting of Freedom House and giving a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. In the latter speech he among other things lamented the fact that &quot;a picture of the West as a sort of moral example for ourselves&quot; had &quot;in the past ten to twenty years become much, much more blurry.&quot; He also said at Freedom House that &quot;Russia has been wasting time these past 10 years... Now is when we must begin to make up this lost time.&quot;

A 3 October 2014, article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that Khodorkovsky planned &quot;to bring about a constitutional conference that would shift power away from the Russian presidency and toward the legislature and judiciary.&quot; During his U.S. trip, he said, &quot;The question of Russian power won&#x27;t be decided by democratic elections—forget about this. ... This is why, when we speak of strategic tasks, I speak of a constitutional conference that will redistribute power from the president&quot; to other branches of government.

On 2 December 2014, Khodorkovsky addressed the European Parliament.

Khodorkovsky&#x27;s book &quot;My Fellow Prisoners&quot;, a collection of sketches about his life in prison, was published in 2014. John Lloyd of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; called it &quot;vivid, humane and poignant&quot;.

In December 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Khodorkovsky, living in Zurich, was &quot;plotting the downfall of the man who put him behind bars for a decade.&quot; The newspaper cited him as claiming that Russian intelligence services were monitoring his communications. In early 2015, he told CNN that he held no desire to run for the presidency, or had any political ambition, although he still held ambitions of social changes; he called his efforts &quot;civic activity&quot; and not politics.

In March 2015, Khodorkovsky, along with other opposition figures, was a subject of attacks by a shadowy organization known as &quot;Glavplakat&quot;. The attacks included anonymous posters and banners flown across Russian cities likening opposition figures to unsavoury characters from history or labeling them as traitors to Russia. It has yet to be determined who is behind the organization, and opposition figures are concerned over the attacks.

In August 2015, the Kremlin summoned Khodorkovsky&#x27;s father for questioning. On 7 December 2015, Khodorkovsky received an official summons from the Russian Investigative Committee.

In September 2016, Khodorkovsky launched an &quot;Instead of Putin&quot; website where visitors can vote for alternatives to Putin.

In November 2017, Khodorkovsky launched the Dossier Center, which seeks to map the network of people operating in support of Putin.

On 20 May 2022, Khodorkovsky was designated as &#x27;foreign agent&#x27; by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Also in May 2022, Khodorkovsky participated in the 8th &quot;Russia Forum&quot; in Vilnius, together with former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, the head of the US-think tank Freedom House, the head of the US-government funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe and others. The aim of the &quot;anti-Putin summit&quot; was to develop a strategy on how to &quot;deputise&quot; Russia and &quot;slay the Russian bear&quot;, meaning Vladimir Putin. The parliament, and not the president, should exercise power in Russia, Khodorkovsky said in Vilnius, adding that the end of Putin’s government “will not be long in coming”.

In November 2022 Khodorkovsky published on the internet, a book in both Russian and English languages entitled &quot;HOW DO YOU SLAY A DRAGON? A Manual for Start-Up Revolutionaries&quot;.

On 30 April 2023 Khodorkovsky and a large group of exiles, among whom were Dmitry Gudkov, Ilya Ponomarev, Garry Kasparov, Leonid Gozman, Kirill Rogov, Ivan Preobrazhensky, Evgeny Chichvarkin, Boris Zimin, Sergey Guriev, Andrei Illarionov, Mark Feigin, Elena Lukyanova, Marat Gelman, Evgenia Chirikova, Anastasia Shevchenko as well as some 50 others, met in Berlin and signed a joint declaration &quot;in which they declared their commitment to fundamental positions, the first of which is the criminal nature of the Russian war against Ukraine.&quot; The Putin regime was &quot;illegitimate and criminal&quot;, and stated that for this reason it &quot;must be eliminated&quot;. The document was entitled &quot;Declaration of Russia’s Democratic Forces&quot;, and published in the form of a petition on Change.org.
On 24 June 2023, Khodorkovsky wrote in support of the Wagner Group mutiny, urging citizens to give the mutineers gasoline and for their opponents not to fight against the mutiny.

On 20 January 2025, Khodorkovsky posted pictures of himself at the Capital One Arena in Washington DC during the second inauguration of Donald Trump.

==Politics==
Khodorkovsky is openly critical of what he refers to as &quot;managed democracy&quot; within Russia. Careful normally not to criticise the current leadership, he says the military and security services exercise too much authority. In 2010 he told &quot;The Times&quot;:&quot;It is the Singapore model, it is a term that people understand in Russia these days. It means that theoretically you have a free press, but in practice there is self-censorship. Theoretically you have courts, in practice the courts adopt decisions dictated from above. Theoretically there are civil rights enshrined in the constitution; in practice you are not able to exercise some of these rights.&quot;

Khodorkovsky promoted social programs through Yukos in regions where the company operated, one example being &quot;New Civilization&quot;, in Angarsk, which promoted student government to young adults. The scout program incorporated aspects of student government. Participants from throughout the country spent their holidays organizing student-governed bodies at summer camps.

Masha Gessen, writing in 2012, recalled meeting Khodorkovsky in 2002, &quot;when he met with a group of young authors to try out what would become his stump speech as he traveled the country, urging the creation of a new kind of economy in Russia, one based on intellectual rather than mineral resources.&quot;

==Relationship with Vladimir Putin==

&quot;At the root of the conflict between Putin and Khodorkovsky&quot;, stated writer and activist Masha Gessen in April 2012, &quot;lies a basic difference in character. Putin rarely says what he means and even less frequently trusts that others are saying what they mean. Khodorkovsky, in contrast, seems to have always taken himself and others at face value—he has constructed his identity in accordance with his convictions and his life in accordance with his identity. That is what landed him in prison and what has kept him there.&quot;

In February 2003, at a televised meeting at the Kremlin, Khodorkovsky argued with Putin about corruption. He implied that major government officials were accepting millions in bribes. In early 2012, prior to the Russian presidential election, Khodorkovsky and Putin were said to have both underestimated each other.

After being convicted for tax evasion, money-laundering, and embezzlement, Khodorkovsky maintained his innocence and said that his conviction was &quot;retribution for financing political parties that opposed Putin&quot;.

On 20 December 2013, Putin signed a pardon freeing Khodorkovsky. Following his release, Khodorkovsky addressed the media at a news conference in Berlin, Germany. He referred to himself as a &quot;political prisoner&quot;, and stated he would not re-enter business or politics.

Khodorkovsky stated in a December 2014 interview that he was not violating his promise to Putin to avoid politics, but was only engaged in &quot;civil society work... politics is in essence a battle to get yourself elected, personally. I&#x27;m not interested in this. But to the question, are you ready to go through to the very end: yes, I am. I see this as my civic duty.&quot; He said he was &quot;offering myself as a crisis manager. Because that&#x27;s what I am.&quot;
