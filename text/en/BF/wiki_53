<text>A datasheet, data sheet, or spec sheet is a document that summarizes the performance and other characteristics of a product, machine, component (e.g., an electronic component), material, subsystem (e.g., a power supply), or software in sufficient detail that allows a buyer to understand what the product is and a design engineer to understand the role of the component in the overall system. Typically, a datasheet is created by the manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the of the devices. In cases where there is relevant source code to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file. Datasheets are created, stored, and distributed via product information management or product data management systems.

Depending on the specific purpose, a datasheet may offer an average value, a typical value, a typical range, engineering tolerances, or a nominal value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the datasheet.

A datasheet is usually used for commercial or technical communication to describe the characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical specification is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.

The ideal datasheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure, according to a strict taxonomy, that allows the information to be processed by a machine. Such machine readable descriptions can facilitate information retrieval, display, design, testing, interfacing, verification, system discovery, and e-commerce. Examples include Open Icecat data-sheets, transducer electronic data sheets for describing sensor characteristics, and electronic device descriptions in CANopen or descriptions in markup languages, such as SensorML.

==Product datasheet information==
A product data sheet (PDS), like any datasheet, has a different data model per category. It typically contains:
* Identifiers like manufacturer and manufacturer product code, GTIN
* Classification data, such as UNSPSC
* Descriptions such as marketing texts
* Specifications
* Product images
* Feature logos
* Reasons-to-buy
* Leaflets, typically as PDFs
* Manuals, typically in PDF.
* Product videos, 3D objects, and other rich media assets

In Open Icecat, the global open catalog or open content project in which hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of e-commerce sellers participate, the data models of tens of thousands of taxonomy classes are defined, and millions of free PDSs can be found conforming these data-sheet data models.

===Material safety data sheets===
A material safety data sheet (MSDS), safety data sheet (SDS), or product safety data sheet (PSDS) is an important component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. It provides workers with ways to allow them to work in a safe manner and gives them physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical&#x27;s risks, safety, and effect on the environment.

The SDSs are a commonly used classification for logging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. The SDSs often include the safe use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical. Anytime chemicals are used these datasheets will be found.

There is a need to have an internationally recognized symbol when describing hazardous substances. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background, used to denote a harmful substance.

The purpose of an SDS is not so that the general public will have a knowledge of how to read and understand it, but more so that it can be used in an occupational setting to allow workers to be able to work with it.

===Chemical data===
Datasheets and pages are available for specific properties of chemicals in chemical elements data references: example, melting points of the elements (data page). Specific materials have technical data in individual sheets such as ethanol: this includes subjects such as structure and properties, thermodynamic properties, spectral data, vapor pressure, etc. Other chemical datasheets are available from individual producers of chemicals, often on their web pages.

==Datasheets for automobiles==
Datasheets for automobiles may be described under several names such as features, specs, engineering data, technical summary, etc. They help communicate the technical information about a car to potential buyers and are useful for comparisons with similar cars. They might include: critical inside and outside dimensions, weight, fuel efficiency, engine and drive train, towing capability, safety features and options, warranty, etc.

==Similar documents==
* Brochure – focuses more on the benefits and advantages of a product and states fewer details, especially fewer quantitative parameters to describe the product. The beginning parts of a brochure and a datasheet for the same product may look the same and include the name of the product, the manufacturer&#x27;s name, the logo and contact details, a brief description, and a photo of the scheme of the product.
* Catalog – presents a variety of products compared to datasheets, which present one product or a relatively small group of similar products. Catalogs may present many of the parameters that are stated in product datasheets, but they are usually not as comprehensive as datasheets.
* User guide – deals more with the step-by-step usage of a product and may include a brief or complete list of parameters that describe the product, usually as an appendix for the actual user guide document.
* Application note – a document that gives more specific details on using a component in a specific application, or relating to a particular process (e.g., the physical assembly of a product containing the component). An example of note could be, &quot;this content is for the flipped content for ENG.&quot; Application notes are especially useful for giving guidance on more unusual uses of a particular component, which would be irrelevant to many readers of the more widely read datasheet. application notes may either be appended to a datasheet or presented as a separate document.
* Technical specification – an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service

<doc id="300596" wikidata="Q374577" url="?curid=300596" title="Two Arabian Knights">
<text>Two Arabian Knights (1927) is an American silent comedy film, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring William Boyd, Mary Astor, and Louis Wolheim. The film was produced by Howard Hughes and was distributed by United Artists. The screenwriters were James T. O&#x27;Donohue, Wallace Smith, and George Marion Jr.

The film won the only Academy Award for Best Comedy Direction in 1929. The next year, AMPAS merged the categories Best Director of a Comedy Picture and Best Director of a Dramatic Picture to form the category Academy Award for Best Director.

==Plot==

During the First World War, two American soldiers become trapped in no man&#x27;s land. Expecting to die, W. Dangerfield Phelps III (William Boyd) decides to fulfill his fondest desire: to beat up his sergeant since training camp, Peter O&#x27;Gaffney (Louis Wolheim). While they are brawling, the Germans sneak up and capture them.

In a German prison camp, the two become friends when Phelps takes responsibility for an unflattering caricature he drew of a guard, rather than let O&#x27;Gaffney take the blame. The two escape, stealing the white robes of Arab prisoners to blend in with the snow. However, they encounter (and are forced to join) a group of similarly garbed Arab prisoners being sent by train to Constantinople.

Near the end of their journey, Phelps creates a distraction, and the two men jump off, landing in a hay wagon. When the hay is loaded onto a ship bound for Arabia, so are they. The stowaways are discovered, but the skipper (Michael Visaroff) is satisfied when Phelps pays him their fare.

When a small boat founders nearby, Phelps jumps in to try to rescue an Arabian woman, Mirza (Mary Astor). Both he and the woman have to be saved by O&#x27;Gaffney. The two soldiers and the skipper vie for the veiled woman&#x27;s affections. Phelps eventually coaxes her into removing her veil, and is entranced by her beauty. Meanwhile, the woman&#x27;s escort observes this development with disapproval. The skipper insists on being paid for Mirza&#x27;s fare, but none of the three have any money left. They hold him off as best they can.

When they reach their destination, the skipper refuses to let Mirza debark without paying, so O&#x27;Gaffney robs the purser (Boris Karloff) to get the money. Mirza is met by Shevket Ben Ali (Ian Keith); Mirza informs Phelps that her father has arranged for her to marry Shevket. They depart. The Americans jump overboard when the skipper discovers what happened to his purser.

The two men head for the American consul, but leave hastily without speaking to him when they find the skipper already there lodging a complaint. They decide to seek the assistance of Mirza&#x27;s father the Emir, who turns out to be the governor of the region. However, Mirza&#x27;s escort has told him and Shevket that Phelps has seen her without her veil. Outraged, the Emir sends his men to bring the Americans back to be executed. Unaware of this, the two soldiers saunter into the Emir&#x27;s palace. Phelps reads Mirza&#x27;s warning note in time, and the two escape.

When Phelps sets out to rescue Mirza, O&#x27;Gaffney shows true friendship and accompanies him. They are trapped by Shevket and his men, but when Mirza threatens to kill herself, Shevket proposes they settle this with a duel in which only one of the pistols is loaded with a real bullet, the other gun has a blank cartridge. Phelps agrees and fires first; his gun contains the blank. Mirza is made to leave the room. Then Shevket reveals that both guns had blanks; he did not wish to wager his life with a &quot;dog&quot;. He exits, leaving his men to dispose of Phelps. The two men overcome their captors, relieve Shevket of Mirza, and ride away.

==Cast==

* William Boyd as W. Dangerfield Phelps III
* Mary Astor as Mirza
* Louis Wolheim as Sgt. Peter O&#x27;Gaffney

==Production==
The movie was filmed in the United States. Roughly four months after the film&#x27;s premiere, it was reported that director Lewis Milestone had been hired primarily on the basis of his work on Harold Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Kid Brother&quot; (1927).

==Preservation==
The film was long thought lost before being located in Howard Hughes&#x27; film collection after his death. &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in partnership with University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 2016.

<doc id="300602" wikidata="Q1472399" url="?curid=300602" title="Internet access">
<text>Internet access is a facility or service that provides connectivity for a computer, a computer network, or other network device to the Internet, and for individuals or organizations to access or use applications such as email and the World Wide Web. Internet access is offered for sale by an international hierarchy of Internet service providers (ISPs) using various networking technologies. At the retail level, many organizations, including municipal entities, also provide cost-free access to the general public. Types of connections range from fixed-line cable (such as DSL and fiber optic) to mobile (via cellular) and satellite.

The availability of Internet access to the general public began with the commercialization of the early Internet in the early 1990s, and has grown with the availability of useful applications, such as the World Wide Web. In 1995, only percent of the world&#x27;s population had access, with well over half of those living in the United States and consumer use was through dial-up. By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations used faster broadband technology. By 2014, 41 percent of the world&#x27;s population had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global average connection speeds exceeded one megabit per second. 

==History==
The Internet developed from the ARPANET, which was funded by the US government to support projects within the government, at universities and research laboratories in the US, but grew over time to include most of the world&#x27;s large universities and the research arms of many technology companies. Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.

In the early to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from personal computers and workstations directly connected to local area networks (LANs) or from dial-up connections using modems and analog telephone lines. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, dial-up connections were made from terminals or computers running terminal-emulation software to terminal servers on LANs. These dial-up connections did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal-to-host connections. The introduction of network access servers supporting the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and later the point-to-point protocol (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made the full range of Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up.

An important factor in the rapid rise of Internet access speed has been advances in MOSFET (MOS transistor) technology. The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960 following Frosch and Derick discoveries, is the building block of the Internet telecommunications networks. The laser, originally demonstrated by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow in 1960, was adopted for MOS light-wave systems around 1980, which led to exponential growth of Internet bandwidth. Continuous MOSFET scaling has since led to online bandwidth doubling every 18 months (Edholm&#x27;s law, which is related to Moore&#x27;s law), with the bandwidths of telecommunications networks rising from bits per second to terabits per second.

Broadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as &quot;Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access&quot; and so covers a wide range of technologies. The core of these broadband Internet technologies are complementary MOS (CMOS) digital circuits, the speed capabilities of which were extended with innovative design techniques. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer&#x27;s built in Ethernet networking capabilities, or by using a NIC expansion card.

Most broadband services provide a continuous &quot;always on&quot; connection; there is no dial-in process required, and it does not interfere with voice use of phone lines. Broadband provides improved access to Internet services such as:
* Faster World Wide Web browsing
* Faster downloading of documents, photographs, videos, and other large files
* Telephony, radio, television, and videoconferencing
* Virtual private networks and remote system administration
* Online gaming, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games which are interaction-intensive

In the 1990s, the National Information Infrastructure initiative in the U.S. made broadband Internet access a public policy issue. In 2000, most Internet access to homes was provided using dial-up, while many businesses and schools were using broadband connections. In 2000 there were just under 150 million dial-up subscriptions in the 34 OECD countries and fewer than 20 million broadband subscriptions. By 2004, broadband had grown and dial-up had declined so that the number of subscriptions were roughly equal at 130 million each. In 2010, in the OECD countries, over 90% of the Internet access subscriptions used broadband, broadband had grown to more than 300 million subscriptions, and dial-up subscriptions had declined to fewer than 30 million.

The broadband technologies in widest use are of digital subscriber line (DSL), ADSL, and cable Internet access. Newer technologies include VDSL and optical fiber extended closer to the subscriber in both telephone and cable plants. Fiber-optic communication, while only recently being used in premises and to the curb schemes, has played a crucial role in enabling broadband Internet access by making transmission of information at very high data rates over longer distances much more cost-effective than copper wire technology.

In areas not served by ADSL or cable, some community organizations and local governments are installing Wi-Fi networks. Wireless, satellite, and microwave Internet are often used in rural, undeveloped, or other hard to serve areas where wired Internet is not readily available.

Newer technologies being deployed for fixed (stationary) and mobile broadband access include WiMAX, LTE, and fixed wireless.

Starting in roughly 2006, mobile broadband access is increasingly available at the consumer level using &quot;3G&quot; and &quot;4G&quot; technologies such as HSPA, EV-DO, HSPA+, and LTE.

==Availability==

In addition to access from home, school, and the workplace Internet access may be available from public places such as libraries and Internet cafés, where computers with Internet connections are available. Some libraries provide stations for physically connecting users&#x27; laptops to LANs.

Wireless Internet access points are available in public places such as airport halls, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Some access points may also provide coin-operated computers. Various terms are used, such as &quot;public Internet kiosk&quot;, &quot;public access terminal&quot;, and &quot;Web payphone&quot;. Many hotels also have public terminals, usually fee based.

Coffee shops, shopping malls, and other venues increasingly offer wireless access to computer networks, referred to as hotspots, for users who bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or PDA. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A Wi-Fi hotspot need not be limited to a confined location since multiple ones combined can cover a whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.

Additionally, mobile broadband access allows smartphones and other digital devices to connect to the Internet from any location from which a mobile phone call can be made, subject to the capabilities of that mobile network.

===Speed===
The bit rates for dial-up modems range from as little as 110 bit/s in the late 1950s, to a maximum of from 33 to 64 kbit/s (V.90 and V.92) in the late 1990s. Dial-up connections generally require the dedicated use of a telephone line. Data compression can boost the effective bit rate for a dial-up modem connection from 220 (V.42bis) to 320 (V.44) kbit/s. However, the effectiveness of data compression is quite variable, depending on the type of data being sent, the condition of the telephone line, and a number of other factors. In reality, the overall data rate rarely exceeds 150 kbit/s.

Broadband technologies supply considerably higher bit rates than dial-up, generally without disrupting regular telephone use. Various minimum data rates and maximum latencies have been used in definitions of broadband, ranging from 64 kbit/s up to 4.0 Mbit/s. In 1988 the CCITT standards body defined &quot;broadband service&quot; as requiring transmission channels capable of supporting bit rates greater than the primary rate which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s. A 2006 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report defined broadband as having download data transfer rates equal to or faster than 256 kbit/s. And in 2015 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defined &quot;Basic Broadband&quot; as data transmission speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s downstream (from the Internet to the user&#x27;s computer) and 3 Mbit/s upstream (from the user&#x27;s computer to the Internet). The trend is to raise the threshold of the broadband definition as higher data rate services become available.

The higher data rate dial-up modems and many broadband services are &quot;asymmetric&quot;—supporting much higher data rates for download (toward the user) than for upload (toward the Internet).

Data rates, including those given in this article, are usually defined and advertised in terms of the maximum or peak download rate. In practice, these maximum data rates are not always reliably available to the customer. Actual end-to-end data rates can be lower due to a number of factors. In late June 2016, internet connection speeds averaged about 6 Mbit/s globally. Physical link quality can vary with distance and for wireless access with terrain, weather, building construction, antenna placement, and interference from other radio sources. Network bottlenecks may exist at points anywhere on the path from the end-user to the remote server or service being used and not just on the first or last link providing Internet access to the end-user.

===Network congestion===
Users may share access over a common network infrastructure. Since most users do not use their full connection capacity all of the time, this aggregation strategy (known as contended service) usually works well, and users can burst to their full data rate at least for brief periods. However, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and high-quality streaming video can require high data-rates for extended periods, which violates these assumptions and can cause a service to become oversubscribed, resulting in congestion and poor performance. The TCP protocol includes flow-control mechanisms that automatically throttle back on the bandwidth being used during periods of network congestion. This is fair in the sense that all users who experience congestion receive less bandwidth, but it can be frustrating for customers and a major problem for ISPs. In some cases, the amount of bandwidth actually available may fall below the threshold required to support a particular service such as video conferencing or streaming live video–effectively making the service unavailable.

When traffic is particularly heavy, an ISP can deliberately throttle back the bandwidth available to classes of users or for particular services. This is known as traffic shaping and careful use can ensure a better quality of service for time critical services even on extremely busy networks. However, overuse can lead to concerns about fairness and network neutrality or even charges of censorship, when some types of traffic are severely or completely blocked.

===Outages===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption. Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links. Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia. Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of Internet censorship, as in the blockage of the Internet in Egypt, whereby approximately 93% of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests.

On April 25, 1997, due to a combination of human error and a software bug, an incorrect routing table at MAI Network Service (a Virginia Internet service provider) propagated across backbone routers and caused major disruption to Internet traffic for a few hours.

==Technologies==
When the Internet is accessed using a modem, digital data is converted to analog for transmission over analog networks such as the telephone and cable networks. A computer or other device accessing the Internet would either be connected directly to a modem that communicates with an Internet service provider (ISP) or the modem&#x27;s Internet connection would be shared via a LAN which provides access in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.

Although a connection to a LAN may provide very high data-rates within the LAN, actual Internet access speed is limited by the upstream link to the ISP. LANs may be wired or wireless. Ethernet over twisted pair cabling and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies used to build LANs today, but ARCNET, Token Ring, LocalTalk, FDDI, and other technologies were used in the past.

Ethernet is the name of the IEEE 802.3 standard for physical LAN communication and Wi-Fi is a trade name for a wireless local area network (WLAN) that uses one of the IEEE 802.11 standards. Ethernet cables are interconnected via switches &amp; routers. Wi-Fi networks are built using one or more wireless antenna called access points.

Many &quot;modems&quot; (cable modems, DSL gateways or Optical Network Terminals (ONTs)) provide the additional functionality to host a LAN so most Internet access today is through a LAN such as that created by a WiFi router connected to a modem or a combo modem router, often a very small LAN with just one or two devices attached. And while LANs are an important form of Internet access, this raises the question of how and at what data rate the LAN itself is connected to the rest of the global Internet. The technologies described below are used to make these connections, or in other words, how customers&#x27; modems (Customer-premises equipment) are most often connected to internet service providers (ISPs).

===Dial-up technologies===
====Dial-up access====
Dial-up Internet access uses a modem and a phone call placed over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to connect to a pool of modems operated by an ISP. The modem converts a computer&#x27;s digital signal into an analog signal that travels over a phone line&#x27;s local loop until it reaches a telephone company&#x27;s switching facilities or central office (CO) where it is switched to another phone line that connects to another modem at the remote end of the connection.

Operating on a single channel, a dial-up connection monopolizes the phone line and is one of the slowest methods of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas as it requires no new infrastructure beyond the already existing telephone network, to connect to the Internet. Typically, dial-up connections do not exceed a speed of , as they are primarily made using modems that operate at a maximum data rate of 56 kbit/s downstream (towards the end user) and 34 or 48 kbit/s upstream (toward the global Internet).

====Multilink dial-up====
Multilink dial-up provides increased bandwidth by channel bonding multiple dial-up connections and accessing them as a single data channel. It requires two or more modems, phone lines, and dial-up accounts, as well as an ISP that supports multilinking – and of course any line and data charges are also doubled. This inverse multiplexing option was briefly popular with some high-end users before ISDN, DSL and other technologies became available. Diamond and other vendors created special modems to support multilinking.

===Hardwired broadband access===

The term &quot;broadband&quot; includes a broad range of technologies, all of which provide higher data rate access to the Internet. The following technologies use wires or cables in contrast to wireless broadband described later.

====Integrated Services Digital Network====
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a switched telephone service capable of transporting voice and digital data, and is one of the oldest Internet access methods. ISDN has been used for voice, video conferencing, and broadband data applications. ISDN was very popular in Europe, but less common in North America. Its use peaked in the late 1990s before the availability of DSL and cable modem technologies.

Basic rate ISDN, known as ISDN-BRI, has two 64 kbit/s &quot;bearer&quot; or &quot;B&quot; channels. These channels can be used separately for voice or data calls or bonded together to provide a 128 kbit/s service. Multiple ISDN-BRI lines can be bonded together to provide data rates above 128 kbit/s. Primary rate ISDN, known as ISDN-PRI, has 23 bearer channels (64 kbit/s each) for a combined data rate of 1.5 Mbit/s (US standard). An ISDN E1 (European standard) line has 30 bearer channels and a combined data rate of 1.9 Mbit/s. ISDN has been replaced by DSL technology, and it required special telephone switches at the service provider.

====Leased lines====
Leased lines are dedicated lines used primarily by ISPs, business, and other large enterprises to connect LANs and campus networks to the Internet using the existing infrastructure of the public telephone network or other providers. Delivered using wire, optical fiber, and radio, leased lines are used to provide Internet access directly as well as the building blocks from which several other forms of Internet access are created.

T-carrier technology dates to 1957 and provides data rates that range from 56 and (DS0) to (DS1 or T1), to (DS3 or T3). A T1 line carries 24 voice or data channels (24 DS0s), so customers may use some channels for data and others for voice traffic or use all 24 channels for clear channel data. A DS3 (T3) line carries 28 DS1 (T1) channels. Fractional T1 lines are also available in multiples of a DS0 to provide data rates between 56 and . T-carrier lines require special termination equipment such as Data service units that may be separate from or integrated into a router or switch and which may be purchased or leased from an ISP. In Japan the equivalent standard is J1/J3. In Europe, a slightly different standard, E-carrier, provides 32 user channels () on an E1 () and 512 user channels or 16 E1s on an E3 ().

Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET, in the U.S. and Canada) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH, in the rest of the world) are the standard multiplexing protocols used to carry high-data-rate digital bit-streams over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At lower transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The basic unit of framing is an OC-3c (optical) or STS-3c (electrical) which carries . Thus an OC-3c will carry three OC-1 (51.84 Mbit/s) payloads each of which has enough capacity to include a full DS3. Higher data rates are delivered in OC-3c multiples of four providing OC-12c (), OC-48c (), OC-192c (), and OC-768c (). The &quot;c&quot; at the end of the OC labels stands for &quot;concatenated&quot; and indicates a single data stream rather than several multiplexed data streams. Optical transport network (OTN) may be used instead of SONET for higher data transmission speeds of up to per OTN channel.

The 1, 10, 40, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet IEEE standards (802.3) allow digital data to be delivered over copper wiring at distances to 100 m and over optical fiber at distances to .

====Cable Internet access====

Cable Internet provides access using a cable modem on hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) wiring originally developed to carry television signals. Either fiber-optic or coaxial copper cable may connect a node to a customer&#x27;s location at a connection known as a cable drop. Using a cable modem termination system, all nodes for cable subscribers in a neighborhood connect to a cable company&#x27;s central office, known as the &quot;head end.&quot; The cable company then connects to the Internet using a variety of means – usually fiber optic cable or digital satellite and microwave transmissions. Like DSL, broadband cable provides a continuous connection with an ISP.

Downstream, the direction toward the user, bit rates can be as much as 1000 Mbit/s in some countries, with the use of DOCSIS 3.1. Upstream traffic, originating at the user, ranges from 384 kbit/s to more than 50 Mbit/s. DOCSIS 4.0 promises up to downstream and upstream, however this technology is yet to have been implemented in real-world usage. Broadband cable access tends to service fewer business customers because existing television cable networks tend to service residential buildings; commercial buildings do not always include wiring for coaxial cable networks. In addition, because broadband cable subscribers share the same local line, communications may be intercepted by neighboring subscribers. Cable networks regularly provide encryption schemes for data traveling to and from customers, but these schemes may be thwarted.

====Digital subscriber line (DSL, ADSL, SDSL, and VDSL)====
Digital subscriber line (DSL) service provides a connection to the Internet through the telephone network. Unlike dial-up, DSL can operate using a single phone line without preventing normal use of the telephone line for voice phone calls. DSL uses the high frequencies, while the low (audible) frequencies of the line are left free for regular telephone communication. These frequency bands are subsequently separated by filters installed at the customer&#x27;s premises.

DSL originally stood for &quot;digital subscriber loop&quot;. In telecommunications marketing, the term digital subscriber line is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256 kbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e., in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric. With a symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.

Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL or VHDSL, ITU G.993.1) is a digital subscriber line (DSL) standard approved in 2001 that provides data rates up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream over copper wires and up to 85 Mbit/s down- and upstream on coaxial cable. VDSL is capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television, as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet access, over a single physical connection.

VDSL2 (ITU-T G.993.2) is a second-generation version and an enhancement of VDSL. Approved in February 2006, it is able to provide data rates exceeding 100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. However, the maximum data rate is achieved at a range of about 300 meters and performance degrades as distance and loop attenuation increases.

====DSL Rings====
DSL Rings (DSLR) or Bonded DSL Rings is a ring topology that uses DSL technology over existing copper telephone wires to provide data rates of up to 400 Mbit/s.

====Fiber to the home====
Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) is one member of the Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) family that includes Fiber-to-the-building or basement (FTTB), Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), Fiber-to-the-desk (FTTD), Fiber-to-the-curb (FTTC), and Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN). These methods all bring data closer to the end user on optical fibers. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with just how close to the end user the delivery on fiber comes. All of these delivery methods are similar in function and architecture to hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) systems used to provide cable Internet access. Fiber internet connections to customers are either AON (Active optical network) or more commonly PON (Passive optical network). Examples of fiber optic internet access standards are G.984 (GPON, G-PON) and 10G-PON (XG-PON). ISPs may instead use Metro Ethernet as a replacement for T1 and Frame Relay lines for corporate and institutional customers, or offer carrier-grade Ethernet.

The use of optical fiber offers much higher data rates over relatively longer distances. Most high-capacity Internet and cable television backbones already use fiber optic technology, with data switched to other technologies (DSL, cable, LTE) for final delivery to customers. Fiber optic is immune to electromagnetic interference.

In 2010, Australia began rolling out its National Broadband Network across the country using fiber-optic cables to 93 percent of Australian homes, schools, and businesses. The project was abandoned by the subsequent LNP government, in favor of a hybrid FTTN design, which turned out to be more expensive and introduced delays. Similar efforts are underway in Italy, Canada, India, and many other countries (see Fiber to the premises by country).

====Power-line Internet====
Power-line Internet, also known as Broadband over power lines (BPL), carries Internet data on a conductor that is also used for electric power transmission. Because of the extensive power line infrastructure already in place, this technology can provide people in rural and low population areas access to the Internet with little cost in terms of new transmission equipment, cables, or wires. Data rates are asymmetric and generally range from 256 kbit/s to 2.7 Mbit/s.

Because these systems use parts of the radio spectrum allocated to other over-the-air communication services, interference between the services is a limiting factor in the introduction of power-line Internet systems. The IEEE P1901 standard specifies that all power-line protocols must detect existing usage and avoid interfering with it.

Power-line Internet has developed faster in Europe than in the U.S. due to a historical difference in power system design philosophies. Data signals cannot pass through the step-down transformers used and so a repeater must be installed on each transformer. In the U.S. a transformer serves a small cluster of from one to a few houses. In Europe, it is more common for a somewhat larger transformer to service larger clusters of from 10 to 100 houses. Thus a typical U.S. city requires an order of magnitude more repeaters than a comparable European city.

====ATM and Frame Relay====
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay are wide-area networking standards that can be used to provide Internet access directly or as building blocks of other access technologies. For example, many DSL implementations use an ATM layer over the low-level bitstream layer to enable a number of different technologies over the same link. Customer LANs are typically connected to an ATM switch or a Frame Relay node using leased lines at a wide range of data rates.

While still widely used, with the advent of Ethernet over optical fiber, MPLS, VPNs and broadband services such as cable modem and DSL, ATM and Frame Relay no longer play the prominent role they once did.

===Wireless broadband access===
Wireless broadband is used to provide both fixed and mobile Internet access with the following technologies.

====Satellite broadband====
Satellite Internet access provides fixed, portable, and mobile Internet access. Data rates range from 2 kbit/s to 1 Gbit/s downstream and from 2 kbit/s to 10 Mbit/s upstream. In the northern hemisphere, satellite antenna dishes require a clear line of sight to the southern sky, due to the equatorial position of all geostationary satellites. In the southern hemisphere, this situation is reversed, and dishes are pointed north. Service can be adversely affected by moisture, rain, and snow (known as rain fade). The system requires a carefully aimed directional antenna.

Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) operate in a fixed position above the Earth&#x27;s equator. At the speed of light (about ), it takes a quarter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, voice over IP, and remote control devices. TCP tuning and TCP acceleration techniques can mitigate some of these problems. GEO satellites do not cover the Earth&#x27;s polar regions. HughesNet, Exede, AT&amp;T and Dish Network have GEO systems.

Satellite internet constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO, below ) and medium Earth orbit (MEO, between ) operate at lower altitudes, and their satellites are not fixed in their position above the Earth. Because they operate at a lower altitude, more satellites and launch vehicles are needed for worldwide coverage. This makes the initial required investment very large which initially caused OneWeb and Iridium to declare bankruptcy. However, their lower altitudes allow lower latencies and higher speeds which make real-time interactive Internet applications more feasible. LEO systems include Globalstar, Starlink, OneWeb and Iridium. The O3b constellation is a medium Earth-orbit system with a latency of 125 ms. COMMStellation™ is a LEO system, scheduled for launch in 2015, that is expected to have a latency of just 7 ms.

====Mobile broadband====

Mobile broadband is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers (cellular networks) to computers, mobile phones (called &quot;cell phones&quot; in North America and South Africa, and &quot;hand phones&quot; in Asia), and other digital devices using portable modems. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called tethering. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using PC cards, USB modems, and USB sticks or dongles, or separate wireless modems can be used.

New mobile phone technology and infrastructure is introduced periodically and generally involves a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak data rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz becomes available. These transitions are referred to as generations. The first mobile data services became available during the second generation (2G).



The download (to the user) and upload (to the Internet) data rates given above are peak or maximum rates and end users will typically experience lower data rates.

WiMAX was originally developed to deliver fixed wireless service with wireless mobility added in 2005. CDPD, CDMA2000 EV-DO, and MBWA are no longer being actively developed.

In 2011, 90% of the world&#x27;s population lived in areas with 2G coverage, while 45% lived in areas with 2G and 3G coverage.

5G was designed to be faster and have lower latency than its predecessor, 4G. It can be used for mobile broadband in smartphones or separate modems that emit WiFi or can be connected through USB to a computer, or for fixed wireless.

====Fixed wireless====
Fixed wireless internet connections that do not use a satellite nor are designed to support moving equipment such as smartphones due to the use of, for example, customer premises equipment such as antennas that can&#x27;t be moved over a significant geographical area without losing the signal from the ISP, unlike smartphones. Microwave wireless broadband or 5G may be used for fixed wireless.

=====WiMAX=====
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is a set of interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.16 family of wireless-network standards certified by the WiMAX Forum. It enables &quot;the delivery of last mile wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL&quot;. The original IEEE 802.16 standard, now called &quot;Fixed WiMAX&quot;, was published in 2001 and provided 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates. Mobility support was added in 2005. A 2011 update provides data rates up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. WiMax offers a metropolitan area network with a signal radius of about 50 km (30 miles), far surpassing the 30-metre (100-foot) wireless range of a conventional Wi-Fi LAN. WiMAX signals also penetrate building walls much more effectively than Wi-Fi. WiMAX is most often used as a fixed wireless standard.

=====Wireless ISP=====

Wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) operate independently of mobile phone operators. WISPs typically employ low-cost IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi radio systems to link up remote locations over great distances (Long-range Wi-Fi), but may use other higher-power radio communications systems as well, such as microwave and WiMAX.

Traditional 802.11a/b/g/n/ac is an unlicensed omnidirectional service designed to span between 100 and 150 m (300 to 500 ft). By focusing the radio signal using a directional antenna (where allowed by regulations), 802.11 can operate reliably over a distance of many km(miles), although the technology&#x27;s line-of-sight requirements hamper connectivity in areas with hilly or heavily foliated terrain. In addition, compared to hard-wired connectivity, there are security risks (unless robust security protocols are enabled); data rates are usually slower (2 to 50 times slower); and the network can be less stable, due to interference from other wireless devices and networks, weather and line-of-sight problems.

With the increasing popularity of unrelated consumer devices operating on the same 2.4 GHz band, many providers have migrated to the 5GHz ISM band. If the service provider holds the necessary spectrum license, it could also reconfigure various brands of off the shelf Wi-Fi hardware to operate on its own band instead of the crowded unlicensed ones. Using higher frequencies carries various advantages:
* usually regulatory bodies allow for more power and using (better-) directional antennae,
* there exists much more bandwidth to share, allowing both better throughput and improved coexistence,
* there are fewer consumer devices that operate over 5 GHz than over 2.4 GHz, hence fewer interferers are present,
* the shorter wavelengths don&#x27;t propagate as well through walls and other structures, so much less interference leaks outside of the homes of consumers.

Proprietary technologies like Motorola Canopy &amp; Expedience can be used by a WISP to offer wireless access to rural and other markets that are hard to reach using Wi-Fi or WiMAX. There are a number of companies that provide this service.

=====Local Multipoint Distribution Service=====
Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology that uses microwave signals operating between 26 GHz and 29 GHz. Originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV), it is conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Data rates range from 64 kbit/s to 155 Mbit/s. Distance is typically limited to about , but links of up to from the base station are possible in some circumstances.

LMDS has been surpassed in both technological and commercial potential by the LTE and WiMAX standards.

===Hybrid Access Networks===
In some regions, notably in rural areas, the length of the copper lines makes it difficult for network operators to provide high-bandwidth services. One alternative is to combine a fixed-access network, typically XDSL, with a wireless network, typically LTE. The Broadband Forum has standardized an architecture for such Hybrid Access Networks.

===Non-commercial alternatives for using Internet services===
====Grassroots wireless networking movements====
Deploying multiple adjacent Wi-Fi access points is sometimes used to create city-wide wireless networks. It is usually ordered by the local municipality from commercial WISPs.

Grassroots efforts have also led to wireless community networks widely deployed in numerous countries, both developing and developed ones. Rural wireless-ISP installations are typically not commercial in nature and are instead a patchwork of systems built up by hobbyists mounting antennas on radio masts and towers, agricultural storage silos, very tall trees, or whatever other tall objects are available.

Where radio spectrum regulation is not community-friendly, the channels are crowded or when equipment can not be afforded by local residents, free-space optical communication can also be deployed in a similar manner for point to point transmission in air (rather than in fiber optic cable).

====Packet radio====
Packet radio connects computers or whole networks operated by radio amateurs with the option to access the Internet. Note that as per the regulatory rules outlined in the HAM license, Internet access and email should be strictly related to the activities of hardware amateurs.

====Sneakernet====
The term, a tongue-in-cheek play on &quot;net(work)&quot; as in &quot;Internet&quot; or &quot;Ethernet&quot;, refers to the wearing of sneakers as the transport mechanism for the data.

For those who do not have access to or can not afford broadband at home, downloading large files and disseminating information is done by transmission through workplace or library networks, taken home and shared with neighbors by sneakernet. The Cuban &quot;El Paquete Semanal&quot; is an organized example of this.

There are various decentralized, delay tolerant peer to peer applications which aim to fully automate this using any available interface, including both wireless (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi mesh, P2P or hotspots) and physically connected ones (USB storage, Ethernet, etc.).

Sneakernets may also be used in tandem with computer network data transfer to increase data security or overall throughput for big data use cases. Innovation continues in the area to this day; for example, AWS has recently announced Snowball, and bulk data processing is also done in a similar fashion by many research institutes and government agencies.

==Pricing and spending==
Internet access is limited by the relation between pricing and available resources to spend. Regarding the latter, it is estimated that 40% of the world&#x27;s population has less than US$20 per year available to spend on information and communications technology (ICT). In Mexico, the poorest 30% of the society spend an estimated US$35 per year (US$3 per month) and in Brazil, the poorest 22% of the population merely has US$9 per year to spend on ICT (US$0.75 per month). From Latin America, it is known that the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good is roughly around the &quot;magical number&quot; of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year. This is the amount of ICT spending people esteem to be a basic necessity. Current Internet access prices exceed the available resources by large in many countries.

Dial-up users pay the costs for making local or long-distance phone calls, usually pay a monthly subscription fee, and may be subject to additional per minute or traffic based charges, and connect time limits by their ISP. Though less common today than in the past, some dial-up access is offered for &quot;free&quot; in return for watching banner ads as part of the dial-up service. NetZero, BlueLight, Juno, Freenet (NZ), and Free-nets are examples of services providing free access. Some Wireless community networks continue the tradition of providing free Internet access.

Fixed broadband Internet access is often sold under an &quot;unlimited&quot; or flat rate pricing model, with price determined by the maximum data rate chosen by the customer, rather than a per minute or traffic based charge. Per minute and traffic based charges and traffic caps are common for mobile broadband Internet access.

Internet services like Facebook, Wikipedia and Google have built special programs to partner with mobile network operators (MNO) to introduce &quot;zero-rating&quot; the cost for their data volumes as a means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets.

With increased consumer demand for streaming content such as video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing, demand for bandwidth has increased rapidly and for some ISPs the flat rate pricing model may become unsustainable. However, with fixed costs estimated to represent 80–90% of the cost of providing broadband service, the marginal cost to carry additional traffic is low. Most ISPs do not disclose their costs, but the cost to transmit a gigabyte of data in 2011 was estimated to be about $0.03.

Some ISPs estimate that a small number of their users consume a disproportionate portion of the total bandwidth. In response some ISPs are considering, are experimenting with, or have implemented combinations of traffic based pricing, time of day or &quot;peak&quot; and &quot;off peak&quot; pricing, and bandwidth or traffic caps. Others claim that because the marginal cost of extra bandwidth is very small with 80 to 90 percent of the costs fixed regardless of usage level, that such steps are unnecessary or motivated by concerns other than the cost of delivering bandwidth to the end user.

In Canada, Rogers Hi-Speed Internet and Bell Canada have imposed bandwidth caps. In 2008 Time Warner began experimenting with usage-based pricing in Beaumont, Texas. In 2009 an effort by Time Warner to expand usage-based pricing into the Rochester, New York area met with public resistance, however, and was abandoned.
On August 1, 2012, in Nashville, Tennessee and on October 1, 2012, in Tucson, Arizona Comcast began tests that impose data caps on area residents. In Nashville exceeding the 300 Gbyte cap mandates a temporary purchase of 50 Gbytes of additional data.

==Digital divide==


Despite its tremendous growth, Internet access is not distributed equally within or between countries. The digital divide refers to &quot;the gap between people with effective access to information and communications technology (ICT), and those with very limited or no access&quot;. The gap between people with Internet access and those without is one of many aspects of the digital divide. Whether someone has access to the Internet can depend greatly on financial status, geographical location as well as government policies. &quot;Low-income, rural, and minority populations have received special scrutiny as the technological &#x27;have-nots&#x27;.&quot;

Government policies play a tremendous role in bringing Internet access to or limiting access for underserved groups, regions, and countries. For example, in Pakistan, which is pursuing an aggressive IT policy aimed at boosting its drive for economic modernization, the number of Internet users grew from 133,900 (0.1% of the population) in 2000 to 31 million (17.6% of the population) in 2011. In North Korea there is relatively little access to the Internet due to the governments&#x27; fear of political instability that might accompany the benefits of access to the global Internet. The U.S. trade embargo is a barrier limiting Internet access in Cuba.

Access to computers is a dominant factor in determining the level of Internet access. In 2011, in developing countries, 25% of households had a computer and 20% had Internet access, while in developed countries the figures were 74% of households had a computer and 71% had Internet access. The majority of people in developing countries do not have Internet access. About 4 billion people do not have Internet access. When buying computers was legalized in Cuba in 2007, the private ownership of computers soared (there were 630,000 computers available on the island in 2008, a 23% increase over 2007).

Internet access has changed the way in which many people think and has become an integral part of people&#x27;s economic, political, and social lives. The United Nations has recognized that providing Internet access to more people in the world will allow them to take advantage of the &quot;political, social, economic, educational, and career opportunities&quot; available over the Internet. Several of the 67 principles adopted at the World Summit on the Information Society convened by the United Nations in Geneva in 2003, directly address the digital divide. To promote economic development and a reduction of the digital divide, national broadband plans have been and are being developed to increase the availability of affordable high-speed Internet access throughout the world. The Global Gateway, the EU&#x27;s initiative to assist infrastructure development throughout the world, plans to raise €300 billion for connectivity projects, including those in the digital sector, between 2021 and 2027.

===Growth in number of users===


Access to the Internet grew from an estimated 10 million people in 1993, to almost 40 million in 1995, to 670 million in 2002, and to 2.7 billion in 2013. With market saturation, growth in the number of Internet users is slowing in industrialized countries, but continues in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Across Africa, an estimated 900 million people are still not connected to the internet; for those who are, connectivity fees remain generally expensive, and bandwidth is severely constrained in many locations. The number of mobile customers in Africa, however, is expanding faster than everywhere else. Mobile financial services also allow for immediate payment of products and services.

There were roughly 0.6 billion fixed broadband subscribers and almost 1.2 billion mobile broadband subscribers in 2011. In developed countries people frequently use both fixed and mobile broadband networks. In developing countries mobile broadband is often the only access method available.

===Bandwidth divide===

Traditionally the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices (&quot;have and have-not of subscriptions&quot;). Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita). As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, &quot;the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s&quot; increased digital inequality, as well as &quot;the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality&quot;. This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. 3G and fiber optics FTTH). As shown in the Figure, Internet access in terms of bandwidth is more unequally distributed in 2014 as it was in the mid-1990s.

For example, only 0.4% of the African population has a fixed-broadband subscription. The majority of internet users use it through mobile broadband.

===Rural access===
One of the great challenges for Internet access in general and for broadband access in particular is to provide service to potential customers in areas of low population density, such as to farmers, ranchers, and small towns. In cities where the population density is high, it is easier for a service provider to recover equipment costs, but each rural customer may require expensive equipment to get connected. While 66% of Americans had an Internet connection in 2010, that figure was only 50% in rural areas, according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.
Virgin Media advertised over 100 towns across the United Kingdom &quot;from Cwmbran to Clydebank&quot; that have access to their 100 Mbit/s service.

Wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) are rapidly becoming a popular broadband option for rural areas. The technology&#x27;s line-of-sight requirements may hamper connectivity in some areas with hilly and heavily foliated terrain. However, the Tegola project, a successful pilot in remote Scotland, demonstrates that wireless can be a viable option.

The Canadian Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative public private partnership is the first program in North America to guarantee access to &quot;100% of civic addresses&quot; in a region. It is based on Motorola Canopy technology. As of November 2011, under 1000 households have reported access problems. Deployment of a new cell network by one Canopy provider (Eastlink) was expected to provide the alternative of 3G/4G service, possibly at a special unmetered rate, for areas harder to serve by Canopy.

In New Zealand, a fund has been formed by the government to improve rural broadband, and mobile phone coverage. Current proposals include: (a) extending fiber coverage and upgrading copper to support VDSL, (b) focusing on improving the coverage of cellphone technology, or (c) regional wireless.

Several countries have started Hybrid Access Networks to provide faster Internet services in rural areas by enabling network operators to efficiently combine their XDSL and LTE networks.

===Access as a civil or human right===
The actions, statements, opinions, and recommendations outlined below have led to the suggestion that Internet access itself is or should become a civil or perhaps a human right.

Several countries have adopted laws requiring the state to work to ensure that Internet access is broadly available or preventing the state from unreasonably restricting an individual&#x27;s access to information and the Internet:
* Costa Rica: A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: &quot;Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with the government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web.&quot;
* Estonia: In 2000, the parliament launched a massive program to expand access to the countryside. The Internet, the government argues, is essential for life in the twenty-first century.
* Finland: By July 2010, every person in Finland was to have access to a one-megabit per second broadband connection, according to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. And by 2015, access to a 100 Mbit/s connection.
* France: In June 2009, the Constitutional Council, France&#x27;s highest court, declared access to the Internet to be a basic human right in a strongly-worded decision that struck down portions of the HADOPI law, a law that would have tracked abusers and without judicial review automatically cut off network access to those who continued to download illicit material after two warnings
* Greece: Article 5A of the Constitution of Greece states that all persons has a right to participate in the Information Society and that the state has an obligation to facilitate the production, exchange, diffusion, and access to electronically transmitted information.
* Spain: Starting in 2011, , the former state monopoly that holds the country&#x27;s &quot;universal service&quot; contract, has to guarantee to offer &quot;reasonably&quot; priced broadband of at least one megabyte per second throughout Spain.

In December 2003, the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was convened under the auspice of the United Nations. After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses and civil society representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted reaffirming the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening human rights:

:1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled in Geneva from 10–12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, declare our common desire and commitment to build a people-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

:3. We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, as enshrined in the Vienna Declaration. We also reaffirm that democracy, sustainable development, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.

The WSIS Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the &quot;Information Society&quot; in stating:
:4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.&quot;

A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users, conducted for the BBC World Service between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010 found that almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right. 50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion.

The 88 recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in a May 2011 report to the Human Rights Council of the United Nations General Assembly include several that bear on the question of the right to Internet access:
:67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an &quot;enabler&quot; of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.

:78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

:79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.

:85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.

===Network neutrality===

Network neutrality (also net neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors. Opponents claim net neutrality regulations would deter investment into improving broadband infrastructure and try to fix something that isn&#x27;t broken. In April 2017, a recent attempt to compromise net neutrality in the United States is being considered by the newly appointed FCC chairman, Ajit Varadaraj Pai. The vote on whether or not to abolish net neutrality was passed on December 14, 2017, and ended in a 3–2 split in favor of abolishing net neutrality.

==Natural disasters and access==

Natural disasters disrupt internet access in profound ways. This is important—not only for telecommunication companies who own the networks and the businesses who use them, but for emergency crew and displaced citizens as well. The situation is worsened when hospitals or other buildings necessary for disaster response lose their connection. Knowledge gained from studying past internet disruptions by natural disasters could be put to use in planning or recovery. Additionally, because of both natural and man-made disasters, studies in network resiliency are now being conducted to prevent large-scale outages.

One way natural disasters impact internet connection is by damaging end sub-networks (subnets), making them unreachable. A study on local networks after Hurricane Katrina found that 26% of subnets within the storm coverage were unreachable. At Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s peak intensity, almost 35% of networks in Mississippi were without power, while around 14% of Louisiana&#x27;s networks were disrupted. Of those unreachable subnets, 73% were disrupted for four weeks or longer and 57% were at &quot;network edges were important emergency organizations such as hospitals and government agencies are mostly located&quot;. Extensive infrastructure damage and inaccessible areas were two explanations for the long delay in returning service. The company Cisco has revealed a Network Emergency Response Vehicle (NERV), a truck that makes portable communications possible for emergency responders despite traditional networks being disrupted.

A second way natural disasters destroy internet connectivity is by severing submarine cables—fiber-optic cables placed on the ocean floor that provide international internet connection. A sequence of undersea earthquakes cut six out of seven international cables connected to Taiwan and caused a tsunami that wiped out one of its cable and landing stations. The impact slowed or disabled internet connection for five days within the Asia-Pacific region as well as between the region and the United States and Europe.

With the rise in popularity of cloud computing, concern has grown over access to cloud-hosted data in the event of a natural disaster. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been in the news for major network outages in April 2011 and June 2012. AWS, like other major cloud hosting companies, prepares for typical outages and large-scale natural disasters with backup power as well as backup data centers in other locations. AWS divides the globe into five regions and then splits each region into availability zones. A data center in one availability zone should be backed up by a data center in a different availability zone. Theoretically, a natural disaster would not affect more than one availability zone. This theory plays out as long as human error is not added to the mix. The June 2012 major storm only disabled the primary data center, but human error disabled the secondary and tertiary backups, affecting companies such as Netflix, Pinterest, Reddit, and Instagram.

<text>West Berkshire is a unitary authority in the ceremonial county of Berkshire, England. It is administered from Newbury by West Berkshire Council.

==History==
The district of Newbury was formed on 1 April 1974, as a merger of the borough of Newbury, Bradfield Rural District, Hungerford Rural District and Newbury Rural District, along with part of Wantage Rural District.

Until 1 April 1998, Newbury District Council and Berkshire County council were responsible for the region at local government level. On 1 April 1998, Berkshire County Council was abolished and Newbury District Council changed its name to West Berkshire Council and took on the former County Council&#x27;s responsibilities within its area.

==Geography==
West Berkshire is semi-rural in character, with most of the population living in the wooded Kennet valley. Apart from Newbury, the other main centres in the district include Thatcham, Hungerford, Pangbourne and Lambourn. Larger villages include Burghfield, Mortimer and Hermitage. 30% of the population resides in the East of the district, these towns and villages including Tilehurst, Theale, Purley-on-Thames and Calcot which form part of the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area. West Berkshire borders Hampshire to the south, Wiltshire to the west, Oxfordshire to the north and both the Reading and Wokingham authorities to the east. Around three-quarters of the land is designated North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, ranging from the Berkshire Downs to the Thames Valley.

The highest point in southeast/south-central England is located in West Berkshire at Walbury Hill with a summit height of 297 m (974 ft) 2 km to the south of the village of Inkpen, though the hill is not particularly prominent.

West Berkshire has a number of water courses running through the area. In addition to the River Thames, there are the Rivers Lambourn, Kennet, Pang, Bourne and the Kennet and Avon Canal and a number of tributaries that feed these rivers. Properties within flood plains may be at risk of flooding from rising river waters or from water coming up through the ground in some periods of heavy and/or prolonged periods of rain. Purley and Pangbourne are particularly at risk.

==Economy==
West Berkshire has the 21st largest economy in England, characterised by low unemployment, above average wages, and abundance of jobs in technology and financial sectors. The presence of Vodafone has created a cluster of around 80 mobile phone related businesses in Newbury, while the Lambourn area is the second most important centre for the racehorse industry in Great Britain, employing over 800 people directly, and producing an annual income of £20 million.

West Berkshire is also home to Atomic Weapons Establishment, near Aldermaston, Wolseley plc, Bayer and PepsiCo.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms for West Berkshire was established in 1974 for Newbury District Council. Upon the creation of the unitary authority it was inherited by West Berkshire Council.

The colours of red and gold in the arms represent industry and the richness of the area, whilst the interwoven cross represents the weaving industry which was important to Newbury in past centuries. The corn on the shield represents the agriculture industry which is important to the area, whilst the cogwheels represent manufacturing and manufacturing achievement. The mural crown represents local government and the grassy mount symbolises the downs of the surrounding area. Finally, the horseman represents the two battles of Newbury in the English Civil War.

==Politics==

West Berkshire Council is the local authority for the area, based at the Council Offices on Market Street in Newbury.

The district is divided between the Newbury and Reading West and Mid Berkshire parliamentary constituencies, the latter also extending into parts of Reading Borough.

==Education==
There are 10 state-funded secondary schools operating in West Berkshire as well as numerous primary schools and a special school provision. There are also a number of private schools.

Further and higher education in the area is provided by Newbury College, however there are no universities, the nearest being the University of Reading and one of the University of West London campuses, both in the neighbouring Reading Borough.

<text>Barkerville was the main town of the Cariboo Gold Rush in British Columbia, Canada, and is preserved as a historic town. It is located on the north slope of the Cariboo Plateau near the Cariboo Mountains east of Quesnel. BC Highway 26, which follows the route of the Cariboo Wagon Road, the original access to Barkerville, goes through it.

==History==
===Founding===
Barkerville is located on the western edge of the Cariboo Mountains in British Columbia. It was named after Billy Barker from Cambridgeshire, England, who was among those who first struck gold at the location in 1862. His claim was the richest and the most famous.

Barkerville was built up almost overnight, and was a case of &quot;growth via word of mouth&quot;. It grew as fast as the word of Barker&#x27;s strike spread. His claim would eventually yield 37,500 ounces (1,065 kg/2,350 lb) of gold.

Before the construction of the Cariboo Wagon Road, people hauled their own supplies to Barkerville, either on their backs or in a pack train. Because supplies were scarce, the prices of even the most everyday items were extremely high. High prices for goods in Barkerville did not ease up until the Cariboo Road had been finished, when goods could be transported by huge freight wagons. Soon, movers of freight boasted that they could pack and carry a set of champagne glasses without any breakage—for a price, of course. More women came to Barkerville after the construction of the Cariboo Road.

Cattle were driven north up the Okanagan valley via what is now Highway 97 into Canada to provide meat for the miners and residents of Barkerville.

===Growth===

At first, the town consisted only of makeshift cabins and tents. By the mid-1860s, however, Barkerville and the surrounding area had a population estimated between 3000 and 5000 people.

Even though its population was transient and largely dependent on mining, Barkerville was becoming more of a real community. It had several general stores and boarding houses, a drugstore that also sold newspapers and cigars, a barbershop that cut women&#x27;s as well as men&#x27;s hair, the &quot;Wake-Up Jake Restaurant and Coffee Salon&quot;, a theatre (the &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;), and a literary society (the Cariboo Literary Society). In 1867, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) opened a store in Barkerville and served as headquarters of HBC&#x27;s Cariboo District.
Horse racing and prize fighting were common entertainments. Among the so-called &quot;sober set,&quot; church services were extremely well attended. The general stores were the most profitable of the merchants. As they had the only source of food, the store owners could increase the price of foods and supplies. In the height of the gold rush, the stores sold flour for as high as $1.25 per pound. Beans, meat, and dried fruit were sold for a dollar a pound. But as the gold rush ended, the stores went bankrupt and finally out of business.
People of Chinese descent were an important part of Barkerville life for almost a hundred years. They established a number of businesses, including the Kwong Lee Company of Victoria., a general store that sold groceries, clothing, hardware, and mining tools. The company had stores in other parts of British Columbia, but the Barkerville store was one of the most impressive in town. The Chinese community also built cabins (for Chinese miners, who saved money by sharing four or five to a cabin) and Tai Ping (the &quot;Peace Room&quot;), the equivalent of a modern nursing home. Chinese benevolent associations provided social services to the Chinese community, and also resolved disputes within the Chinese community without the use of BC courts.

===Decline===
On September 16, 1868, Barkerville was destroyed by a fire that spread quickly through the wooden buildings. Rebuilding began immediately, and at an impressive pace. Within six weeks, ninety buildings had been rebuilt. Boardwalks were improved, and the narrow and winding main street was widened and straightened. By 1880, there were enough children in the area to build the Barkerville School. It had thirteen pupils and one piece of school equipment—a chalkboard.

Nevertheless, Barkerville&#x27;s population was declining by the end of the 19th century and it eventually had only a few residents. The HBC store closed in 1884. It had a revival in the 1930s, when the Great Depression caused widespread unemployment, and the price of gold skyrocketed. But as the depression turned for the better, Barkerville declined to a very small village.

===Preservation===
On 12 January 1959, BC Parks established Barkerville Historic Park by Order-in-Council with an initial area of . This was increased in 1973 to .

In 1998, Barkerville Historic Park was dissolved and two properties were created: Barkerville Provincial Park and Barkerville Historic Town (Provincial Heritage Property). Barkerville Provincial Park converted from Order In Canada to statute designation in 2000; the whole area consisted of roughly . However, in 2006, the BC Ministry of the Environment repealed &quot;Barkerville Provincial Park&quot; and transferred ownership of it to the Ministry of Tourism, Sport and the Arts to create Barkerville Historic Town and Park.

In 2008, Barkerville&#x27;s Chee Kung Tong Building
was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. The two-storey board and batten structure was completed in 1877 and originally used by the Chee Kung Tong organization, a benevolent association for recent arrivals. It is representative of the community building among immigrant Chinese labourers and merchants in new settlements throughout Canada.

==Barkerville Historic Town and Park==

Barkerville Historic Town and Park Camping Sites consists of three sites: Government Hill Site (7.4 acres), Lowhee Site (49.4 acres), and Forest Rose Site (79 acres), all of which are operated by Barkerville Historic Town and Park.

Having been fully restored in the 1950s, Barkerville appears as it did in its heyday. The history of each building has been researched and documented. No residents remain; they were either bought out or moved to New Barkerville during the restoration of the site.

In 1980 part of the western movie &quot;Harry Tracy, Desperado&quot; was made here. The 2022 Punjabi film, &quot;Chhalla Mud Ke Nahi Aaya&quot;, directed by Amrinder Gill, was also shot here.

==Climate==
Barkerville has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;), which makes it have long, cold and snowy winter and short and cool summers due to its high altitude and latitude. Its growing season averages only 66 days.

<doc id="300619" wikidata="Q526532" url="?curid=300619" title="Lucille Bogan">
<text>Lucille Bogan (née Anderson; April 1, 1897August 10, 1948) was an American classic female blues singer and songwriter, among the first to be recorded. She also recorded under the pseudonym Bessie Jackson. Music critic Ernest Borneman noted that Bogan was one of &quot;the big three of the blues&quot;, along with Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Many of Bogan&#x27;s songs have been recorded by later blues and jazz musicians.

Many of her songs were sexually explicit, and she is generally considered to have been a &quot;dirty blues&quot; musician.

In 2022, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
She was born Lucile Anderson, the daughter of Gussie and Wylie Anderson. According to some sources, she was born in Amory, Mississippi, but according to her entry in the 1900 census her birthplace was Birmingham, Alabama. In 1914, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan, a railwayman, and gave birth to a son, Nazareth Jr., in either 1915 or 1916. She later divorced Bogan and married James Spencer.

She first recorded vaudeville songs for Okeh Records in New York in 1923, with the pianist Henry Callens. Later that year she recorded &quot;Pawn Shop Blues&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia; this was the first time a black blues singer had been recorded outside New York or Chicago. In 1927 she began recording for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin, where she recorded her first big success, &quot;Sweet Petunia&quot;, which was covered by Blind Blake. She also recorded for Brunswick Records, backed by Tampa Red.

By 1930, her songs tended to concern drinking and sex, such as &quot;Sloppy Drunk Blues&quot; (written and first recorded by Bogan but released first by Leroy Carr in 1930 then by Bogan the following year, later recorded by others) and &quot;Tricks Ain&#x27;t Walkin&#x27; No More&quot; (later recorded by Memphis Minnie). She also recorded the original version of &quot;Black Angel Blues&quot;, which (as &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot;) was covered by B. B. King and many others. With her experience in some of the rowdier juke joints of the 1920s, many of Bogan&#x27;s songs, most of which she wrote herself, have thinly veiled humorous sexual references. The theme of prostitution, in particular, featured prominently in several of her recordings. One of these was &quot;Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)&quot;, which was originally written and recorded by Charlie &quot;Specks&quot; McFadden. Piggly Wiggly is the name of supermarket chain operating in the South and the Midwest, which pioneered self-service grocery sales. Bogan used this self-service notion in her amended lyrics to the song, part of which ran, &quot;My name is Piggly Wiggly and I swear you can help yourself, And you&#x27;ve got to have your greenback, and it don&#x27;t take nothin&#x27; else&quot;.

In 1933, she returned to New York, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for the Banner label of ARC. She was usually accompanied on piano by Walter Roland, with whom she recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes, &quot;Seaboard Blues&quot;, &quot;Troubled Mind&quot;, and &quot;Superstitious Blues&quot;. Her other songs include &quot;Stew Meat Blues&quot;, &quot;Coffee Grindin&#x27; Blues&quot;, &quot;My Georgia Grind&quot; (accompanied on piano by Charles Avery), &quot;Honeycomb Man&quot;, &quot;Mr. Screw Worm in Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Bo Hog Blues&quot;.

Her final recordings with Roland and Josh White include two takes of &quot;Shave &#x27;Em Dry&quot;, recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs. According to Keith Briggs&#x27; liner notes for Document Records Complete Recordings, these were recorded either for the fun of the recording engineers, or for &quot;clandestine distribution as a &#x27;Party Record. Briggs notes that Bogan seems to be unfamiliar with the lyrics, reading them as she sings them, potentially surprised by them herself. Another of her songs, &quot;B.D. Woman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, takes the position of a &quot;bull dyke&quot; (&quot;B.D.&quot;), with the lyrics &quot;Comin&#x27; a time, B.D. women, they ain&#x27;t gonna need no men&quot;, &quot;They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man&quot; and &quot;They can lay their jive just like a natural man.&quot;

She appears not to have recorded after 1935. She managed her son&#x27;s jazz group, Bogan&#x27;s Birmingham Busters, for a time, before moving to Los Angeles shortly before her death from coronary sclerosis in 1948. She is interred at the Lincoln Memorial Park, in Carson, California.

In 2022, she was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. The citation noted that &quot;Bogan recorded some of the most memorable blues songs of the pre-World War II era, including some that were landmarks in blues and some that continue to sensationalize her reputation decades after her death&quot;.

<text>Telford and Wrekin is a borough and unitary authority in Shropshire, England. In 1974, a non-metropolitan district of Shropshire was created called the Wrekin, named after a prominent hill to the west of Telford. In 1998, the district became a unitary authority and was renamed &quot;Telford and Wrekin&quot;, which remains part of the Shropshire ceremonial county and shares institutions such as the Fire and Rescue Service and Community Health with the rest the county. 

The borough&#x27;s major settlement is Telford, which was designated a new town in the 1960s and incorporated the towns of Dawley, Madeley, Oakengates, and Wellington. After the Telford conurbation, which includes the aforementioned towns, the next-largest settlement is Newport which is located in the northeast of the borough and is not part of the original new town of Telford.
The borough borders Staffordshire, but is surrounded by the unitary district of Shropshire which covers the area previously administered by Shropshire County Council.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the area of five former districts, plus a small part of a sixth:
*Dawley Urban District
*Newport Urban District
*Oakengates Urban District
*Wellington Rural District
*Wellington Urban District
*From Shifnal Rural District, the part of the parish of Shifnal within the designated area of Telford New Town (which was added to the parish of Lilleshall)

The district was initially called &quot;Wrekin&quot;, but during 1974 the council changed the name to &quot;The Wrekin&quot;. A significant part of the new district was within the designated area of the Telford New Town, which had been initially designated in 1963 as Dawley New Town before being enlarged and renamed to Telford in 1968. The Telford Development Corporation existed alongside the elected councils until it was wound up in 1991, running various functions such as town planning which would otherwise have been council responsibilities.

On 1 April 1998, as a result of the Local Government Commission for England&#x27;s review, the district became a unitary authority, independent from Shropshire County Council. On the same day the district&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;The Wrekin&quot; to &quot;Telford and Wrekin&quot;.

All of the council houses previously owned by Wrekin District Council and the subsequent Telford and Wrekin Council were transferred to a newly created housing association, the Wrekin Housing Trust, in 1999 which now owns the majority of social housing in Telford.

Telford and Wrekin applied unsuccessfully for city status in 2000. The district was granted borough status in 2002.

===Wards===

For the borough council itself there is a system of thirty wards to elect councillors.

<text>Munnar () is a town and hill station located in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. Munnar is situated at around above mean sea level, in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar is also called the &quot;Kashmir of South India&quot; and is a popular honeymoon destination.

==Etymology==
The name Munnar is a combination of the words &quot;Munnu&quot; and &quot;Aaru&quot; in the local languages of Malayalam/Tamil meaning &quot;three rivers&quot;, referring to its location at the confluence of the Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundali rivers.

==History==
The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years. In the early days, only Tamils and few Malayalis lived there. They were brought as workers in the tea plantations. Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar during Tipu Sultan&#x27;s campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817, who followed Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.

It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col. Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest but also paddy cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed throughout the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of Munnar&#x27;s land was suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn, and his half-brother AW Turner obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the area throughout the 1880s. Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of straw.

Eventually roads were opened to the lowlands and in Bodinayakanur in western Madras Presidency, planters got provisions from a local headman - Suppan Chetty. He and his son, Alaganan Chetty (later an MLA) would continue providing supplies to the tea estates in the region. By 1894, 26 estates were established in the hills, but all were facing losses. In 1897, a separate company, Kannan Devan Hills Corporation (KDHC) was registered to operate the tea estates which was later taken over by the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd., who owned 26 estates, most with coffee and some with cinchona, almost all in the area except for a few in the lower areas.

In 1900, a ropeway was built and eventually monorails were installed for easier transport of goods to the plains. In 1901, P. R. Buchanan took over as General Manager and began the most extensive clearing of jungles for plantations. In 1908, construction started on a new railway which opened in 1909. By 1911, around 16,000 acres of the region was under cultivation.

In 1924, a flood swept through Munnar, damaged the road and destroyed the rail track. In its place it was decided to create a ropeway to transport tea. In 1930, this in turn was replaced by a modern road that made transport much easier. By 1952, almost 28,000 acres of land was under cultivation. After Independence, Indian planters took over. In 1964, the KDHC which owned most tea estates was acquired by Tata and Finlay who started the first instant tea factory in the country. In 1971, the Kerala government wanted to reforest all land in the hills not used for plantations. However, negotiations that followed resulted in Tata keeping most of the land, leaving it with 57,000 acres.

To this day, most tea estate labourers are landless. In the early 2000s, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a Dalit outfit from Tamil Nadu, started demanding land for the labourers, started making inroads into Kerala. In 2009, VS Achuthanandan promised his support for providing land to the mainly Tamil Dalit estate labourers. However, the process became very slow and as of 2018, most families still hand no land.

The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.

==Flora and fauna==

Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resulting from creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the north east, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park to the north, the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south and the proposed Palani Hills National Park to the east.

==Endemic species==

These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including Nilgiri Thar, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the Neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).

==Land ownership==
There has been action to address the problems of property takeovers by the land mafia that have, according to successive governments, plagued the area. In 2011, the government estimated that 20,000 hectares of land had been illegally appropriated and launched a campaign of evictions that had first been mooted in 2007.

<text>A vegetative state (VS) or post-coma unresponsiveness (PCU) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. After four weeks in a vegetative state, the patient is classified as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. The term unresponsive wakefulness syndrome may be used alternatively, as &quot;vegetative state&quot; has some negative connotations among the public.

== Definition ==
There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman&#x27;s usage. There are different legal implications in different countries.

=== Medical definition ===
Per the definition of the British Royal College of Physicians of London, &quot;a wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent (or &#x27;continuing&#x27;) vegetative state&quot;.

=== &quot;Vegetative state&quot; ===
The vegetative state is a chronic or long-term condition. This condition differs from a coma: a coma is a state that lacks both awareness and wakefulness. Patients in a vegetative state may have awoken from a coma, but still have not regained awareness. In the vegetative state patients can open their eyelids occasionally and demonstrate sleep-wake cycles, but completely lack cognitive function. The vegetative state is also called a &quot;coma vigil&quot;. The chances of regaining awareness diminish considerably as the time spent in the vegetative state increases.

=== &quot;Persistent vegetative state&quot; ===
Persistent vegetative state is the standard usage (except in the UK) for a medical diagnosis, made after numerous neurological and other tests, that due to extensive and irreversible brain damage a patient is highly unlikely ever to achieve higher functions above a vegetative state. This diagnosis does not mean that a doctor has diagnosed improvement as impossible, but does open the possibility, in the US, for a judicial request to end life support. Informal guidelines hold that this diagnosis can be made after four weeks in a vegetative state. US caselaw has shown that successful petitions for termination have been made after a diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state, although in some cases, such as that of Terri Schiavo, such rulings have generated widespread controversy.

In the UK, the term is discouraged in favor of two more precisely defined terms that have been strongly recommended by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). These guidelines recommend using a &quot;continuous vegetative state&quot; for patients in a vegetative state for more than four weeks. A medical determination of a &quot;permanent vegetative state&quot; can be made if, after exhaustive testing and a customary 12 months of observation, a medical diagnosis is made that it is &quot;impossible&quot; by any informed medical expectations that the mental condition will ever improve. Hence, a &quot;continuous vegetative state&quot; in the UK may remain the diagnosis in cases that would be called &quot;persistent&quot; in the US or elsewhere.

While the actual testing criteria for a diagnosis of &quot;permanent&quot; in the UK are quite similar to the criteria for a diagnosis of &quot;persistent&quot; in the US, the semantic difference imparts in the UK a legal presumption that is commonly used in court applications for ending life support. The UK diagnosis is generally only made after 12 months of observing a static vegetative state. A diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state in the US usually still requires a petitioner to prove in court that recovery is impossible by informed medical opinion, while in the UK the &quot;permanent&quot; diagnosis already gives the petitioner this presumption and may make the legal process less time-consuming.

In common usage, the &quot;permanent&quot; and &quot;persistent&quot; definitions are sometimes conflated and used interchangeably. However, the acronym &quot;PVS&quot; is intended to define a &quot;persistent vegetative state&quot;, without necessarily the connotations of permanence, and is used as such throughout this article. Bryan Jennett, who originally coined the term &quot;persistent vegetative state&quot;, has now recommended using the UK division between continuous and permanent in his book &quot;The Vegetative State&quot;, arguing that &quot;the &#x27;persistent&#x27; component of this term ... may seem to suggest irreversibility&quot;.

The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has suggested &quot;post coma unresponsiveness&quot; as an alternative term for &quot;vegetative state&quot; in general.

=== Lack of legal clarity ===
Unlike brain death, permanent vegetative state (PVS) is recognized by &quot;statute law&quot; as death in only a very few legal systems. In the US, courts have required petitions before termination of life support that demonstrate that any recovery of cognitive functions above a vegetative state is assessed as impossible by authoritative medical opinion. In England, Wales and Scotland, the legal precedent for withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in cases of patients in a PVS was set in 1993 in the case of Tony Bland, who sustained catastrophic anoxic brain injury in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. An application to the Court of Protection is no longer required before nutrition and hydration can be withdrawn or withheld from PVS (or &#x27;minimally conscious&#x27; – MCS) patients.

This legal has led to vocal advocates that those in PVS should be allowed to die. Others are equally determined that, if recovery is at all possible, care should continue. The existence of a small number of diagnosed PVS cases that have eventually resulted in improvement makes defining recovery as &quot;impossible&quot; particularly difficult in a legal sense. This legal and ethical issue raises questions about autonomy, quality of life, appropriate use of resources, the wishes of family members, and professional responsibilities.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most PVS patients are unresponsive to external stimuli and their conditions are associated with different levels of consciousness. Some level of consciousness means a person can still respond, in varying degrees, to stimulation. A person in a coma, however, cannot. In addition, PVS patients often open their eyes in response to feeding, which has to be done by others; they are capable of swallowing, whereas patients in a coma subsist with their eyes closed.

Cerebral cortical function (e.g. communication, thinking, purposeful movement, etc.) is lost while brainstem functions (e.g. breathing, maintaining circulation and hemodynamic stability, etc.) are preserved.  Non-cognitive upper brainstem functions such as eye-opening, occasional vocalizations (e.g. crying, laughing), maintaining normal sleep patterns, and spontaneous non-purposeful movements often remain intact.

PVS patients&#x27; eyes might be in a relatively fixed position, or track moving objects, or move in a &quot;disconjugate&quot; (i.e., completely unsynchronized) manner. They may experience sleep-wake cycles, or be in a state of chronic wakefulness. They may exhibit some behaviors that can be construed as arising from partial consciousness, such as grinding their teeth, swallowing, smiling, shedding tears, grunting, moaning, or screaming without any apparent external stimulus.

Individuals in PVS are seldom on any life-sustaining equipment other than a feeding tube because the brainstem, the center of vegetative functions (such as heart rate and rhythm, respiration, and gastrointestinal activity) is relatively intact.

=== Recovery ===
Many people emerge spontaneously from a vegetative state within a few weeks. The chances of recovery depend on the extent of injury to the brain and the patient&#x27;s age – younger patients having a better chance of recovery than older patients. A 1994 report found that of those who were in a vegetative state a month after a trauma, 54% had regained consciousness by a year after the trauma, whereas 28% had died and 18% were still in the vegetative state. For non-traumatic injuries such as strokes, only 14% had recovered consciousness at one year, 47% had died, and 39% were still vegetative. Patients who were vegetative six months after the initial event were much less likely to have recovered consciousness a year after the event than in the case of those who were simply reported vegetative at one month. A &quot;New Scientist&quot; article from 2000 gives a pair of graphs showing changes of patient status during the first 12 months after head injury and after incidents depriving the brain of oxygen. After a year, the chances that a PVS patient will regain consciousness are very low and most patients who do recover consciousness experience significant disability. The longer a patient is in a PVS, the more severe the resulting disabilities are likely to be. Rehabilitation can contribute to recovery, but many patients never progress to the point of being able to take care of themselves.

The medical literature also includes case reports of the recovery of a small number of patients following the removal of assisted respiration with cold oxygen. The researchers found that in many nursing homes and hospitals unheated oxygen is given to non-responsive patients via tracheal intubation. This bypasses the warming of the upper respiratory tract and causes a chilling of aortic blood and chilling of the brain which the authors believe may contribute to the person&#x27;s nonresponsive state. The researchers describe a small number of cases in which removal of the chilled oxygen was followed by recovery from the PVS and recommend either warming of oxygen with a heated nebulizer or removal of the assisted oxygen if it is no longer needed. The authors further recommend additional research to determine if this chilling effect may either delay recovery or even may contribute to brain damage.

There are two dimensions of recovery from a persistent vegetative state: recovery of consciousness and recovery of function. Recovery of consciousness can be verified by reliable evidence of awareness of self and the environment, consistent voluntary behavioral responses to visual and auditory stimuli, and interaction with others. Recovery of function is characterized by communication, the ability to learn and to perform adaptive tasks, mobility, self-care, and participation in recreational or vocational activities. Recovery of consciousness may occur without functional recovery, but functional recovery cannot occur without recovery of consciousness.

== Causes ==
There are three main causes of PVS (persistent vegetative state):
* Acute traumatic brain injury
* Non-traumatic: neurodegenerative disorder or metabolic disorder of the brain
* Severe congenital abnormality of the central nervous system

Potential causes of PVS are:
* Meningitis
* Encephalitis
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Brain tumor 
* Brain abscess 
* Ischemic stroke 
* Intracerebral hemorrhage
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage
* Brain herniation 
* Hypoxic-anoxic brain injury
** Cardiac arrest 
** Respiratory arrest
** Cardiac arrhythmia
** Atrial fibrillation 
** Ventricular fibrillation 
** Ventricular tachycardia 
** Myocardial infarction
** Heart failure
** Drowning
** Myocarditis 
** Pericarditis 
** Cardiogenic shock
** Electrocution 
** Choking 
* Toxins such as uremia, ethanol, atropine, opiates, lead, dimethylmercury, endrin, parathion, and colloidal silver
* Physical trauma: Concussion, contusion, etc.
* Seizure, both nonconvulsive status epilepticus and postconvulsive state (postictal state)
* Electrolyte imbalance, which involves hypoxia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypocalcemia
* Postinfectious: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
* Endocrine disorders such as adrenal insufficiency and thyroid disorders
* Degenerative and metabolic diseases including urea cycle disorders, Reye syndrome, and mitochondrial disease
* Systemic infection and sepsis
* Hepatic encephalopathy

In addition, these authors claim that doctors sometimes use the mnemonic device AEIOU-TIPS to recall portions of the differential diagnosis: Alcohol ingestion and acidosis, epilepsy and encephalopathy, infection, opiates, uremia, trauma, insulin overdose or inflammatory disorders, poisoning and psychogenic causes, and shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Despite converging agreement about the definition of persistent vegetative state, recent reports have raised concerns about the accuracy of diagnosis in some patients, and the extent to which, in a selection of cases, residual cognitive functions may remain undetected and patients are diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. Objective assessment of residual cognitive function can be extremely difficult as motor responses may be minimal, inconsistent, and difficult to document in many patients, or may be undetectable in others because no cognitive output is possible. In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated an important role for functional neuroimaging in the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state; this technology is providing new insights into cerebral activity in patients with severe brain damage. Such studies, when successful, may be particularly useful where there is concern about the accuracy of the diagnosis and the possibility that residual cognitive function has remained undetected.

=== Diagnostic experiments ===
Researchers have begun to use functional neuroimaging studies to study implicit cognitive processing in patients with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Activations in response to sensory stimuli with positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electrophysiological methods can provide information on the presence, degree, and location of any residual brain function. However, use of these techniques in people with severe brain damage is methodologically, clinically, and theoretically complex and needs careful quantitative analysis and interpretation.

For example, PET studies have shown the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state. That is, an external stimulation, such as a painful stimulus, still activates &quot;primary&quot; sensory cortices in these patients but these areas are functionally disconnected from &quot;higher order&quot; associative areas needed for awareness. These results show that parts of the cortex are indeed still functioning in &quot;vegetative&quot; patients.

In addition, other PET studies have revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of auditory cortex in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary fMRI examination revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension.

Furthermore, several studies have used PET to assess the central processing of noxious somatosensory stimuli in patients in PVS. Noxious somatosensory stimulation activated midbrain, contralateral thalamus, and primary somatosensory cortex in each and every PVS patient, even in the absence of detectable cortical evoked potentials. In conclusion, somatosensory stimulation of PVS patients, at intensities that elicited pain in controls, resulted in increased neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex, even if resting brain metabolism was severely impaired. However, this activation of primary cortex seems to be isolated and dissociated from higher-order associative cortices.

Also, there is evidence of partially functional cerebral regions in catastrophically injured brains. To study five patients in PVS with different behavioral features, researchers employed PET, MRI and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. In three of the five patients, co-registered PET/MRI correlate areas of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behavior. Two patients had had anoxic injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30–40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with higher metabolic rates, that ranged up to 50–80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained &lt;50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the cortical level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioral patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioral fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who sustained severe injury to the tegmental mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical–pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains.

=== Misdiagnoses ===
Statistical PVS misdiagnosis is common. An example study with 40 patients in the United Kingdom diagnosed with PVS reported 43% of the patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed, and another 33% had recovered whilst the study was underway. Some PVS cases may actually be a misdiagnosis of patients being in an undiagnosed minimally conscious state. Since the exact diagnostic criteria of the minimally conscious state were only formulated in 2002, there may be chronic patients diagnosed as PVS before the secondary notion of the minimally conscious state became known.

Whether or not there is any conscious awareness with a patient&#x27;s vegetative state is a prominent issue. Three completely different aspects of this should be distinguished. First, some patients can be conscious simply because they are misdiagnosed (see above). In fact, they are not in vegetative states. Second, sometimes a patient was correctly diagnosed but is then examined during the early stages of recovery. Third, perhaps some day the notion itself of vegetative states will change so to include elements of conscious awareness. Inability to disentangle these three example cases causes confusion. An example of such confusion is the response to an experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging which revealed that a woman diagnosed with PVS was able to activate predictable portions of her brain in response to the tester&#x27;s requests that she imagine herself playing tennis or moving from room to room in her house. The brain activity in response to these instructions was indistinguishable from those of healthy patients.

In 2010, Martin Monti and fellow researchers, working at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge, reported in an article in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; that some patients in persistent vegetative states responded to verbal instructions by displaying different patterns of brain activity on fMRI scans. Five out of a total of 54 diagnosed patients were apparently able to respond when instructed to think about one of two different physical activities. One of these five was also able to &quot;answer&quot; yes or no questions, again by imagining one of these two activities. It is unclear, however, whether the fact that portions of the patients&#x27; brains light up on fMRI could help these patients assume their own medical decision making.

In November 2011, a publication in &quot;The Lancet&quot; presented bedside EEG apparatus and indicated that its signal could be used to detect awareness in three of 16 patients diagnosed in the vegetative state.

==Treatment==
Currently no treatment for vegetative state exists that would satisfy the efficacy criteria of evidence-based medicine. Several methods have been proposed which can roughly be subdivided into four categories: pharmacological methods, surgery, physical therapy, and various stimulation techniques. Pharmacological therapy mainly uses activating substances such as tricyclic antidepressants or methylphenidate. Mixed results have been reported using dopaminergic drugs such as amantadine and bromocriptine and stimulants such as dextroamphetamine. Surgical methods such as deep brain stimulation are used less frequently due to the invasiveness of the procedures. Stimulation techniques include sensory stimulation, sensory regulation, music and musicokinetic therapy, social-tactile interaction, and cortical stimulation.

=== Zolpidem ===
There is limited evidence that the hypnotic drug zolpidem has an effect. The results of the few scientific studies that have been published so far on the effectiveness of zolpidem have been contradictory.

== Epidemiology ==
In the United States, it is estimated that there may be between 15,000 and 40,000 patients who are in a persistent vegetative state, but due to poor nursing home records exact figures are hard to determine.

== History ==
The syndrome was first described in 1940 by Ernst Kretschmer who called it &quot;apallic syndrome&quot;. However the term &quot;vegetative&quot; had been attested to in the OED since 1764, then described as &quot;an organic body capable of growth and development but devoid of sensation and thought.&quot; Thus the related term &quot;persistent vegetative state&quot; was coined in 1972 by Scottish spinal surgeon Bryan Jennett and American neurologist Fred Plum to describe a syndrome that seemed to have been made possible by medicine&#x27;s increased capacities to keep patients&#x27; bodies alive.

== Society and culture ==

===Ethics and policy===
An ongoing debate exists as to how much care, if any, patients in a persistent vegetative state should receive in health systems plagued by limited resources. In a case before the New Jersey Superior Court, &quot;Betancourt v. Trinitas Hospital&quot;, a community hospital sought a ruling that dialysis and CPR for such a patient constitutes futile care. An American bioethicist, Jacob M. Appel, argued that any money spent treating PVS patients would be better spent on other patients with a higher likelihood of recovery.
The patient died naturally prior to a decision in the case, resulting in the court finding the issue moot.

In 2010, British and Belgian researchers reported in an article in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; that some patients in persistent vegetative states actually had enough consciousness to &quot;answer&quot; yes or no questions on fMRI scans. However, it is unclear whether the fact that portions of the patients&#x27; brains light up on fMRI will help these patient assume their own medical decision making. Professor Geraint Rees, Director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, responded to the study by observing that, &quot;As a clinician, it would be important to satisfy oneself that the individual that you are communicating with is competent to make those decisions. At the moment it is premature to conclude that the individual able to answer 5 out of 6 yes/no questions is fully conscious like you or I.&quot; In contrast, Jacob M. Appel of the Mount Sinai Hospital told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that this development could be a welcome step toward clarifying the wishes of such patients. Appel stated: &quot;I see no reason why, if we are truly convinced such patients are communicating, society should not honour their wishes. In fact, as a physician, I think a compelling case can be made that doctors have an ethical obligation to assist such patients by removing treatment. I suspect that, if such individuals are indeed trapped in their bodies, they may be living in great torment and will request to have their care terminated or even active euthanasia.&quot;

<text>Ourense (; ) is a city and the capital of the province of Ourense, located in the autonomous community of Galicia, northwestern Spain. It is on the Camino Sanabrés path of the Way of St James (Camino de Santiago), and is crossed by the Miño, Barbaña, Loña and Barbañica rivers. It is also known as &quot;A cidade das Burgas&quot; (in Galician) due to its hot springs, being one of the European cities with the greatest thermal heritage.

==Population==
Its population of 105,233 (2019) accounts for 34.2% of the population of the province and makes it the third largest city of Galicia. Its metropolitan area has a population that exceeds 140,000.

In 2019 there were 14,171 foreigners living in the city, representing 13.5% of the total population. The main nationalities are Portuguese (31.8%), Venezuelans (11.2%) and Romanians (7.9%).

By language, according to 2018 data, 32.3% of the population always speak in Galician, 17.1% always speak in Spanish and the rest use both interchangeably.

==History==
The origin of the town can be traced to the Romans and the presence of hot springs called the Burgas. These can still be seen today. There was also the need to fortify the place to protect one of the easiest ways to cross the Miño River. After the Romans, Ourense was part of the Suebi (Suevi) kingdom during most of the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries and was destroyed by the Moors in 716. It was later rebuilt by Alfonso III of Asturias about 877. The Norse invasions as well as attacks from the Arab warlord Al-Mansur once more laid the city to waste. It was only under Sancho II and his sister Doña Elvira that the city was resettled during the 11th century. The definitive urban impulse did not arrive until the 12th century when Ourense became an important center of services. Recently the city has made many efforts to provide new parks, bridges, fountains and geothermal springs installations to make the city more attractive.

In the Middle Ages, there was a Jewish community in Ourense, until the 1492 expulsion of the Jews.

==Geography and geothermal springs==
The ancient city of Auria is located on both banks of the Miño river in the south-central part of Galicia, at an elevation of 128 meters above sea level.

Four rivers cross the town: Miño (the main river), Barbaña, Loña and Barbañica. The biggest river divides a rather industrial western suburb, which contains the railroad station, from the main town. Three highway and one railroad bridge cross the river in addition to the famous Roman bridge, Ponte Vella, which is now closed to vehicle traffic. The town is surrounded by forests, mainly oak and pine.

One of the main tourist attractions is related to hot springs, as Ourense holds one of the greatest amount of geothermal water in Europe, becoming one of the six founding cities of the European Association of Historic Thermal Cities in 2009. It is estimated that three million liters of hot springs flow every day throughout the province. There are several places called &quot;pozas, burgas&quot; (galician terms) or &quot;termas&quot; (shared term between galician and spanish), with or without entrance fee, where you can have a bath outdoors. One of them (As Burgas) is located inside the old town centre, relating to the ancient Roman tradition, as ruins of a Roman bath were discovered and are now open to visitors.

There are more hot springs located along the river Miño:

* Termas da Chavasqueira. They are located near the fire station and the main entrance to the city, surrounded by green areas and the Miño river. Its waters flow at 63 °C and are bicarbonated, fluorinated, and sulfurized with medium mineralization.
* Fonte do Tinteiro. It is a manual traction fountain that expels low-mineralized, alkaline, sulphurous, fluorinated and mesothermal waters, located just 500 meters from the A Chavasqueira thermal area, at a 43 °C temperature.
* Pozas do Muíño da Veiga. They are located 3 km from the city, next to an old renovated mill. The space has a large main hot spring of 200m2, a second of 130 m2 and two others of 55 and 45 meters respectively. Its waters flow at a temperature between 65 °C and 72 °C. As for its composition, they are low-mineralized, fluorinated, silicated and alkaline waters.
* Pozas de Outariz. They&#x27;re near the Pozas do Muíño da Veiga, 4 km from the city, and have two different parts separated by a pedestrian bridge that connects the OU-402 road with the enclosure: at the top are the &quot;Pozas de Outariz&quot; hot springs and at the bottom the &quot;Burgas de Canedo&quot; ones. The waters of this enclosure are low-mineralized, fluorinated, silicated and bicarbonated. The temperature at which these waters flow is 60 °C.

==Climate==
Ourense has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa). Summers have hot daytime temperatures around , while winters are wet with daytime highs at and lows a few degrees above freezing. On August 3, 2018, Ourense recorded its then hottest day on record at 42.7 °C (108.9 °F); this was beaten on 14 July 2022 when it reached 44.1 °C (111.4 °F). It is a microclimate generated by the unique orography of Ourense, affected by the Miño river valley, since the climate of Galicia is generally considered transitional oceanic or warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb).

==Economy==
The economy of the city of Ourense is marked by a predominance of service sector provision. The city has the largest shopping and leisure in the province, and administrative services (Xunta delegation, central and provincial government offices), educational (a campus of the University of Vigo) and health services (Ourense Hospital Complex). The construction industry is also important. Copasa, one of the biggest Galician construction companies, has its headquarters in the city.

The industrial area of San Cibrao das Viñas has many light industries including several important clothing factories, like Adolfo Dominguez and Roberto Verino, as well as automotive supplier industries.

Ourense is a well known producer of European chestnuts (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;). Coren, one of the Spanish agricultural sector&#x27;s most important companies, has its headquarters in Ourense.

The most read province newspaper is &quot;La Región&quot;.

==Sights==
[[Ourense Cathedral]].
Although mainly a town of services, Ourense is not without its tourist sites. The town has three parts: the medieval, the area of 19th-century expansion, and the modern perimeter. Many who pass by on the highway linking Madrid to Vigo are unaware of the medieval quarter, with its narrow streets and tiny plazas. Once an area of a certain dilapidated charm the area is now undergoing renovation and is full of typical restaurants and bars patronized by the university students of the town. The Plaza Mayor is the center of city life with its arcaded shops and the Town Hall.

The Cathedral is the most important monument in Ourense. This cathedral (founded 572; rebuilt in the 13th century) is the second oldest in Galicia. It occupies the same site as the Suevian basilica that stood there in earlier times. Romanesque in structure, but with a mixture of Romanesque and Gothic styles, it is rather hidden away but, contains a façade with the Door of Paradise in imitation of the Door of Glory of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Inside, the Capilla del Cristo, or Christ&#x27;s Chapel (16th century), contains a crucifix venerated throughout Galicia.

The Miño is crossed at Ourense by the Ponte Vella (Old Bridge). With Roman foundations, it was reconstructed by Bishop Lorenzo in 1230 but frequently repaired since then; it has seven arches and a central span of 141 feet (43 m).

La Ruta de la Plata (the silver route in English) and the Portuguese Way, different routes on the Camino de Santiago, both pass directly through Ourense. La Ruta de la Plata, the longest of all the Camino&#x27;s routes, begins in Sevilla and moves north through the west of the country. The pilgrims on both routes are important to Ourense&#x27;s tourism industry, especially in holy years of St. James when traffic on the Camino is especially high.

==Politics==
==Transport==
The city is served by the Ourense Railway Station.

==Barallete==
Barallete was the name of an argot employed by the traditional knife-sharpeners and umbrella makers (&quot;afiadores e paragüeiros&quot;) of Ourense. It was based on the Galician language as spoken in Ourense, but its users substituted everyday words with invented ones of no linguistic connection, making it impossible for other people to understand it.

==Sport==
The town has a long but turbulent history of association football. UD Orensana was founded in 1935 after a merger of two local clubs. It was dissolved in 1952 and CD Ourense was founded in its place. They fell into financial trouble in 2014 and were dissolved. Ponte Ourense Club de Fútbol, founded in 1977, changed its name in 2014 to Ourense CF.

<doc id="300632" wikidata="Q1123840" url="?curid=300632" title="Symbols of Europe">
<text>A number of symbols of Europe have emerged since antiquity, notably the mythological figure of &quot;Europa&quot;.
Several symbols were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by the European Council. The European Communities created additional symbols for itself in 1985, which was to become inherited by the European Union (EU) in 1993. Such symbols of the European Union now represent political positions in support of EU policies and European integration as advocated by Europeans.

== Europa and the bull==


&quot;Europa&quot; was used as a geographical term, for one of the great divisions of the known world, by Herodotus (in a reduced geographical scope, referring to parts of Thrace or Epirus, also in the Homeric hymn to Apollo). It became the geographical term for the landmass west of the Tanais in the Roman-era geography by Strabo and Ptolemy.
&quot;Europa&quot; first began to be used in a cultural sense, denoting the territory of Latin Christendom, in the Carolingian period.

&quot;Europa&quot; is a feminine name, the name of a nymph in Hesiod, and in a legend first related by Herodotus, the name of a Phoenician noble-woman abducted by Greeks (in Herodotus&#x27; opinion, Cretans). The classical legend of Europa being abducted not by Greek pirates but by Zeus in the shape of a bull is told in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. According to the account, Zeus took the guise of a tame white bull and mixed himself with the herds of Europa&#x27;s father. While Europa and her female attendants were gathering flowers, she saw the bull, and got onto his back. Zeus took that opportunity and ran to the sea and swam, with her on his back, to the island of Crete. There he revealed his true identity, and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Zeus gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus and three additional gifts: Talos, Laelaps and a javelin that never missed. Zeus later re-created the shape of the white bull in the stars, which is now known as the constellation Taurus.

In addition to generally being a frequent motif in European art since Greco-Roman times, the founding myth of Europa and the bull has frequently been alluded to in relation to the continent and by the modern European Union, and can thus be considered not only a piece of toponymy, but also as a symbol, or national personification of Europe. For instance, statues of Europa and the bull are located outside several of the European Union&#x27;s institutions, as well as on the Greek €2 coin. Europa&#x27;s name appeared on postage stamps commemorating the Council of Europe, which were first issued in 1956. Furthermore, the dome of the European Parliament&#x27;s Paul-Henri Spaak building contains a large mosaic by Aligi Sassu portraying the abduction of Europa with other elements of Greek mythology. The bull is also in the top-left corner of the new design of the residence permit card of all European Union countries.

==Europa regina==
Europa regina (Latin for &quot;Queen Europe&quot;) is the cartographic depiction of the European continent as a queen. Introduced and made popular during the mannerist period, &quot;Europa Regina&quot; is the map-like depiction of the European continent as a queen. Made popular in the 16th century, the map shows Europe as a young and graceful woman wearing imperial regalia. The Iberian Peninsula (&quot;Hispania&quot;) is the head, wearing a crown shaped like the Carolingian hoop crown. The Pyrenees, forming the neck, separate the Iberian Peninsula from France (Gallia), which makes up the upper chest. The Holy Roman Empire (Germania and other territories) is the centre of the torso, with Bohemia (sometimes Austria in early depictions) being the heart of the woman (alternatively described as a medallion at her waist). Her long gown stretches to Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Livonia, Bulgaria, Muscovy, Macedonia and Greece. In her arms, formed by Italy and Denmark, she holds a sceptre and an orb (Sicily). In most depictions, Africa, Asia and the Scandinavian peninsula are partially shown, as are the British Isles, in schematic form.

The first map to depict Europe in this manner was made by Johannes Bucius Aenicola (1516–1542) in 1537. Though much about the origination and initial perception of this map is uncertain, it is known that Putsch maintained close relations with Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg, and that the map&#x27;s popularity increased significantly during the second half of the 16th century. &quot;Europa Regina&quot; was introduced in the 1530s by the Austrian cartographer Johannes Putsch, possibly with the intent of depicting Europe as the spouse of Charles V of Habsburg, who aspired to become the universal monarch of Christendom and reigned over numerous realms including the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian lands, Burgundian territories, and the kingdom of Spain. Arguments in favour of this hypothesis are the westward orientation of the map to have &quot;Hispania&quot; as the crowned head, said to resemble the face of Charles V&#x27;s wife, Isabella of Portugal; the use of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s &quot;insignia&quot; – its Carolingian crown, sceptre and orb – and the portrayal of Habsburg realms (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, Germany) as the heart and centre of the body; the design of the gown, which resembles the contemporary dress code at the Habsburg court. As in contemporary portraits of couples, &quot;Europa regina&quot; has her head turned to her right and also holds the orb with her right hand, which has been interpreted as facing and offering power to her imaginary husband, the emperor. More general, Europe is shown as the &quot;res publica christiana&quot;, the united Christendom in medieval tradition, and great or even dominant power in the world.

Another allegory is the attribution of Europe as the paradise by special placement of the water bodies. As contemporary iconography depicted the paradise as a closed form, &quot;Europa regina&quot; is enclosed by seas and rivers. The Danube river is depicted in a way that it resembles the course of the biblical river flowing through the paradise, with its estuary formed by four arms. That &quot;Europa regina&quot; is surrounded by water is also an allusion to the mythological Europa, who was abducted by Zeus and carried over the water. &quot;Europa regina&quot; belongs to the Early Modern allegory of &quot;Europa triumphans&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Europa deplorans&quot;.

==Pater Europae==

Charlemagne (; King of the Franks from 768; Holy Roman Emperor c. 742814), also known as Charles the Great, is considered the founder of the French and German monarchies. Known as &quot;Pater Europae&quot; («Father of Europe»), he established an empire that represented the most expansive European unification since the fall of the Western Roman Empire and brought about a renaissance that formed a pan-European identity whilst marking the end of Late Antiquity. There was also a contemporary intellectual and cultural revival which profoundly marked the history of Western Europe. This gave Charlemagne a legendary standing that transcended his military accomplishments.

For many centuries, European royal houses sought to associate themselves with the Carolingian heritage. The crowns of the Holy Roman Empire and Napoleon Bonaparte were for instance both respectively named &quot;The Crown of Charlemagne&quot;, and Charlemagne&#x27;s personal sword, &quot;Joyeuse&quot;, served as a coronation sword for French kings from the 11th century onwards. The cult of Charlemagne was further embellished by the French renaissance author Jean Lemaire de Belges, who postulated that the emperor was part of an illustrious &quot;translatio imperii&quot; originating with King Priam of Troy during the Trojan Wars, and thus by extension Zeus, the &quot;Father of Gods and men&quot; in Greek Mythology.

Today, much of the pan-European, symbolic value of Charlemagne is attributed to the fact that he is considered an embodiment of the Franco-German friendship which was absent during the long-lasting enmity which culminated in the two world wars, but has become indispensable in the process of European integration. Thus, in the 1952 design competition for the Council of Europe&#x27;s flag, several of the unsuccessful proposals were redolent of the &quot;Oriflamme&quot;; the banner given to Charlemagne by Pope Leo III at his coronation in the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the year 800. Similarities between Charlemagne&#x27;s empire and the modern European integration were also suggested by professor Hans von Hentig the same year. The European Commission is also alluding to Charlemagne by means of naming one of its central buildings in Brussels after him (The Charlemagne building). The German city of Aachen has since 1949 annually awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unity, including Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet and the euro itself. Each edition of the international affairs newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; features a column called «Charlemagne&#x27;s notebook», focusing on European Union affairs. In his speech at the award ceremony for the 2010 Charlemagne Youth Prize, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek said the following:
Later monarchs who also have carried sobriquets as &quot;relatives&quot; of Europe include Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (&quot;grandmother of Europe&quot;), Christian IX of Denmark and Nicholas I of Montenegro (both respectively &quot;father-in-law of Europe&quot;). These late 19th and early 20th century sobriquets are however purely on account of the marriage of these monarchs&#x27; offspring to foreign princes and princesses, and involve no wider symbolism.

==Patron saints==
The Roman Catholic Church venerates six saints as &quot;patrons of Europe&quot;. Benedict of Nursia had been declared &quot;Patron saint of all Europe&quot; by Pope Paul VI in 1964.
Pope John Paul II named between 1980 and 1999 Ss. Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross as co-patrons.

==Flag==
A &quot;Flag of Europe&quot; was introduced by the Council of Europe in 1955, originally intended as a &quot;symbol for the whole of Europe&quot;, 
but due to its adoption by the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1985, and hence by the European Union (EU) as the successor organisation of the EEC, the flag is now strongly associated with the European Union so that it no longer serves the function of representing &quot;Europe as a whole&quot; at least since the early 2000s. 
The flag has notably been used by pro-EU protestors in the colour revolutions of the 2000s, e.g., in Belarus in 2004 by the pro-EU faction in the Euromaidan riots in Ukraine in 2013, and by the pro-EU faction in the Brexit campaigns of 2016.

===Pan-European flags adopted before 1955===

Prior to development of political institutions, flags representing Europe were limited to unification movements. The most popular were the European Movement&#x27;s large green &#x27;E&#x27; on a white background, and the &quot;Pan European flag&quot; of the Paneuropean Union (1922).

<text>Science fantasy is a hybrid genre within speculative fiction that simultaneously draws upon or combines tropes and elements from both science fiction and fantasy. In a conventional science fiction story, the world is presented as grounded by the laws of nature and comprehensible by science, while a conventional fantasy story contains mostly supernatural elements that do not obey the scientific laws of the real world. The world of science fantasy, however, is laid out to be scientifically logical and often supplied with hard science-like explanations of any supernatural elements.

During the Golden Age of Science Fiction, science fantasy stories were seen in sharp contrast to the terse, scientifically plausible material that came to dominate mainstream science fiction, typified by the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Although science fantasy stories at that time were often relegated to the status of children&#x27;s entertainment, their freedom of imagination and romance proved to be an early major influence on the &quot;New Wave&quot; writers of the 1960s, who became exasperated by the limitations of &quot;Hard Science Fiction&quot;.

==Historical view==
The term &quot;science fantasy&quot; was coined in 1935 by critic Forrest J. Ackerman as a synonym for science fiction. In the 1950s, the British journalist Walter Gillings considered science fantasy as a part of science fiction that was not plausible from the point of view of the science of the time (for example, the use of nuclear weapons in H.G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The World Set Free&quot; was a science fantasy from the point of view of Newtonian physics and a work of science fiction from the point of view of Einstein&#x27;s theory). In 1948, writer Marion Zimmer (later known as Marion Zimmer Bradley) called &quot;science fantasy&quot; a mixture of science fiction and fantasy in &quot;Startling Stories&quot; magazine. Critic Judith Murry considered science fantasy as works of fantasy in which magic has a natural scientific basis. Science fiction critic John Clute chose the narrower term &quot;technological fantasy&quot; from the broader concept of &quot;science fiction&quot;. The label first came into wide use after many science fantasy stories were published in the American pulp magazines, such as Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Magic, Inc.&quot;, L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Slaves of Sleep&quot;, and Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s Harold Shea series. All were relatively rationalistic stories published in John W. Campbell Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Unknown&quot; magazine. These were a deliberate attempt to apply the techniques and attitudes of science fiction to traditional fantasy subjects.

Distinguishing between pure science fiction and pure fantasy, Rod Serling argued that the former was &quot;the improbable made possible&quot; while the latter was &quot;the impossible made probable&quot;. As a combination of the two, science fantasy gives a scientific veneer of realism to things that simply could not happen in the real world under any circumstances. Where science fiction does not permit the existence of fantastical or supernatural elements, science fantasy explicitly relies upon them to complement the scientific elements.

In explaining the intrigue of science fantasy, Carl D. Malmgren provides an intro regarding C. S. Lewis&#x27;s speculation on the emotional needs at work in the subgenre: &quot;In the counternatural worlds of science fantasy, the imaginary and the actual, the magical and the prosaic, the mythical and the scientific, meet and interanimate. In so doing, these worlds inspire us with new sensations and experiences, with [quoting C. S. Lewis] &#x27;such beauty, awe, or terror as the actual world does not supply&#x27;, with the stuff of desires, dreams, and dread.&quot;

Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore published novels in &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, alone and together, which were far more romantic. These were closely related to the work that they and others were doing for outlets like &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, such as Moore&#x27;s Northwest Smith stories.

Ace Books published a number of books as science fantasy during the 1950s and 1960s.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; points out that as a genre, science fantasy &quot;has never been clearly defined&quot;, and was most commonly used in the period between 1950 and 1966.

The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise created by Gene Roddenberry is sometimes cited as an example of science fantasy. Writer James F. Broderick describes &quot;Star Trek&quot; as science fantasy because it includes semi-futuristic as well as supernatural/fantasy elements such as The Q. According to the late science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, many purists argue that &quot;Star Trek&quot; is science fantasy rather than science fiction because of its scientifically improbable elements, which he partially agreed with.

The status of &quot;Star Wars&quot; as a science fantasy franchise has been debated. In 2015, George Lucas stated that &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; isn&#x27;t a science-fiction film, it&#x27;s a fantasy film and a space opera&quot;.

<text>Oskar Benjamin Klein (; 15 September 1894 – 5 February 1977) was a Swedish theoretical physicist.

Oskar Klein is known for his work on Kaluza–Klein theory, which is partially named after him.

==Biography==

Klein was born in Danderyd outside Stockholm, son of the chief rabbi of Stockholm, Gottlieb Klein from Humenné in Kingdom of Hungary, now Slovakia and Antonie (Toni) Levy. He became a student of Svante Arrhenius at the Nobel Institute at a young age and was on the way to Jean-Baptiste Perrin in France when World War I broke out and he was drafted into the military.

From 1917, he worked a few years with Niels Bohr in the University of Copenhagen and received his doctoral degree at the University College of Stockholm (now Stockholm University) in 1921. In 1923, he received a professorship at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and moved there with his recently wedded wife, Gerda Koch from Denmark. Klein returned to Copenhagen in 1925, spent some time with Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden, then became docent at Lund University in 1926 and in 1930 accepted the offer of the professorial chair in physics at the Stockholm University College, which had previously been held by Erik Ivar Fredholm until his death in 1927. Klein was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1959. He retired as professor emeritus in 1962.

Klein discovered in 1926 the Klein-Gordon equation, the simplest and prototypical example of relativistic wave equation. It describes the behavior of scalar fields, such as e.g., those associated to the pions. 
Walter Gordon, independently discovered and published the equation a few months later, as well as Vladimir Fock.
The Klein-Gordon equation is an example of Stigler&#x27;s law as it was first discovered by Erwin Schrödinger in 1925 but not published until after Klein, Gordon and Fock&#x27;s papers because Schrödinger was initially discouraged by the fact that it did not give the right fine structure for the hydrogen atom.

Klein is also credited for inventing the idea, part of Kaluza–Klein theory, that extra dimensions may be physically real but curled up and very small, an idea essential to string theory.

In 1938, he proposed a boson-exchange model for charge-charging weak interactions (radioactive decay), a few years after a similar proposal by Hideki Yukawa. His model was based on a local isotropic gauge symmetry and anticipated the later successful theory of Yang–Mills.

Oskar Klein died on 5 February 1977 in Stockholm, Sweden.

The Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture, held annually at the University of Stockholm, has been named after him. The Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics in Stockholm, Sweden is also in his honor.

Oskar Klein is the grandfather of Helle Klein.

<doc id="300651" wikidata="Q985517" url="?curid=300651" title="Alfama">
<text>The Alfama () is the oldest neighborhood of Lisbon, spreading on the slope between the São Jorge Castle and the Tagus river. The district includes the &quot;freguesias&quot; (parishes) of São Miguel, Santo Estêvão, São Vicente de Fora and part of the two streets, &quot;Freguesia da Sé: Rua do Barão&quot; and &quot;Rua São João da Praça&quot;. It contains many important historical attractions, as well as an abundance of Fado bars and restaurants.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Alfama&quot; originates from the Arabic &quot;al-ḥamma&quot; (), meaning &quot;hot springs&quot;. The Arabic word comes from the root meaning &quot;to heat&quot; or &quot;to become hot&quot;, from which the word hammam () also derives.

== History ==
The Rua do Barão is one of the streets of the Freguesia da Sé, which begins at the Rua São João da Praça (where once stood the Door of the Alfama) and ends at Rua Augusto Rosa (at the Cathedral&#x27;s walls). The toponym &quot;Rua do Barão&quot; is because João Fernandes da Silveira, the first Baron of Alvito, minister of Portuguese kings Dom Afonso V and Dom João II, lived here.

During the times of Moorish rule, Alfama constituted the whole of the city, which later spread to the West (Baixa neighbourhood). Alfama became inhabited by the fishermen and the poor, and its condition as the neighbourhood of the poor continues to this day.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake did not destroy the Alfama, which has remained a labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares. Lately the neighbourhood has been restored with the renovation of old houses and new restaurants where Fado is sometimes played.

Overlooking the Alfama is the medieval Castle of São Jorge, royal residence until the early 16th century with views of the city. In the slopes of Alfama there are other terraces (&quot;miradouros&quot;) from which to see the city, like the &quot;Miradouro de Santa Luzia&quot;, near the church of the same name and over remnants of the Moorish city walls, and the &quot;Miradouro das Portas do Sol&quot; (Gates of the Sun). Near Miradouro of Santa Luzia is located the Museum of Decorative Arts (&quot;Museu de Artes Decorativas&quot;), a 17th-century mansion.

From 2012, Alfama is part of the freguesia of Santa Maria Maior.

==Landmarks==
Among the churches of the Alfama are Lisbon Cathedral (12th–14th centuries), the oldest of the city and located to the West of the neighbourhood, the Convent of the Grace (&quot;Convento da Graça&quot;, 18th century), near the Castle, the mannerist Monastery of São Vicente de Fora (late 16th–18th century), where the Kings of the House of Braganza are buried, and the baroque Church of Santa Engrácia (17th century), now converted into a National Pantheon for important Portuguese personalities.

<doc id="300658" wikidata="Q1260663" url="?curid=300658" title="Evans (surname)">
<text>Evans is a male name and surname of Welsh, and possibly Cornish, origin. Within Wales it is the fifth most common surname and is the tenth most common in England. Within the United States, it is ranked as the 48th-most common surname.

==Origin==
A modern variation, is used as a masculine version of the hebrew name Eve. Though, the traditional name Evans is of Welsh origin. In its anglicised form, the name means &quot;son of Evan&quot;. Regarding its Welsh roots, it is a derivative of the name Ifan, a cognate of John. In the Welsh language, the &quot;f&quot; produces the &quot;v&quot; sound; &quot;Ifan&quot; (&quot;Ivan&quot;) became &quot;Evan&quot;. 

Another school of thought is that ‘Evan’ ( Yvain, Yvainne) is the Latinised Norman-French derivation of ‘Owain’. An example of this is ‘Yvain des Galles’ , better known as ‘Owain Llawgoch’ in his native Wales.
In the Welsh language the patronymic &quot;ab Evan&quot; resulted in the anglicized surname &quot;Bevan&quot;, which is also common in Wales. Evans is a popular name in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, United States of America, Canada, and Australia.

The similarity to the Slavic name Ivan is not accidental, as it is also a cognate of John.

<doc id="300659" wikidata="Q774621" url="?curid=300659" title="Midnight sun">
<text>Midnight sun, also known as polar day, is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the Sun remains visible at the local midnight. When midnight sun is seen in the Arctic, the Sun appears to move from left to right. In Antarctica, the equivalent apparent motion is from right to left. This occurs at latitudes ranging from approximately 65°44&#x27; to exactly 90° north or south, and does not stop exactly at the Arctic Circle or the Antarctic Circle, due to refraction.

The opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs in winter, when the Sun stays below the horizon throughout the day.

== Geography ==

Because there are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle, apart from research stations, the countries and territories whose populations experience midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle: Canada (Yukon, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories), Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States (state of Alaska).

The largest city in the world north of the Arctic Circle, Murmansk, Russia, experiences midnight sun from 22 May to 22 July (62 days).

A quarter of Finland&#x27;s territory lies north of the Arctic Circle, and at the country&#x27;s northernmost point the Sun does not set at all for 72 days during summer.

In Svalbard, Norway, the northernmost inhabited region of Europe, there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August. The extreme sites are the poles, where the Sun can be continuously visible for half the year. The North Pole has midnight sun for about 6 months, from approximately 18 March to 24 September. South Pole, Antarctica has midnight sun and experiences this from approximately 20 September to 23 March (about 6 months).

=== Polar circle proximity ===
Due to atmospheric refraction, and also because the Sun is a disc rather than a point in the sky, midnight sun may be experienced at latitudes slightly south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle, though not exceeding one degree (depending on local conditions). For example, Iceland is known for its midnight sun, even though most of it (Grímsey is the exception) is slightly south of the Arctic Circle. For the same reasons, the period of sunlight at the poles is slightly longer than six months. Even the northern extremities of the United Kingdom (and places at similar latitudes, such as Saint Petersburg) experience twilight throughout the night in the northern sky at around the summer solstice.

Places sufficiently close to the poles, such as Alert, Nunavut, experience times where it does not get entirely dark at night yet the Sun does not rise either, combining effects of midnight sun and polar night, reaching civil twilight during the &quot;day&quot; and astronomical twilight at &quot;night&quot;.

=== White nights ===
Locations where the Sun remains less than 6 (or 7) degrees below the horizonbetween about 60° 34’ (or 59° 34’) latitude and the polar circleexperience midnight twilight instead of midnight sun, so that daytime activities, such as reading, are still possible without artificial light on a clear night. This happens in both Northern Hemisphere summer solstice and Southern Hemisphere summer solstice. The lowest latitude to experience midnight sun without a golden hour is about 72°34′ North or South.

White Nights have become a common symbol of Saint Petersburg, Russia, where they occur from about 11 June to 1 July, and the last 10 days of June are celebrated with cultural events known as the White Nights Festival. The phenomenon carries similar significance for Fairbanks, Alaska, where an annual Midnight Sun Game baseball competition has been contested since 1906 in the twilight surrounding midnight on June 21.

The northernmost tip of Antarctica also experiences white nights near the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice.

== Explanation ==

Since the axial tilt of Earth is considerable (23 degrees, 26 minutes, 21.41196 seconds), at high latitudes the Sun does not set in summer; rather, it remains continuously visible for one day during the summer solstice at the polar circle, for several weeks only closer to the pole, and for six months at the pole. At extreme latitudes, midnight sun is usually referred to as polar day.

At the poles themselves, the Sun rises and sets only once each year on the equinoxes. During the six months that the Sun is above the horizon, it spends the days appearing to continuously move in circles around the observer, gradually spiraling higher and reaching its highest circuit of the sky at the summer solstice, before beginning to sink lower, setting just after the autumnal equinox.

==Time zones and daylight saving time==
The term &quot;midnight sun&quot; refers to the consecutive 24-hour periods of sunlight experienced north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle. Other phenomena are sometimes referred to as &quot;midnight sun&quot;, but they are caused by time zones and the observance of daylight saving time. For instance, in Fairbanks, Alaska, which is south of the Arctic Circle, the Sun sets at 12:47a.m. at the summer solstice. This is because Fairbanks is 51 minutes (1 hour and 51 minutes at Daylight Savings Time) ahead of its idealized time zone (as most of the state is in one time zone) and Alaska observes daylight saving time. (Fairbanks is at about 147.72 degrees west, corresponding to UTC−9 hours 51 minutes, and is on UTC−9 in winter.) This means that solar culmination occurs at about 12:51p.m. instead of at 12 noon. Also in Fairbanks, Alaska, solar midnight occurs at 01:51 a.m. local time.

If a precise moment for the genuine &quot;midnight sun&quot; is required, the observer&#x27;s longitude, the local civil time, and the equation of time must be taken into account. The moment of the Sun&#x27;s closest approach to the horizon coincides with its passing due north at the observer&#x27;s position, which occurs only approximately at midnight in general. Each degree of longitude east of the Greenwich meridian makes the vital moment exactly 4 minutes earlier than midnight as shown on the clock, while each hour that the local civil time is ahead of coordinated universal time (UTC, also known as GMT) makes the moment an hour later. These two effects must be added. Furthermore, the equation of time (which depends on the date) must be added: a positive value on a given date means that the Sun is running slightly ahead of its average position, so the value must be subtracted.

As an example, at the North Cape of Norway at midnight on June 21/22, the longitude of 25.9 degrees east makes the moment 103.2 minutes earlier by clock time; but the local time, 2 hours ahead of GMT in the summer, makes it 120 minutes later by clock time. The equation of time at that date is -2.0 minutes. Therefore, the Sun&#x27;s lowest elevation occurs 120 - 103.2 + 2.0 minutes after midnight: at 00.19 Central European Summer time. On other nearby dates the only thing different is the equation of time, so this remains a reasonable estimate for a considerable period. The Sun&#x27;s altitude remains within half a degree of the minimum of about 5 degrees for about 45 minutes either side of this time.

When it rotates on its own axis, it sometimes moves closer to the Sun. During this period of Earth&#x27;s rotation from May to July, Earth tilts at an angle of 23.5 degrees above its own axis in its orbit. This causes the part of Norway located in the Arctic region at the North Pole of Earth to move very close to the Sun and during this time the length of the day increases. It can be said that it almost never subsides. Night falls in Norway&#x27;s Hammerfest at this particular time of year. 

==Duration==

The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the closer one goes toward either pole. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice, midnight sun can be seen as much as outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the furthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly from year to year.

Even though at the Arctic Circle the center of the Sun is, per definition and without refraction by the atmosphere, only visible during one summer night, some part of midnight sun is visible at the Arctic Circle from approximately 12 June until 1 July. This period extends as one travels north: At Cape Nordkinn, Norway, the northernmost point of Continental Europe, midnight sun lasts approximately from 14 May to 29 July. On the Svalbard archipelago further north, it lasts from 20 April to 22 August.

=== Southern and Northern poles ===
Also, the periods of polar day and polar night are unequal in both polar regions because the Earth is at perihelion in early January and at aphelion in early July. As a result, the polar day is longer than the polar night in the Northern Hemisphere (at Utqiagvik, Alaska, for example, polar day lasts 84 days, while polar night lasts only 68 days), while in the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is the reverse—the polar night is longer than the polar day.

Observers at heights appreciably above sea level can experience extended periods of midnight sun as a result of the &quot;dip&quot; of the horizon viewed from altitude.

<text>Theropoda (; from ancient Greek [, (&quot;therion&quot;) &quot;wild beast&quot;; , (&quot;pous, podos&quot;) &quot;foot&quot;]), commonly known as theropods, is an extant dinosaur clade that is characterized by hollow bones and three toes and claws on each limb. Theropods are generally classed as a group of saurischian dinosaurs. They were ancestrally carnivorous, although a number of theropod groups evolved to become herbivores and omnivores. Theropods first appeared during the Carnian age of the late Triassic period 231.4 million years ago (Ma) and included the majority of large terrestrial carnivores from the Early Jurassic until at least the close of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma. In the Jurassic, birds evolved from small specialized coelurosaurian theropods, and are today represented by about 11,000 living species.

==Biology==

=== Traits ===
Various synapomorphies for Theropoda have been proposed based on which taxa are included in the group. For example, a 1999 paper by Paul Sereno suggests that theropods are characterized by traits such as an ectopterygoid fossa (a depression around the ectopterygoid bone), an intramandibular joint located within the lower jaw, and extreme internal cavitation within the bones. However, since taxa like Herrerasaurus may not be theropods, these traits may have been more widely distributed among early saurischians rather than being unique to theropods.

Instead, taxa with a higher probability of being within the Theropoda may share more specific traits, such as a prominent promaxillary fenestra, cervical vertebrae with pleurocoels in the anterior part of the centrum leading to a more pneumatic neck, five or more sacral vertebrae, enlargement of the carpal bone, and a distally concave portion of the tibia, among a few other traits found throughout the skeleton. Like the early sauropodomorphs, the second digit in a theropod&#x27;s hand is enlarged. Theropods also have a very well developed ball and socket joint near their neck and head.

Most theropods belong to the clade Neotheropoda, characterized by the reduction of several foot bones, thus leaving three toed footprints on the ground when they walk (tridactyl feet). Digit V was reduced to a remnant early in theropod evolution and was gone by the late Triassic. Digit I is reduced and generally do not touch the ground, and greatly reduced in some lineages. They also lack a digit V on their hands and have developed a furcula which is otherwise known as a wishbone. Early neotheropods like the coelophysoids have a noticeable kink in the upper jaw known as a subnarial gap. Averostrans are some of the most derived theropods and contain the Tetanurae and Ceratosauria. While some used to consider coelophysoids and ceratosaurs to be within the same group due to features such as a fused hip, later studies showed that it is more likely that these were features ancestral to neotheropods and were lost in basal tetanurans. Averostrans and their close relatives are united via the complete loss of any digit V remnants, fewer teeth in the maxilla, the movement of the tooth row further down the maxilla and a lacrimal fenestra. Averostrans also share features in their hips and teeth.

===Diet and teeth ===

Theropods exhibit a wide range of diets, from insectivores to herbivores and carnivores. Strict carnivory has always been considered the ancestral diet for theropods as a group, and a wider variety of diets was historically considered a characteristic exclusive to the avian theropods (birds). However, discoveries in the late 20th and early 21st centuries showed that a variety of diets existed even in more basal lineages. All early finds of theropod fossils showed them to be primarily carnivorous. Fossilized specimens of early theropods known to scientists in the 19th and early 20th centuries all possessed sharp teeth with serrated edges for cutting flesh, and some specimens even showed direct evidence of predatory behavior. For example, a &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot; fossil was found with a lizard in its stomach, and a &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot; specimen was found locked in combat with a &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot; (a type of ornithischian dinosaur). This was likely caused by a sand dune blowing over the two animals mid combat, resulting in fossilization.

The first confirmed non-carnivorous fossil theropods found were the therizinosaurs, originally known as &quot;segnosaurs&quot;. First thought to be prosauropods, these enigmatic dinosaurs were later proven to be highly specialized, herbivorous theropods. Therizinosaurs possessed large abdomens for processing plant food, and small heads with beaks and leaf-shaped teeth. Further study of maniraptoran theropods and their relationships showed that therizinosaurs were not the only early members of this group to abandon carnivory. Several other lineages of early maniraptorans show adaptations for an omnivorous diet, including seed-eating (some troodontids) and insect-eating (many avialans and alvarezsaurs). Oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and advanced troodontids were likely omnivorous as well, and some early theropods (such as &quot;Masiakasaurus knopfleri&quot; and the spinosaurids) appear to have specialized in catching fish.

Diet is largely deduced by the tooth morphology, tooth marks on bones of the prey, and gut contents. Some theropods, such as &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Lourinhanosaurus&quot;, ornithomimosaurs, and birds, are known to use gastroliths, or gizzard-stones.

The majority of theropod teeth are blade-like, with serration on the edges, called ziphodont. Others are pachydont or folidont depending on the shape of the tooth or denticles. The morphology of the teeth is distinct enough to tell the major families apart, which indicate different diet strategies. An investigation in July 2015 discovered that what appeared to be &quot;cracks&quot; in their teeth were actually folds that helped to prevent tooth breakage by strengthening individual serrations as they attacked their prey. The folds helped the teeth stay in place longer, especially as theropods evolved into larger sizes and had more force in their bite.

===Integument (skin, scales and feathers)===

Mesozoic theropods were also very diverse in terms of skin texture and covering. Feathers or feather-like structures (filaments) are attested in most lineages of theropods (see feathered dinosaur). However, outside the coelurosaurs, feathers may have been confined to the young, smaller species, or limited parts of the animal. Many larger theropods had skin covered in small, bumpy scales. In some species, these were interspersed with larger scales with bony cores, or osteoderms. This type of skin is best known in the ceratosaur &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, which has been preserved with extensive skin impressions.

The coelurosaur lineages most distant from birds had feathers that were relatively short and composed of simple, possibly branching filaments. Simple filaments are also seen in therizinosaurs, which also possessed large, stiffened &quot;quill&quot;-like feathers. More fully feathered theropods, such as dromaeosaurids, usually retain scales only on the feet. Some species may have mixed feathers elsewhere on the body as well. &quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot; preserved scales near the underside of the tail, and &quot;Juravenator&quot; may have been predominantly scaly with some simple filaments interspersed. On the other hand, some theropods were completely covered with feathers, such as the troodontid &quot;Anchiornis&quot;, which even had feathers on the feet and toes.

Based on a relationships between tooth size and skull length and also a comparison of the degree of wear of the teeth of non-avian theropods and modern lepidosaurs, it is concluded that theropods had lips that protected their teeth from the outside. Visually, the snouts of such theropods as &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had more similarities with lizards than crocodilians, which lack lips.

===Size===

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was for many decades the largest known theropod and best known to the general public. Since its discovery, however, a number of other giant carnivorous dinosaurs have been described, including &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. The original &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; specimens (as well as newer fossils described in 2006) support the idea that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was probably 3 meters longer than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, though &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; might have been more massive than &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. Specimens such as Sue and Scotty are both estimated to be the heaviest theropods known to science. It is still not clear why these animals grew so heavy and bulky compared to the land predators that came before and after them.

The largest extant theropod is the common ostrich, up to 2.74 m (9 ft) tall and weighing between 90 and 130 kg (200 - 290 lb). The smallest non-avian theropod known from adult specimens is the troodontid &quot;Anchiornis huxleyi&quot;, at 110 grams in weight and 34 centimeters (1 ft) in length. When modern birds are included, the bee hummingbird (&quot;Mellisuga helenae&quot;) is smallest at 1.9 g and 5.5 cm (2.2 in) long.

Recent theories propose that theropod body size shrank continuously over a period of 50 million years, from an average of down to , eventually evolving into over 11,000 species of modern birds. This was based on evidence that theropods were the only dinosaurs to get continuously smaller, and that their skeletons changed four times as fast as those of other dinosaur species.

=== Growth rates ===
In order to estimate the growth rates of theropods, scientists need to calculate both age and body mass of a dinosaur. Both of these measures can only be calculated through fossilized bone and tissue, so regression analysis and extant animal growth rates as proxies are used to make predictions. Fossilized bones exhibit growth rings that appear as a result of growth or seasonal changes, which can be used to approximate age at the time of death. However, the amount of rings in a skeleton can vary from bone to bone, and old rings can also be lost at advanced age, so scientists need to properly control these two possibly confounding variables.

Body mass is harder to determine as bone mass only represents a small proportion of the total body mass of animals. One method is to measure the circumference of the femur, which in non-avian theropod dinosaurs has been shown to be a relatively proportional to quadrupedal mammals, and use this measurement as a function of body weight, as the proportions of long bones like the femur grow proportionately with body mass. The method of using extant animal bone proportion to body mass ratios to make predictions about extinct animals is known as the extant-scaling (ES) approach. A second method, known as the volumetric-density (VD) approach, uses full-scale models of skeletons to make inferences about potential mass. The ES approach is better for wide-range studies including many specimens and doesn&#x27;t require as much of a complete skeleton as the VD approach, but the VD approach allows scientists to better answer more physiological questions about the animal, such as locomotion and center of gravity.

The current consensus is that non-avian theropods didn&#x27;t exhibit a group wide growth rate, but instead had varied rates depending on their size. However, all non-avian theropods had faster growth rates than extant reptiles, even when modern reptiles are scaled up to the large size of some non-avian theropods. As body mass increases, the relative growth rate also increases. This trend may be due to the need to reach the size required for reproductive maturity. For example, one of the smallest known theropods was &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus,&quot; which had a body mass of 200 grams, grew at a rate of approximately 0.33 grams per day. A comparable reptile of the same size grows at half of this rate. The growth rates of medium-sized non-avian theropods (100–1000 kg) approximated those of precocial birds, which are much slower than altricial birds. Large theropods (1500–3500 kg) grew even faster, similar to rates displayed by eutherian mammals. The largest non-avian theropods, like &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; had similar growth dynamics to the largest living land animal today, the African elephant, which is characterized by a rapid period of growth until maturity, subsequently followed by slowing growth in adulthood.

===Stance and gait===

As a hugely diverse group of animals, the posture adopted by theropods likely varied considerably between various lineages through time. All known theropods are bipedal, with the forelimbs reduced in length and specialized for a wide variety of tasks (see below). In modern birds, the body is typically held in a somewhat upright position, with the upper leg (femur) held parallel to the spine and with the forward force of locomotion generated at the knee. Scientists are not certain how far back in the theropod family tree this type of posture and locomotion extends.

Non-avian theropods were first recognized as bipedal during the 19th century, before their relationship to birds was widely accepted. During this period, theropods such as carnosaurs and tyrannosaurids were thought to have walked with vertical femurs and spines in an upright, nearly erect posture, using their long, muscular tails as additional support in a kangaroo-like tripodal stance. Beginning in the 1970s, biomechanical studies of extinct giant theropods cast doubt on this interpretation. Studies of limb bone articulation and the relative absence of trackway evidence for tail dragging suggested that, when walking, the giant, long-tailed theropods would have adopted a more horizontal posture with the tail held parallel to the ground. However, the orientation of the legs in these species while walking remains controversial. Some studies support a traditional vertically oriented femur, at least in the largest long-tailed theropods, while others suggest that the knee was normally strongly flexed in all theropods while walking, even giants like the tyrannosaurids. It is likely that a wide range of body postures, stances, and gaits existed in the many extinct theropod groups.

===Nervous system and senses===
Although rare, complete casts of theropod endocrania are known from fossils. Theropod endocrania can also be reconstructed from preserved brain cases without damaging valuable specimens by using a computed tomography scan and 3D reconstruction software. These finds are of evolutionary significance because they help document the emergence of the neurology of modern birds from that of earlier reptiles. An increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred with the advent of the Coelurosauria and &quot;continued throughout the evolution of maniraptorans and early birds.&quot;

Studies show that theropods had very sensitive snouts. It is suggested they might have been used for temperature detection, feeding behavior, and wave detection.

===Forelimb morphology===

Shortened forelimbs in relation to hind legs was a common trait among theropods, most notably in the abelisaurids (such as &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;) and the tyrannosaurids (such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;). This trait was, however, not universal: spinosaurids had well developed forelimbs, as did many coelurosaurs. The relatively robust forelimbs of one genus, &quot;Xuanhanosaurus&quot;, led D. Zhiming to suggest that the animal might have been quadrupedal. However, this is no longer thought to be likely.

The hands are also very different among the different groups. The most common form among non-avian theropods is an appendage consisting of three fingers; the digits I, II and III (or possibly II, III and IV), with sharp claws. Some basal theropods, like most Ceratosaurians, had four digits, and also a reduced metacarpal V (e.g. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;). The majority of tetanurans had three, but some had even fewer.

The forelimbs&#x27; scope of use is also believed to have also been different among different families. The spinosaurids could have used their powerful forelimbs to hold fish. Some small maniraptorans such as scansoriopterygids are believed to have used their forelimbs to climb in trees. The wings of modern birds are used primarily for flight, though they are adapted for other purposes in certain groups. For example, aquatic birds such as penguins use their wings as flippers.

===Forelimb movement===

Contrary to the way theropods have often been reconstructed in art and the popular media, the range of motion of theropod forelimbs was severely limited, especially compared with the forelimb dexterity of humans and other primates. Most notably, theropods and other bipedal saurischian dinosaurs (including the bipedal prosauropods) could not pronate their hands—that is, they could not rotate the forearm so that the palms faced the ground or backwards towards the legs. In humans, pronation is achieved by motion of the radius relative to the ulna (the two bones of the forearm). In saurischian dinosaurs, however, the end of the radius near the elbow was actually locked into a groove of the ulna, preventing any movement. Movement at the wrist was also limited in many species, forcing the entire forearm and hand to move as a single unit with little flexibility. In theropods and prosauropods, the only way for the palm to face the ground would have been by lateral splaying of the entire forelimb, as in a bird raising its wing.

In carnosaurs like &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, the hand itself retained a relatively high degree of flexibility, with mobile fingers. This was also true of more basal theropods, such as herrerasaurs. Coelurosaurs showed a shift in the use of the forearm, with greater flexibility at the shoulder allowing the arm to be raised towards the horizontal plane, and to even greater degrees in flying birds. However, in coelurosaurs, such as ornithomimosaurs and especially dromaeosaurids, the hand itself had lost most flexibility, with highly inflexible fingers. Dromaeosaurids and other maniraptorans also showed increased mobility at the wrist not seen in other theropods, thanks to the presence of a specialized half-moon shaped wrist bone (the semi-lunate carpal) that allowed the whole hand to fold backward towards the forearm in the manner of modern birds.

===Paleopathology===

In 2001, Ralph E. Molnar published a survey of pathologies in theropod dinosaur bone. He found pathological features in 21 genera from 10 families. Pathologies were found in theropods of all body size although they were less common in fossils of small theropods, although this may be an artifact of preservation. They are very widely represented throughout the different parts of theropod anatomy. The most common sites of preserved injury and disease in theropod dinosaurs are the ribs and tail vertebrae. Despite being abundant in ribs and vertebrae, injuries seem to be &quot;absent... or very rare&quot; on the bodies&#x27; primary weight supporting bones like the sacrum, femur, and tibia. The lack of preserved injuries in these bones suggests that they were selected by evolution for resistance to breakage. The least common sites of preserved injury are the cranium and forelimb, with injuries occurring in about equal frequency at each site. Most pathologies preserved in theropod fossils are the remains of injuries like fractures, pits, and punctures, often likely originating with bites. Some theropod paleopathologies seem to be evidence of infections, which tended to be confined only to small regions of the animal&#x27;s body. Evidence for congenital malformities have also been found in theropod remains. Such discoveries can provide information useful for understanding the evolutionary history of the processes of biological development. Unusual fusions in cranial elements or asymmetries in the same are probably evidence that one is examining the fossils of an extremely old individual rather than a diseased one.

===Swimming===
The trackway of a swimming theropod, the first in China of the ichnogenus named &quot;Characichnos&quot;, was discovered at the Feitianshan Formation in Sichuan. These new swim tracks support the hypothesis that theropods were adapted to swimming and capable of traversing moderately deep water. Dinosaur swim tracks are considered to be rare trace fossils, and are among a class of vertebrate swim tracks that also include those of pterosaurs and crocodylomorphs. The study described and analyzed four complete natural molds of theropod foot prints that are now stored at the Huaxia Dinosaur Tracks Research and Development Center (HDT). These dinosaur footprints were in fact claw marks, which suggest that this theropod was swimming near the surface of a river and just the tips of its toes and claws could touch the bottom. The tracks indicate a coordinated, left-right, left-right progression, which supports the proposition that theropods were well-coordinated swimmers.

==Evolutionary history==

During the late Triassic, a number of primitive proto-theropod and theropod dinosaurs existed and evolved alongside each other.

The earliest and most primitive of the theropod dinosaurs were the carnivorous &quot;Eodromaeus&quot; and, possibly, the herrerasaurids of Argentina. The herrerasaurs existed during the early late Triassic (Late Carnian to Early Norian). They were found in North America and South America and possibly also India and Southern Africa. The herrerasaurs were characterised by a mosaic of primitive and advanced features. Some paleontologists have in the past considered the herrerasaurians to be members of Theropoda, while other theorized the group to be basal saurischians, and may even have evolved prior to the saurischian-ornithischian split. Cladistic analysis following the discovery of &quot;Tawa&quot;, another Triassic dinosaur, suggests the herrerasaurs likely were early theropods.

The earliest and most primitive unambiguous theropods are the Coelophysoidea. The coelophysoids were a group of widely distributed, lightly built and potentially gregarious animals. They included small hunters like &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and &quot;Camposaurus&quot;. These successful animals continued from the Late Carnian (early Late Triassic) through to the Toarcian (late Early Jurassic). Although in the early cladistic classifications they were included under the Ceratosauria and considered a side-branch of more advanced theropods, they may have been ancestral to all other theropods (which would make them a paraphyletic group).

Neotheropoda (meaning &quot;new theropods&quot;) is a clade that includes coelophysoids and more advanced theropod dinosaurs, and is the only group of theropods that survived the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. Neotheropoda was named by R.T. Bakker in 1986 as a group including the relatively derived theropod subgroups Ceratosauria and Tetanurae, and excluding coelophysoids. However, most later researchers have used it to denote a broader group. Neotheropoda was first defined as a clade by Paul Sereno in 1998 as &quot;Coelophysis&quot; plus modern birds, which includes almost all theropods except the most primitive species. Dilophosauridae was formerly considered a small clade within Neotheropoda, but was later considered to be paraphyletic. By the Early Jurassic, all non-averostran neotheropods had gone extinct.

Averostra (or &quot;bird snouts&quot;) is a clade within Neotheropoda that includes most theropod dinosaurs, namely Ceratosauria and Tetanurae. It represents the only group of post-Early Jurassic theropods. One important diagnostic feature of Averostra is the absence of the fifth metacarpal. Other saurischians retained this bone, albeit in a significantly reduced form.

The somewhat more advanced ceratosaurs (including &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;) appeared during the Early Jurassic and continued through to the Late Jurassic in Laurasia. They competed alongside their more anatomically advanced tetanuran relatives and—in the form of the abelisaur lineage—lasted to the end of the Cretaceous in Gondwana.

The Tetanurae are more specialised again than the ceratosaurs. They are subdivided into the basal Megalosauroidea (alternately Spinosauroidea) and the more derived Avetheropoda. Megalosauridae were primarily Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous predators, and their spinosaurid relatives&#x27; remains are mostly from Early and Middle Cretaceous rocks. Avetheropoda, as their name indicates, were more closely related to birds and are again divided into the Allosauroidea (the diverse carcharodontosaurs) and the Coelurosauria (a very large and diverse dinosaur group including the birds).

Thus, during the late Jurassic, there were no fewer than four distinct lineages of theropods—ceratosaurs, megalosaurs, allosaurs, and coelurosaurs—preying on the abundance of small and large herbivorous dinosaurs. All four groups survived into the Cretaceous, and three of those—the ceratosaurs, coelurosaurs, and allosaurs—survived to end of the period, where they were geographically separate, the ceratosaurs and allosaurs in Gondwana, and the coelurosaurs in Laurasia.

Of all the theropod groups, the coelurosaurs were by far the most diverse. Some coelurosaur groups that flourished during the Cretaceous were the tyrannosaurids (including &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;), the dromaeosaurids (including &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, which are remarkably similar in form to the oldest known bird, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;), the bird-like troodontids and oviraptorosaurs, the ornithomimosaurs (or &quot;ostrich Dinosaurs&quot;), the strange giant-clawed herbivorous therizinosaurs, and the avialans, which include modern birds and is the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. While the roots of these various groups are found in the Middle Jurassic, they only became abundant during the Early Cretaceous. A few palaeontologists, such as Gregory S. Paul, have suggested that some or all of these advanced theropods were actually descended from flying dinosaurs or proto-birds like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; that lost the ability to fly and returned to a terrestrial habitat.

The evolution of birds from other theropod dinosaurs has also been reported, with some of the linking features being the furcula (wishbone), pneumatized bones, brooding of the eggs, and (in coelurosaurs, at least) feathers.

==Classification==
===History of classification===

O. C. Marsh coined the name Theropoda (meaning &quot;beast feet&quot;) in 1881. Marsh initially named Theropoda as a suborder to include the family Allosauridae, but later expanded its scope, re-ranking it as an order to include a wide array of &quot;carnivorous&quot; dinosaur families, including Megalosauridae, Compsognathidae, Ornithomimidae, Plateosauridae and Anchisauridae (now known to be herbivorous sauropodomorphs) and Hallopodidae (subsequently revealed as relatives of crocodilians). Due to the scope of Marsh&#x27;s Order Theropoda, it came to replace a previous taxonomic group that Marsh&#x27;s rival E. D. Cope had created in 1866 for the carnivorous dinosaurs: Goniopoda (&quot;angled feet&quot;).

By the early 20th century, some palaeontologists, such as Friedrich von Huene, no longer considered carnivorous dinosaurs to have formed a natural group. Huene abandoned the name &quot;Theropoda&quot;, instead using Harry Seeley&#x27;s Order Saurischia, which Huene divided into the suborders Coelurosauria and Pachypodosauria. Huene placed most of the small theropod groups into Coelurosauria, and the large theropods and prosauropods into Pachypodosauria, which he considered ancestral to the Sauropoda (prosauropods were still thought of as carnivorous at that time, owing to the incorrect association of rauisuchian skulls and teeth with prosauropod bodies, in animals such as &quot;Teratosaurus&quot;). Describing the first known dromaeosaurid (&quot;Dromaeosaurus albertensis&quot;) in 1922, W. D. Matthew and Barnum Brown became the first paleontologists to exclude prosauropods from the carnivorous dinosaurs, and attempted to revive the name &quot;Goniopoda&quot; for that group, but other scientists did not accept either of these suggestions.

In 1956, &quot;Theropoda&quot; came back into use—as a taxon containing the carnivorous dinosaurs and their descendants—when Alfred Romer re-classified the Order Saurischia into two suborders, Theropoda and Sauropoda. This basic division has survived into modern palaeontology, with the exception of, again, the Prosauropoda, which Romer included as an infraorder of theropods. Romer also maintained a division between Coelurosauria and Carnosauria (which he also ranked as infraorders). This dichotomy was upset by the discovery of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; in 1969, neither of which could be classified easily as &quot;carnosaurs&quot; or &quot;coelurosaurs&quot;. In light of these and other discoveries, by the late 1970s Rinchen Barsbold had created a new series of theropod infraorders: Coelurosauria, Deinonychosauria, Oviraptorosauria, Carnosauria, Ornithomimosauria, and Deinocheirosauria.

With the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature in the 1980s, and their development in the 1990s and 2000s, a clearer picture of theropod relationships began to emerge. Jacques Gauthier named several major theropod groups in 1986, including the clade Tetanurae for one branch of a basic theropod split with another group, the Ceratosauria. As more information about the link between dinosaurs and birds came to light, the more bird-like theropods were grouped in the clade Maniraptora (also named by Gauthier in 1986). These new developments also came with a recognition among most scientists that birds arose directly from maniraptoran theropods and, on the abandonment of ranks in cladistic classification, with the re-evaluation of birds as a subset of theropod dinosaurs that survived the Mesozoic extinctions and lived into the present.

===Relationships===
The following family tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the major theropod groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s.

Averostra was named by G.S. Paul in 2002 as an apomorphy-based clade defined as the group including the Dromaeosauridae and other Avepoda with (an ancestor with) a promaxillary fenestra (&quot;fenestra promaxillaris&quot;) which can also be referred to as a maxillary fenestra, an extra opening in the front outer side of the maxilla, the bone that makes up the upper jaw. It was later re-defined by Martin Ezcurra and Gilles Cuny in 2007 as a node-based clade containing &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, their last common ancestor and all its descendants. Mickey Mortimer commented that Paul&#x27;s original apomorphy-based definition may make Averostra a much broader clade than the &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;+&quot;Allosaurus&quot; node, potentially including all of Avepoda or more.

A large study of early dinosaurs by Dr Matthew G. Baron, David Norman and Paul M. Barrett (2017) published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; suggested that Theropoda is actually more closely related to Ornithischia, to which it formed the sister group within the clade Ornithoscelida. This new hypothesis also recovered Herrerasauridae as the sister group to Sauropodomorpha in the redefined Saurischia and suggested that the hypercarnivore morphologies that are observed in specimens of theropods and herrerasaurids were acquired convergently. However, this phylogeny remains controversial and additional work is being done to clarify these relationships.

<text>HMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was the last battlecruiser built by the Royal Navy before the First World War. The sole member of her class, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; shared many features with the s, including her eight guns. She was completed in 1913 and participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight as part of the Grand Fleet in 1914. Like most of the modern British battlecruisers, the ship never left the North Sea during the war. As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914, but was unsuccessful. The ship was refitting in early 1915 and missed the Battle of Dogger Bank in January, but participated in the largest fleet action of the war, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. She was hit twice by the German battlecruiser during the early part of the battle and her magazines exploded shortly afterwards, sinking her with the loss of more than 98 percent of the ship’s complement.

Her wreck was discovered in 1991 and rests in pieces, some of which are upside down, on the floor of the North Sea. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 as it is the grave of 1,266 officers and ratings.

==Design==

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; was ordered, together with the four battleships of the , under the 1910–11 Naval Programme. As was the usual pattern of the time, only one battlecruiser was ordered per naval programme. She differed from her predecessors of the &quot;Lion&quot; class in the distribution of her secondary armament and armour and in the location of the officers&#x27; quarters. Every capital ship since the design of the battleship in 1905 had placed the officers&#x27; quarters closer to their action stations amidships; after complaints from the Fleet, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was the first battlecruiser to restore the quarters to their traditional place in the stern. In addition, she was the first battlecruiser to mount a sternwalk.

&quot;Queen Mary&quot;, the only ship of her name ever to serve in the Royal Navy, was named for Mary of Teck, the wife of King George V. The Queen&#x27;s representative at the ship&#x27;s christening on 20 March 1912 was the wife of Viscount Allendale.

===General characteristics===
Slightly larger than the preceding &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship normally displaced and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. She had a metacentric height of at deep load. In peacetime, the crew numbered 997 officers and ratings, but this increased to 1,275 during wartime.

===Propulsion===
The ship had two paired sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine rooms. Each set consisted of a high-pressure turbine driving an outboard propeller shaft and a low-pressure turbine driving an inner shaft. A cruising stage was built into the casing of each high-pressure turbine for economical steaming at low speeds. The turbines had a designed output of , more than her predecessors. On sea trials in May and June 1913, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; achieved more than , although she barely exceeded her designed speed of . The steam plant consisted of 42 Yarrow boilers arranged in seven boiler rooms. Maximum bunkerage was of coal and of fuel oil to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. Her range was at a speed of .

===Armament===

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; mounted eight BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; from bow to stern. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 20°, although the director controlling the turrets was limited to 15° 21&#x27; until prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 20° elevation, this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing (AP) shells. The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5–2 rounds per minute. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mk VII guns, most of which were mounted in casemates on the forecastle deck, unlike the arrangement in the &quot;Lion&quot; class. The guns could depress to −7° and had a maximum elevation of 15°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a maximum range of ; the ship carried 150 rounds per gun.

The ship was built without any anti-aircraft guns, but two guns were fitted in October 1914. One was a QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun and the other was a QF 3-inch 20 cwt, both on high-angle mountings. The Hotchkiss fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The three-inch gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of with a maximum effective ceiling of .

Two submerged torpedo tubes were fitted, one on each broadside. Fourteen Mk II*** torpedoes were carried, each of which had a warhead of of TNT. Their range was at or at .

===Fire control===
In February 1913, the Admiralty bought five sets of fire-control equipment from Arthur Pollen for comparative trials with the equipment designed by Commander Frederic Dreyer. One set was mounted in &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and consisted of a Argo rangefinder located on top of the conning tower that fed range data into an Argo Clock Mk IV (a mechanical fire-control computer) located in the transmitting station below the conning tower. The clock converted the information into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The aft torpedo director tower was the backup gunnery control position. All four turrets were provided with 9-foot rangefinders and &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets were further outfitted to serve as auxiliary control positions.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I, and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; received her director before the Battle of Jutland.

===Armour===
The armour protection given to &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was similar to that of the &quot;Lion&quot;s; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour was also thick between &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. It thinned to inches towards the ships&#x27; ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. In addition the ship was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour, thinning to abreast the end turrets. Four-inch transverse bulkheads closed off the ends of the armoured citadel. High-tensile steel plating, cheaper than nickel-steel, but equally as effective, was used for the protective decks. The lower armoured deck was generally only thick except outside the citadel where it was . The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only one inch thick. The forecastle deck ranged from .

The gun turrets had nine-inch fronts and sides, while their roofs were thick. The barbettes were protected by nine inches of armour above the deck, but it thinned to above the upper armour deck and below it. The forward 4-inch guns were protected by three-inch sides and a two-inch high-tensile steel deck overhead. The conning tower sides were thick, with three-inch roofs and communication tubes. Her aft torpedo director tower was protected by six-inch walls and a three-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. Her funnel uptakes were protected by high-tensile steel splinter armour thick on the sides and one inch thick on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; was laid down at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at their shipyard in Jarrow on 6 March 1911. She was launched on 20 March 1912 and was completed in August 1913 at a total cost of £2,078,491 (including guns). The ship came under the command of Captain Reginald Hall on 1 July and was commissioned on 4 September. Assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) under the command of Rear Admiral David Beatty, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and the rest of the 1st BCS made a port visit to Brest in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June.

===First World War===
====Battle of Heligoland Bight====

&quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule, and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty, however, was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly ahead of him. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at a range of . At 13:10, Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Beatty&#x27;s main body encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot; shortly after turning north, and she was sunk by two salvos from .

====Raid on Scarborough====

The Imperial German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterward. The fast battlecruisers were to conduct the bombardment, while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Together with the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron, Beatty&#x27;s 1st BCS – now reduced to four ships, including &quot;Lion&quot; – was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank. By this time, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was commanded by Captain C. I. Prowse.

Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender – commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron – had received a signal at 05:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers, although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, but she could not transmit the message until 07:25. Warrender received the signal – as did the battlecruiser – but Beatty did not, despite the fact that &quot;New Zealand&quot; had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on &quot;Shark&quot;″s message to Beatty at 07:36, but he did not manage to make contact until 07:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched &quot;New Zealand&quot; to search for &quot;Roon&quot;. She was being overhauled by &quot;New Zealand&quot; when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered &quot;New Zealand&quot; to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty&#x27;s ships passed to the north, while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships; however, those were some behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron – which had been screening for Beatty&#x27;s ships – detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; was refitting in January and February 1915 and did not participate in the Battle of Dogger Bank; she received her main battery director in December 1915.

====Battle of Jutland====
On 31 May 1916, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German&#x27;s line of retreat and called his ships&#x27; crews to action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, almost 180 degrees, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time, Beatty altered course to the east, as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn, as only the two leading ships – &quot;Lion&quot; and – had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range, as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; opened fire about 15:50 on , using only her forward turrets. By 15:54, the range was down to , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. During this period, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; made two hits on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, at 15:55 and 15:57, one of which caused a propellant fire that burnt out her aft superfiring turret.
The range had grown too far for accurate shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed &quot;Lion&quot; to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused to lose sight of &quot;Lion&quot; – which had sheered out of line to starboard – and to switch her fire to &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, now visible to &quot;Derfflinger&quot;″s gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, at 16:16. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; hit &quot;Seydlitz&quot; again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; had been hit twice by &quot;Seydlitz&quot; before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of &#x27;Q&#x27; turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25, the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late for &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, however, as &quot;Derfflinger&quot;″s fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated one or both of the forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret&#x27;s crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so &#x27;Q&#x27; turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. , the battlecruiser behind her, was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Queen Mary&quot;, along with the other Jutland wrecks, has been declared a &quot;protected place&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite &#x27;Q&#x27; magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.

<text>SMS was the second built by the German (Imperial Navy) before World War I. Ordered as a replacement for the old protected cruiser , was launched on 29 November 1913, but not completed until 1916. was a sister ship to from which she differed slightly in that she was armed with an additional pair of 15 cm (5.9 inch) secondary guns and had an additional watertight compartment in her hull. She was named in honor of the Prussian general Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow who fought in the Napoleonic Wars.

 was commissioned on 8 August 1915, but did not join I Scouting Group until 20 March due to engine damage during trials. This was after most of the major actions conducted by the German battlecruiser force had taken place. As a result, saw very little action during the war. She took part in only one bombardment operation: the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, after which she became Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s flagship. One month later, the ship was heavily engaged during the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May–1 June. During the battle, sank the British battlecruiser and is sometimes given credit for sinking the armored cruiser . However, she was heavily damaged by an estimated 24 heavy-caliber shell hits. With her bow thoroughly flooded, the ship was unable to make the return voyage to Germany; her crew was evacuated and she was sunk by torpedoes fired by one of her escorts, the torpedo boat .

==Design==

The class was authorized for the 1911 fiscal year as part of the 1906 naval law; design work had begun in early 1910. After their British counterparts had begun installing guns in their battlecruisers, senior officers in the German naval command came to the conclusion that an increase in the caliber of the main battery guns from to would be necessary. To keep costs from growing too quickly, the number of guns was reduced from ten to eight, compared to the earlier , but a more efficient superfiring arrangement was adopted. , the second member of the class, was allocated to the 1912 construction program.

 was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She was designed to displace normally and she reached at full load. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines that drove four screw propellers. Steam was provided by eighteen naval boilers, fourteen of which burned coal, the other four burning fuel oil. ″s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship had a crew that consisted of 44 officers and 1,068 to 1,138 enlisted men. While serving as the squadron flagship, her crew was augmented by an additional 14 officers and 62 enlisted men in the commander&#x27;s staff.

″s armament consisted of a main battery of eight 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns in four gun turrets, mounted in superfiring pairs fore and aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 15 cm SK L/45 guns mounted in casemates at main deck level. She also carried eight 8.8 cm SK L/45 quick-firing guns in anti-aircraft mounts. The armament suite was rounded out with four torpedo tubes, all placed in the hull, below the waterline.

 was protected by an armor belt that was thick in the central citadel of the ship where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck was thick, with the thicker armor sloping down at the sides to connect to the lower edge of the belt. Her main battery turrets had thick faces. Her secondary casemates received of armor protection. The forward conning tower, where the ship&#x27;s commander controlled the vessel, had 300 mm walls.

==Service==
 was ordered as , to replace the elderly protected cruiser , which was by then 20 years old. Built by Schichau-Werke in Danzig, her keel was laid down in May 1912, and she was launched on 29 November 1913. was commissioned on 8 August 1915 for trials, and was sent to Kiel on 23 August. The torpedo boats , , and provided a screen for hostile submarines that might be operating in the area, the four vessels arriving the next day. There she completed her final fitting out, including her armament. On 13 September, she began her trials, including torpedo firing tests on 15 September and gunnery tests on 6 October. While on trials on 25 October, ″s port low-pressure turbine was badly damaged. Repairs were conducted in Kiel until late January 1916, after which the ship underwent further trials. These were finished on 19 February; was assigned to I Scouting Group on 20 March, and arrived at her new unit four days later.

The ship&#x27;s first and only commander was (Captain at Sea) Victor Harder. On 24 April, and the battlecruisers and made a brief sortie into the North Sea, cruising to the eastern end of the Amrun Bank, since British destroyers had been reported to have been in the area. A second sweep followed two days later, also to the Amrun Bank. While on this operation, a British submarine attempted to torpedo without success. (Rear Admiral) Friedrich Boedicker, the deputy commander of I Scouting Group, temporarily raised his flag aboard the ship from 29 March to 11 April. On 21–22 April, joined the rest of the High Seas Fleet for a sortie into the North Sea that failed to locate any British warships.

===Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft===
″ first major operation was the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. Franz von Hipper, the commander of I Scouting Group, was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Boedicker. , the flagship, followed by , , , and left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of six light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Boedicker&#x27;s ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50.

In the meantime, by 14:00, Boedicker&#x27;s ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, struck a mine, which tore a long hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400 short tons (1,250 long tons) of water to enter the ship. turned back with the screen of light cruisers at a speed of . The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat took Boedicker to .

At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers and , which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt&#x27;s Harwich Force. Boedicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships&#x27; guns on Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers destroyed two 6 in (15 cm) shore batteries and inflicted other damage to the town. In the process, a single 6 in shell from one of the shore batteries struck , but the ship sustained no significant damage.

At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one salvo each, with the exception of , which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47 encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the German screening ships. Boedicker&#x27;s ships opened fire from a range of 12,000 m (13,000 yards). Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, Boedicker broke off the chase and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, turned back towards Germany, having been warned of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s sortie from Scapa Flow.

===Battle of Jutland===
At 02:00 CET, on 31 May 1916, I Scouting Group departed the Jade estuary; , Hipper&#x27;s flagship, was the leading vessel, followed by her sister , , , and . The ships were accompanied by II Scouting Group, under the command of Rear Admiral Boedicker, composed of the four light cruisers , , , and . The reconnaissance force was screened by 30 torpedo boats of II, VI, and IX Flotillas, directed by the cruiser . An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet—under the command of Admiral Scheer—left the Jade with 16 dreadnoughts. It was accompanied by IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser . The six pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00. The operation was to be a repeat of previous German fleet actions: to draw out a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it.

====Opening actions====
Shortly before 16:00, Hipper&#x27;s force encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. At 16:00, Hipper ordered the signal &quot;Distribution of fire from left&quot; be hoisted on . The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately . The two leading British battlecruisers, and , concentrated their fire on , while engaged only &quot;Lion&quot;. The ship&#x27;s gunners aimed their initial salvo at a range of , well over their intended target. The ship fired semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells, unlike the other German battlecruisers, which had loaded armor-piercing (AP) shells instead. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile beyond their German opponents; &quot;Lion&quot;″s gunners fired their opening salvo at . In the span of three minutes, had fired four more salvos, alternating between the four forward and four aft guns, and had struck with the last one at 16:51.

 scored a second hit a minute later at 16:52. Eight minutes later, &quot;Lion&quot; scored the first hit on ; a salvo from the British ship struck the battlecruiser on her forecastle, but no major damage was done. These two hits would prove to be very important, however, as took on more water due to damage sustained later in the battle, since they allowed water to enter the ship above the armored deck. Nearly simultaneously, dealt a tremendous blow to &quot;Lion&quot;; one of her 30.5 cm shells penetrated the roof of &quot;Lion&quot;″s center &quot;Q&quot; turret and detonated the munitions that were stored inside. Only by the resolute actions of the turret commander—Major Francis Harvey, who ordered the magazine be flooded—did the ship avoid a catastrophic magazine explosion. Indeed, approximately 30 minutes after the turret was destroyed, the fire in the turret spread to the working chamber that was directly above the magazine; there it detonated propellant charges that had been stored there. The resulting explosion would have likely destroyed the ship if the ammunition magazine had not been flooded.

At 17:03, the rearmost British battlecruiser, , was struck by several shells from her opponent, . The forward ammunition magazines were penetrated and set on fire; the resulting explosion tore the ship apart. Shortly thereafter, scored several more hits on &quot;Lion&quot;, though without serious damage being done. ″s gunnery officer, Günther Paschen, later regretted the decision to fire SAP shells, believing that had fired AP rounds, she would have destroyed &quot;Lion&quot; during this action. In the course of the first nineteen minutes of the battle, had fired thirty-one salvos at &quot;Lion&quot;, scoring six hits, forcing the latter to sheer out of line temporarily. From 17:10 to 17:16, resumed firing at &quot;Lion&quot;, but in the haze, her gunners believed they were engaging . During this period, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; opened fire on and scored two hits, the first of which exploded between the forward turrets and the second struck the belt. At 17:24, again opened fire at &quot;Lion&quot; and scored three more hits in the span of thirty seconds.

In an attempt to regroup his ships, Admiral Beatty sought to turn his ships away by 2 degrees while the s of the 5th Battle Squadron arrived on the scene and provided covering fire. As the British battlecruisers began to turn away, and were able to concentrate their fire on &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Witnesses reported at least five shells from two salvos hit the ship, which caused an intense explosion that ripped the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in half. Shortly after the destruction of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, both British and German destroyers attempted to make torpedo attacks on the opposing lines. The British destroyers &quot;Nestor&quot; and &quot;Nicator&quot; each fired two torpedoes at , though all four missed. At 17:34, launched a torpedo at the battlecruiser without success. scored another hit on &quot;Lion&quot; at 17:57, followed by three more hits, one of which started a fire in the aft secondary battery.

The leading ships of the German battle fleet had by 18:00 come within effective range of the British ships, and had begun trading shots with the British battlecruisers and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships. At 18:13, a shell from one of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s struck ; two more hits came at 18:25 and 18:30. The ship was hit again at 18:45, probably by &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. The ship continued to engage the British battlecruisers as they steamed north toward the Grand Fleet, but had no success during this period. Later, at 19:05, she scored one hit on &quot;Lion&quot;. During the engagements between the combined German fleet and the British 1st Battlecruiser and 5th Battle Squadrons, had both of her wireless transmitters damaged; after that point, the only method of communication between ships was via signal lamp.

====Battlefleets engage====
Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the battlecruiser ; the German battlecruisers made a 16-point turn to the northeast and made for the crippled cruiser at high speed. III Battle Squadron of the German fleet, which contained the most powerful battleships of the German navy, also altered course to assist . Simultaneously, the British III and IV Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered with fire from their main guns. During the turn to the northeast, the British destroyers and approached to launch torpedoes at , though without success. &quot;Onslow&quot; was hit three times by ″s secondary battery and was forced to withdraw. Shortly thereafter, a second destroyer, &quot;Acasta&quot; launched a torpedo at that missed; in return, and fired a barrage of 15 cm shells at &quot;Acasta&quot;, hitting her twice. At 19:15, the German battlecruisers spotted the British armored cruiser , which had joined the attack on . Hipper initially hesitated, believing the ship was the German cruiser , but at 19:16, (KzS) Harder, ″s commanding officer, ordered his ships&#x27; guns to fire. The other German battlecruisers and battleships joined in the melee; fired five broadsides in rapid succession. In the span of less than five minutes, &quot;Defence&quot; was struck by several heavy-caliber shells from the German ships. One salvo penetrated the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.

While and the rest of the fleet were concentrating on &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Lion&quot; scored two hits on Hipper&#x27;s flagship, causing a serious fire. By 19:24, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron had formed up with Beatty&#x27;s remaining battlecruisers ahead of the German line. The leading British ships spotted and , and began firing on them. In the span of eight minutes, &quot;Invincible&quot; scored eight hits on ; these hits were mainly concentrated in the ship&#x27;s bow and were the primary cause of the flooding that would eventually cause her to sink. In return, both and concentrated their fire on &quot;Invincible&quot;, and 19:33, ″s third salvo penetrated &quot;Invincible&quot;″s center turret and ignited the magazine; the ship disappeared in a series of massive explosions. From this point onward, came under no further fire from the British battlecruisers, though she was flooding badly from two of the hits from &quot;Invincible&quot; that had struck below the waterline.

By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of II Battle Squadron. If he chose to use his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat, he would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.

====&quot;Lützow&quot; withdraws and sinks====
The other battlecruisers followed the move, but had lost speed and was unable to keep up. Instead, the ship tried to withdraw to the southwest to escape the punishing British gunfire. By 20:00, flooding in the forward part of the ship had reached the magazine for the forward turret. The gun crew brought up as many shells and propellant charges as could be stored in the working chamber below the turret. Shortly before, at 19:50, Andreas Michelsen, aboard the cruiser , dispatched the torpedo boats of I Half-Flotilla to assist . came alongside and took Hipper and his staff aboard, in order to transfer him to one of the other battlecruisers. and began laying a smoke screen between the battered ship and the British line, but at 20:15, before it was finished, was struck in quick succession by four heavy-caliber shells. One pierced the ship&#x27;s forward superfiring turret and temporarily disabled it. The shell detonated a propellant charge and the right gun was destroyed. The second hit disabled the electric gear of the rearmost turret, which now had to be operated by hand. While Hipper was aboard &quot;G39&quot;, command of I Scouting Group temporarily fell to &quot;KzS&quot; Johannes Hartog. fired her last shot at 20:45, at which point the smoke screen had successfully hidden her from the British line.

As the German fleet began to withdraw after nightfall, , steaming at 15 knots, attempted to pass behind the German line to seek the safety of the disengaged side. By 22:13, the last German ship in the line lost sight of , which was unable to keep up with the fleet. Scheer hoped that in the foggy darkness, could evade detection and successfully return to a German port. By 21:30, the ship was settling deeper into the sea. Water began to wash onto the deck and into the forecastle above the main armored deck; this would prove to be a significant problem. At midnight, there was still hope that the severely wounded could make it back to harbor. The ship was capable of up until around 00:45 when she began taking on more water. At times, the ship had to slow down to as little as to reduce pressure on the rear bulkhead in the torpedo flat. Critically, the forward main pumps were no longer usable, as the control rods had jammed.

By 01:00, there was too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward generator compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser&#x27;s crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over .

By 2:20, an estimated 8,000 tons of water was in the ship, and she was in serious danger of capsizing, so Harder gave the order to abandon ship. The torpedo boats &quot;G37, G38, G40&quot;, and &quot;V45&quot; came alongside the stricken battlecruiser to evacuate the ship&#x27;s crew, though six men were trapped in the bow and could not be freed. By 02:45 was submerged up to her bridge. &quot;G38&quot; fired two torpedoes into the ship, and two minutes later she disappeared below the waves. The ship was approximately north-west of Horns Reef when she was scuttled. The position of the wreck is estimated to be . During the battle, had fired an estimated 380 main battery shells and 400 rounds from her secondary guns, as well as two torpedoes. In return, she was hit 24 times by British heavy-caliber shells. The ship&#x27;s crew suffered 115 men killed and another 50 wounded, second only to , which lost 157 men killed and 26 wounded.

In 2015, the survey ship conducted an exploration of the area while laying a tide gauge. During the search, &quot;Echo&quot;″s sonar located on the sea floor, some eight miles from her last recorded position. &quot;Echo&quot; took sonar images of the wreck, which her commander stated would &quot;ensure the ship&#x27;s final resting place is properly recognised as a war grave.&quot;

<text>Compis (&quot;COMPuter I Skolan&quot;) was a computer system intended for the general educational system in Sweden and sold to Swedish schools beginning in 1984 through the distributor Esselte Studium, who also was responsible for the software packages. 

The computers were also used in Danish, Finnish and Norwegian schools under the name Scandis.

== History ==
In 1980, the ABC 80 used in the schools was regarded as becoming obsolete, and the National Swedish Board for Technical Development (&quot;Styrelsen för teknisk utveckling&quot;) was tasked to find a replacement. In 1981, the procurement &quot;Tudis (Teknikupphandlingsprojekt Datorn i Skolan) &quot; was launched, and while the decision was controversial, Svenska Datorer AB was awarded the contract with development beginning in 1982. After Svenska Datorer went bankrupt, production was transferred to TeliDatorer/Telenova under Televerket (Sweden).

The computer was distributed by Esselte and exclusively marketed towards, and sold to, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish schools, mainly high stage (year 7-9) and gymnasium-level.

The computer was based on the Intel 80186 CPU and with CP/M-86 as the operating system in ROM (although it could also run MS-DOS from disk). The computer had a wide selection of ports, including one for a light pen. The Compis project was criticized from the start, and as the move to IBM PC compatibility came it was left behind and finally cancelled in 1988 although it was in use well into the 1990s.

== Applications ==

Notable applications being run on the Compis in an educational environment was:

* COMAL interpreter
* Turbo Pascal 3.0 compiler, under the name Scandis-Pascal
* WordStar word processor
* &quot;Harmony&quot; software: word processing, spreadsheet and database. The name was a pun on Lotus Symphony, the dominant productivity software at the time.

Some schools had simple local area networks of Compis/Scandis computers, in which 10–20 machines shared one hard disk with a typical capacity of 10MB.

<doc id="300675" wikidata="Q1354864" url="?curid=300675" title="Traian Vuia">
<text>Traian Vuia or Trajan Vuia (; 17 August 1872 – 3 September 1950) was a Romanian inventor and aviation pioneer who designed, built, and tested the first tractor monoplane. He was the first to demonstrate that a flying machine could rise into the air by running on wheels on an ordinary road. He is credited with a powered hop of made on 18 March, 1906, and he later claimed a powered hop of . Though unsuccessful in sustained flight, Vuia&#x27;s invention influenced Louis Blériot in designing monoplanes. Later, Vuia also designed helicopters.

A French citizen from 1918, Vuia led the Romanians (especially Transylvanians) of France in the Resistance during World War II. He returned to Romania just before his death in 1950.

==Education and early career==
Vuia was born to Romanian parents—Simion Popescu, a priest, and his second wife, Ana Vuia—living in Surducul Mic and/or Bujor, where he attended the local primary school, and Făget, a village in the Banat region, Austro-Hungarian Empire, (modern-day Romania); the place is now called Traian Vuia.

From 1884, he attended the Roman Catholic high school in Lugoj and graduated in 1892. He then enrolled in the School of Mechanics at the Polytechnic University of Budapest where he received his engineering diploma. He then joined the Faculty of Law in Budapest, Hungary, where he earned a PhD in law in May 1901 with the thesis &quot;Military and Industry, State and Contract Regime.&quot;

He returned to Lugoj, where he studied the problem of human flight and designed his first flying machine, which he called the &quot;airplane-car&quot;. He attempted to build the machine, but due to financial constraints decided to go to Paris in July 1902, hoping to find someone interested in financing his project, possibly balloon enthusiasts. He met with considerable skepticism from people who believed that a heavier-than-air machine could not fly. He then visited Victor Tatin, the well-known theoretician and experimenter who had built an aircraft model which flew in 1879. Tatin was interested in the project, but doubted that Vuia had a suitable engine or that his aircraft would be stable. Vuia then presented his plan to the Académie des Sciences in Paris on 16 February 1903, but was rejected with the comment &quot;The problem of flight with a machine which weighs more than air can not be solved and it is only a dream.&quot;

Undeterred, Vuia applied for a French patent on 15 May 1903, and obtained patent No. 332106 for his design. He began to build his first flying machine in the winter of 1902–03. Overcoming more financial difficulties, he also started construction of an engine of his own design for which he was granted various patents, the first in 1904.

==Flying experiments==

By December 1905, Vuia had finished construction of his first airplane, the &quot;Vuia I&quot;. It was a high-wing monoplane constructed entirely of steel tubing. The basic framework consisted of a pair of triangular frames, the lower members forming the sides of the rectangular chassis which bore four pneumatic-tyred wheels, the front pair steerable. The wing was mounted on the apices of these frames and resembled those of Otto Lilienthal&#x27;s gliders, with a number of curved steel tubes radiating outwards from centres at the apex of each of the side frames, braced by wires attached to a pair of kingposts, and covered in varnished linen. Pitch control was achieved by varying the angle of attack of the wing. A trapezoidal rudder was mounted behind and below the wing. It was powered by a carbonic acid gas engine driving a single tractor propeller. The engine had to be adapted by Vuia himself as a suitable engine was not available. Liquid carbon dioxide was vaporized in a Serpollet boiler and fed to a Serpollet engine. The fuel supply was enough for a running time of about five minutes at full power. The aircraft was constructed for Vuia by the Parisian engineering company of Hockenjos and Schmitt.

Vuia chose a site in Montesson, near Paris, for testing. At first, he used the machine without the wings mounted so he could gather experience controlling it on the ground. The wings were put on in March and on 18 March 1906, it lifted off briefly. After accelerating for about , the aircraft left the ground and travelled through the air at a height of about for a distance of about , but then the engine cut out and it came down. Caught by the wind, it was blown against a tree and damaged. On 19 August a longer hop of at a height of about 2.5 m (8 ft) was made, ending in a heavy landing which damaged the propeller.

In August 1906, he modified the aircraft, reducing the camber of the wing and adding an elevator. In this form, it is sometimes called the Vuia I-bis.
The British aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith described this aircraft as &quot;the first man-carrying monoplane of basically modern configuration&quot;, yet &quot;unsuccessful&quot; because it was incapable of sustained flight.

The French journal &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; emphasized that Vuia&#x27;s machine had the capability to take off from a flat surface, without assistance such as an incline, rails, or catapult. At the time Europe was aware of the efforts of the Wright brothers who on 17 December 1903, had flown their &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; from level ground using a dolly undercarriage running on a guide rail into a headwind, though few yet recognised the achievement. The Wrights had made sustained and controlled flights in a complete circuit by September 1904.

In 1907, Vuia built the Vuia II, using an Antoinette internal combustion engine. This aircraft had the same basic configuration as the Vuia I-bis, but was both smaller and lighter, with a total weight (including pilot) of and a wingspan of . Vuia succeeded in making a brief powered hop on 5 July, travelling , but damaging the aircraft and suffering slight injuries on landing. No further attempts were made to fly the aircraft.

Charles Dollfus, former curator of the Air Museum in Paris, wrote that aviation pioneer Alberto Santos Dumont&#x27;s use of wheels on his aircraft was influenced by Dumont&#x27;s having seen Vuia&#x27;s flight attempts.

==Documentation==

Vuia made his first powered hop on 18 March 1906, on a flat field at Montesson, near Paris, France. The flight took place in the presence of his mechanic and two close friends. The airplane, Vuia 1, lifted one meter off the ground and flew for 12 meters. Accounts of this test published at the time, and of his later airborne tests, until 19 August 1906, are based on letters he wrote to &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot;, the official journal of the Aéro Club of France. Vuia made the first known public demonstration of his airplane on 8 October 1906, when he became airborne for four meters, witnessed by Ernest Archdeacon and Édouard Surcouf. Another journal of the period, &quot;Flight&quot;, credited him with a five-meter hop on 8 October 1906, as the earliest entry in a list of his tests shown in a table of &quot;the performances which have been made by the most prominent aviators of the last few years.&quot;

==Later career==

Between 1918 and 1921, Vuia built two experimental helicopters on the Juvisy and Issy-les-Moulineaux aerodromes.

Traian Vuia was a socialist and a friend of Petru Groza, who invited him to return to Romania in 1950.

He is buried at Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest, Romania.

==Legacy==
Another invention by Vuia was a steam generator with internal combustion that generates very high pressure—more than 100 atm (10 MPa)—that is still used today in thermal power stations. Traian Vuia and one of his partners, Emmanuel Yvonneau, patented several types of gas generators.

On 27 May 1946, Vuia was named an honorary member of the Romanian Academy.

His birthplace, Bujoru, in Timiș County was renamed Traian Vuia after his death.

Timișoara International Airport Traian Vuia (TSR), Romania&#x27;s third largest airport, carries his name. High schools in Bucharest, Craiova, Făget, Focșani, Galați, Oradea, Reșița, Satu Mare, Târgu Jiu, and Tăuții-Măgherăuș are named after him, and so is a boulevard in Galați and streets in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Galați, Hunedoara, Otopeni, Suceava, and Timișoara.

<doc id="300678" wikidata="Q3085140" url="?curid=300678" title="Ethchlorvynol">
<text>Ethchlorvynol is a GABA-ergic hypnotic sedative medication first developed by Pfizer in the 1950s. In the United States it was sold by Abbott Laboratories under the trade name Placidyl. Placidyl was available in 200 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg strength gel filled capsules. While the 500 mg and 750 mg strength capsules were for use in reducing sleep latency, the 200 mg strength capsules were intended to be used to re-induce sleep in case of early awakening. Abbott discontinued production in 1999, due to it being replaced by the benzodiazepine family and its widespread abuse, after which Placidyl was available for about a year in the United States. Although, theoretically, ethchlorvynol could be manufactured for sale in the United States by another pharmaceutical company (subject to FDA approval of such manufacture), no pharmaceutical company has chosen to do so. Individuals with a valid prescription for the substance may legally transport a reasonable amount of ethclorvynol with them into the United States.

==Use and effects==

Ethchlorvynol was used to treat insomnia, but prescriptions for the drug had fallen significantly by 1990, as other hypnotics that were considered safer (i.e., less dangerous in overdose) became much more common. It is no longer prescribed in the United States due to unavailability, but it is still available in some countries and would still be considered legal to possess and use with a valid prescription.

Along with expected sedative effects of relaxation and drowsiness, adverse reactions to ethchlorvynol include skin rash, faintness, restlessness and euphoria. Early adjustment side effects may include nausea and vomiting, numbness, blurred vision, stomach pains and temporary dizziness. There are no specific antidotes available for ethchlorvynol, and treatment is supportive with protocols resembling those for the treatment of barbiturate overdose. Overdose may be marked by a variety of symptoms, including confusion, fever, peripheral numbness and weakness, reduced coordination and muscle control, slurred speech, reduced heartbeat, respiratory depression, and in extreme overdoses, coma and death.

As with all GABAA receptor agonists, Placidyl can be habit forming and extremely physically addictive (with potentially lethal withdrawal resembling delirium tremens and benzodiazepine withdrawal). After prolonged use, withdrawal symptoms may include convulsions, hallucinations, and amnesia. As with most hypnotics, Placidyl was indicated for use in the treatment of insomnia for a short period of time (a week or two). However, it was nonetheless not uncommon for doctors to prescribe Placidyl (and other hypnotics) for extended periods of time, as currently prescribed soporifics are today.

During the late 1970s, ethchlorvynol was sometimes over-prescribed causing a minor epidemic of persons who quickly became addicted to this powerful drug. Elvis Presley was quite fond of Placidyl, Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist had to be hospitalized for detox of Placidyl, as was Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Occasional deaths would occur when addicted persons would try to inject the drug directly into a vein or an artery. Ethchlorvynol is not compatible with intravenous injection and serious injury (including the loss of limbs due to vascular injury) or death can occur when it is used in this manner.

==Chemistry==
Ethchlorvynol is a member of the class of sedative-hypnotic carbinols, which includes methylparafynol and &quot;tert&quot;-amyl alcohol. It is not a benzodiazepine, carbamate, or barbituric acid derivative, and its molecular structure is considerably simpler. The systematic name of ethchlorvynol is usually given as ethyl 2-chlorovinyl ethynyl carbinol or 1-chloro-3-ethylpent-1-en-4-yn-3-ol. Its empirical formula is C7H9ClO.

Ethchlorvynol is synthesized by an ethynylation reaction using lithium acetylide and 1-chloro-1-penten-3-one in liquid ammonia, followed by acidic work-up.

The analogous compound consisting of a carbamate derived from the hydroxyl group was investigated and was shown to have a slower onset, longer duration, and increased potency, but was not developed commercially.

<text>Carlos Juan Delgado Hernández (born June 25, 1972) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball primarily as a first baseman, from 1993 to 2009, most prominently as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, where he was a member of the 1993 World Series-winning team, won the 2000 American League (AL) Hank Aaron Award, and was the 2003 AL RBI leader. He was also a two-time AL All-Star player and a three-time Silver Slugger Award winner during his tenure with the Blue Jays.

Delgado holds the Major League Baseball record for career home runs by a Puerto Rican player with 473. He is one of only six players in Major League history to hit 30 home runs in ten consecutive seasons, becoming the fourth player to do so. During his 12 years with the Toronto Blue Jays, Delgado set many team records, including home runs (336), RBI (1,058), walks (827), slugging percentage (.556), on-base plus slugging (.949), runs (889), total bases (2,786), doubles (343), runs created (1,077), extra base hits (690), times on base (2,362), hit by pitch (122), intentional walks (128) and at bats per home run (14.9).

Delgado also played for the Florida Marlins and New York Mets. In 2006, he was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award. On February 4, 2015, Delgado was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Delgado was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Carlos &quot;Cao&quot; Delgado and Carmen Digna Hérnandez. He grew up in the El Prado section of Aguadilla. There, he attended elementary school alongside his three siblings. Both his father, &quot;Don Cao&quot;, and his grandfather, Asdrúbal &quot;Pingolo&quot; Delgado, were well-known figures in the town. Delgado has said that this made him feel &quot;protected,&quot; but that it also demanded that he had to behave properly.

Delgado attended Agustín Stahl Middle School and José de Diego High School, from which he graduated in 1989. Delgado has expressed his strong feelings of pride in being an &quot;Aguadillano&quot;, noting everything he holds dear is found in the municipality, and his off-season house is located there. He is friends with many people who live there, many of whom he played Little League baseball with.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===

At the age of 16, several major league organizations including the Cincinnati Reds, Montreal Expos, New York Mets, Texas Rangers, and Toronto Blue Jays saw his potential and attempted to sign him. He signed with the Blue Jays in 1988 by team scout Epy Guerrero. In 1992, Delgado played for the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League and produced 30 home runs and 100 RBI, leading the league in both categories, along with a .324 batting average. 
That season, he was named &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Minor League Player of the Year. Before the 1993 season, he was named the number 4 prospect in the minor leagues by &quot;Baseball America&quot; and was promoted to the Double-A Knoxville Smokies. That year, he hit .303 with 25 home runs, 102 RBI, and 102 walks, winning the Southern League MVP Award.

As a September call-up, he made his major league debut on October 1, 1993, drawing a walk in his first career plate appearance. Though he didn&#x27;t play in the 1993 postseason, in which the Blue Jays won the World Series, he was awarded a World Series ring. Originally a catcher, Delgado played in left field for the Blue Jays in 1994 and 1995, before switching to first base, where he became one of the most productive sluggers in the major leagues. Starting in 1997, he hit at least 30 home runs in ten consecutive seasons. A two-time All-Star, in 2000 and 2003, Delgado holds several Blue Jays single-season and career records. He won the Hank Aaron and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year Awards in 2000, and the Silver Slugger Award in 1999, 2000, and 2003.

In 1999, Delgado hit a career-high 44 home runs, along with 134 RBI, and a .272 batting average. The next year, he batted a career-high .344, along with 41 home runs, 57 doubles, and 137 RBI. He finished fourth in the 2000 American League MVP voting.

On September 25, 2003, in a game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Delgado became the 15th major league player to hit four home runs in one game. He hit a three-run home run in the first inning off Jorge Sosa, then again off Sosa while leading off the fourth, then off Joe Kennedy while leading off in the sixth and then off Lance Carter leading off the eighth inning. Delgado is the only player to hit four home runs with only 4 at-bats in a game. In the 2003 season, Delgado hit 42 home runs and led the Majors with 145 RBI, while batting .302; he finished second to Alex Rodriguez for the AL MVP Award. He was named AL Player of the Week on September 30, 2003, and again on September 7, 2004.

Following the 2004 season, Delgado became a free agent, and was pursued by the Baltimore Orioles, Florida Marlins, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. The Blue Jays were not interested in re-signing him, due to payroll constraints.

===Florida Marlins===
On January 25, 2005, Delgado chose to sign with the Marlins, signing a four-year, $52 million contract. He made a successful transition to the National League, with a .301 batting average, .399 on-base percentage, 33 home runs, and 115 RBI in 2005. At the same time, he shared the major league lead in errors for a first baseman, with 14.

Following the 2005 season, the Marlins performed one of their periodic salary-cutting maneuvers, unloading some of their higher-paid players. On November 23, 2005, the Marlins sent Delgado and $7 million to the New York Mets for Mike Jacobs, Yusmeiro Petit, and Grant Psomas.

===New York Mets===

====2006 season====

Delgado responded well as the Mets&#x27;cleanup hitter, hitting 38 home runs and driving in 114 runs in 2006. With Delgado hitting between fellow Puerto Rican Carlos Beltrán and third baseman David Wright, the Mets had the best record in the National League in 2006 but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series in seven games. At season&#x27;s end, with Delgado was tied with Duke Snider with 407 career home runs, 41st most in MLB history at the time. Through 2006, Delgado was the all-time leader for interleague play RBIs with 131, and second all-time in home runs with 43.
====2007 season====
Carlos Delgado had early struggles in the 2007 season, with his batting average at .196 on May 3, but his numbers improved as the season progressed. On May 9, 2007, he hit a home run into McCovey Cove during a game against the San Francisco Giants, becoming the first visiting player to have hit three splash home runs at AT&amp;T Park. Delgado ended the season tied with Cal Ripken Jr. for 37th place on the all-time career home run list with 431.

====2008 season====
During spring training 2008, Delgado was diagnosed with a hip impingement, but the Mets decided to keep him on the active roster. As in the previous year, Delgado began the season in an offensive slump with a .204 batting average in April, and hitting just three home runs, but once again his stats improved as the season continued. In May, his batting average increased to .235 with five home runs. On June 15, 2008, Delgado broke Juan González&#x27;s record for most runs batted in by a Puerto Rican player. On June 27, Delgado set a new Mets record with 9 RBIs (hitting a two-run double, grand slam, and three-run home run) in an interleague game versus the New York Yankees, breaking Dave Kingman&#x27;s club record of 8. In the final game before the All-Star break, Delgado hit his 17th home run of the season. Between June and July his batting average improved, rising to .260 with 19 home runs. Between July 23–31, Delgado hit four home runs.

On August 21, 2008, against the Atlanta Braves, Delgado went 5 for 5 with 3 singles, 3 RBIs, a double, and a walk-off single scoring David Wright in the ninth off the glove of left fielder Omar Infante. It was the first time he had gone 5 for 5 in 10 years. The Mets swept the three-game set. On August 25, 2008, against the Houston Astros, Delgado hit two 3-run homers to lead the Mets to a 9–1 victory in the finale of the series. On September 7 he became the third Mets player in history to have at least 65 RBIs in a 65-game stretch in a season. On September 9, he tied Dave Kingman&#x27;s record of most multi-home run games during a season as a Met with 7. Delgado notched his 2,000th career hit on September 21, 2008, against the Atlanta Braves. On October 31 the Mets exercised Delgado&#x27;s $12 million option. Delgado was ninth in the voting for the 2008 National League MVP Award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, David Wright and Brad Lidge.

====2009 season====
Delgado was the first Major League player to hit a home run into the Pepsi Porch at Citi Field on April 8, 2009. He played his last major league game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 10, 2009. Eight days later on May 18, the Mets announced that Delgado had a bone spur and a torn labrum in his hip, and he would have to undergo surgery. The Mets reported the next day that the surgery was successful and Delgado would be out for approximately ten weeks, which would delay his quest for 500 home runs. However, he did not play again in 2009.

Delgado filed for free agency on November 5. Delgado made his return to the Puerto Rico Baseball League (PRBL) winter league, registering a batting average of .364 and one home run in his first three games. He had seven hits in eight games in the winter league season.

===2010 free agency===
In February 2010, Delgado underwent another hip operation, this time to reconstruct the labrum on his right hip. He also underwent a micro-fracture procedure on his hip socket. Although Delgado had reportedly received interest from MLB clubs, including the Mets and Marlins, he felt pain in his hip and decided to undergo the second surgery to be better prepared for the coming season. According to his agent, David Sloane, Delgado &quot;felt, despite the time it would take, it was a better option for him to be the Carlos Delgado of old instead of an old Carlos Delgado.&quot;

===Pawtucket Red Sox===
On August 7, 2010, the Boston Red Sox signed Delgado to a minor league contract. He played 5 games with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox between August 9 and 15, collecting 3 singles in 13 at-bats with 2 RBI. This was the entire extent of Delgado&#x27;s 2010 season after Delgado suffered a setback with his surgically repaired hip.

===Retirement===
On April 13, 2011, Delgado officially announced, while in San Juan, Puerto Rico, his retirement from professional baseball after 17 MLB seasons.

On December 7, 2012, the Blue Jays announced that Delgado would be the 10th person inducted to the club&#x27;s Level of Excellence. The induction occurred on July 21, 2013, at Rogers Centre in Toronto. Delgado threw the ceremonial first pitch for that day&#x27;s Blue Jays game.

===Career statistics===
In 2,035 games over 17 seasons, Delgado posted a .280 batting average with 1241 runs, 483 doubles, 18 triples, 473 home runs, 1,512 RBI, 1,109 walks, .383 on-base percentage and .546 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .992 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman. In ten postseason games, he hit .351 (13-for-37) with eight runs, three doubles, four home runs, 11 RBIs and six walks.

==International career==
Delgado represented the Puerto Rico national team in international competition. In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, he singled in his only at-bat of the tournament. His role on the Puerto Rican squad was much more prominent at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, where he slashed .438/.625/.938 in 16 plate appearances. Delgado led the team with 7 walks and tied with Iván Rodríguez for the most home runs on the team with 2 apiece.

After his retirement, he was hitting coach for Puerto Rico in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He reprised his role in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

==Post-retirement career==

After retiring, Delgado has continued to work in matters closely related to baseball. In February 2013, he was announced as the new member of the Board for the Development of the Puerto Rican Full-Time Athlete. This agency is directed by the Department of Sports and Recreation of Puerto Rico.

Also, in March 2013, he served as hitting coach for the Puerto Rico national baseball team that represented the island at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The team finished second in the rankings. He reprised his role as hitting coach for Team Puerto Rico in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

In his only appearance on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2015, Delgado received just 3.8% of the vote, below the 5% minimum required to remain on future ballots. That same year, he was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Delgado lives in his hometown of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He is married to Betzaida García, who is also from Aguadilla. They have a son, Carlos Antonio, and in 2010 adopted a baby daughter, Mariana Isabel.

===Social activism===
Like his hero, Roberto Clemente, Delgado is a well-known peace activist, and has been open about his political beliefs. As part of the Navy-Vieques protests, Delgado was actively opposed to the use of the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico as a bombing target practice facility by the United States Department of Defense, until bombing was halted in 2003. He was also against the occupation of Iraq. In the 2004 season, Delgado protested the war by silently staying in the dugout during the playing of &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh inning stretch. Delgado does not make a public show of his beliefs, and even his teammates were not aware of his views until a story was published in July 2004 in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Delgado was quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s a very terrible thing that happened on September 11. It&#x27;s (also) a terrible thing that happened in Afghanistan and Iraq, ... I just feel so sad for the families that lost relatives and loved ones in the war. But I think it&#x27;s the stupidest war ever.&quot; The story was the subject of a media frenzy, mostly in New York, where on July 21, 2004, as was anticipated, Delgado was booed by Yankee fans for his passive protest during a game at Yankee Stadium. Delgado had explained that the playing of &quot;God Bless America&quot; had come to be equated with a war in which he didn&#x27;t believe. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Delgado said this is what he believed in, and &quot;It takes a man to stand up for what he believes.&quot; After being traded to the Mets, in a conciliatory measure, Delgado opted to stand during the singing of &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

Among other charity work, Delgado is well known for his generous visits to hospitals in his hometown where, on Three Kings Day, he brings toys to hospitalized children. In 2006, he joined Puerto Rico&#x27;s Senate President in co-sponsoring a Three Kings gift-giving effort in the town of Loíza. Delgado started his own non-profit organization, &quot;Extra Bases&quot;, to assist island youth. In 2007, Delgado donated video conference equipment to allow his hometown&#x27;s Buen Samaritano Hospital to establish a regular link with a hospital in Boston in order to allow for remote diagnoses through telemedicine.

Delgado has also contributed to improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s public education system. In 2007, he participated in &quot;Sapientis Week&quot;, an initiative sponsored by the non-profit Sapientis which brings distinguished public figures into classrooms in order to raise the public&#x27;s awareness of the education crisis in Puerto Rico. Delgado taught a class on Athletic Mental Training and Health at the Ramon Power y Giralt School in the Luis Llorens Torres public housing complex.

For his efforts, Delgado was awarded the Roberto Clemente Award in 2006. The award goes to the player in baseball who best exemplifies humanitarianism and sportsmanship, and was named after Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente in 1973. Prior to the 2008 season of the Puerto Rico Baseball League, Delgado was involved in an initiative to provide economic help to the Indios de Mayagüez team.

<text>Norman Lewis Corwin (May 3, 1910 – October 18, 2011) was an American writer, screenwriter, producer, essayist and teacher of journalism and writing. His earliest and biggest successes were in the writing and directing of radio drama during the 1930s and 1940s.

Corwin was among the first producers to regularly use entertainmenteven light entertainmentto tackle serious social issues. In this area, he was a peer of Orson Welles and William N. Robson, and an inspiration to other later radio/TV writers such as Rod Serling, Gene Roddenberry, Norman Lear, J. Michael Straczynski and Yuri Rasovsky. His work was very influential on successful creative and performing artists, including Ray Bradbury, Charles Kuralt, The Firesign Theatre, Robert Altman, and Robin Williams among many others.

A major figure during the Golden Age of Radio, his work was very influential both at the time and later. He has been called &quot;The Grand Master of American Audio Theatre&quot;. During the 1930s and 1940s he was a writer and producer of many radio programs in many genres: history, biography, fantasy, fiction, poetry and drama. He was the writer and creator of series such as &quot;The Columbia Workshop&quot;, &quot;13 by Corwin&quot;, &quot;26 by Corwin&quot; and others. After leaving the CBS Network, he was Head of Special Media Programming for the United Nations in the early 1950s, producing radio programs explaining the U.N.&#x27;s organization and goals, and documenting some of its efforts worldwide. He was a lecturer in Journalism at the University of Southern California until he was 97.

A documentary film on Corwin&#x27;s life, &quot;A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin&quot;, won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature) in 2006. Les Guthman&#x27;s feature documentary on Mr. Corwin&#x27;s career, &quot;Corwin&quot; aired on PBS in the 1990s. He was inducted into the Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters Diamond Circle in 1994.

On Corwin&#x27;s 100th birthday, the Writers Guild of America West gave him a &quot;Gala&quot; in Hollywood, which was hosted by Leonard Maltin and featured live performances of two of his favorite works and birthday speeches and reminiscences by many people, including Carl Reiner, Hal Kanter, William Shatner, and others. On that occasion, the National Audio Theatre Festival organization announced the creation of the Norman Corwin Award for Excellence in Audio Theatre, which is given annually to an individual or group who have made significant contributions to the art form in the United States.

==Early years ==
Norman Lewis Corwin was born in Boston, the third of four children born to Rose, a homemaker, and Samuel, a printer. They raised their family in East Boston, MA, before moving to Winthrop, Massachusetts when Norman was thirteen. Norman graduated from Winthrop High School, but unlike his brothers, he did not attend college. His earliest goal was to be a writer. Due to his interest in writing, he sought a position in journalism and was ultimately hired by the &quot;Greenfield (MA) Recorder&quot; as a cub reporter when he was only seventeen. In Greenfield, he reported on the courts and was also a film critic. Several years later, Corwin was hired by the &quot;Springfield (MA) Republican&quot;.

==Radio career==
While living and working in Springfield in the early 1930s, he became involved with radio broadcasting. He first worked as the radio editor of the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; and subsequently began broadcasting his own radio program. The date of his first broadcast has been reported as early as 1931 by R. Leroy Bannerman; but the &quot;Springfield (MA) Republican&quot; reported that his first program, &quot;Rhymes and Cadences&quot;, a show during which Corwin read poetry, and his friend Benjamin Kalman offered musical interludes on the piano, debuted in March 1934 on WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield. As radio editor of the &quot;Republican&quot;, he became known for his column &quot;Radiosyncracies,&quot; which he published under the pseudonym &#x27;Vladimir Shrdlu.&#x27; He also worked as a news commentator over WBZ and WBZA. In June 1935, Corwin accepted an executive position in Cincinnati at station WLW. By 1937, Corwin was hired to host a poetry program called &quot;Poetic License&quot; on New York station WQXR, which led to his being hired by the CBS Radio Network to produce and direct cultural programs. He remained with CBS until 1949.

The first program he produced and hosted for CBS was &quot;Words Without Music&quot;, the goal of which, Corwin said, was to make poetry more entertaining. It went on the air over CBS affiliate WABC in New York in early December 1938. Corwin continued to produce and host a wide range of programs for CBS. In December 1941, he created a program to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the United States Bill of Rights: &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot; was first broadcast on December 15, 1941. Corwin said it was written at the &quot;invitation&quot; of the U.S. Office of Facts and Figures. He recalled being on a train on his way to California to produce the program when news of the attack on Pearl Harbor came to him. He sent a telegram to Washington at the next stop, asking if the OFF still wanted the program done. When he got to Albuquerque, a telegram was waiting for him: &quot;the President says, &#x27;now more than ever.&#x27;&quot; Many radio and movie stars of the day featured, along with an epilogue by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With an audience of 60 million listeners it became one of the most famous ever produced on radio. In 1941, he received a Peabody Award for that program.

In 1942, Corwin and Edward R. Murrow combined to produce &quot;An American in England&quot; on CBS radio. Corwin intentionally avoided interviewing government officials, choosing instead to focus on everyday people and how they were affected by the war. He made weekly reports from England via shortwave August 3 – September 7, then did four more episodes December 1–22 after he had returned to New York City.

Corwin&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;On a Note of Triumph&quot;, a celebration of the Allied victory in Europe, first broadcast on VE Day, May 8, 1945. Not knowing where he would be when the end came, broadcast historian Erik Barnouw wrote, Corwin had performers ready in both New York City and Los Angeles. The program went on (from the Los Angeles studios of CBS Radio Station KNX), with Martin Gabel as host/narrator and with William L. Shirer (via cable from New York) re-creating his role as reporter in the Compiègne forest covering the French surrender to Germany. Corwin wrote a similar program for CBS, &quot;Fourteen August&quot;, which was broadcast on V-J Day. This critically acclaimed broadcast earned him a Distinguished Achievement Award from &quot;Radio Life&quot; magazine.

Corwin was also the first winner of the One World Award established by the Common Council for American Unity along with the (Wendell) Willkie Memorial of Freedom House. The award&#x27;s winner was given an around the world trip. He won the award for his contributions in the field of mass communication to the concept of the world becoming more unified. In June 1946, he set out from New York for a 4-month journey. He interviewed both world leaders and ordinary citizens, accompanied by a CBS recording engineer with 225 pounds of magnetic wire recording equipment. His 100 hours of recorded interviews was transcribed and took up 3700 pages. The CBS network then molded his work into a 13-part documentary that was aired in the Winter and Spring of 1947. Programs featured Great Britain, Western Europe, Sweden and Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Egypt and India, Shanghai and Cities of the Far East, The Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.

==Post-CBS career==
After leaving CBS in March 1949, Corwin went to work for the radio division of the United Nations; in charge of special projects, his first production was &quot;Citizen of the World&quot; in July 1949. He ultimately left radio around 1952; some sources say he was frustrated by what he felt was radio&#x27;s over-reaction to Mccarthyism; other sources say he left radio after persistent accusations that he was a Communist sympathizer, a charge which he always vehemently denied. The House Un-American Activities Committee also named him among a number of other entertainers and performers in a 1951 list of alleged Communist sympathizers. The list included conductor Leonard Bernstein, actor Lee J. Cobb, and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. After leaving radio, Corwin and produced some work for television, including his first televised play, &quot;Ann Rutledge,&quot; which starred Grace Kelly. He also wrote a number of motion picture screenplays, including &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951), &quot;Scandal at Scourie&quot; (1953), &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; (1961). In the early 1970s, Corwin produced and hosted the television show &quot;Norman Corwin Presents&quot;. In 1979 he hosted &quot;Academy Leaders&quot;, a weekly showcase for short films which had won or been nominated for an Academy Award. Corwin wrote several books, which include &quot;Trivializing America&quot;; plus many essays, letters, articles and plays.

In the 1980s, Corwin was one of the writing teachers of J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Stracyzynski named a recurring character in the series, David Corwin, after Norman. On the rec.arts.babylon5.moderated Usenet newsgroup, Stracyzynski wrote a series of posts on Norman Corwin&#x27;s work. Corwin wrote and directed two plays produced on Broadway, &quot;The Rivalry&quot; (1959) and &quot;The World of Carl Sandburg&quot; (1960). 

Composer David Raksin&#x27;s &quot;reverent orchestral theme&quot; for the 1950 MGM film &quot;The Next Voice You Hear...&quot; was later published with original lyrics by Corwin as a hymn, &quot;Hasten the Day&quot;.

During the 1990s, Corwin returned to radio drama, producing a series of radio plays for National Public Radio. In 1993, Corwin was finally inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame after a long career. And in 2001, NPR aired six new plays by Corwin under the title &quot;More By Corwin.&quot; He also lectured at USC as a visiting professor and was also on the Advisory Board of the National Audio Theatre Festival. Corwin celebrated his 100th birthday in May 2010. Corwin died at the age of 101 on October 18, 2011.

==Personal life==
Corwin was married in 1947 to actress Katherine Locke. They had two children – an adopted son, Anthony Leon, and a daughter, Diane Arlene. Katherine Locke died in 1995. Corwin died in 2011, at age 101. His father, Samuel, died in 1987 at age 110. His older brother, Emil, retired at 96 from a distinguished federal government career, and died in 2011 at age 107.

<doc id="300696" wikidata="Q6584340" url="?curid=300696" title="Syrup">
<text>In cooking, syrup (less commonly sirup; from ; , beverage, wine and ) is a condiment that is a thick, viscous liquid consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing a large amount of dissolved sugars but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. In its concentrated form, its consistency is similar to that of molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups.

==Types==
There are a range of syrups used in food production, including:
* Agave syrup, made from agave stem
* Cane syrup, made from sugar canes
* Chocolate syrup
* Corn syrup
* Glucose syrup
* Golden syrup, a by-product of refining crystallized sugar
* High fructose corn syrup, widely used in the US
* Maple syrup
* Table syrup

==Uses==
===For beverages===

A variety of beverages call for sweetening to offset the tartness of some juices used in the drink recipes. Granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold drinks or ethyl alcohol. Since syrups are liquids, they are easily mixed with other liquids in mixed drinks, making them superior alternatives to granulated sugar.

====Simple sugar syrups====
=====Simple syrup=====
Simple syrup (also known as sugar syrup, or bar syrup) is a basic sugar-and-water syrup. It is used by bartenders as a sweetener to make cocktails, and as a yeast feeding agent in ethanol fermentation.

The ratio of sugar to water is 1:1 by volume for normal simple syrup, but can get up to 2:1 for rich simple syrup. For pure sucrose the saturation limit is about 5:1 ( sucrose to water).

=====Demerara syrup=====
Combining demerara sugar, a type of natural brown sugar, with water in this process produces demerara syrup. Sugar substitutes such as honey or agave nectar can also be used to make syrups. Spices can be added to the ingredients during the process, resulting in a spiced simple syrup.

=====Gomme syrup=====
&quot;Gomme syrup&quot; (or &quot;gum syrup&quot;; is French for &quot;gum&quot;) is a boiled mixture of sugar and water, made with the highest ratio of sugar to water possible. In old recipes, gum arabic is added, in the belief that it prevents the sugar from crystallizing and adds a smooth texture. Some recipes omit the gum arabic, thus are just simple syrup, considering the gum undesired, or to reduce cost.

&quot;Gomme syrup&quot; is an ingredient commonly used in mixed drinks.

In Japan, liquid sweeteners for iced coffee are called &quot;gum syrup&quot;, although they are actually simple syrup which contains no gum arabic. Ingredients vary by brand; some are glucose–fructose syrup, some are sugar, or blends of both.

====Flavored syrup====
Flavored syrups are made by infusing simple syrups with flavoring agents during the cooking process. A wide variety of flavoring agents can be used, often in combination with each other, such as herbs, spices, or aromatics. For instance, &quot;syrups&#x27; aromatics&quot; is prepared by adding certain quantities of orange flavorings and cinnamon water to simple syrup. This type of syrup is commonly used at coffee bars, especially in the United States, to make flavored drinks. Infused simple syrups can be used to create desserts, or add sweetness and depth of flavor to cocktails.
=== Feedstock for fermentation ===
Glucose syrups rating over 90 DE (dextrose equivalent) are used in industrial fermentation.

==Production==
Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, or maple sap. Corn syrup is made from corn starch using an enzymatic process that converts it to sugars.

A must weight-type refractometer is used to determine the sugar content in the solution.

<doc id="300699" wikidata="Q1287709" url="?curid=300699" title="Steve Carlton">
<text>Steven Norman Carlton (born December 22, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher for six different teams from 1965 to 1988, most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies with whom he won four Cy Young Awards as well as the 1980 World Series. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994 in his first year of eligibility.

Nicknamed &quot;Lefty&quot;, Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). He was the first pitcher to win four Cy Young Awards in a career. He held the lifetime strikeout record several times between and , before his contemporary Nolan Ryan passed him. One of his most remarkable records was accounting for nearly half (46%) of his team&#x27;s wins, when he won 27 games for the last-place (59–97) Phillies. He is the last National League pitcher to win 25 or more games in one season, as well as the last pitcher from any team to throw more than 300 innings in a season. He also holds the record for the most career balks of any pitcher, with 90 (double the second on the all-time list, Bob Welch; Welch ironically being the last pitcher to win at least 25 games in the American League).

==Early years==
Carlton was born and raised in Miami, Florida, where he played Little League and American Legion Baseball during his youth. Steve was the only son of Joe and Anne Carlton and was raised with his sisters Joanne and Christina on 144th Street in Miami. Joe Carlton was an airline maintenance worker.

As a teenager, Carlton began reading and following the teachings of Eastern philosophy and Paramahansa Yogananda, who promoted greatness through meditation.

He attended North Miami High School, playing baseball and basketball at first. Carlton had no plans beyond high school and showed little interest in his studies. As a senior, Carlton quit basketball to concentrate on pitching. He was teammates in high school with Kurt Bevacqua, and his teammate Richie Mehlich defeated Charlie Hough 1–0 in the playoffs under coach Jack Clark; Mehlich was later the victim of murder.

After high school, Carlton played baseball at Miami Dade College North, where he pitched in relief on a strong team under coach Demie Mainieri.

In 1963, while a student at Miami-Dade, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals for a $5,000 bonus.

==Minor leagues==
In 1964, Carlton pitched for four teams as he quickly advanced through the Cardinals minor league system. He pitched for the Cardinals team in the Florida East Coast Instructional League going 2–3 with a 2.89 ERA; in 12 starts with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Class A Northern League he was 4–4 with a 3.36 ERA; with the Rock Hill Cardinals of the Class A Western Carolinas League he was 10–1 with a 1.03 ERA in 11 starts, earning a promotion to Class AA Tulsa. Carlton concluded 1964 with the Tulsa Oilers of the Texas League, going 1–1 with a 2.63 ERA in four games. Overall, Carlton was 15–6 with a 2.22 ERA and 191 strikeouts in 178 innings in 1964.

In 1965, Carlton pitched one game and 5 innings of one-run ball with the Cardinals team in the Florida East Coast Instructional League and was promoted to the major league team.

In 1966, Carlton started 19 games with the now Class AAA Tulsa Oilers of the Pacific Coast League, going 9–5 with a 3.59 ERA.

==Major league career (1965–1988)==
===St. Louis Cardinals (1965–1971)===

Carlton debuted with the St. Louis Cardinals as a 20–year-old in 1965 and by was a regular in the Cardinals rotation. An imposing man () with a hard fastball and slider, Carlton was soon known as an intimidating and dominant pitcher. Carlton enjoyed immediate success in St. Louis, posting winning records and reaching the World Series in 1967 and 1968. In 1967, Carlton was 14–9 with a 2.98 ERA in 28 starts. In 1968, he was 13–11 with a 2.99 ERA. On September 15, , Carlton struck out 19 New York Mets, while losing to the Mets, 4–3, setting the modern-day record at that time for strikeouts in a nine-inning game. He finished 1969 with a 17–11 record, a 2.17 ERA, second-lowest in the NL, and 210 strikeouts.

In the 1967 World Series, Carlton started Game 5 and pitched six strong innings, giving up only an unearned run, but taking a 3–1 loss. The Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox to capture the World Series.

In the 1968 World Series, Carlton pitched in two games in relief, giving up three runs over four innings as the Cardinals lost to the Detroit Tigers in seven games.

A contract dispute with the Cardinals (he had made $26,000 in 1969 and was holding out for $50,000, as opposed to the Cardinals&#x27; contract offer for $31,000) made Carlton a no-show at spring training in . He proceeded to go 10–19 with a 3.73 ERA, leading the NL in losses. In , Carlton rebounded, going 20–9 with a 3.56 ERA, his first of six 20–win seasons.

Following another salary dispute, Cardinals owner Gussie Busch ordered Carlton traded. The Cardinals were offering $55,000 and Carlton wanted $10,000 more. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on February 26, 1972, just before the season for pitcher Rick Wise. The trade is now considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history. However, at the time, the trade appeared to make sense from the Cardinals&#x27; perspective. Carlton had won 77 games to Wise&#x27;s 75, and both were considered among the game&#x27;s best pitchers. Tim McCarver, who had caught for Carlton in St. Louis and for Wise in Philadelphia (and who would later become Carlton&#x27;s personal catcher again with the Phillies), described the trade at the time as &quot;a real good one for a real good one&quot;. He felt Carlton had more raw talent, but Wise had better command on the mound. While Wise pitched in the majors for another 11 years (he pitched two seasons with the Cardinals before being traded to Boston), he only won 188 career games compared to Carlton&#x27;s 329. Partly because of this, the trade is considered one of the worst trades in Cardinals history, and one of the most lopsided trades in all of baseball history.

Carlton was 77–62 with a 3.10 ERA in 190 games and 172 starts with the Cardinals over parts of seven seasons, with 66 complete games and 16 shutouts. He was selected to the NL All-Star team in 1968, 1969 and 1971.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1972–1986)===
In Carlton&#x27;s first season with Philadelphia, he led the league in wins (27), complete games (30), strikeouts (310), and ERA (1.97), despite playing for a team whose final record was 59–97. His 1972 performance earned him his first Cy Young Award and the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year. He became the first pitcher on a last-place team to win the Cy Young Award, and his winning percentage of 46% of his team&#x27;s victories that season is a record in modern major league history. Carlton attributed his success to his grueling training regimen, which included Eastern martial arts techniques, the most famous of which was twisting his fist to the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket of rice.

Some highlights of Carlton&#x27;s 1972 season included starting the season with five wins and one loss, then losing five games in a row, during which period the Phillies scored only 10 runs. At this point he began a 15–game winning streak. After it ended at a 20–6 record, he finished the final third of the year with seven more wins and four losses, ending with 27 wins and 10 losses. Carlton also completed 30 of 41 starts.

During the 18 games of the winning streak (three were no-decisions), Carlton pitched 155 innings, allowed 103 hits and 28 runs (only 17 in the 15 winning games), allowed 39 walks, and had 140 strikeouts. From July 23, 1972, to August 13, 1972, he pitched five complete-game victories, allowed only one unearned run while only giving up 22 hits in 45 innings, and threw four shutouts. Baseball commentators during 1972 regularly remarked that Carlton&#x27;s slider was basically unhittable.

&quot;Auggie Busch traded me to the last-place Phillies over a salary dispute,&quot; reflected Carlton on his 1972 season. &quot;I was mentally committed to winning 25 games with the Cardinals and now I had to re-think my goals. I decided to stay with the 25-win goal and won 27 of the Phillies&#x27; 59 victories. I consider that season my finest individual achievement.&quot;

==== Media silence ====
When Carlton slumped in , finishing 13–20 with a 3.90 ERA, the media&#x27;s questioning of his unusual training techniques led to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton. In 1976, upon the advice of his lawyer Edward L. Wolf, he decided to sever all ties with the media, and refused to answer press questions for the rest of his career with the Phillies. When approached unbeknownst he was on live air in the early 1980s he hurled a sponsor&#x27;s watch at the commentator&#x27;s head in the pregame show. This reached a point where, in , while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, &quot;The two best pitchers in the National League don&#x27;t speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.&quot;

&quot;One thing I regret is that Philadelphia fans didn&#x27;t see the same Steve Carlton we saw in our clubhouse,&quot; longtime Phillies teammate Larry Bowa said of Carlton&#x27;s media silence. &quot;He put up a mask when the writers came in. He was very consistent with the writers. He didn&#x27;t talk to any of them.&quot;

Carlton reflected on his longtime media silence, saying: &quot;It (not talking to the media from 1974 through the end of his career) was perfect for me at the time. It took me two years to make up my mind. I was tired of getting slammed. To me it was a slap in the face. But it (his silence) made me concentrate better. And the irony is that they wrote better without access to my quotes. It&#x27;s all quotes, anyway, and it all sounds the same to me. After that they wrote better and more interesting stuff. I took it personal. I got slammed quite a bit. To pick up the paper and read about yourself getting slammed, that doesn&#x27;t start your day off right.&quot;

==== More success ====

Carlton continued to enjoy many years of success with the Phillies, winning the Cy Young Award in , , , and , and pitching the Phillies to the best string of post-season appearances in club history. Carlton was the first pitcher to win four Cy Young Awards, a mark later matched by Greg Maddux, and exceeded by Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson. His Cy Young Award in 1972 was by unanimous vote, and he finished fifth in balloting for the National League MVP. Gradually the Phillies improved their team, and won the National League East Division three consecutive times from 1976 to 1978.

In 1980, Carlton led the National League in victories (24), strikeouts (286) and innings pitched (304) to help the Phillies win the 1980 World Series, their first title; he won the series&#x27; final game and was 2–0 with a 2.40 ERA with 17 strikeouts in 15 innings in his two starts against the Kansas City Royals. Carlton is the last major league pitcher to have 300 innings pitched in a season.

Carlton won a Gold Glove Award for his fielding in . On September 13, 1982, for the fourth time in his career, Carlton hit a home run and tossed a complete-game shutout in the same game. He is the only pitcher to have done so in three different decades.

He helped the Phillies to another pennant in 1983, finishing 15–16 with a 3.11 ERA in 37 starts. but they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Carlton was 2–0 with a 0.66 ERA against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, allowing 1 run in 13 innings with 13 strikeouts. In the 1983 World Series, Carlton was matched up against Jim Palmer in Game 3, where he gave up 2 earned runs in innings of a 3–2 loss. The Phillies lost the series in five games.

On September 23, 1983, in a game against his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals, Carlton won the 300th game of his career, becoming the 16th pitcher to accomplish the feat.

==== Race for the all–time strikeout record ====
Over a three-year period between –, Carlton was involved in an interesting pitching duel with Nolan Ryan and Gaylord Perry, in which they often traded places at the top of the all–time strikeout list. At the start of the 1983 season, the 55-year-old mark of Walter Johnson was 3,508 strikeouts, but there were three pitchers who were within 100 strikeouts of Johnson: Ryan (3,494), Perry (3,452), and Carlton (3,434). Ryan was the first to surpass Johnson on April 22, 1983 against the Montreal Expos. However a stint on the disabled list shortly after he set the record, combined with a spectacular season by Carlton, allowed Carlton to make up ground and on June 7, 1983, Carlton passed Ryan as the all-time strikeout king with 3,526 to Ryan&#x27;s 3,524. There were 14 lead changes and one tie that season, often after each of their respective starts, before the season ended with Carlton leading 3,709 to 3,677. Perry, aging and in his final season, passed Johnson later to finish his career with 3,534 strikeouts. Since then, five other pitchers have surpassed Johnson&#x27;s mark and Johnson has fallen to ninth place on the all-time strikeout list.

There were five more lead changes and a tie in before Carlton ran out of gas. His last-ever lead in the all-time strikeout race was after his start on September 4, 1984, when he struck out four Cubs to lead Ryan by three (3,857 to 3,854). Although the season ended with a mere two-strikeout lead for Ryan (3,874 to 3,872), Carlton had an injury-riddled season in 1985 and an even worse season in 1986 before being released by the Phillies just 18 strikeouts short of 4,000.

On his longtime Phillies teammate Mike Schmidt, Carlton said, &quot;Schmitty provided what pitchers need most, home runs and great defense. He&#x27;s the best third baseman that I ever played with, and maybe of all-time. Obvious Hall of Famer, even then. He retired while on top of his game. I thought for sure he was going to hit 600 home runs.&quot;

In 15 seasons with the Phillies, Carlton was 241–161 with a 3.09 ERA. He started 499 games with 185 complete games, 39 shutouts and 3,031 strikeouts against 1,252 walks in 3,697 innings. He was a seven-time All-Star with the Phillies and won the NL Cy Young Award four times: in 1972, 1977, 1980 and 1982.

===San Francisco Giants (1986)===
After being released by the Phillies, Carlton joined the San Francisco Giants; he also briefly broke his self-imposed boycott of the media to give a press conference after signing with the Giants. Carlton pitched seven shutout innings in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which he also hit a three-run homer, for his only win as a Giant. Overall, Carlton went 1–3 with a 5.10 ERA in six games for the Giants.

====4,000th strikeout====
Carlton collected his 4,000th career strikeout, striking out Eric Davis in an 11–6 Giants loss to the Reds in San Francisco on August 5, 1986. He became just the second pitcher to reach the 4,000 strikeout mark, after Nolan Ryan. Two days after the milestone, Carlton announced his retirement on August 7, 1986. &quot;Upon reflection, I realized that I&#x27;ve reached a career milestone never before accomplished by a pitcher spending his entire career in one league,&quot; Carlton said in a statement. &quot;I realize that the San Francisco Giants are committed to the younger players in their organization, specifically the talented young men on their pitching staff.&quot;

===Chicago White Sox (1986)===
Carlton&#x27;s retirement was brief; he had not submitted paperwork for the voluntary retired list nor did he submit a letter of retirement to the National League. Carlton subsequently signed with the Chicago White Sox for the remainder of the season on August 11, 1986. With the White Sox, Carlton went 4–3 with a 3.69 ERA.

Overall, Carlton&#x27;s 1986 numbers (with three teams) were a 9–14 win–loss record, with a 5.10 ERA.

===Cleveland Indians (1987)===
In 1987, Carlton joined the Cleveland Indians. There he became teammates with contemporary Phil Niekro. In a game against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, they became the first teammates and 300-game winners to appear in the same game, a 10–6 Yankee victory. It was Carlton&#x27;s only pitching appearance in Yankee Stadium, having spent the majority of his career in the National League before the inception of interleague play. (He was selected to the 1977 National League All-Star team which was held in Yankee Stadium, but he did not appear in the game.)

===Minnesota Twins (1987–1988)===

Carlton was traded to the Minnesota Twins in late July 1987. He went a combined 6–14 with a 5.74 ERA for both the Indians and Twins. The Twins won the 1987 World Series, albeit without Carlton on the postseason roster, to earn him a third World Series ring. Carlton made the trip to the White House to meet President Reagan along with his Twins teammates. When Carlton was photographed with his teammates at the White House, newspapers listed each member of the team with the notable exception of Carlton. Instead, Carlton was listed as an &quot;unidentified Secret Service agent.&quot;

He made the Twins roster in , pitching in four games (0–1 with a 16.76 ERA), before being released by the Twins on April 23, 1988, after surrendering eight runs in five innings in what would be his final meaningful appearance. No teams signed Carlton for the remainder of the 1988 season.

===Retirement===
Carlton remained unsigned in . The New York Yankees offered him the use of their facilities for training purposes, but guaranteed no spot in spring training. Carlton subsequently retired at age 44.

Nolan Ryan pitched until and extended his strikeout lead over Carlton to almost 1,600 before retiring. Carlton eventually fell to third and then fourth place on the all–time strikeout list after Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson passed him.

==Career statistics==
Carlton was an accomplished hitter for a pitcher. In his career, he hit .201 with 13 home runs, 123 runs and 140 RBIs in 1,710 career at-bats. In the postseason, Carlton hit .222 overall, with a home run in the 1978 National League Championship Series. Defensively, he recorded a .952 fielding percentage, which was the league average at his position.

==Legacy==

A ten-time All-Star, Carlton led the league in many pitching categories. He struck out 4,136 batters in his career, setting a record for a left-handed pitcher (since surpassed by Randy Johnson), and holds many other records for both left-handed and Phillies pitchers. His 329 career wins are the eleventh most in baseball history, behind Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens, and Warren Spahn among pitchers of the live-ball era (post ). He is also second (behind Bob Gibson) in major league history for the most consecutive starts with at least six innings pitched (69), which was snapped in April 1982.

Phillies announcer and Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn said of Carlton as a pitcher, &quot;Lefty was a craftsman, an artist. He was a perfectionist. He painted a ballgame. Stroke, stroke, stroke, and when he got through (pitching a game) it was a masterpiece.&quot;

Carlton picked 144 runners off base, by far the most in Major League Baseball since pickoff records began being collected in 1957. Andy Pettitte is second with 98.

Although he never threw a no-hitter, Carlton pitched six one–hitters, 11th most in baseball history.

Carlton had 90 career balks, by far the most in baseball history.

Carlton was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in with 95.82% of the vote, one of the highest percentages ever.

The Philadelphia Phillies retired Carlton&#x27;s number 32 in 1989.

The Philadelphia Phillies honored him with a statue outside Citizens Bank Park in 2004.
In 1998, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Carlton number 30 on its list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

In 1999, Carlton was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Despite his career-long rivalry with Ryan, Carlton maintains his greatest rival was Tom Seaver.

His losing 19-strikeout effort against the Mets was a microcosm of his career against them. While he posted 30 wins against them during his career, they bested him 36 times.

Carlton appeared in an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, playing himself in an episode where former athletes humiliate Al Bundy while filming a shoe commercial. In the episode, Kelly Bundy asks him for an autograph and he is shown writing with his right hand.

In an interview with ESPN&#x27;s Roy Firestone, Firestone asked Carlton, “Why do you think you were put on this earth?” Carlton answered, “To teach the world how to throw a slider.”

=== Charges of bigotry and Antisemitism ===
In 1994, he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan at Carlton&#x27;s home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story &quot;Thin Mountain Air&quot; in the April 1994 issue of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. The article was noted by Murray Chass of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as being the source of numerous claims about Carlton&#x27;s political and social beliefs:

The same article notes that former teammate Tim McCarver defended Carlton against charges of being a bigot and an Antisemite, though he acknowledged &quot;If he&#x27;s guilty of anything, it&#x27;s believing some of the material he reads. Does he become confused with his reading about radical things? Yes. I&#x27;ve told him that. Does that translate into him being antisemitic? No.&quot;

==Personal life==

Carlton was married to Beverly for 33 years, divorcing in 1998. The couple had two sons.

As of 2017, Carlton lives in Durango, Colorado.

Carlton has an orchard and 150 fruit trees, saying, &quot;Before Al Gore was green, I was green.&quot; Of his healthy partnership with St. Luke&#x27;s, he added, &quot;I&#x27;m interested in this &#x27;fit for life&#x27; idea, we&#x27;re trying to get people off the couch, move a little bit, not a sedentary life. ... St. Luke&#x27;s and myself, we&#x27;re on the same page as far as how we think about that. I&#x27;m not on the medicine side, but I&#x27;ve been trained well. I know a lot of different arts. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m interested in.&quot;

In 2017, Carlton said that he hadn&#x27;t had a television in around 15 years and didn&#x27;t follow daily baseball. &quot;I don&#x27;t know these players anymore, (I know) some of the coaches, but I&#x27;ve moved on. Something else to do, there&#x27;s more to it. I owned it for 24 years. I played it, so I don&#x27;t need to do it again. I&#x27;m on to different things.&quot;

Speaking about today&#x27;s pitch counts, Carlton added, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t raised in this environment, so I think differently. These guys don&#x27;t know anything but pitch counts. I would balk at it because I don&#x27;t agree with it, but they can&#x27;t go up against it because that&#x27;s all they know. Philosophically I don&#x27;t agree with it because I think these guys are not really in shape because they don&#x27;t throw enough. You need to throw so much so the tendons, ligaments, the muscle and bone get bigger, denser, stronger to be able to handle the stress of throwing. I don&#x27;t think they throw enough. 100 pitches is not a lot. You warm up with 100 pitches. Then you throw your 200. We threw 185 pitches in a game.&quot;

Tim McCarver, Carlton&#x27;s longtime teammate and personal catcher, said jokingly once: &quot;When Steve (Carlton) and I die, we are going to be buried in the same cemetery, sixty feet, six inches apart.&quot; McCarver died first in 2023.

<text>A pharmacopoeia, pharmacopeia, or pharmacopoea (from the obsolete typography &quot;pharmacopœia&quot;, meaning &quot;drug-making&quot;), in its modern technical sense, is a book containing directions for the identification of compound medicines, and published by the authority of a government or a medical or pharmaceutical society.

Descriptions of preparations are called monographs. In a broader sense it is a reference work for pharmaceutical drug specifications.

==Etymology==
The term derives from &quot;making of (healing) medicine, drug-making&quot;, a compound of &quot;medicine, drug, poison&quot; (), with the verb &quot;to make&quot; (), and the abstract noun suffix &quot;-ia&quot;.
In early modern editions of Latin texts, the Greek diphthong οι (&quot;oi&quot;) is latinized to its Latin equivalent &quot;oe&quot; which is in turn written with the ligature &quot;œ&quot;, giving the spelling &quot;pharmacopœia&quot;; in modern UK English, &quot;œ&quot; is written as &quot;oe&quot;, giving the spelling &quot;pharmacopoeia&quot;, while in American English &quot;oe&quot; becomes &quot;e&quot;, giving us &quot;pharmacopeia&quot;.

==History==

Although older writings exist which deal with herbal medicine, the major initial work in the field is considered to be the Edwin Smith Papyrus in Egypt, Pliny&#x27;s pharmacopoeia.

A number of early pharmacopoeia books were written by Persian and Arab physicians. These included &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; of Avicenna in 1025 AD, and works by Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) in the 12th century (and printed in 1491), and Ibn Baytar in the 14th century. The Shen-nung pen ts&#x27;ao ching (Divine Husbandman&#x27;s Materia Medica) is the earliest known Chinese pharmacopoeia. The text describes 365 medicines derived from plants, animals, and minerals; according to legend it was written by the Chinese god Shennong.

Pharmacopeial synopsis were recorded in the Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali.

===China===
The earliest extant Chinese pharmacopoeia, the &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot; was compiled between 200-250 AD. It contains descriptions of 365 medications.

The earliest known officially sponsored pharmacopoeia was compiled in 659 AD by a team of 23 pharmaceutical scientists led by Su jing during the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) and was called the &quot;Xinxiu bencao&quot; (Newly Revised Canon of Material Medical). The work consists of 20 volumes with one dedicated to the table of contents, and 25 volumes of pictures with one volume dedicated to the table of contents. A third part consisting of seven volumes contained illustrated descriptions. The text contains descriptions of 850 medicines with 114 new ones. The work was used throughout China for the next 400 years.

===City pharmacopoeia origins===
A dated work appeared in Nuremberg in 1542; a passing student Valerius Cordus showed a collection of medical prescriptions, which he had selected from the writings of the most eminent medical authorities, to the physicians of the town, who urged him to print it for the benefit of the apothecaries, and obtained the sanction of the senatus for his work. A work known as the &quot;Antidotarium Florentinum&quot;, was published under the authority of the college of medicine of Florence in the 16th century. In 1511, the &quot;Concordie Apothecariorum Barchinone&quot; was published by the Society of Apothecaries of Barcelona and kept in the School of Pharmacy of the University of Barcelona.
The term &quot;Pharmacopoeia&quot; first appears as a distinct title in a work published at Basel, Switzerland, in 1561 by A. Foes, but does not appear to have come into general use until the beginning of the 17th century.

Before 1542, the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples (basic medicinal ingredients) by Avicenna and Serapion; the &quot;De synonymis&quot; and &quot;Quid pro quo&quot; of Simon Januensis; the &quot;Liber servitoris&quot; of Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim, which described preparations made from plants, animals, and minerals, and was the type of the chemical portion of modern pharmacopoeias; and the &quot;Antidotarium&quot; of Nicolaus de Salerno, containing Galenic formulations arranged alphabetically. Of this last work, there were two editions in use — Nicolaus magnus and Nicolaus parvus: in the latter, several of the compounds described in the large edition were omitted and the formulae given on a smaller scale.

Also Vesalius claimed he had written some &quot;&quot;dispensariums&quot; and &quot;manuals&quot;&quot; on the works of Galenus. Apparently he burnt them. According to recent research communicated at the congresses of the International Society for the History of Medicine by the scholar Francisco Javier González Echeverría, Michel De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) also published a pharmacopoeia. De Villeneuve, fellow student of Vesalius and the best galenist of Paris according to Johann Winter von Andernach, published the anonymous &quot;Dispensarium or Enquiridion&quot; in 1543, at Lyon, France, with Jean Frellon as editor. This work contains 224 original recipes by De Villeneuve and others by Lespleigney and Chappuis. As usual when it comes to pharmacopoeias, this work was complementary to a previous Materia Medica that De Villeneuve published that same year. This finding was communicated by the same scholar in the International Society for the History of Medicine, with agreement of John M. Riddle, one of the foremost experts on Materia Medica-Dioscorides works.

Nicolaes Tulp, mayor of Amsterdam and respected surgeon general, gathered all of his doctor and chemist friends together and they wrote the first pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam named &quot;Pharmacopoea Amstelredamensis&quot; in 1636. This was a combined effort to improve public health after an outbreak of the bubonic plague, and also to limit the number of quack apothecary shops in Amsterdam.

====London====
Until 1617, such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in England by the apothecaries and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary&#x27;s shop. The preparation of physicians&#x27; prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the College of Physicians, and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7 m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized London Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be so full of errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.

At this period the compounds employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs&#x27; eyes (i.e., gastroliths), pearls, oyster shells, and coral were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, calculi, human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, earthworms, etc.

Although other editions of the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir Hans Sloane, that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs&#x27; excrement, earthworms, and moss from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, cordials and ratafias were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.

In the edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the principal remedies of physicians for 2,000 years were discarded, while a few powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the Pharmacopoeia of 1765 were restored to their previous position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published in 1824, 1836, and 1851.

The first &quot;Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia&quot; was published in 1699 and the last in 1841; the first&quot; Dublin Pharmacopoeia&quot; in 1807 and the last in 1850.

===National pharmacopoeia origins===
The preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the Medical Act of 1858 ordained that the General Medical Council should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the &quot;British Pharmacopoeia&quot;, which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the fact that the majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore not competent to decide upon the kind of preparations required for the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.

There are national and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 under the authority of a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees. In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or misbranded under the Federal food and drug laws.

===Supranational and international harmonization===
The Soviet Union had a nominally supranational pharmacopoeia, the State Pharmacopoeia of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSRP), although the de facto nature of the nationality of republics within that state differed from the de jure nature. The European Union has a supranational pharmacopoeia, the European Pharmacopoeia; it has not replaced the national pharmacopoeias of EU member states but rather helps to harmonize them. Attempts have been made by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis on which a globally international pharmacopoeia could be prepared, but regulatory complexity and regional variation in conditions of pharmacy are hurdles to fully harmonizing across all countries (that is, defining thousands of details that can all be known to work successfully in all places). Nonetheless, some progress has been made under the banner of the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), a tri-regional organisation that represents the drug regulatory authorities of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. Representatives from the Pharmacopoeias of these three regions have met twice yearly since 1990 in the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group to try to work towards &quot;compendial harmonisation&quot;. Specific monographs are proposed, and if accepted, proceed through stages of review and consultation leading to adoption of a common monograph that provides a common set of tests and specifications for a specific material. This is a slow process. The World Health Organization has produced the International Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Int.), which does not replace a national pharmacopoeia but rather provides a model or template for one and also can be invoked by legislation within a country to serve as that country&#x27;s regulation.

==Medical preparations, uses, and dosages==
Though formerly printed there has been a transition to a situation where pharmaceutical information is available as printed volumes and on the internet. The rapid increase in knowledge renders necessary frequent new editions, to furnish definite formulae for preparations that have already come into extensive use in medical practice, so as to ensure uniformity of strength, and to give the characters and tests by which their purity and potency may be determined. However each new edition requires several years to carry out numerous experiments for devising suitable formulae, so that current pharmacopoeia are never quite up to date.

This difficulty has hitherto been met by the publication of such non-official formularies as &quot;Squire&#x27;s Companion to the Pharmacopoeia&quot; and &quot;&quot; (formerly &quot;Martindale&#x27;s: the extra pharmacopoeia&quot;), in which all new remedies and their preparations, uses and doses are recorded, and in the former the varying strengths of the same preparations in the different pharmacopoeias are also compared (Squire&#x27;s was incorporated into Martindale in 1952). The need of such works to supplement the Pharmacopoeia is shown by the fact that they are even more largely used than the Pharmacopoeia itself, the first issued in 18 editions and the second in 13 editions at comparatively short intervals. In the UK, the task of elaborating a new Pharmacopoeia is entrusted to a body of a purely medical character, and legally the pharmacist does not, contrary to the practice in other countries, have a voice in the matter. This is notwithstanding the fact that, although the medical practitioner is naturally the best judge of the drug or preparations that will afford the best therapeutic result, they are not as competent as the pharmacist to say how that preparation can be produced in the most effective and satisfactory manner, nor how the purity of drugs can be tested.

The change occurred with the fourth edition of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1898. A committee of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was appointed at the request of the General Medical Council to advise on pharmaceutical matters. A census of prescriptions was taken to ascertain the relative frequency with which different preparations and drugs were used in prescriptions, and suggestions and criticisms were sought from various medical and pharmaceutical bodies across the British Empire. As regards the purely pharmaceutical part of the work a committee of reference in pharmacy, nominated by the pharmaceutical societies of Great Britain and Ireland (as they were then), was appointed to report to the Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Medical Council.

Some difficulty has arisen since the passing of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only &quot;intended to afford to the members of the medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined&quot;. It cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can be used only as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called &quot;Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs&quot; by C. G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.

An important step has also been taken in this direction by the publication under the authority of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain of the &quot;British Pharmaceutical Codex&quot; (BPC), in which the characters of and tests for the purity of many unofficial drugs and preparations are given as well as the character of many glandular preparations and antitoxins that have come into use in medicine, but have not yet been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia. This work may also possibly serve as a standard under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act for the purity and strength of drugs not included in the Pharmacopoeia and as a standard for the commercial grade of purity of those in the Pharmacopoeia which are used for non-medical purposes.

Another legal difficulty connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion in some of them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were to use the same article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the &quot;British Pharmaceutical Codex&quot;.

In most of the Neo-Latin names, &quot;Pharmacopoea&quot; is the more common spelling, although for several of them, &quot;Pharmacopoeia&quot; is common.

<text>Derrick Jensen (born December 19, 1960) is an American ecophilosopher, writer, author and environmentalist in the anarcho-primitivist tradition, though he rejects the label &quot;anarchist&quot;. &quot;Utne Reader&quot; named Jensen among &quot;50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; says that he &quot;has been called the poet-philosopher of the ecology movement&quot;. 

Jensen is a critic of the mainstream environmental movement&#x27;s focus on preserving civilization and technology over preserving the natural world. He specifically challenges the lifestyle changes and individualistic solutions broadly advocated, considering them drastically inadequate to the global scale of environmental catastrophe. Instead, he promotes civil disobedience, radical activism, and dismantling infrastructure on a massive level in order to halt what he has called &quot;the murder of the planet&quot;. 

Along with Lierre Keith, Jensen is a founder and leader within Deep Green Resistance.

His belief, and the organization&#x27;s position, that women-only spaces should exclude trans women has drawn criticism.

Jensen lives in Crescent City, California.

<doc id="300717" wikidata="Q2975815" url="?curid=300717" title="Acorn squash">
<text>Acorn squash (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; var. turbinata), also called pepper squash or Des Moines squash, is a winter squash with distinctive longitudinal ridges on its exterior and sweet, yellow-orange flesh inside. Although considered a winter squash, acorn squash belongs to the same species (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot;) as all summer squashes (including zucchini and crookneck squash).

Indigenous to North and Central America, the squash was introduced to early European settlers by Native Americans.

== Appearance ==
The most common variety is dark green on the outside, often with a single splotch of orange on the side or top; however newer varieties have arisen, including &quot;golden acorn&quot;, so named for its glowing yellow color, as well as varieties that are white. Golden acorn squash with an orange color are sometimes sold around Halloween for carving into small jack-o&#x27;-lanterns. Acorn squash can also be variegated. As the name suggests, its shape resembles an acorn. Acorn squashes typically weigh one to two pounds and are between four and seven inches long. The stem has a prickly feel.

== Cultivation ==
Acorn squash is very easily grown: seeds are started after the danger of frost is past and the soil is warm or started for transplant 3 to 4 weeks before the predicted last frost date in the area. In one method, seeds directly sown are placed 25 mm (1 inch) deep, 5 to 6 to a hill. Grow hills are separated by 2 m (6 feet) in all directions.

About 85 days after germination, acorn squash are ready to be harvested.

== Storage == 
Acorn squash keep well in a temperature-controlled environment, such as a root cellar, maintaining their quality well for at least 3.5 months with a simple cleaning pretreatment known as Hot Water Rinsing and Brushing or HWRB.

== Curing ==

Curing takes seven to ten days in a sheltered area outside or a warm dry place (like a storage space) protected from frost. The curing process helps the fruit keep longer before spoiling. 

== Characteristics ==

As with other squash varieties, the acorn squash vine makes yellow trumpet flowers that are edible. Tops about three inches from the end are also edible and they are one of the most common vegetables in the Philippines (as greens).

== Uses ==
The flavor of acorn squash has been described as mild, subtly sweet, and nutty. It is most commonly baked, but can also be microwaved, sauteed or steamed. For savory recipes, it may be stuffed with rice, meat or vegetable mixtures. If a sweeter dish is desired, maple syrup is often used to fill the halves prior to baking, or used in a sauce or glaze to enhance the squash&#x27;s flavor. The skin is edible and the seeds of the squash can also be eaten, usually after being toasted first. Acorn squash can be used to prepare squash soup.

This squash is not as rich in beta-carotene as other winter squashes, but is a good source of dietary fiber and potassium, as well as smaller amounts of vitamins C and B, magnesium, and manganese.

<doc id="300730" wikidata="Q440370" url="?curid=300730" title="Mel-frequency cepstrum">
<text>In sound processing, the mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency.

Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip (a nonlinear &quot;spectrum-of-a-spectrum&quot;). The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system&#x27;s response more closely than the linearly-spaced frequency bands used in the normal spectrum. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound, for example, in audio compression that might potentially reduce the transmission bandwidth and the storage requirements of audio signals.

MFCCs are commonly derived as follows:

# Take the Fourier transform of (a windowed excerpt of) a signal.
# Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale, using triangular overlapping windows or alternatively, cosine overlapping windows.
# Take the logs of the powers at each of the mel frequencies.
# Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers, as if it were a signal.
# The MFCCs are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum.

There can be variations on this process, for example: differences in the shape or spacing of the windows used to map the scale, or addition of dynamics features such as &quot;delta&quot; and &quot;delta-delta&quot; (first- and second-order frame-to-frame difference) coefficients.

The European Telecommunications Standards Institute in the early 2000s defined a standardised MFCC algorithm to be used in mobile phones.

==Applications==
MFCCs are commonly used as features in speech recognition systems, such as the systems which can automatically recognize numbers spoken into a telephone.

MFCCs are also increasingly finding uses in music information retrieval applications such as genre classification, audio similarity measures, etc.

=== MFCC for speaker recognition ===
Since Mel-frequency bands are distributed evenly in MFCC, and they are very similar to the voice system of a human, MFCC can efficiently be used to characterize speakers. For instance, it can be used to recognize the speaker&#x27;s cell phone model characteristics, and further the details of the speaker&#x27;s voice. 

This type of mobile device recognition is possible because the production of electronic components in a phone have tolerances, because different electronic circuit realizations do not have exact same transfer functions. The dissimilarities in the transfer function from one realization to another becomes more prominent if the task performing circuits are from different manufacturers. Hence, each cell phone introduces a convolutional distortion on input speech that leaves its unique impact on the recordings from the cell phone. Therefore, a particular phone can be identified from the recorded speech by multiplying the original frequency spectrum with further multiplications of transfer functions specific to each phone followed by signal processing techniques. Thus, by using MFCC one can characterize cell phone recordings to identify the brand and model of the phone.

Considering recording section of a cellphone as Linear time-invariant (LTI) filter:

Impulse response- &quot;h(n)&quot;, recorded speech signal &quot;y(n)&quot; as output of filter in response to input &quot;x(n).&quot; 

Hence, formula_1 (convolution)

As speech is not stationary signal, it is divided into overlapped frames within which the signal is assumed to be stationary. So, the formula_2 short-term segment (frame) of recorded input speech is:

:formula_3, 

where &quot;w(n)&quot;: windowed function of length W.

Hence, as specified the footprint of mobile phone of the recorded speech is the convolution distortion that helps to identify the recording phone.

The embedded identity of the cell phone requires a conversion to a better identifiable form, hence, taking short-time Fourier transform:

:formula_4

formula_5 can be considered as a concatenated transfer function that produced input speech, and the recorded speech formula_6 can be perceived as original speech from cell phone.

So, equivalent transfer function of vocal tract and cell phone recorder is considered as original source of recorded speech. Therefore,

:formula_7 

where &quot;Xew(f)&quot; is the excitation function, formula_8 is the vocal tract transfer function for speech in the formula_2 frame and formula_10 is the equivalent transfer function that characterizes the cell phone.

:formula_11

This approach can be useful for speaker recognition as the device identification and the speaker identification are very much connected.

Providing importance to the envelope of the spectrum which multiplied by filter bank (suitable cepstrum with mel-scale filter bank), after smoothing filter bank with transfer function U(f), the log operation on output energies are:

:formula_12

Representing formula_13

:formula_14

MFCC is successful because of this nonlinear transformation with additive property.

Transforming back to time domain:

:formula_15 

where, cy(j), ce(j), cw(j) are the recorded speech cepstrum and weighted equivalent impulse response of cell phone recorder that characterizes the cell phone, respectively, while j is the number of filters in the filter bank.

More precisely, the device specific information is in the recorded speech which is converted to additive form suitable for identification.

cy(j) can be further processed for identification of the recording phone.

Often used frame lengths- 20 or 20 ms.

Commonly used window functions- Hamming and Hanning windows.

Hence, Mel-scale is a commonly used frequency scale that is linear till 1000 Hz and logarithmic above it. 

Computation of central frequencies of filters in Mel-scale:

:formula_16, base 10.

Basic procedure for MFCC calculation:

# Logarithmic filter bank outputs are produced and multiplied by 20 to obtain spectral envelopes in decibels.
# MFCCs are obtained by taking Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of the spectral envelope.
# Cepstrum coefficients are obtained as:

formula_17 , formula_18, 

where formula_19 corresponds to the formula_20-th MFCC coefficient, formula_21 is the number of triangular filters in the filter bank, formula_22 is the log energy output of formula_23-th filter coefficient, and formula_24 is the number of MFCC coefficients that we want to calculate.

== Inversion ==
An MFCC can be approximately inverted to audio in four steps: (a1) inverse DCT to obtain a mel log-power [dB] spectrogram, (a2) mapping to power to obtain a mel power spectrogram, (b1) rescaling to obtain short-time Fourier transform magnitudes, and finally (b2) phase reconstruction and audio synthesis using Griffin-Lim. Each step corresponds to one step in MFCC calculation.

==Noise sensitivity==

MFCC values are not very robust in the presence of additive noise, and so it is common to normalise their values in speech recognition systems to lessen the influence of noise. Some researchers propose modifications to the basic MFCC algorithm to improve robustness, such as by raising the log-mel-amplitudes to a suitable power (around 2 or 3) before taking the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which reduces the influence of low-energy components.

==History==
Paul Mermelstein is typically credited with the development of the MFC. Mermelstein credits Bridle and Brown for the idea:
Bridle and Brown used a set of 19 weighted spectrum-shape coefficients given by the cosine transform of the outputs of a set of nonuniformly spaced bandpass filters. The filter spacing is chosen to be logarithmic above 1 kHz and the filter bandwidths are increased there as well. We will, therefore, call these the mel-based cepstral parameters.
Sometimes both early originators are cited.

Many authors, including Davis and Mermelstein, have commented that the spectral basis functions of the cosine transform in the MFC are very similar to the principal components of the log spectra, which were applied to speech representation and recognition much earlier by Pols and his colleagues.

<text>In baseball, a single is the most common type of base hit, accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball (thus becoming a runner) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder&#x27;s choice. Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder&#x27;s error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder&#x27;s choice) is not credited with a single.

On a single hit to the outfield, any runners on second base or third base normally score, and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to third base. Depending on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner.

Hitters who focus on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often called &quot;contact hitters&quot;. Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits well and having fast running speed to achieve singles are often called &quot;slap hitters&quot;. Ty Cobb, Pete Rose, Tony Gwynn, and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of contact hitters; of these, Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters. 

Unlike doubles or other types of extra base hits, singles do not remove the possibility of multiple force plays on the next fair ball; in fact, the batter achieving the single will be forced to advance to second base on the next play, creating the possibility of a force double play.

==Symbol==
There is no universally accepted symbol for a single. Most often, singles are not reported; rather, the total number of hits, doubles, triples, and home runs is reported; then, hits minus these &quot;extra base hits&quot; yields the number of singles.

Sometimes, 1B is used as the symbol for singles; however, this symbol is more commonly used for the first baseman or for first base itself. Another possible symbol is a horizontal line, &quot;-&quot;. The letter S is never used as a symbol for single, because it is the symbol for strike.

<doc id="300736" wikidata="Q1071368" url="?curid=300736" title="Fielder's choice">
<text>In baseball, fielder&#x27;s choice (abbreviated FC) refers to a variety of plays involving an offensive player reaching a base due to the defense&#x27;s attempt to put out another baserunner, or the defensive team&#x27;s indifference to his advance. Fielder&#x27;s choice is not called by the umpires on the field of play; rather, it is recorded by the official scorer to account for the offensive player&#x27;s advance without crediting him with an offensive statistic such as a hit or stolen base.

Though there are several definitions of fielder&#x27;s choice, the most common (and the only one commonly referred to as FC) involves a fielder fielding a fair ball and choosing to try to put out another baserunner, thereby allowing the batter-runner to safely reach first base. This could be because the defensive player believes they do not have a reasonable prospect of preventing the batter-runner from reaching first base safely, but is usually because it is typically more beneficial for the defensive team to prevent another baserunner from advancing closer to home plate or scoring a run. If another runner is retired on a force out, the batter will not be rewarded with a hit and will be scored a Fielder&#x27;s Choice (FC). Other plays that fall under the definition of FC are usually referred to using other terms such as &quot;defensive indifference&quot; or &quot;on the throw.&quot;

==Definition==
Fielder&#x27;s choice is defined in MLB Rule 2, &quot;Definitions&quot;, as &quot;the act of a fielder who handles a fair grounder and, instead of throwing to first base to put out the batter-runner, throws to another base in an attempt to put out a preceding runner.&quot; FC is recorded for the batter-runner if he reaches first base safely regardless of whether the attempt to put out the other runner(s) is successful. If the other runner is successfully put out for the third out, FC is recorded for the batter-runner regardless of whether he had already reached first base (if the other runner was forced out, the batter is described as &quot;grounding into a force play&quot;).

Rule 2 also defines FC as any of the following circumstances:
* When a batter accomplishes a hit but is able to safely reach an extra base because of the defense&#x27;s attempt to put out another baserunner (e.g., one running towards home plate). Often called &quot;on the throw&quot;. 
* When a runner already on base safely reaches another base due to a fielder&#x27;s attempt to put out another runner, unless his advance can be categorized as a stolen base. Also referred to as &quot;on the throw.&quot;

In many situations fielder&#x27;s choice requires the official scorer to make judgment calls, such as what the outcome of the play would have been had there been no runners on base after taking into account ordinary effort by the defensive team, as well as what effect any errors committed by the defensive team might have had on the play.

===Impact on statistics===
A batter who reaches first base safely as the result of a fielder&#x27;s choice is &quot;not&quot; credited with a hit or a time on base; however, his turn at the plate is recorded as an at bat and plate appearance. Therefore, a player&#x27;s batting average and on-base percentage decrease as a result of reaching first base via fielder&#x27;s choice.

A batter who reaches first base safely but advances on the same play as the result of fielder&#x27;s choice is credited with a hit for the number of bases he would have reached safely with no other runners on base, and is said to have taken the additional base(s) &quot;on the throw&quot;.

A baserunner who makes an undefended steal is not credited with a stolen base, but his advance is accounted for as defensive indifference.

==Examples of fielder&#x27;s choice situations==
* With a runner on first base, the batter hits a ground ball directly to the shortstop. Although he could easily throw the batter-runner out at first base, the shortstop chooses to throw to the second baseman who is covering second base, in an attempt to force out the runner advancing from first. Meanwhile, the batter-runner reaches first base safely. 
** This play is commonly referred to as &quot;grounding into a force out&quot;. Fielder&#x27;s choice is recorded for the batter-runner (6-4 or 6-4-3, depending on whether an attempt was made to put him out), and he is not credited with a hit. 
** A 6-4 FC would be recorded if the preceding runner is put out for the third out, regardless of where the batter-runner is on the basepaths when this occurs.
* With a runner on second base, the batter sends a base hit to the outfield. The outfielder, playing shallow in anticipation of such a hit, throws to home plate in an attempt to put out the runner trying to score. The batter-runner may decide to advance to second base since he can see that there will not be a play there. This play is scored as a single for the batter-runner regardless of the outcome of the attempt to put out the runner trying to score. The term &quot;on the throw&quot; is often used to describe the outcome of any plays in this situation.
** If the batter-runner safely reaches second base regardless of the outcome at home plate, his single still stands, but he is said to have taken second on the throw, or on fielder&#x27;s choice.
** If the batter-runner is thrown out at second base regardless of the outcome at home plate, he is still credited with a single, since the put out was a consequence of his attempt to take second on the throw.
** If the runner attempting to score is put out, he is said to be out at home plate on the throw. If he is put out for the third out, no advance on the throw is recorded for the batter-runner, and the batter-runner is left on base since he is credited with a single.
* With a runner on first base, the batter hits a ground ball back up the middle. The shortstop dives for the ball and saves it from going into center field. Realizing he has no time to throw out the batter-runner at first base, the shortstop tosses the ball to the second baseman covering second base in an attempt to force out the runner coming from first. However, the throw is not in time, and both runners are safe. Assuming the official scorer agrees the shortstop could not have thrown the batter-runner out at first with ordinary effort, this play will be scored as a base hit and not FC.
* With the bases loaded and two outs, the batter takes a called strike or swings and misses at a pitch with two strikes; however, the catcher fumbles or misses the catch. Under the uncaught 3rd strike rule, the batter is obliged to run to first base and all baserunners are compelled to attempt to advance one base to accommodate the batter-runner. The catcher retrieves the ball and steps on home plate, achieving a force play on the baserunner who was on third base when the play began. The play is both a strikeout and a fielder&#x27;s choice. If the pitcher must run to home plate to field a throw of a third-strike pitch that a catcher first fumbled and catches the ball and touches home plate before the runner from third base reaches home plate safely, then the play is a fielder&#x27;s choice (2-1) as well as a strikeout.

<text>In baseball, a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire, without the benefit of a fielder&#x27;s misplay (see error) or another runner being put out on a fielder&#x27;s choice. A double is a type of hit (the others being the single, triple and home run) and is sometimes called a &quot;two-bagger&quot; or &quot;two-base hit&quot;. For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B.

==Description==
Typically, a double is a well-hit ball into the outfield that finds the &quot;gap&quot; between the center fielder and one of the corner outfielders, bounces off the outfield wall and down into the field of play, or is hit up one of the two foul lines. To hit many doubles, a batter must have decent hitting skill and power; it also helps to run well enough to beat an outfield throw. Many of the best double hitting batters were revered for high baseball IQ and the ability to slide well and turn a single into an extra-base hit.

Doubles typically drive in runs from third base, second base, and even from first base at times. When total bases and slugging percentages are calculated, the number two is used for the calculation.

Teams sometimes position their fielders in a &quot;no doubles&quot; defense, meaning:
* Outfielders play relatively deep, to minimize the chance that a fly ball can land behind them.
* Corner infielders play close to the foul lines, to minimize the chance that a ground ball can get by them and roll far into an outfield corner.
This defensive alignment is typically seen late in a game, when the team in the field is ahead by one or two runs.

Renowned doubles hitters occasionally acquire a nickname that relates to their doubles hitting, for example &quot;Mitchy Two Bags&quot; (Mitch Moreland) and &quot;Tony Two Bags&quot; (Anthony Rendon).

===Ground rule double===
A two-base hit awarded by an umpire when a batted ball is hit fairly and bounces out of play is referred to as a ground rule double. The batter is awarded second base and any runners advance two bases from the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. Prior to 1931, such hits were considered home runs. A two-base hit awarded because the batter hit into a special situation defined in the ground rules is also defined as a ground rule double. An example of this occurs where the rules of Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field award a ground rule double if a batted ball is lost in the vines on the outfield bleacher wall. At the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, umpires awarded Dave Kingman a ground rule double in a 1984 game, when a ball he hit became stuck in the roof, although no specific ground rule existed for that situation at the Metrodome at the time.

==Major League Baseball records==
===Career===

The all-time leader in doubles is Tris Speaker, with 792. The following players are the top 10 Major League doubles hitters of all-time:
#Tris Speaker – 792
#Pete Rose – 746
#Stan Musial – 725
#Ty Cobb – 724
#Albert Pujols – 684
#Craig Biggio – 668
#George Brett – 665
#Nap Lajoie – 657
#Carl Yastrzemski – 646
#Honus Wagner – 640

Derek Jeter has the most career doubles (32) in postseason history.

===Season===

Only five players in Major League history have reached 50 or more doubles in a season at least three times: Tris Speaker (1912, 1920–21, 1923, 1926), Paul Waner (1928, 1932, 1936), Stan Musial (1944, 1946, 1953), Brian Roberts (2004, 2008–09) and Albert Pujols (2003–04, 2012).

Individual season leaders:

#Earl Webb (1931) – 67
#George Burns (1926) – 64
#Joe Medwick (1936) – 64
#Hank Greenberg (1934) – 63
#Paul Waner (1932) – 62
#Charlie Gehringer (1936) – 60

Three players have hit eight doubles in a single postseason: Albert Pujols and David Freese (both 2011) and Ben Zobrist (2015).

===Game===
The most doubles hit by a player in a major league game is four. This has been achieved more than 40 times, most recently on April 27, 2022, by Kyle Farmer for the Cincinnati Reds against the San Diego Padres. Only two players—Billy Werber and Albert Belle—have achieved the feat twice. Johnny Damon and Shannon Stewart are the only players to have hit four doubles in interleague play, doing so in separate games on July 18, 2000. The St. Louis Cardinals have recorded the most doubles by a team in one game: they hit 13 doubles in a 17–13 win over the Chicago Cubs on July 12, 1931, in the second game of a doubleheader.

Frank Isbell of the Chicago White Sox hit four doubles in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series, the only time this has been achieved in the postseason. Freddy Sanchez was the first player to hit three doubles in his first three World Series plate appearances, doing so in Game 1 of the 2010 World Series. Later in the game, Sanchez reached second base on a base hit that was initially scored as a double, which would have tied Isbell&#x27;s World Series and postseason records; the play was later amended to a single and an error, however. The sole player to have twice hit three doubles in a postseason game is Albert Pujols, both times in the 2011 postseason. The most doubles hit in a postseason game by both teams combined is 13, by the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox in Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS. There have been 13 postseason games that ended with a walk-off double; the most recent was hit by Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS. The 1924 and 1929 World Series were both won via a game-ending RBI double.

Nine players have hit two doubles in an All-Star Game, most recently Jonathan Lucroy in the 2014 edition.

===Consecutive games===
Bo Bichette hit a double in a record nine consecutive games in 2019.

===Pitching===
Among MLB pitchers, Earl Whitehill of the Washington Senators has given up the most doubles in a game. The Detroit Tigers hit 10 doubles against him on July 10, 1935. Robin Roberts holds the single-season record for doubles conceded (70 in 1953),
while the career record of 820 doubles allowed belongs to Jamie Moyer.

<text>In baseball, a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball, with neither the benefit of a fielder&#x27;s misplay (see error) nor another runner being put out on a fielder&#x27;s choice. A triple is sometimes called a &quot;three-bagger&quot; or &quot;three-base hit&quot;. For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B.

Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball, less common than both the double and the home run. This is because it requires a ball to be hit solidly to a distant part of the field (ordinarily a line drive or fly ball near the foul line closest to right field), or the ball to take an irregular bounce in the outfield, usually against the wall, away from a fielder. It also requires the batter&#x27;s team to have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base, as a stand-up double is sufficient to put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to risk being tagged out whilst trying to stretch a double into a triple (although reaching third base with fewer than two outs could potentially allow the runner to reach home plate on a sacrifice fly). On the extreme, the triple may be stretched into the very rare inside-the-park home run. The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields (generally increasing the number of home runs), ensuring that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history, particularly in the dead-ball era. Another factor that may have contributed to the decrease of triples is the shift from speed to power as the most important factor in batting in the modern era.

A walk-off triple (one that ends a game) occurs very infrequently. In general, game-winning hits with a runner on first base are walk-off doubles, since it is quite common for runners starting on first base to score on a double (as it is to make it from first to third on a single). For example, in 2019, there was not a single walk-off triple.

<text>In baseball, a runner is charged, and the fielders involved are credited, with a time caught stealing when the runner attempts to advance or lead off from one base to another without the ball being batted and then is tagged out by a fielder while making the attempt. The runner is said to be caught stealing or thrown out. A time caught stealing cannot be charged to a batter-runner, a runner who is still advancing as the direct result of reaching base. In baseball statistics, caught stealing is denoted by CS. It may be the result of a rundown.

Major League Baseball (MLB) began tracking caught stealing in 1951. The official MLB rules specify that a time caught stealing is charged when:

* a runner, attempting a stolen base, is put out;
* a runner is caught in a rundown play while stealing, and is tagged out; or
* a runner, attempting a stolen base, is safe because a fielder is charged with an error on catching the ball, and in the judgment of the official scorer, the runner would have been out if the ball had been caught. (This official scoring is almost never made; an error is usually only charged if a bad throw or catch allows the runner to take an additional base, e.g., the runner attempts to steal second, the ball goes into the outfield, and the runner takes third as well. In such an instance the runner is credited with a steal of second, with the error accounting for the advance to third.)

Rickey Henderson is the MLB all-time leader in getting caught stealing (335 times). The active leader is Elvis Andrus with 111 times caught.

==Pickoffs==

A baserunner is &quot;picked off&quot; base when that runner takes a lead off his base and the pitcher (or catcher) makes a quick throw to a fielder manning that base, resulting in the runner being tagged out. In this circumstance, the baserunner is not considered to have been caught stealing. However, if, during the play, the runner made any feint or motion toward the next base, then the runner is caught stealing, even if he is eventually caught trying to re-assume the base which he originally occupied.

==Wild pitch and passed ball==

If a runner is making no attempt to advance to the next base until there is a wild pitch or passed ball, and is then put out trying to advance to the next base, this runner is not caught stealing. The runner is put out on a fielder&#x27;s choice, and a wild pitch/passed ball would not be charged to the pitcher or catcher.

==Records==
Rickey Henderson, the all-time stolen base leader with 1,406 steals, holds the major league and American League records for being caught stealing. Henderson was caught stealing 335 times in his career, including a record 293 times in the American League. Lou Brock, who ranks second on the all-time stolen base list and holds the National League record for career steals with 938, also holds the National League record for times caught stealing. Brock, who spent his entire career in the National League, was caught stealing 307 times.

Henderson also holds the major league and American League records for being caught stealing in a single season. He was thrown out 42 times in 1982, when he also set the post-1900 record for steals in a season with 130. (Hugh Nicol set the all-time record for steals with 138 in 1887 when he played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association. Caught stealing records were not kept then.) Miller Huggins set the single season caught stealing record in the National League in 1914, when he was thrown out 36 times (although he did steal 32 bases that year).

Robby Thompson of the San Francisco Giants was the first player in major league history to be caught stealing four times in one game. This occurred against the Cincinnati Reds on June 27, 1986.

<text>In baseball, a run is scored when a player advances around first, second and third base and returns safely to home plate, touching the bases in that order, before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured. A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely &quot;on base&quot; (that is, on first, second, or third) as a runner and subsequently brings him home. Once a player has scored a run, they may not attempt to score another run until their next turn to bat. The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.

The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then, even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made, his run does not count. However, if the third out is not a force out, but a tag out, then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made, his run will count. In baseball statistics, a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run (R), sometimes referred to as a &quot;run scored&quot;. While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic, it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in (RBIs). Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent; however, the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player&#x27;s contribution toward producing runs for his team.

A pitcher is likewise assessed on runs surrendered in his statistics, which differentiate between standard earned runs (for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors, which do not count in his personal statistics. Specifically, if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning, the Official Scorer – the official in-game statistician – in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned, will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred. For example, with two outs, suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error, and then the next batter hits a two-run home run, and then the following batter then makes the third out, ending the inning. If the inning is reconstructed without the error, and if that third batter, instead of reaching on an error, registered an out, the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring. Thus, the two runs that did score will be classified as unearned, and will not count in the pitcher&#x27;s personal statistics.

If a pitching substitution occurs while a runner is on base, and that runner eventually scores a run, the pitcher who allowed the player to get on base is charged with the run even though he was no longer pitching when the run scored.

==Examples==
Below are examples of an un-counted run and a run scored.

*With a runner on third and two outs, batter hits a ground ball to the second baseman. The runner on third races home. The second baseman fields the ball and throws on to the first baseman in time to get the batter on the force out at first for the third out of the inning. Even if the runner on third had touched home plate before that force out was made at first, his run would not count.
*With a runner on third and two outs, batter hits a fly ball over centerfielder&#x27;s head. It bounces several times as it rolls to the wall. The runner on third runs safely home and easily scores a run. Meanwhile, the batter safely reaches first, then tries to advance to second. The centerfielder, having retrieved the ball, throws the ball to the second baseman and the runner is tagged out as he slides into second. Since the runner stepped on home plate before the batter was tagged out at second for the third out of the inning, his run will count.

==Significant run scoring records==

===Player===
The career record for most runs scored by a major-league player is 2,295, held by Rickey Henderson (1979–2003). The season record for most runs scored is 198, set by Billy Hamilton of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1894. The so-called modern-day record (1900 and after) is 177, achieved by Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees in 1921. The record for most seasons leading one of the major leagues in runs scored is 8, held by Babe Ruth (American League: 1919–21, 1923, 1924, 1926–28).

The record for most consecutive games with at least one run scored is 18, shared by the Yankees&#x27; Red Rolfe (August 9–August 25, 1939) and the Cleveland Indians&#x27; Kenny Lofton (August 15–September 3, 2000). The record for most runs scored by a player in a single game is 7, set by Guy Hecker of the American Association&#x27;s Louisville Colonels on August 15, 1886. The modern-day record of 6 is shared by fourteen players (eight of whom attained it before 1900). Of the six modern-day players to score 6 runs in a game, the first to perform the feat was Mel Ott of the New York Giants on August 4, 1934 (he repeated the accomplishment ten years later, making him the only player ever to do it twice); the most recent was Shawn Green, then of the Los Angeles Dodgers, on May 23, 2002.

===Team===
The record for most runs scored by a major-league team during a single season is 1,212, set by the Boston Beaneaters (now the Atlanta Braves) in 1894. The modern-day record is 1,067, achieved by the New York Yankees in 1931. The team record for most consecutive games with at least one run scored (i.e., most consecutive games not being shut out) is 308, set by the Yankees between August 3, 1931, and August 2, 1933. The team record for most runs in its overall history (up until 2022) is the Chicago Cubs with 100,875.

The record for most runs scored by a team in a single game is 36, set by the Chicago Colts (now the Chicago Cubs) against the Louisville Colonels (which joined the National League in 1892) on June 29, 1897. The modern-day record of 30 was set on August 22, 2007, by the Texas Rangers against the Baltimore Orioles. The National League record was set by the Atlanta Braves with 29 runs against the Miami Marlins on September 9, 2020. The highest combined score in a game is 49 runs on August 25, 1922, when the Chicago Cubs defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 26–23.

The record for most runs scored by a team in a single inning is 18, set by the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs) against the Detroit Wolverines on September 6, 1883. The modern-day record is 17, achieved by the Boston Red Sox against the Detroit Tigers on June 18, 1953.

===Postseason===
The Los Angeles Dodgers scored 11 runs against the Atlanta Braves in Game 3 in the first inning of the 2020 NLCS, the record for the most postseason runs in a single inning.

===World Series===
The Yankees&#x27; Mickey Mantle holds the record for most career World Series runs scored with 42 (1951–53, 1955–58, 1960–64). The record for most runs scored in a single World Series, shared by two players, is 10, achieved both times in a six-game Series: Reggie Jackson of the Yankees was the first to do it, in 1977; the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; Paul Molitor equaled him in 1993. The most runs ever scored by a player in a World Series game is 4, a record shared by ten players. Babe Ruth set the mark on October 6, 1926, while with the Yankees; it was matched most recently by Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the 2011 World Series.

On October 2, 1936, playing the New York Giants, the Yankees set the team record for most runs scored in a single World Series game with 18. Players crossed the plate a record 29 times in the highest-scoring World Series game in history on October 20, 1993, as the Blue Jays beat the Phillies 15–14 at Veterans Stadium in Game 4 of the 1993 World Series.

<text>Corporate accountability is the acknowledgement and assumption of responsibility for the consequences of a company&#x27;s actions. It can be defined in narrowly financial terms, e.g. for a business to meet certain standards or address the regulatory requirements of its business activities. Corporate accountability may also be applied more broadly, such as expectations for a publicly-traded company to be accountable to its employees and local community rather than focusing exclusively on earning profits in the short-term for the benefit of its shareholders.

<text>The Hutton Inquiry was a 2003 judicial inquiry in the UK chaired by Lord Hutton, who was appointed by the Labour government to investigate the controversial circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly, a biological warfare expert and former UN weapons inspector in Iraq.

On 18 July 2003, Kelly, an employee of the Ministry of Defence, was found dead after he had been named as the source of quotations used by BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan. These quotations had formed the basis of media reports claiming that the government had knowingly &quot;sexed up&quot; the &quot;September Dossier&quot;, a report into Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. The inquiry opened in August 2003 and reported on 28 January 2004. The Hutton report cleared the government of wrongdoing, while the BBC was strongly criticised, leading to the resignation of the BBC&#x27;s chairman Gavyn Davies and director-general Greg Dyke. The report was met with scepticism by the British public, and criticism by British newspapers such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, though others said it exposed serious flaws within the BBC.

==Background==
Kelly had been the source for reports made by three BBC journalists that the government, particularly the press office of Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, had knowingly embellished the dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq&#x27;s military capabilities; specifically, a claim that Iraq had the ability to launch a strike using &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; within 45 minutes.

These reports were aired by Andrew Gilligan on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme on 29 May 2003, by Gavin Hewitt on the Ten O&#x27;Clock News the same day and by Susan Watts on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 2 June. On 1 June, Gilligan repeated his allegations in an article written for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, naming government press secretary Alastair Campbell as the driving force for alteration of the dossier.

The government denounced the reports and accused the BBC of poor journalism. In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, Kelly was finally named in the press as the source for Gilligan&#x27;s story on 9 July.

Kelly died by suicide in a field close to his home on 17 July. An inquiry was announced by the British government the following day. The inquiry was to investigate &quot;the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly&quot;.

==The inquiry==

The inquiry opened on 1 August. Hearings began on 11 August. The first phase of the inquiry closed on 4 September. A second session of witness-calling began on Monday 15 September, where some witnesses from the first session, such as Andrew Gilligan, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon, BBC chairman Gavyn Davies and Alastair Campbell were recalled for further questions arising from the first phase, and some witnesses were called for the first time. The taking of evidence closed on Wednesday 24 September. The inquiry heard evidence on 22 days, lasting 110 hours, from 74 witnesses. Examination and cross-examination came from five Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Representing the Inquiry was James Dingemans QC (now Mr Justice Dingemans) and Peter Knox (now KC). Representing the government was Jonathan Sumption (now Lord Sumption). Andrew Caldecott QC represented the BBC.

At the conclusion of the Inquiry there was widespread approval of the process conducted by Hutton. The Inquiry had provided exceptional access to the inner workings of the UK Government and the BBC. Virtually all the documentation provided to the Inquiry was quickly provided to the public on the Inquiry&#x27;s website.

British ambassador David Broucher reported a conversation with Dr Kelly at a meeting in Geneva in February 2003, which he described as &quot;from a very deep memory hole&quot;. Broucher related that Kelly said he had assured his Iraqi sources that there would be no war if they co-operated, and that a war would put him in an &quot;ambiguous&quot; moral position. Broucher had asked Kelly what would happen if Iraq were invaded, and Kelly had replied, &quot;I will probably be found dead in the woods.&quot; Broucher then quoted from an email he had sent just after Kelly&#x27;s death: &quot;I did not think much of this at the time, taking it to be a hint that the Iraqis might try to take revenge against him, something that did not seem at all fanciful then. I now see that he may have been thinking on rather different lines.&quot;

==The report==
Hutton initially announced that he expected to be able to deliver his report in late November or early December. The report was eventually published on 28 January 2004. It ran to 750 pages in 13 chapters and 18 appendices, though this was mainly composed of excerpts from the hundreds of documents (letters, emails, transcripts of conversation, and so on) that were published during the inquiry. The main conclusions were:

* Nobody could have anticipated that Dr Kelly would take his life
* There was &quot;no underhand [government] strategy&quot; to name him as the source for the BBC&#x27;s accusations
* Gilligan&#x27;s original accusation was &quot;unfounded&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s editorial and management processes were &quot;defective&quot;
* The dossier had not been &quot;sexed up&quot;, but was in line with available intelligence, although the Joint Intelligence Committee, chaired by John Scarlett, may have been &quot;subconsciously influenced&quot; by the government
* The Ministry of Defence (MOD) was at fault for not informing Dr Kelly of its strategy that would involve naming him

The report exonerated the government much more completely than had been expected by many observers prior to its publication. Evidence presented to the inquiry had indicated:

* That the wording of the dossier had been altered to present the strongest possible case for war within the bounds of available intelligence
* That some of these changes had been suggested by Alastair Campbell
* That reservations had been expressed by experts within the Intelligence Community about the wording of the dossier
* That David Kelly had direct contact with dissenters within the Defence Intelligence Staff and had communicated their reservations (and his own) to several journalists.
* That, following Dr Kelly&#x27;s decision to come forward as one of Gilligan&#x27;s contacts, Alastair Campbell and Geoff Hoon had wanted his identity made public
* That the Prime Minister himself had chaired a meeting at which it was decided that Dr Kelly&#x27;s name would be confirmed by the Ministry of Defence if put to them by journalists
* That Dr Kelly&#x27;s name had been confirmed after journalists had made multiple suggestions to the MOD press office.
Despite this evidence, Hutton&#x27;s report largely cleared the government of any wrongdoing. In large measure this was because Hutton judged that the government had not known of the reservations in the intelligence community: it seemed they had been discounted by senior intelligence assessors (the Joint Intelligence Committee) — thus Gilligan&#x27;s claim that the government &quot;probably knew&quot; the intelligence was flawed, was itself unfounded. Furthermore, the Inquiry heard that these were not the words used by Gilligan&#x27;s source, but Gilligan&#x27;s own inference. However, the judgement that No. 10 was not aware of the reservations of the intelligence community was not supported by other evidence contained in the report, such as the transcript of an interview given by David Kelly to BBC journalist Susan Watts. In addition to clearing the government, Hutton determined that any failure of intelligence assessments fell outside his remit, and the Intelligence Services thus also escaped censure.

Instead the report placed a great deal of emphasis on evidence of the failings of Gilligan and the BBC, many of which had been explicitly acknowledged during the course of the Inquiry. Gilligan, for example, admitted and apologised for surreptitiously briefing politicians on a select committee in order to put pressure on Dr Kelly. Gilligan, whilst disagreeing with the overall thrust of the report, also admitted that he had attributed inferences to Dr Kelly which were in fact his own.

The Inquiry specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC management, the report said, had accepted Gilligan&#x27;s word that his story was accurate, in spite of his notes being incomplete.

Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story, and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under Davies&#x27; guidance, accepted that further investigation of the government&#x27;s complaints were unnecessary. In his report Hutton wrote of this:

:The Governors should have recognised more fully than they did that their duty to protect the independence of the BBC was not incompatible with giving proper consideration to whether there was validity in the Government&#x27;s complaints, no matter how strongly worded by Mr Campbell, that the allegations against its integrity reported in Mr Gilligan&#x27;s broadcasts were unfounded and the Governors failed to give this issue proper consideration.

There was considerable speculation in the media that the report had been deliberately written to clear the government, a claim disputed by Lord Hutton at a later press conference. Many people remain convinced that this was the case. Suggestions of whitewash were supported by Hutton&#x27;s careful choice of language at certain points in the report. For example, he argued that the use of the phrase &quot;sexed up&quot; by Gilligan would have been taken by the general public to indicate an outright lie rather than mere exaggeration, and thus the claim was untrue.

==Aftermath of publication==
It was because of the report&#x27;s criticism of his actions that Gavyn Davies resigned on the day of publication, 28 January 2004. Reporters from rival news organisation ITN described the day of publication as &quot;one of the worst in the BBC&#x27;s history&quot;. Greg Dyke, the director-general, resigned two days after the publication of the report, following a meeting of BBC Governors where it is reported he only retained the support of one-third of the board. However, after announcing his resignation, Dyke stated:

:I do not necessarily accept the findings of Lord Hutton.

Andrew Gilligan resigned because of his part in the affair on 30 January. However, in his resignation statement he questioned the value of Hutton&#x27;s report:

:This report casts a chill over all journalism, not just the BBC&#x27;s. It seeks to hold reporters, with all the difficulties they face, to a standard that it does not appear to demand of, for instance, Government dossiers.

Blair, who had been repeatedly under fire for the &quot;sexing-up&quot; allegations, told the House of Commons in the debate following the release of the report that he had been completely exonerated. He demanded a retraction from those who had accused him of lying to the House, particularly Michael Howard, the Leader of the Opposition:

:The allegation that I or anyone else lied to this House or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on WMD is itself the real lie. And I simply ask that those that made it and those who have repeated it over all these months, now withdraw it, fully, openly and clearly.

Howard sidestepped the demand for an apology. However, immediately after the Board of Governors had accepted Dyke&#x27;s resignation, Lord Ryder, as Acting Chairman of the BBC, apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for errors made during the affair. Dyke, who had not given the conclusions of the Hutton report his full backing, said that he &quot;could not quite work out&quot; what the BBC was apologising for. &quot;The Independent&quot; subsequently reported that the BBC governors had ignored the advice of BBC lawyers that the Hutton report was &quot;legally flawed&quot;. Although this was denied by the BBC, it was confirmed in 2007 when the BBC was forced to publish minutes of a governors meeting at the BBC that took place directly after the Hutton report.

At the end of the report Hutton recalled how the final part of David Kelly&#x27;s life had not been representative of his entire career in the civil service:

:The evidence at this Inquiry has concentrated largely on the last two months of Dr Kelly&#x27;s life, and therefore it is fitting that I should end this report with some words written in Dr Kelly&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 31 July by Mr Terence Taylor, the President and Executive Director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Washington DC, and a former colleague of Dr Kelly: &quot;It is most important that the extraordinary public attention and political fallout arising from the events of the past month do not mask the extraordinary achievements of a scientist who loyally served not only his Government but also the international community at large.&quot;

Deliberately or otherwise, Dr Kelly had raised wider questions about the quality, interpretation and presentation of intelligence that Hutton had left unanswered. Some of these were to be addressed in a new inquiry, announced by the government on 3 February 2004. Amongst other things, the Butler Report concluded that &quot;the fact that the reference to the 45 minute claim in the classified assessment was repeated in the dossier later led to suspicions that it had been included because of its eye-catching character&quot;. Andrew Gilligan claims that this has vindicated his original story that the dossier had been &quot;sexed up&quot;.

Over a dozen years later, the Chilcot Inquiry came to different conclusions. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported, &quot;Every previous inquiry into Britain&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq has swiftly been condemned by the public as a &quot;whitewash&quot;. Such a description hardly applies to the monumental inquest that has been published by Sir John Chilcot.&quot;

==Leaking of the report prior to publication==
The report was leaked by an unknown party to &quot;The Sun&quot; the night before the official publication date. The &quot;Sun&quot; and consequently most other newspapers in their later editions ran with the leaked version of the report. Delivered by an unnamed source over the telephone to &quot;Sun&quot; political editor Trevor Kavanagh, the leaked version accurately described the report&#x27;s main findings. All sides involved in the Inquiry denounced the leak. Lord Hutton launched a further inquiry into how the report came to be leaked. This second inquiry, carried out by a solicitor, reported on 11 August 2004, but failed to find the source of the leak. It also said there were &quot;no particular weaknesses&quot; in the security of the report and so offered no suggestions of how a similar leak might be prevented in the future.

==Media reaction to the report==

Several national newspapers judged the report to be so uncritical of the government that they accused Hutton of participating in an &quot;establishment whitewash&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote in its editorial &quot;We&#x27;re faced with the wretched spectacle of the BBC chairman resigning while Alastair Campbell crows from the summit of his dunghill. Does this verdict, my lord, serve the real interest of truth?&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; included a large, mostly empty, white space above the fold on its front page containing the word &quot;whitewash?&quot; in small red type.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; headline read &quot;Hutton&#x27;s whitewash leaves questions unanswered&quot; — referring to the fact that an investigation into Britain&#x27;s reasons for joining the war in Iraq was beyond the scope of the inquiry. None of the newspapers presented evidence of a cover-up, but they questioned whether the conclusions were supported by the evidence.

Other newspapers such as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; (both owned by News Corporation and usually critical of the BBC) and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; concentrated on the behaviour of the BBC criticised in the report and called for Greg Dyke to resign, as he did later that day (29 January). &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; depicted Lord Hutton as the three wise monkeys who would &#x27;see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil&#x27;.

The reactions of papers supportive of the Conservative Party, such as &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in part reflected the Conservatives&#x27; disappointment that the report did not find that Blair had misled the House of Commons or the public, which might have precipitated his resignation. On the other hand, left-wing newspapers such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, while supporting Blair against the Conservatives, strongly opposed British participation in the war in Iraq, and sympathised with what they (and many others) saw as the anti-war stance of BBC journalists such as Gilligan. While they probably did not want Blair forced from office, they would have welcomed a finding that Alastair Campbell had falsified the September Dossier.

Martin Kettle wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 3 February: &quot;Too many newspapers invested too heavily in a particular preferred outcome on these key points. They wanted the government found guilty on the dossier and on the naming, and they wanted Gilligan&#x27;s reporting vindicated. When Hutton drew opposite conclusions, they damned his findings as perverse and his report as a whitewash. But the report&#x27;s weakness was its narrowness, and to some extent its unworldliness, not the accuracy of its verdicts.&quot;

Thousands of BBC workers paid for a full-page advertisement in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 31 January in order to publish a message of support for Dyke, followed by a list of their names. The message read:

An ICM public opinion poll, commissioned by the &quot;News of the World&quot; and published on 1 February 2004, showed that 54% of respondents believed Tony Blair&#x27;s reputation had deteriorated. Only 14% thought his status had improved after being vindicated in the report.

In some countries the reputation of the BBC in fact improved as a result of its attacks on the British government during the Kelly affair. The BBC&#x27;s willingness to accuse the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence so publicly of wrongdoing, despite the mistakes the BBC itself acknowledged it had made, boosted its credentials as an impartial and unbiased news source.

Hutton himself defended the report, speaking before a Commons select committee on 14 May 2004. He stated he had not thought it appropriate to embark on a study of the pre-war intelligence: &quot;I had to draw the line somewhere.&quot; He felt the allegations against Gilligan were &quot;far graver&quot; than questions concerning the quality of the intelligence, and that it was right that a separate inquiry, the Butler Review, was being conducted. In November 2006 he dismissed the media claims that his report was a whitewash, saying:
The notoriety of the Hutton Report received a boost when Cherie Blair was reported to have auctioned off a signed copy of the report for £400 for the benefit of the Labour Party in May 2006.

==Criticism==
===Fatality of ulnar artery cuts===
Although suicide was officially accepted as the cause of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old man with no previous psychiatric history.

In December 2010 &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Kelly had a rare abnormality in the arteries supplying his heart; the information had been disclosed by the head of the Academic Unit of Pathology at Sheffield University Medical School, Professor Paul Ince, who noted that the post-mortem had found severe narrowing of the blood vessels, and said that heart disease was likely to have been a factor in Kelly&#x27;s death as the cut to the wrist artery would not itself have been fatal. Vice-President of the British Cardiovascular Society Ian Simpson said that Kelly&#x27;s artery anomaly could have contributed to his death.

Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics who were called to the scene of Kelly&#x27;s death, have since spoken publicly with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the location to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly&#x27;s body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics&#x27; claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Kelly&#x27;s heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.

On 15 October 2007 it was discovered, through a Freedom of Information request, that the knife had no fingerprints on it, nor were fingerprints retrieved from the medication blister pack or Kelly&#x27;s mobile phone.

===Alternative theories for Kelly&#x27;s death===
The BBC broadcast a programme on Kelly on 25 February 2007 as part of the series &quot;The Conspiracy Files&quot;; the network commissioned an opinion poll to establish the views of the public on his death. 22.7% of those surveyed thought Kelly had not killed himself, 38.8% of people believed he had, and 38.5% said they did not know. On 19 May 2006 Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, who had previously investigated the Hinduja affair, which led to the resignation of Peter Mandelson, announced that he had been investigating &quot;unanswered questions&quot; from the official inquiry into Kelly&#x27;s death. He later announced that he had uncovered evidence to show that Kelly did not die from natural causes. In July 2006, Baker claimed that his hard drive had been wiped remotely. Baker&#x27;s book &quot;The Strange Death of David Kelly&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; before publication in November 2007. In his book, Baker argued that Kelly did not commit suicide. Kelly&#x27;s family expressed their displeasure at the publication; his sister-in-law said: &quot;It is just raking over old bones. I can&#x27;t speak for the whole family, but I&#x27;ve read it all [Baker&#x27;s theories], every word, and I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

On 5 December 2009 six doctors began legal action to demand a formal inquest into the death, saying there was &quot;insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt he killed himself&quot;. In January 2010, it was disclosed that Hutton had requested that all files relating to the postmortem remain secret for 70 years. Hutton said this was to protect Kelly&#x27;s family from the distress of further media reports about the death, saying: &quot;My request was not a concealment of evidence because every matter of relevance had been examined or was available for examination during the public inquiry. There was no secrecy surrounding the postmortem report because it had always been available for examination and questioning by counsel representing the interested parties during the inquiry.&quot;

In 2010 Attorney General Dominic Grieve was said to be considering an inquiry to review the suicide finding. Early that August, a group of nine experts, including former coroners and a professor of intensive-care medicine, wrote a letter to the newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; questioning Lord Hutton&#x27;s verdict. On 14 August 2010, Jennifer Dyson, a retired pathologist, amplified the criticism, saying that a coroner would probably have recorded an open verdict in the absence of absolute proof that suicide was intended. She cast further doubt on the circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly, and also criticised Hutton&#x27;s handling of the inquiry. She joined other experts questioning the official finding that Kelly had bled to death and argued that it was more likely that he had suffered a heart attack due to the stress he had been placed under. This intervention came as Michael Howard, the former Conservative Party leader, became the most prominent politician to call for a full inquest into Kelly&#x27;s death.

===&quot;The Strange Death of David Kelly&quot;===
In his 2007 book &quot;The Strange Death of David Kelly&quot;, shortlisted for the Channel 4 Political Book Award 2008, Norman Baker (at the time an MP) argued that Kelly was almost certainly murdered. He described the police investigation and Hutton Inquiry as a &#x27;farce&#x27;, which failed to investigate numerous discrepancies and anomalies in the physical, medical and witness evidence.

Baker concluded that Kelly&#x27;s death was probably a revenge killing by Iraqi supporters of Saddam Hussein, and that it was crudely disguised as a suicide by Thames Valley police – who appeared to have known of an assassination plot in advance – because the British government was fearful of the political consequences. He noted that many of those apparently involved have since received promotions or unusual awards. Baker later stated that more detail about this had to be removed from the book.

While investigating Kelly&#x27;s death, Baker claimed he had experienced strange events, including apparent intimidation of a woman who was assisting him, and the unexplained wiping of his computer&#x27;s hard drive.

===Medical criticisms and calls for inquest===
Throughout 2004 there were frequent questions from medical practitioners, as well as ambulance crew on the scene, about the veracity of the verdict of suicide. They said that it was extremely unusual to die as a result of cutting the ulnar artery – Kelly being the only supposed case of this occurring in 2003 – and that almost no blood was found at the scene.

In August 2010, nine leading doctors and forensic experts wrote to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; calling for a full inquest, on the grounds that the cause of death claimed was extremely unlikely and had not been properly investigated by the Hutton Inquiry. Former Conservative party leader Michael Howard backed their call for an inquest.

In June 2011, Attorney General Dominic Grieve ruled out applying to the High Court for an inquest, saying that the evidence Kelly had committed suicide was &quot;overwhelming&quot;. This was greeted with outrage by the group of doctors campaigning for an inquest, whose leader, Dr Stephen Frost, said the government was &quot;complicit in a determined and concerted cover-up&quot;. He added:

He said that the doctors would seek a judicial review of the decision not to pursue an inquest.

<doc id="300750" wikidata="Q7397362" url="?curid=300750" title="Sacrifice bunt">
<text>In baseball, a sacrifice bunt (also called a sacrifice hit) is a batter&#x27;s act of deliberately bunting the ball, before there are two outs, in a manner that allows a baserunner to advance to another base. The batter is almost always put out, and hence sacrificed (to a certain degree that is the intent of the batter), but sometimes reaches base on an error or fielder&#x27;s choice. In that situation, if runners still advance bases, it is still scored a sacrifice bunt instead of the error or the fielder&#x27;s choice. Sometimes the batter may safely reach base by simply outrunning the throw to first; this is not scored as a sacrifice bunt but rather a single.

A successful sacrifice bunt does not count as an at bat, does not impact a player&#x27;s batting average, and counts as a plate appearance. Unlike a sacrifice fly, a sacrifice bunt is not included in the calculation of the player&#x27;s on-base percentage. If the official scorer believes that the batter was attempting to bunt for a base hit and not solely to advance the runners, the batter is charged an at bat and is not credited with a sacrifice bunt.

In leagues without a designated hitter, sacrifice bunts are most commonly attempted by pitchers, who are typically not productive hitters. Managers consider that if a pitcher&#x27;s at bat will probably result in an out, they might as well go out in a way most likely to advance the runners. The play also obviates the need for the pitcher to run the base paths, and hence avoids the risk of injury. Some leadoff hitters also bunt frequently in similar situations and may be credited with a sacrifice, but as they are often highly skilled bunters and faster runners, they are often trying to get on base as well as advance runners.

A sacrifice bunt attempted while a runner is on third is called a squeeze play. A sacrifice bunt attempted while a runner on third is attempting to steal home is called a suicide squeeze.

Although a sacrifice bunt is not the same as a sacrifice fly, both fell under the same statistical category until 1954.

In scoring, a sacrifice bunt may be denoted by SH, S, or, occasionally, SAC.

==Notable players with 300 or more sacrifice bunts==
The following players have accumulated 300 or more sacrifice bunts in their playing careers:

;Major League Baseball (MLB)

*512: Eddie Collins (2B) &quot;(major league record)&quot;
*392: Jake Daubert (1B)
*383: John &quot;Stuffy&quot; McInnis (1B)
*366: &quot;Wee&quot; Willie Keeler (OF)
*337: Owen &quot;Donie&quot; Bush (SS)
*334: Ray Chapman (SS)
*323: Bill Wambsganss (2B)
*314: Roger Peckinpaugh (SS)
*311: Larry Gardner (3B)
*309: Tris Speaker (OF)
*300: Walter &quot;Rabbit&quot; Maranville (SS)

;Active MLB leaders (as of end of 2017 season)
#100: Elvis Andrus (SS)
#89: Clayton Kershaw (P)
#84: Johnny Cueto (P)
#77: Alcides Escobar (SS)
#75: Erick Aybar (INF)

;Nippon Professional Baseball

*533: Masahiro Kawai (SS) &quot;(world record)&quot;

Since the beginning of the live-ball era (1920), the career leader in sacrifice bunts is Joe Sewell with 275. He was first called up by the Cleveland Indians late in the 1920 season shortly after Indians star shortstop Ray Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch, the event which is generally regarded as the start of the live-ball era.

==Criticism==
Though touted as good strategy by traditionalists, the sacrifice bunt has received significant criticism by modern sabermetrics. Simply, sabermetricians argue that the value of moving a runner to another base is offset by the team&#x27;s sacrificing one of its limited and valuable 27 outs. An out conceded is an out wasted, in other words.

The following stats illustrate the argument. From 1993–2010, if a team had a runner on first base with no outs, on average it would score .941 runs from that point until the end of the inning. If a team had a runner on second base with one out, however, the average was .721 runs from that point forward. Thus, if a batter walks to lead off an inning, that team will, on average, score almost one run in the inning. On the other hand, that team decreases its run expectancy by 23 percent [(1 - 0.721/0.941) * 100%] if it successfully bunts and moves the runner to second with one out.

Complicating affairs are the many difficulties and risks associated with bunting. The runner or runners on base must have speed, or the defense may get an easy force out. A manager could feasibly pinch run, but then his bench becomes smaller (that is, there are fewer substitute players available). The player at the plate must also lay down a quality bunt. That is, the player must lay down a bunt that does not pop up, go foul, or go straight to a fielder. Even if all goes well, if the sacrifice bunt is successful, the team must still get a hit to score the runner, and they now have 2 outs remaining instead of three.

Writing for Baseball Prospectus in 2004, James Click concluded that pitchers should nearly always sacrifice bunt when the option is available to them, and that most position players should sacrifice bunt with a runner on second and no outs in situations where scoring at least one run is more important than maximizing run output (i.e. in the late innings of a close game). In all other situations, he found that sacrifice bunting hurts the sacrificing team more than it helps.

<text>In baseball, a complete game (CG) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher. A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played—pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game, while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game. A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game.

The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball. The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started. In modern baseball, the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975; in the 21st century, a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice.

==Historical trend==

In the early 20th century, it was common for most good Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers to pitch a complete game almost every start, barring injury or ejection. Pitchers were expected to complete games they started. Over the course of the 20th century, complete games became less common, to the point where a modern pitcher may pitch an entire season without throwing a complete game. (In the 2024 MLB season, 0.6% of starts were complete games.) To put this in perspective, as recently as the 1980s, 10–15 complete games a year by a star pitcher was not unheard of, and in 1980, Oakland Athletics pitcher Rick Langford threw 22 consecutive complete games. Years earlier, Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies threw 28 consecutive complete games, spanning the 1952 and 1953 seasons. In 1962, a news article detailed Bo Belinsky&#x27;s concern when he failed to complete six starts in a row.

This change has been brought about by strict adherence to pitch counts as a basis for removing a pitcher, even though he may appear to be pitching well, and new pitching philosophies in general. Many have come to believe that the risk of arm injuries becomes far more prevalent after a pitcher has thrown 100 to 120 pitches in a single game. Though Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan once threw well over 200 pitches in a single game (a 1974 contest in which he pitched 13 innings), it is now rare for a manager to allow a pitcher to throw more than 120 pitches in a start. Former pitcher Carl Erskine noted the increase in ex-pitchers on coaching staffs since the 1950s, whom he considered better evaluators of a pitchers&#x27; ability to pitch late into games. Given this, sabermetricians generally regard Cy Young&#x27;s total of 749 complete games as the career baseball record that will never be broken. Further supporting the belief is that only three pitchers (Young, Ryan, and Don Sutton) even made at least 749 starts in their careers.

James Shields threw 11 complete games in the 2011 season for the Tampa Bay Rays, becoming the first pitcher to reach double digits in a single season since CC Sabathia threw 10 complete games for the Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Brewers in 2008. The last pitcher to throw as many as 15 complete games in a single season was Curt Schilling, who accomplished that feat for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1998. The last pitcher to throw 20 complete games in a single season was Fernando Valenzuela, who did so for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1986. The last pitcher to throw 25 complete games in a season was Rick Langford, who had 28 for the Oakland Athletics in 1980. The last pitcher to throw 30 complete games in a season was Catfish Hunter, who did so for the New York Yankees in 1975.

All pitchers above are right-handed, except for Eddie Plank. All also played most or all of their careers before the start of the modern live-ball era of baseball, which began during the 1920 season and was fully established in 1921. Among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the all-time leader in complete games is Warren Spahn, whose total of 382 places him 21st all-time.

==Other records==

*Jack Taylor completed 187 consecutive games he started between 1901 and 1906.
*Leon Cadore and Joe Oeschger share the record for the longest complete game, achieved when they pitched against each other in a 26-inning marathon that ended in a 1–1 tie on May 1, 1920.
*Allan Travers allowed 26 hits and 24 runs in a 1912 complete game, both still records.

<text>John William Dunne (2 December 1875 – 24 August 1949) was a British soldier, aeronautical engineer and philosopher. As a young man he fought in the Second Boer War, before becoming a pioneering aeroplane designer in the early years of the 20th century. Dunne worked on automatically stable aircraft, many of which were of tailless swept wing design, to achieve the first aircraft demonstrated to be stable. He later developed a new approach to dry fly fishing before turning to speculative philosophy, where he achieved some prominence and literary influence through his &quot;serialism&quot; theory on the nature of time and consciousness, first set out in his 1927 book &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;.

==Biography==
John William Dunne was born on 2 December 1875 in Curragh Camp, a British Army establishment in County Kildare, Ireland. He was the oldest son of Irishman Sir John Hart Dunne KCB (1835–1924) and his English wife Julia Elizabeth Dunne (née Chapman). Despite being born in Ireland of an Irish father, he had an English mother and was born in Ireland only because his father was Lieutenant-Colonel of the British 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment, who happened to be stationed there at the time.

He spent most of his childhood and subsequent career in England. At an early age he suffered a bad accident and was confined to bed for several years. During this time he became interested in philosophy. While still only nine years old he asked his nurse about the nature of time. At the age of 13 he had a dream in which he was in a flying machine that needed no steering.

===Military career===
Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Dunne volunteered for the Imperial Yeomanry as an ordinary Trooper and fought in South Africa under General Roberts. In 1900 he was caught up in an epidemic of typhoid fever and was invalided home.

Recovered and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Wiltshire Regiment on 28 August 1901, he went back to South Africa to serve a second tour in March 1902. He fell ill again and was diagnosed with heart disease, causing him to again return home the next year. Much of his remaining time in the Army would be spent on aeronautical work while on sick leave.

===Aeronautics===
While on Army sick leave in 1901, Dunne began a systematic study of flight. His first attempted model was inspired by a Jules Verne novel but failed to fly. Like many other pioneers he closely observed birds in flight. However, unlike most, he was convinced that a safe aeroplane needed to have inherent aerodynamic stability. Encouraged among others by H. G. Wells, whom he befriended in 1902, he made a great number of small test models which eventually led to the development of a stable tailless swept wing configuration.

On his return to England for the second time he resumed his study of flight and by 1906 had developed a tailless, swept-wing &quot;arrowhead&quot; configuration which was inherently stable and would become his trademark.

At the request of Colonel John Capper, the unit&#x27;s commanding officer, in June 1906 he was assigned to the new Army Balloon Factory in South Farnborough. Dunne wanted to construct a monoplane, but at the time the Army demanded biplanes and Capper instructed him accordingly.

A manned glider, the D.1, with provision for fitting engines and propellers, was constructed under great secrecy and, in July 1907, was taken to Blair Atholl in the Scottish Highlands for flight testing. On its one successful flight, Capper flew it for just long enough to demonstrate its stability before crashing into a wall. It was repaired and fitted with its powered chassis, but was damaged on its first and only attempted flight when the takeoff trolley veered off course.

In the winter of 1907–1908 Dunne designed the Dunne-Huntington triplane and a smaller glider, the D.2, to test the design. The glider was not built but the full-scale craft would eventually be built by A. K. Huntington and flown successfully from 1910.

The 1908 season at Blair Atholl saw two new machines brought up from Farnborough, the D.3 glider and the D.4 powered aeroplane. The glider flew well at the hands of Lt. Launcelot Gibbs, while the D.4 had limited success being badly underpowered and consequently, in Dunne&#x27;s words, &quot;more a hopper than a flyer&quot;.

Dunne returned to the Balloon Factory in the midst of a Government Inquiry into military aeronautics. As a result of its findings the War Office stopped all work on powered aircraft and in the spring of 1909 Dunne left the Balloon Factory. By now, he was also an official in the Aeronautical Society.
With his friends&#x27; financial investment Dunne formed the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate to continue his experiments and took up hangar space on the Aero Club&#x27;s new flying ground at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey. Short Brothers had a manufacturing facility there and were contracted to build the D.5, a broadly similar biplane in which Dunne installed a more powerful 35 hp Green engine. Following a series of increasingly successful flights, on 20 December 1910 Dunne demonstrated the inherent stability of the D.5 to an amazed audience who included two official observers, Orville Wright and Griffith Brewer, making it the first aeroplane to be demonstrably stable in flight. He was able to take both hands off the controls and make notes on a piece of paper.

Dunne&#x27;s next design, free of Army influence, was a monoplane, the D.6, which was built by his former commanding officer, Col. Capper. It failed to fly but its derivatives, the D.7 and D.7bis, flew throughout 1911–1913. British-built examples were flown both at Sheppey and at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, and one was also built by the Astra company in France.

Parallel with the monoplane work, the Dunne D.8 biplane was developed from the D.5. In 1913 an example was bought by Nieuport (who had taken over Astra&#x27;s aeroplane business) and flown across the Channel to France. The next year a much reorganised Farnborough evaluated the type. Production was licensed to both Nieuport in France and Burgess in America, however only the Burgess-Dunne was manufactured in any quantity.

From 1913, Dunne&#x27;s continuing ill health forced him to retire from active flying. The Blair Atholl Syndicate was taken over by armaments conglomerate Armstrong Whitworth and Dunne began work on a D.11. When war broke out in 1914, the project was abandoned and Dunne moved on to other work.

===Later years===

Dunne published his first book, on dry fly fishing, in 1924, with a new method of making realistic artificial flies.

Meanwhile, he was studying precognitive dreams which he believed he and others had experienced. By 1927 he had evolved the theory of serial time for which he would become famous and published an account of it, together with his dream researches, in his next book &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;. In 1932 the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) tried to replicate his experimental results on dream precognition, but their investigator Theodore Besterman failed amid some controversy. The SPR&#x27;s journal editor even prefaced his report with a disclaimer distancing the Society from his findings and Dunne gave his own version two years later in a new edition of his book.

When the playwright J. B. Priestley premiered his 1937 time play &quot;Time and the Conways&quot;, Dunne lectured the cast on his theory. He later gave a television broadcast. Dunne continued to work on serialism throughout the rest of his life and wrote several more books, as well as frequent updates to &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;.

On 3 July 1928, at the age of 52, he married the Hon. Cicely Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, daughter of Geoffrey Cecil Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 18th Baron Saye and Sele, and they lived for a good deal of time after that at the family seat of Broughton Castle. They had two children and he wrote up some of his bedtime stories to them in two more books, &quot;The Jumping Lions of Borneo&quot; and &quot;St. George and the Witches&quot; (published in the US as &quot;An Experiment with St. George&quot;).

===Death===
Dunne died in Banbury, England on 24 August 1949, aged 73.

==Aircraft==

Dunne created some of the first practical and stable aircraft. The majority were unusual in being of tailless swept configuration. Stability was achieved by progressively rolling the leading edge down from root to tip, a feature known as washout. Careful balance of its characteristics allowed the use of only two flight controls. A disadvantage of this was that, without a rudder, crosswind landings were not possible and the approach had to be made into the wind.

Aircraft designed by Dunne included:
* D.1, 1907. Biplane, flown first as a glider, then the powered version was damaged on its first takeoff attempt.
* D.2. Proposed small test glider for the Dunne-Huntington triplane, not built.
* Dunne-Huntington triplane, designed 1907–1908, flown 1910. Triple tandem wing with high-mounted central wing and smaller fore wing, leading some to refer to it as a biplane. Constructed by Professor A. K. Huntington to Dunne&#x27;s design, the only type which was not of tailless swept configuration.
* D.3, 1908. Biplane glider, flew well.
* D.4, 1908. Powered biplane, achieved short hops.
* D.5, 1910. Powered biplane. First Dunne aeroplane to fly, first tailless aeroplane to fly, stable in flight. Following an accident it was rebuilt in modified form as the D.8.
* D.6, 1911. Monoplane, never flew.
* D.7, 1911. Monoplane, flew well. The D.7-bis was a Gnome-powered version of the D.7.
* D.8, 1912. Biplane, several built. The D.8-bis was a Gnome-powered version of the D.8; an example flew from Eastchurch to Paris in 1913.
* D.9, 1913. Unequal-span biplane or sesquiplane project, never completed.
* D.10, 1913. Shorter-span version of D.8. Proved a failure.
* Burgess-Dunne. License-built variants derived from the D.8 and manufactured under license in U.S. from 1913 to 1916; land- and seaplane versions; flew with U.S. and Canadian military air arms.

==Dry fly fishing==
Dunne was a keen dry fly fisherman. At the time Halford&#x27;s theories were fashionable and his flies commonplace, but Dunne noticed that they did not match the real flies he saw while fishing. He was one of the first writers to challenge the Halford school, developing new theories and a number of dry flies based on the translucence of a fly when seen from underneath in direct sunlight. In Dunne&#x27;s flies the hooks were painted white to reflect light, bound in methodically coloured fibres and oiled to make the fibres more translucent.

He published his theories and fly dressings in a book, &quot;Sunshine and the Dry Fly&quot;, in 1924. The first part of the book is primarily a treatise on the vision of the trout and its response to various kinds of prey or lure. The second part comprises instructions for tying the flies which he had designed.

His work proved revolutionary, &quot;amounting almost to heresy.&quot; Writers who have endorsed Dunne include Robert Hartman and Arthur Ransome. Flies to his pattern were still available from Hardy Bros. as late as 1966.

==Dreams and serialism==

Dunne believed that he experienced precognitive dreams. The first he records occurred in 1898, in which he dreamed of the time on his watch before waking up and checking it. Several such experiences, some quite dramatic, led him to undertake a scientific investigation into the phenomenon. Based on years of experimentation with such precognitive dreams and hypnagogic states, both on himself and on others, he claimed that in such states, the mind was not shackled to the present and was able to perceive events in the past and future with equal facility. He used this to support his new theory of time and consciousness. His landmark &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; (1927) recounts the story and also includes his account of the theory of serial time.

Dunne proposed that our experience of time as linear is an illusion brought about by human consciousness. He argued that past, present and future were continuous in a higher-dimensional reality and we only experience them sequentially because of our mental perception of them. He went further, proposing an infinite regress of higher time dimensions inhabited by the conscious observer, which he called &quot;serial time.&quot;

In &quot;The Serial Universe&quot; (1934), &quot;The New Immortality&quot; (1938), &quot;Nothing Dies&quot; (1940) and &quot;Intrusions?&quot; (1955), he further elaborated on the concept of &quot;serialism,&quot; examining its relation to current physics in relativity and quantum mechanics, and to psychology, parapsychology and Christian theology.

Dunne&#x27;s theory offered a scientific explanation for ideas of consciousness being explored widely at the time. It became well known and was discussed by philosophers such as J. A. Gunn, C. D. Broad and M. F. Cleugh, and by the parapsychologist G. N. M. Tyrrell. While some accepted his dream observations and the general thrust of his arguments, the majority rejected his infinite regress as logically flawed.

The ideas underlying Serialism were, and continue to be, explored by many literary figures in works of both fiction and criticism, most notably in the time plays of J. B. Priestley.

<doc id="300755" wikidata="Q648261" url="?curid=300755" title="Polemonium reptans">
<text>Polemonium reptans is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. Common names include spreading Jacob&#x27;s ladder, creeping Jacob&#x27;s ladder, false Jacob&#x27;s ladder, abscess root, American Greek valerian, blue bells, stairway to heaven, and sweatroot.

== Description ==
Jacob&#x27;s ladder grows tall, with pinnate leaves up to long with 5–13 leaflets. The leaves and flower stems grow from a vertical crown with abundant fibrous roots.

The flowers are produced in panicles on weak stems from mid to late spring. They are 1.3 cm ( in) long and have five light blue-violet petals that are fused at the base, enclosed by a tubular calyx with five pointed lobes. The pollen is white. The stigma extends beyond the anthers, making self-pollination difficult, so insects must cross-pollinate for the plants to produce seed.

Pollinated flowers develop into an oval pod with three chambers, 6 mm ( in) long, which is enclosed by the green calyx. The plant spreads by reseeding itself. The Latin specific epithet &quot;reptans&quot; means creeping.

== Ecology ==

The flowers produce both pollen and nectar. Long- and short-tongued bees visit the plants for both nectar and pollen, syrphid flies and fire beetles (&quot;Pedilus lugubris&quot;) feed on pollen, and butterflies and moths drink nectar. Out of these insects, large bees are the most effective at cross-pollination, since they most often touch the pollen-covered anthers.

== Range and habitat ==
&quot;Polemonium reptans&quot; is typically found in rich, moist woods, often along streambanks. Its range extends from Minnesota to New Hampshire in the north, and from Georgia to Mississippi in the south. It is most abundant west of the Appalachian Mountains.

== Cultivation ==

The plant prefers partial shade and mesic soil. It tolerates full sun, but requires constantly moist soil.

== Uses ==
The dried roots have a slightly bitter and acrid taste. &quot;P. reptans&quot; has been traditionally used as an herbal medicine for febrile and inflammatory diseases, to ease coughs, colds and bronchial complaints, and to encourage perspiration. It is furthermore said to bring relief in cases of inflammations and infections. The root is rarely used in modern herbalism. It is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use.

<text>Pag (, ) is the largest town on the island of Pag, with a population of 2,343 (2021) in the urban core and 3,178 in the entire municipality.

==History==

Medieval Pag emerged near the salterns where the abandoned Old Town used to be, south of the present location. According to historical documents, the name Pag was mentioned for the first time in the 10th century. In 976, the Croatian king Stjepan Držislav took Pag from the Byzantine authority and appointed a Croatian district Prefect as the administrator of the town. In 1102, the Croatians voluntary formed a union with Hungary under King Coloman, as they had a succession crisis after the death of Demetrius Zvonimir. Hungary did agree to maintain the Croatian nobility, with the Sabor (Council of Croatian nobles) and a ban (Croat viceroy).

In 1244 Hungarian king Béla IV granted Pag the status of a free royal town. After the rebellion against Zadar, Pag obtained partial autonomy, and Ludovic I acknowledged its full autonomy in 1376 as to all other Dalmatian towns. In the battles against Zadar which took place in 1394, Pag suffered a heavy defeat and devastation, and the inhabitants moved to a new location, where the present Pag was founded.

In 1403, King Louis the Great, the King of Hungary and also of Croatia and Poland, sold his share of Dalmatia, Pag included, to Venice and thus sentenced Pag to a centuries-long life under Venetian rule. In 1433 Pag received the Town Statute, one of the first documents of that sort in Croatia.

In the middle of the 15th century, the Ottoman threat kept rising and therefore the inhabitants of Pag decided to build a new town. The construction works began on today&#x27;s location of the town, on 18 May 1443. The urban plans of the new town were developed in Venice respecting the principles of architecture and urbanism of that time. Giorgio da Sebenico (= Juraj Dalmatinac), a great constructor and sculptor participated in the development of the urban plan.

In the 19th century, the town was ruled by the Austrian monarchy, Dalmatia Province, until the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, under the bilingual name Pag-Pago.

In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the town of Pag had 4700 inhabitants. In later years, and especially in 1905, following the emergence of a blight, which had destroyed the vineyards, the population started declining. Many inhabitants emigrated, mostly to the United States, Canada and Australia.

Another wave of depopulation of Pag town and island took place at the end of the Second World War. In this period, the nobility completely ceased to exist.

During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, the only link between southern and northern Croatia was the island Pag, thanks to the bridge that connects it to the mainland on the south and a ferry line on the north of Pag.

==Cultural heritage==

Pag was the seat of a Roman Catholic Bishop of Cissa.

In 1443 the new town was founded and built according to new principles of town-planning. The longitudinal and the transversal streets, the latter known as Vela ulica, intersect at a right angle, forming in this way a rectangular square with the Collegiate Church, the Duke&#x27;s Palace and the unfinished Bishop&#x27;s Palace, which, as well as the town walls, were built by the famous mason and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico.

The Collegiate Church is a three-nave basilica with three apses. The simple front is decorated with a Gothic portal, a Renaissance rosette and unfinished figures of the saints. In 1466 Juraj Dalmatinac became supervisor of the construction works on the church, while the building itself was carried out by his disciples; finished not before the beginning of the 16th century; restored in the 18th century, when the stucco work on the ceiling was performed. The church accommodates valuable works of art: the altar painting Our Lady of the Rosary, the Gothic wooden cross, and the silver processional crucifix and reliquaries are safeguarded in the treasury. The bell tower with its present height was erected in 1526.

In the Benedictine church of St. Marguerite, constructed after the plan of Giorgio da Sebenico, a silver processional cross and reliquaries are kept. The church of St. George, bearing Renaissance features, is a work of local masons from the 16th century.

There are several houses and smaller palaces with Renaissance façades, portals and coats of arms of local noble families in the town.

The Old Town includes partially preserved walls and the main church, a three-nave basilica built in the Romanesque style; the fronts of the Romanesque and Gothic styles were built in 1392 by the sculptor Paul from Sulmona. The ruins of a Franciscan monastery from 1589 are near the church.

Pag Town is also the place of origin of Paška čipka, the famous lacework whose first mention is related to sisters of the Order of Saint Benedict in 1579. It has been on Unesco&#x27;s list of Intangible cultural heritage since 2009.

==Politics==
===Minority councils and representatives===

Directly elected minority councils and representatives are tasked with consulting tasks for the local or regional authorities in which they are advocating for minority rights and interests, integration into public life and participation in the management of local affairs. At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Albanians of Croatia fulfilled legal requirements to elect 15 members minority councils of the Town of Pag but the elections were not organized due to the absence of candidatures.

==Economy==
Traditionally, cattle and sheep breeding, along with salt extraction, fishing and agriculture have been the basis of survival on the island throughout the centuries. The tradition of salt extraction most probably originates from the times of the first settlement in this area.

These traditional activities have been maintained until the present day. Now, around 40,000 sheep are kept on the island. Also, around 33,000 tons of salt are produced yearly, making ⅔ of the total production in Croatia. The salt basins are spread over .

The most important economic activity, not only for the inhabitants, is tourism. Tourism on the island of Pag has seen a boom in the last decades. A large, well-maintained public beach, particularly suitable for families with children, lies not far from the centre of the town. The famous lacework of Pag, the best-known national lacework, is produced here, and in the local cheese-monger&#x27;s shop one of the most famous authentic national sorts of cheese - Paški sir - may be found. The prominent national costumes are also categorized as national souvenirs. The present rich touristic offering of Pag, which - along with the impressive landscape - stone lace in the sea - make Pag and the Pag Bay an exquisite tourist resort. 

Pag is often called the &quot;island of stone&quot; or the &quot;island of the moon&quot; because of the appearance of its surface, and is one of the sunniest islands in the Adriatic with over 2,500 hours of sunshine per year.

<doc id="300758" wikidata="Q8192188" url="?curid=300758" title="Innings pitched">
<text>In baseball, the statistic innings pitched (IP) is the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that have been put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively.

Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched. It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched. Alternatively, it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs. He could throw one pitch that results in a triple play, and for that one pitch, he would be credited with a full-inning pitched.

==Decline==
In Major League Baseball, the only active players in the top 100 all-time at the end of the season were Tom Glavine (ranked 30th with IP), Randy Johnson (ranked 38th with ), Jamie Moyer (ranked 45th with ) and John Smoltz (ranked 74th with 3473). By the end of the season, only two active players were in the top 100 all-time: CC Sabathia (ranked 73rd with 3470), and Bartolo Colón (ranked 74th with ). This is because over time, innings pitched have declined. Several factors are responsible for this decline:
*From 1876 to 1892, pitchers threw from fifty feet and exerted less stress on their arms (also pitchers often threw underhand in this era). In this era, season totals of 600 innings pitched were not uncommon.
*In 1893, the mound (the pitching rubber, to be more precise) was moved back to the current distance of sixty feet, six inches. However, they still often threw 400 innings in a season. This was because the home run was far less common and pitchers often conserved arm strength throughout the game.
*From 1920 to the 1980s, the four-man pitching rotation was well established. Pitchers could no longer throw 400 innings in a season, as the home run meant a run could be scored at any time. The league leader in innings pitched often threw somewhat more than 300 innings. Occasionally, innings pitched would spike, as in the early 1970s, when Wilbur Wood pitched innings in and then innings in .
*From the 1980s to the present, the four-man rotation was replaced with the five-man rotation, with a weak fifth man who would often be skipped on off days. Also, managers starting using their bullpens more and more, accelerating the decline in innings pitched. As of the start of the 2022 season no pitcher has thrown 250 innings since Justin Verlander in 2011.

<text>In baseball and softball, a double play (denoted as DP in baseball statistics) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs.

In Major League Baseball (MLB), the double play is defined in the Official Rules in the Definitions of Terms, and for the official scorer in Rule 9.11. During the 2023 Major League Baseball season, teams completed an average 132 double plays per 162 games played during the regular season.

==Examples==
The simplest scenario for a double play is a runner on first base with less than two outs. In that context, five example double plays are:
* The batter hits a ground ball
** to an infielder or the pitcher, who throws the ball to one of the middle infielders, who steps on second base to force out the runner coming from first (first out), and then throws the ball to the first baseman in time to force out the batter (second out). As both outs are made by force plays, this is referred to as a &quot;force double play&quot;. This is the most common double play. The neighborhood play is a source of controversy, as umpires sometimes call the runner at second base out despite the infielder not clearly touching that base, but merely being &quot;in the neighborhood&quot;.
** to the first baseman, who steps on first base to force out the batter (first out), and with the baserunner trying to advance from first base to second base, throws the ball to the shortstop who puts out the runner (second out). This is referred to as a &quot;reverse force double play&quot;, although executing the first out removes the condition that forced the runner to take second base. The second out is not a force play and must be made with a tag.
* The batter hits the ball in the air
** a line drive to the first baseman, who catches it (first out), and then steps on first base before the baserunner can return to first to tag up (second out). This is also an example of an unassisted double play.
** a deep fly ball to the right fielder, who catches it (first out), meanwhile the baserunner tags up and attempts to advance, and the outfielder throws the ball to the shortstop who tags the runner before he reaches second base (second out).
* The batter strikes out (first out)
** Meanwhile, the runner attempts to steal second base, and the catcher throws the ball to a middle infielder, who tags the runner before he reaches the base (second out). This is colloquially known as a &quot;strike &#x27;em out, throw &#x27;em out&quot; double play.

Double plays can occur in many ways in addition to these examples, and can involve many combinations of fielders. A double play can include an out resulting from a rare event, such as interference or an appeal play.

===Recordkeeping===
Per standard baseball positions, the examples given above are recorded, respectively, as:
:* 4-6-3 (second baseman to shortstop to first baseman) or 6-4-3 (shortstop to second baseman to first baseman). Other combinations start with 1 (pitcher), 3 (first baseman), or (5 third baseman), followed by 6-3 or 4-3 depending on which middle infielder is covering second base on the play.
:* 3-6 (first baseman to shortstop) 
:* 3 (first baseman), unassisted
:* 9-6 (right fielder to shortstop)
:* K (strike out), 2-6 CS (caught stealing, catcher to shortstop) or 2-4 CS (caught stealing, catcher to second baseman)

Double plays that are initiated by a batter hitting a ground ball are recorded in baseball statistics as GIDP (grounded into double play). This statistic has been tracked since 1933 in the National League and since 1939 in the American League. This statistic does not include line-outs into double plays, for which there is no official statistic for a batter.

== Strategy ==
The double play is a coup for the fielding team and debilitating to the batting team. The fielding team can select pitches to induce a double play — such as a sinker, which is more likely to be hit as a ground ball — and can position fielders to make a ground ball more likely to be turned into a double play. The batting team may take action — such as a hit and run play — to reduce the chance of grounding into a force double play.

==Slang==
In baseball slang, making a double play is referred to as &quot;turning two&quot; or a &quot;twin killing&quot; (a play on &quot;twin billing&quot;, a moviehouse offering two features on the same ticket). Double plays are also known as &quot;the pitcher&#x27;s best friend&quot; because they disrupt offense more than any other play, except for the rare triple play. A force double play made on a ground ball hit to the third baseman, who throws to the second baseman, who then throws to the first baseman, is referred to as an &quot;around the horn&quot; double play.

The ability to &quot;make the pivot&quot; on a force double play – receiving a throw from the third base side, then quickly turning and throwing to first base – is a key skill for a second baseman.

==Tinker to Evers to Chance==

The most famous double play trio—although they never set any records—were Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers and Frank Chance, who were the shortstop, second baseman and first baseman, respectively, for the Chicago Cubs between 1902 and 1912. Their double play against the New York Giants in a 1910 game inspired Giants fan Franklin Pierce Adams to write the short poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot;, which immortalized the trio. All three players were part of the Cubs team that won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910, and the World Series in 1907 and 1908, turning 491 double plays on the way. They were elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.

==Odd and notable double plays==
* The New York Yankees recorded a rare 4-1-5 double play against the San Francisco Giants on July 24, 2016, in the top of the 8th inning. The Giants had Mac Williamson on first base with one out, when Ramiro Peña hit a ground ball that got by Yankees&#x27; first baseman Mark Teixeira but was fielded on the edge of the outfield grass by Starlin Castro. Castro threw to pitcher Chad Green at first base to retire Peña. Meanwhile, Williamson had rounded second on his way to third, and a throw from Green to third baseman Chase Headley resulted in Williamson being tagged out, ending the inning.
* A bizarre 8-6-2 double play occurred in a nationally televised game between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox on August 2, 1985, in the bottom of the 7th inning. With Bobby Meacham on second base and Dale Berra on first base, Rickey Henderson hit a single to deep left-center field. Berra ran quickly from first to second, while Meachem stopped his run towards third to return to second base to tag up (expecting the ball would be caught). After the ball was not caught, both runners – now within a few yards of each other – ran to third and then tried to score. A throw from Luis Salazar in centerfield to Ozzie Guillén at shortstop was relayed to catcher Carlton Fisk in time for him to tag out both Meacham and Berra at the plate.
:* A very similar 9-4-2 double play occurred on October 4, 2006, in Game 1 of the National League Division Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets. After Russell Martin hit a single to right field, both Jeff Kent and J.D. Drew were tagged out at the plate by catcher Paul Lo Duca.

* A 9-2-7-2 double play on July 9, 1985, effectively ended the career of Toronto Blue Jays catcher Buck Martinez. With Phil Bradley – a former University of Missouri football player – on second base, Gorman Thomas hit a single to right field. As Bradley rounded third, Blue Jays right fielder Jesse Barfield charged and fielded the ball and threw to Martinez, who had just enough time to catch the ball before being struck by a charging Bradley. Despite suffering a broken leg and severely dislocated ankle, Martinez maintained control of the ball and registered the out at home plate. As Thomas rounded second, Martinez attempted to throw to third base from a seated position, but the ball missed the third baseman and went into left field. On the error, Thomas rounded third in an attempt to score. Left fielder George Bell fielded the ball near the left-field foul line and quickly returned the ball with a perfect one-hop throw to the still seated and virtually immobile Martinez, who tagged out Thomas.
* On July 30, 2014, a 1-6-1-5 double play occurred without the ball being put into play in top of the 6th inning a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants. Giants reliever Jean Machi, having inherited Gaby Sanchez (as a pinch-runner for Ike Davis) and Travis Snider as base-runners and having allowed a sacrifice to Jordy Mercer, issued a one-out walk to Chris Stewart with first base open. However, since the ball is still live on a walk, Machi, noticing that Snider was well off second base, threw the ball to shortstop Brandon Crawford, who chased down and tagged out Snider for the second out of the inning. Crawford then saw Sanchez having vacated third base and trying to score, and so Crawford threw the ball to Machi (by now in the third base line) to chase Sanchez back to third. Machi then threw the ball to Pablo Sandoval, who chased down and tagged out Sanchez for the third out.
* Another double play without the ball being put into play happened on June 25, 2019, between the Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. In the bottom of the second inning, Braves starter Max Fried walked Javier Báez and Willson Contreras, then after striking out David Bote, walked Addison Russell to load the bases and bring up Cubs pitcher Adbert Alzolay to the plate with one out. Alzolay attempted to bunt on the first pitch he saw from Fried, but missed. Báez, already taking off for home, was then caught in a run-down by Braves catcher Brian McCann between third base and home plate, who then threw to third baseman Josh Donaldson, who then chased down Báez for the second out. Moving over to cover third, Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson then received a throw from Donaldson to tag out Contreras attempting to advance to third, ending the inning. The play was scored 2-5-6.
* Shifts away from normal defensive alignment can create scenarios in which unusual double plays can occur.
:* During the April 12, 2008, game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, in the top of the 7th inning the Boston infield was shifted right for New York left-handed power hitter Jason Giambi, with a baserunner on first. Giambi grounded to second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who threw to third baseman Kevin Youkilis, covering second due to the shift. Youkilis tagged second, then threw to first baseman Sean Casey to complete the rare 4-5-3 double play.
:* The Chicago Cubs turned a 7-2-3 double play against the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 2, 2014. Tied 3–3 in the bottom of the 13th inning, the Pirates loaded the bases with no outs. The Cubs then defensively placed left fielder Junior Lake in the infield, near the third base line. Batter Clint Barmes hit a ground ball to Lake, who threw home for one out, and the catcher then threw to first base for the second out.
*A play can also last long enough to where an outfielder is able to reach the infield to record a double play. During the August 13, 2019 game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies, in the top of the 8th inning, with one out and Nick Ahmed on third and Wilmer Flores at first, Diamondbacks outfielder Jarrod Dyson hit a sharp grounder to Rockies&#x27; first baseman Daniel Murphy. Ahmed broke on contact for home plate, and with the Rockies already down 9–2, Murphy, playing in to try to prevent another run from scoring, elected to bluff a throw home to keep Ahmed from being able to score. In the process, Murphy was able to run across the baseball diamond with the ball and tag Ahmed out before he could return to third base. Meanwhile, Flores had remained on second, but Dyson was heading toward second. Noticing this, Murphy then threw to second baseman Ryan McMahon, who chased back Dyson toward second, near where Flores remained. McMahon then threw back toward Murphy, causing Dyson to return to first. Murphy then threw over to first base, where Rockies pitcher Chad Bettis, now having reached first base, was positioned, to chase Dyson away from first. By this time, Garrett Hampson, a natural second baseman playing center field as a defensive substitute, had reached the infield, took the throw from Bettis, who then tagged out Dyson between first and second to end the half-inning. The play, lasting more than 20 seconds in total, was scored 3-4-3-1-8.
* The St. Louis Cardinals recorded a 3-2-5-4-2-8-6 double play against the Chicago Cubs on September 25, 2021. With the Cubs batting in the bottom of the 8th inning, down 5-4, David Bote led off the inning with a triple to left field off pitcher T.J. McFarland. Trayce Thompson walked on a 3-1 count, and Sergio Alcantara struck out swinging for the first out. With one out, on a 1-1 count, runners on first and third base, Rafael Ortega hit a ground ball to first baseman Paul Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt fielded the ball to catcher Yadier Molina, whom he and the third baseman Nolan Arenado forced Bote into a rundown between third and home. Molina fielded the ball to Arenado, who tagged Bote for the second out. Arenado fielded the ball to second baseman Tommy Edman, who threw it back to Molina, who was between second and third base. He fielded the ball to center fielder Harrison Bader, who was at second. Bader threw the ball to shortstop Paul DeJong, who tagged Thompson to complete the 3-2-5-4-2-8-6 double play.
* On August 27, 2023, the San Francisco Giants recorded a rare 3-1-4-2 double play against the Atlanta Braves. With the Braves batting with one out in the top of the fifth inning, Ronald Acuña Jr. hit a slow roller toward first base that was fielded by first baseman J. D. Davis, who flipped the ball to pitcher Scott Alexander, who in turn underhanded the ball to second baseman Thairo Estrada at first base to force out Acuña. Estrada then threw to catcher Patrick Bailey, whose glove brushed the batting gloves in Orlando Arcia&#x27;s back pocket for the out at home, ending the inning. It was the first time in the expansion era that a 3-1-4-2 play has been turned.

<text>In baseball, a triple play (denoted as TP in baseball statistics) is the act of making three outs during the same play. There have only been 737 triple plays in Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1876, an average of just over five per season.

They depend on a combination of two factors, which are themselves uncommon:

* First, there must be at least two baserunners, and no outs. From analysis of all MLB games from 2011 to 2013, only 1.51% of at bats occur in such a scenario. By comparison, 27.06% of at bats occur with at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs, the scenario where a double play is possible.
* Second, activity must occur during the play that enables the defense to make three outs. Common plays, such as the batter striking out or hitting a fly ball, do not normally provide an opportunity for a triple play. A ball hit sharply and directly to an infielder, who then takes very quick or unanticipated action, as well as confusion or mistakes by the baserunners, is usually needed.

In baseball scorekeeping, the abbreviation GITP can be used if the batter grounded into a triple play.

==Examples==
The most likely scenario for a triple play is no outs with runners on first base and second base, which has been the case for the majority of MLB triple plays. In that context, two examples of triple plays are:
* The batter hits a ground ball to the third baseman, who steps on third base to force out the runner coming from second (first out). The third baseman throws to the second baseman, who steps on second base to force out the runner coming from first (second out). The second baseman throws to the first baseman, with the throw arriving in time to force out the batter (third out). This is an example of grounding into a 5-4-3 triple play, also known as an &quot;around the horn&quot; triple play, per standard baseball positions.
:* During the 1973 season, Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson started two such 5-4-3 triple plays: one on July 7 against the Oakland Athletics, and one on September 20 against the Detroit Tigers. As a hitter, he is the all-time MLB leader for grounding into triple plays, with four in his career.
:* On July 17, 1990, the Minnesota Twins became the first (and to date, the only) team in MLB history to turn two triple plays in the same game. Both were 5-4-3 triple plays, executed by fielders Gary Gaetti, Al Newman, and Kent Hrbek in a game against the Boston Red Sox.
* The baserunners start running in an attempt to steal or execute a hit and run play, and the batter hits a line drive to the second baseman, who catches it (first out). The second baseman throws to the shortstop, who steps on second base before the runner who started there can tag up (second out). The shortstop throws to the first baseman, who steps on first base before the runner who started there can tag up (third out). This is an example of lining out into a 4-6-3 triple play. Some triple plays can involve only two players. For example, if the pitcher catches a line drive (first out) then throws to the shortstop who steps on second base for a runner who fails to tag up (second out) and tags the runner from first before that runner can return to first (third out). This is a 1-6 triple play; similarly, instead of the shortstop, the play might involve the second baseman tagging second (second out) and the runner (third out), resulting in a 1-4 triple play. Note that, in either situation, the second and third outs can be reversed, e.g. the runner from first is tagged (second out), followed by second base being tagged (third out). A triple play can also involve only one defensive player. This is an unassisted triple play, described below.

===Most recent MLB triple play===
The most recent triple play in MLB was turned by the San Diego Padres on September 24, 2024, against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth inning. With Tommy Edman at second base and Enrique Hernandez at first base, Miguel Rojas lined a ball to the third baseman, Manny Machado, who fielded the ball on a hop and touched third base (first out). Machado threw to second baseman Jake Cronenworth (second out), who then threw to Donovan Solano at first base (third out). The Padres won, 4–2, clinching a playoff spot. It was the first triple play for the Padres since 2010.

==Unassisted triple plays==
The rarest type of triple play, and one of the rarest events of any kind in baseball, is for a single fielder to complete all three outs in one play. There have only been 15 unassisted triple plays in MLB history, making this feat rarer than a perfect game.

Typically, an unassisted triple play is achieved when a middle infielder catches a line drive near second base (first out), steps on the base before the runner who started there can tag up (second out), and then tags the runner advancing from first before he can return there (third out). Of the 15 unassisted triple plays in MLB history, 12 have been completed in this manner by a middle infielder.

===Most recent MLB unassisted triple play===
The most recent MLB unassisted triple play is consistent with the above – it occurred on August 23, 2009, by second baseman Eric Bruntlett of the Philadelphia Phillies, in a game against the New York Mets. In the bottom of the ninth inning with men on first and second base, the base runners were both running when Jeff Francoeur hit a line drive very close to second base, which Bruntlett was covering. Bruntlett caught the ball (first out), stepped on second base before Luis Castillo could tag up (second out), and then tagged Daniel Murphy who was approaching from first base (third out) to end the game. This was only the second game-ending unassisted triple play in MLB history, the first one having occurred in 1927.

==Unfielded triple play==
Political columnist and baseball enthusiast George Will posed one hypothetical way that a triple play could occur with no fielder touching the ball. With runners on first and second and no outs, the batter hits an infield fly, and is automatically out: one out. The runner from first passes the runner from second and is called out for that infraction: two outs. Just after that, the falling ball hits the runner from second, who is called out for interference: three outs.

Whenever a batter or runner is out without a fielder touching the ball, MLB rule book section 10.09 provides for automatic putouts to be assigned by the official scorer. In this case, the first out would be credited to whoever the official scorer believes would have had the best chance of catching the infield fly. The second and third outs would be credited to the fielder(s) closest to the points the runners were, when their respective outs occurred. Under the scenario described above, the same fielder (the shortstop, for example) could be credited with all three putouts, thus attaining an unassisted triple play without having touched the ball.

While this has never occurred in a major-league game, Texas League Hall of Famer Keith Bodie tells &quot;Sporting News&quot; that this event occurred in a 1986 spring training game.

==Odd and notable triple plays==

* On September 30, 1962, in the eighth inning of the last game of the 1962 Mets&#x27; 40–120 season, facing the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Joe Pignatano popped into a 4-3-6 triple play in his last MLB appearance. It was also the last game for Sammy Drake and Richie Ashburn, the two runners who were tagged out. Pignatano is the only player to end his career by hitting into a triple play.
* The New York Yankees got caught in a bizarre 2-5-3-1 triple play while facing the Minnesota Twins on May 29, 1982. Roy Smalley struck out (first out), while both Yankees baserunners had taken off in an attempted double steal. The ball was thrown to third baseman Gary Gaetti, who chased baserunner Bobby Murcer back to second, where Murcer was safe. Gaetti then threw the ball to first baseman Kent Hrbek to tag baserunner Graig Nettles who was caught between first and second (second out). Meanwhile, Murcer attempted to advance from second to third again. The ball was thrown from Hrbek to third base, where pitcher Terry Felton was covering, and Felton tagged Murcer (third out).
* On August 6, 2001, catcher Scott Hatteberg of the Boston Red Sox lined out into a triple play completed by Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez and second baseman Randy Velarde (the latter of whom completed an unassisted triple play the previous season). In his very next at-bat, Hatteberg proceeded to hit a grand slam, making him the only player to go from hitting into the best defensive play in baseball to making the best offensive play in baseball in consecutive at-bats.
* On April 14, 2002, designated hitter Ron Wright of the Seattle Mariners grounded into a triple-play in the fourth inning of the only MLB game of Wright&#x27;s career (against the Rangers). With runners on first (John Olerud) and third (Ruben Sierra), Wright grounded to pitcher Kenny Rogers who threw to shortstop Alex Rodriguez to force Olerud at second (first out). Sierra, meanwhile, had broken late for home, and Rodriguez fired to catcher Bill Haselman. Haselman threw to third baseman Hank Blalock who threw to Rogers in the rundown; with Rogers tagging out Sierra (second out). Rogers then threw to second baseman Michael Young, who tagged out Wright trying to reach second (third out). The play was scored 1-6-2-5-1-4. (Wright&#x27;s other plate appearances were a strikeout and grounding into a double play, thus accounted for six outs in three MLB at-bats.)
* In a rare case of a triple play without the batter hitting the ball, a September 2, 2006, game between the Seattle Mariners and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays resulted in three outs instigated from an attempt by the Mariners&#x27; Adrián Beltré to steal second base after cleanup hitter Raúl Ibañez struck out against J. P. Howell. The Devil Rays&#x27; catcher, Dioner Navarro, saw the attempt and threw the ball to shortstop Ben Zobrist, who tagged Beltré for the second out. Mariners&#x27; runner José López, who had been at third base during this play, tried to take advantage of the situation and steal home, only for Zobrist to throw the ball back to Navarro who tagged López out. At the time, the Society for American Baseball Research believed this to be the only 2-6-2 triple play in major-league history.
* On May 19, 2010, in a game between the Washington Nationals and the New York Mets, with runners on first and second for the Nationals in the bottom of the fifth inning, Cristian Guzmán hit a blooper that was caught by Ángel Pagán just before it hit the ground (first out), before throwing the ball into the infield, where catcher Henry Blanco picked it up and threw it to shortstop José Reyes covering second base to force out Liván Hernández, who had advanced to third base (second out), before the ball was thrown to first baseman Ike Davis to force out Nyjer Morgan, who had advanced to second base (third out). The play was scored 8-2-6-3. Had Pagán run with the ball in to second base, he could have completed the first unassisted triple play by an outfielder by stepping on the base to force out Hernández and tagging Morgan out.
* The Yankees also turned one of the more complicated triple plays in MLB history. On April 12, 2013, with runners on first and second in the top of the 8th inning, Baltimore batter Manny Machado hit a sharp one-hopper to Yankees second baseman Robinson Canó. Canó fielded the ball and threw to shortstop Jayson Nix, forcing baserunner Nick Markakis for the first out. Instead of going to first for a routine double play, Nix opted to throw to third baseman Kevin Youkilis, catching baserunner Alexi Casilla between second and third. Youkilis chased Casilla back towards second and threw to Nix, who returned the throw to Youkilis, who tagged Casilla for the second out. Youkilis then threw to first baseman Lyle Overbay, catching Machado in a rundown between first and second. Overbay threw back to Canó, who tagged Machado sliding into second base for the third out. The play was scored 4-6-5-6-5-3-4.
* On May 9, 2015, with runners on second and third in the top of the 2nd inning, St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina hit a line drive that was caught by Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Neil Walker for the first out. Walker then threw to third baseman Jung Ho Kang who stepped on third before Jhonny Peralta could tag up, for the second out. Kang, after a moment&#x27;s hesitation, then threw back to Walker who stepped on second before Jason Heyward could tag up, for the third out. It was the first 4-5-4 triple play in MLB history.
* On April 22, 2016, in a game between the Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox, with the bases loaded in the top of the 7th inning, Mitch Moreland of the Rangers hit a line drive to right field that was caught by Adam Eaton for the first out. Eaton threw the ball to first baseman José Abreu, who tagged baserunner Ian Desmond after he overran first base into foul territory while attempting to tag up, for the second out. Abreu then threw the ball to catcher Dioner Navarro at home. Adrián Beltré, the runner on second base, had tagged up earlier in the play and had started advancing to third; however, Prince Fielder, the runner on third base, was still at third. Navarro threw to shortstop Tyler Saladino, making Beltré continue his run towards third, which in turn made Fielder start to run towards home. Fielder was then caught in a rundown; Saladino threw to Navarro, who then threw to third baseman Todd Frazier, who tagged Fielder for the third out. The play was scored 9-3-2-6-2-5.
* On July 29, 2016, in a game between the Washington Nationals and the San Francisco Giants, the Giants loaded the bases with nobody out in the bottom of the 8th inning. Brandon Crawford hit a line drive that was caught by Nationals&#x27; first baseman Ryan Zimmerman for the first out. Zimmerman then touched first base before Buster Posey could tag up, for the second out. Zimmerman then threw to third baseman Anthony Rendon, who stepped on third before Denard Span could tag up, for the third out. It was the first 3-3-5 triple play in MLB history.
* On August 16, 2018, in a game between the Los Angeles Angels and the Texas Rangers, the Angels loaded the bases with nobody out in the top of the 4th inning. David Fletcher hit a grounder that was fielded by Rangers&#x27; third baseman Jurickson Profar, who had knocked down the ball with his body prior to picking it up. Profar stepped on third base to force out Eric Young Jr. for the first out, then tagged out Taylor Ward at third base (who remained at third believing Profar had caught a line drive) once Ward fell off the bag for the second out, before throwing to second baseman Rougned Odor, who stepped on second to force out Kole Calhoun for the third out, leaving Fletcher stranded at first. The play, scored a 5-5-4 fielder&#x27;s choice, was the first 5-5-4 triple play of any kind since St. Louis Browns third baseman Owen Friend and second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss turned the feat in 1950, and the first triple play fielder&#x27;s choice (to &quot;not&quot; retire the batter) in the live-ball era of MLB (the most recent previous such triple play was in 1912, when the Brooklyn Dodgers turned the feat against the Cincinnati Reds).
* On June 17, 2021, the New York Yankees turned the first 1-3-6-2-5-6 triple play in major league history, against the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York. In the bottom of the first inning with first base open, Bo Bichette on second, Marcus Semien on third, and Yankees starter Michael King pitching and facing Vladimir Guerrero Jr. at the plate, Guerrero hit a ground ball to the third base side that was fielded by King. King threw the ball to first baseman DJ LeMahieu for the first out. During that fielding, Bichette had begun to run to third, forcing Semien to proceed to home plate. LeMahieu noticed that both Semien and Bichette were near the third base bag and threw the ball to shortstop Gleyber Torres, who promptly threw the ball to catcher Gary Sanchez, catching Semien in a rundown between third and home. Sanchez chased Semien back to third and threw the ball to third baseman Gio Urshela, who applied the tag to Semien for the second out. Urshela turned around and threw to Torres to tag out Bichette sliding into third for the final out of the inning.
* On , the Minnesota Twins turned the first known 8-5 triple play in MLB history, in a game against the Chicago White Sox. In the bottom of the seventh inning, with Yoán Moncada on first and Adam Engel on second, A. J. Pollock hit a deep fly ball to center, in what apparently would be an extra-base hit. However, center fielder Byron Buxton caught the ball, making Pollock the first out, while both Moncada and Engel attempted to advance without tagging up. Buxton threw the ball in to third basemen Gio Urshela between second and third. Urshela tagged out Moncada, who had already advanced past second and was attempting to return, for the second out, then stepped on second base to make Engel, who had advanced to third base, the final out.
* On June 25, 2024, the Philadelphia Phillies turned a triple play in the third inning of their 8–1 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, which marked the first successful triple play of the 2024 season, the first triple play the Phillies had turned since 2017, and the first 1-3-5 triple play in the major leagues since 1929.
* On September 24, 2024, the San Diego Padres turned a 5-4-3 triple play in the bottom of the ninth inning to end the ballgame, securing a 4–2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. This was the first instance in major-league history of a team executing a game-ending triple play whilst clinching a postseason berth.

==Cultural references==
On June 27, 1967, the New York Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates staged a triple play before their game at Shea Stadium for the film &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The scene depicts Bill Mazeroski of the Pirates grounding into a game-ending 5-4-3 triple play. Mazeroski, who played 17 major league seasons, was involved in only one actual MLB triple play; he was the runner on second base when the Chicago Cubs turned a 3-3-6 triple play on October 3, 1965.

<text>In baseball and softball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows a plate appearance to continue after the batter should have been put out. The term &quot;error&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the play during which an error was committed.

==Relationship to other statistical categories==

An error that allows a batter to reach first base does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer&#x27;s judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional bases reached was the result of the fielder&#x27;s mistake. In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) &quot;and&quot; an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder&#x27;s mistake, it is scored as a &quot;reach on error (ROE),&quot; and treated the same as if the batter had been put out, hence lowering his batting average.

Similarly, a batter does not receive credit for a run batted in (RBI) when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.

If a play should have resulted in a fielder&#x27;s choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder&#x27;s choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.

Passed balls and wild pitches are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors.

If a batted ball were hit on the fly into foul territory, with the batting team having no runners on base, and a fielder misplayed such ball for an error, it is possible for a team on the winning side of a perfect game to commit at least one error, yet still qualify as a perfect game.

There is a curious loophole in the rules on errors for catchers. If a catcher makes a &quot;wild throw&quot; in an attempt to prevent a stolen base and the runner is safe, the catcher is not charged with an error even if it could be argued that the runner would have been put out with &quot;ordinary effort.&quot; There is therefore a &quot;no fault&quot; condition for the catcher attempting to prevent a steal. However, when considering that the majority of stolen base attempts are successful (around 2 successes per failure), this &quot;no fault rule&quot; is understandable due to the difficulty of throwing out runners. If the runner takes an additional base due to the wild throw, an error is charged for that advance. The other scenario where catchers may be given an error unrelated to fielding a ball in play is catcher’s interference, when the catcher&#x27;s glove is hit by the bat during the swing. The catcher is not given an error in that scenario if the batter gets a hit off the play.

If a run scores by the end of the inning that would not have scored in the absence of the error, the run is categorized as unearned, meaning that it is not treated in the statistics as having been the responsibility of the pitcher.

==Statistical significance==

Traditionally, the number of errors was a statistic used to quantify the skill of a fielder. Research has shown that the error rate is higher when the quality of fielding is suspect, e.g., the performance of an expansion team in its first year, or the fielding done by replacement players during World War II, and is lower when playing conditions are better, e.g. on artificial turf and during night games.

However, fans and analysts have questioned the usefulness and significance of errors as a metric for fielding skill. Notably, mental misjudgments, such as failure to cover a base or attempting a force out when such a play is not available, are not considered errors.

A more subtle, though more significant objection to the error, as sabermetricians have noted, is more conceptual. In order for a fielder to be charged with an error, he must have done something right by being in the correct place to be able to attempt the play. A poor fielder may &quot;avoid&quot; many errors simply by being unable to reach batted or thrown balls that a better fielder could successfully reach. Thus, it is possible that a poor fielder will have fewer errors than any fielder with higher expectancies.

In recent times, official scorers have made some attempt to take a fielder&#x27;s supposed &quot;extraordinary&quot; effort or positioning into account when judging whether the play should have been successful given ordinary effort. However, this still leaves statistics, such as fielding percentage, that are based on errors as a way to compare the defensive abilities of players.

Errors also hold significance in calculating the earned run average (ERA) of a pitcher. Runs scored due to an error are unearned and do not count toward a pitcher&#x27;s ERA.

==Statistical records for errors==
In Major League Baseball (MLB), Herman Long holds the record with 1,096 career errors; he played from 1889 to 1904. Bill Dahlen, Deacon White, and Germany Smith are the only other players to commit at least 1,000 errors during their MLB careers. All of these players played at least one season before 1900. The 20th century record is held by Rabbit Maranville, with 711 errors. Among active players, Brandon Crawford, who has won four Gold Glove Awards, leads with 174 errors.

===Pitchers===

The major league record for errors by a pitcher in a career is held by Hippo Vaughn, with 64 errors. That also is the National League record. The American League career record is held by Ed Walsh. The most errors committed by a pitcher in a season is 28 by Jim Whitney, which also is the National League record. The American League record of 15 is held by three pitchers, Jack Chesbro, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh. The record for most errors committed by a pitcher in one inning is three, first set by Cy Seymour in 1898. That feat was matched by Tommy John in 1988, Jaime Navarro in 1996, and Mike Sirotka in 1999.

===Catchers===
Ivey Wingo holds the major league and National League records for most errors committed by a catcher, with 234. He committed 59 errors while playing for the Cardinals and 175 for the Reds. The American League record is held by Wally Schang, who committed 218 errors playing for five teams.

===First basemen===
The MLB and National League records for errors by a first baseman is held by Cap Anson, who committed 568 errors. Hal Chase holds the American League record with 285, 240 for the New York Highlanders and 40 for the Chicago White Sox. Anson also holds the single season record for most errors by a first baseman 58 while Steve Garvey holds the record for fewest in season, with zero.

===Second basemen===

Fred Pfeffer holds the MLB and National League records for most errors committed by a second baseman, with 857 and 781, respectively. The American League record is 435, held by Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.

===Third basemen===
Jerry Denny holds the MLB and National League records for most errors by third basemen in a career with 533. Jimmy Austin holds the American League record with 359.

===Shortstops===
Long committed 1,070 errors at shortstop, which included games in the American League, National League, and American Association. He is also the only player to commit more than 1,000 errors at one position.

Bill Dahlen holds the National League record for shortstops, with 975 errors in 20 seasons. He committed 443 errors with the Chicago Cubs, 260 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, 200 with the New York Giants and 72 with the Boston Braves. He also committed 89 errors as a third baseman, and eight errors at both second base and as an outfielder, for a total of 1,080 errors in his career.

Donie Bush holds the American League record, with 689 errors. He committed 682 errors with the Detroit Tigers, and recorded 7 with the Washington Senators.

===Outfielders===
Nineteenth-century player Tom Brown established the MLB record with 490 errors committed as an outfielder. He racked up 222 errors in the American Association, 238 in the National League, and 30 in the Players&#x27; League. Brown also committed six errors as a pitcher, for a total of 496 errors in his career. The National League record is held by 19th-century player George Gore with 346 errors and the American League record by Ty Cobb with 271.

<text>Vāgbhaṭa (वाग्भट) was one of the most influential writers of Ayurveda. Several works are associated with his name as author, principally the Ashtāṅgasaṅgraha (अष्टाङ्गसंग्रह) and the Ashtāngahridayasaṃhitā (अष्टाङ्गहृदयसंहिता). The best current research, however, argues in detail that these two works cannot be the product of a single author. Indeed, the whole question of the relationship of these two works, and their authorship, is very difficult and still far from solution. Both works make frequent reference to the earlier classical works, the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita. Vāgbhaṭa is said, in the closing verses of the &quot;Ashtāṅgasaṅgraha&quot; to have been the son of Simhagupta and pupil of Avalokita. His works mention worship of cattle and Brahmanas and various Hindu gods and goddesses, he also begins with a note on how Ayurveda evolved from Brahma and Sarasvati. His work contains syncretic elements.

A frequently quoted erroneous suggestion is that Vāgbhaṭa was an ethnic Kashmiri, based on a mistaken reading of the following note by the German Indologist Claus Vogel: Judging by the fact that he expressly defines Andhra and Dravida as the names of two southern kingdoms and repeatedly mentions Kashmirian terms for particular plants, he is likely to have been a Northern Indian Subcontinental man and a native of Kashmira. Vogel is speaking here not of Vāgbhaṭa, but of the commentator Indu.

Vāgbhaṭa was a disciple of Charaka. Both of his books were originally written in Sanskrit with 7000 sutras.

Sushruta, &quot;Father of Surgery&quot; and &quot;Father of Plastic Surgery&quot;, Charaka, a medical genius, and Vāgbhaṭa are considered to be &quot;The Trinity&quot; of Ayurvedic knowledge, with Vāgbhaṭa coming after the other two. According to some scholars, Vāgbhaṭa lived in Sindhu around the sixth century CE. Not much is known about him personally, except that he was most likely to have been a Vedic doctor, as he mentions Hindu deities in his writings, and his children, grandchildren, and disciples were all Vedic Hindus. It is also believed that he was taught Ayurvedic medicine by his father and a Veda monk named Avalokita.

==Classics of Ayurveda==

The &quot;Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā&quot; (Ah, &quot;Heart of Medicine&quot;) is written in poetic language. The &quot;Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha&quot; (As, &quot;Compendium of Medicine&quot;) is a longer and less concise work, containing many parallel passages and extensive passages in prose. The Ah is written in 7120 Sanskrit verses that present an account of Ayurvedic knowledge. Ashtanga in Sanskrit means ‘eight components’ and refers to the eight sections of Ayurveda: internal medicine, surgery, gynaecology and paediatrics, rejuvenation therapy, aphrodisiac therapy, toxicology, and psychiatry or spiritual healing, and ENT (ear, nose and throat). There are sections on longevity, personal hygiene, the causes of illness, the influence of season and time on the human organism, types and classifications of medicine, the significance of the sense of taste, pregnancy and possible complications during birth, Prakriti, individual constitutions and various aids for establishing a prognosis. There is also detailed information on Five-actions therapies (Skt. &quot;pañcakarma&quot;) including therapeutically induced vomiting, the use of laxatives, enemas, complications that might occur during such therapies and the necessary medications. The &quot;Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā&quot; is perhaps Ayurveda’s greatest classic, and copies of the work in libraries across India and the world outnumber any other medical work. The &quot;Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha&quot;, by contrast, is poorly represented in the manuscript record, with only a few, fragmentary manuscripts having survived to the twenty-first century, suggesting it was not widely read in pre-modern times. However, the As has come to new prominence since the twentieth century by its inclusion in the curriculum for ayurvedic college education in India. The Ah is the central work of authority for ayurvedic practitioners in Kerala.

== Translations ==
The Ah has been translated into many languages, including Tibetan, Arabic, Persian and several modern Indian and European languages. Selected passages of the Ah translated into English have been published in the Penguin Classics series.

== Other attributed works ==

Numerous other medical works are attributed to Vāgbhaṭa, but it is almost certain that none of them are by the author of the Ah.

<doc id="300769" wikidata="Q189990" url="?curid=300769" title="Antony Hewish">
<text>Antony Hewish (11 May 1924 – 13 September 2021) was a British radio astronomer who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 (together with fellow radio-astronomer Martin Ryle) for his role in the discovery of pulsars. He was also awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1969.

==Early life and education==
Hewish attended King&#x27;s College, Taunton. His undergraduate degree, at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, was interrupted by the Second World War. He was assigned to war service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and at the Telecommunications Research Establishment where he worked with Martin Ryle. Returning to the University of Cambridge in 1946, Hewish completed his undergraduate degree and became a postgraduate student in Ryle&#x27;s research team at the Cavendish Laboratory. For his PhD thesis, awarded in 1952, Hewish made practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the scintillations of astronomical radio sources, due to foreground plasma.

==Career and research==
Hewish proposed the construction of a large phased array radio telescope, which could be used to perform a survey at high time resolution, primarily for studying interplanetary scintillation. In 1965 he secured funding to construct his design, the Interplanetary Scintillation Array, at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) outside Cambridge. It was completed in 1967. One of Hewish&#x27;s PhD students, Jocelyn Bell (later known as Jocelyn Bell Burnell), helped to build the array and was assigned to analyse its output. Bell soon discovered a radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first pulsar. Hewish initially thought that the signal might be radio frequency interference, but it remained at a constant right ascension, which is unlikely for a terrestrial source. The scientific paper announcing the discovery had five authors, Hewish&#x27;s name being listed first, Bell&#x27;s second.

Hewish and Ryle were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974 for work on the development of radio aperture synthesis and for Hewish&#x27;s decisive role in the discovery of pulsars. The exclusion of Bell from the Nobel prize was controversial (see Nobel prize controversies). Fellow Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle argued that Bell should have received a share of the prize, although Bell herself stated &quot;it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them&quot;. Michael Rowan-Robinson later wrote that &quot;Hewish was undoubtedly the major player in the work that led to the discovery, inventing the scintillation technique in 1952, leading the team that built the array and made the discovery, and providing the interpretation&quot;.
Hewish was professor of radio astronomy in the Cavendish Laboratory from 1971 to 1989 and head of the MRAO from 1982 to 1988. He developed an association with the Royal Institution in London when it was directed by Sir Lawrence Bragg. In 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;Exploration of the Universe&quot;. He subsequently gave several Friday Evening Discourses and was made a Professor of the Royal Institution in 1977. Hewish was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was also a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

===Awards and honours===
Hewish had honorary degrees from six universities, including Manchester, Exeter and Cambridge, was a foreign member of the Belgian Royal Academy, American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. The National Portrait Gallery holds multiple portraits of him in its permanent collection. Other awards and honours include:
* Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1968
* Eddington Medal, Royal Astronomical Society (1969)
* Dellinger Gold Medal, International Union of Radio Science (1972)
* Albert A. Michelson Medal, Franklin Institute (1973, jointly with Jocelyn Bell Burnell)
* Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize (1974)
* Nobel Prize for Physics (jointly) (1974)
* Hughes Medal, Royal Society (1976)
* Elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1998

Hewish married Marjorie Elizabeth Catherine Richards in 1950. They had a son, a physicist, and a daughter, a language teacher. Hewish died on 13 September 2021, aged 97.

===Religious views===
Hewish argued that religion and science are complementary. In the foreword to &quot;Questions of Truth&quot;, Hewish writes, &quot;The ghostly presence of virtual particles defies rational common sense and is non-intuitive for those unacquainted with physics. Religious belief in God, and Christian belief ... may seem strange to common-sense thinking. But when the most elementary physical things behave in this way, we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense understanding.&quot;

<text>Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American is a book by American author, documentary filmmaker, and activist Michael Moore.

The book is primarily about the state of business and industry in the United States and their power over the U.S. government. In particular, the book focuses its criticism on corporations that focus on satisfying their shareholders rather than caring for the safety and well-being of the communities they are involved in. It is part of Moore&#x27;s ongoing campaign for increased corporate accountability.

The book was first published in hardback in 1996 and later in paperback in 1997.

Moore refers to corporations receiving government tax breaks as &quot;corporate welfare mothers.&quot; He also includes chapters about famous Americans including Hillary Clinton and O.J. Simpson -- including chapters arguing opposing sides of whether or not Simpson was guilty of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Another chapter details Moore&#x27;s unsuccessful endeavors to have Bob Dornan, a State Representative from the 46th District of California, involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation.

<doc id="300778" wikidata="Q3062074" url="?curid=300778" title="Tissue expansion">
<text>Tissue expansion is a technique used by plastic, maxillofacial and reconstructive surgeons to cause the body to grow additional skin, bone, or other tissues. Other biological phenomena such as tissue inflammation can also be considered expansion (see tissue inflammation below).

==Skin expansion==
Skin expansion is a common surgical procedure to grow extra skin through controlled mechanical overstretch. It creates skin that matches the color, texture, and thickness of the surrounding tissue, while minimizing scars and risk of rejection.

When skin is stretched beyond its physiological limit, mechanotransduction pathways are activated. This leads to cell growth as well as to the formation of new cells. In some cases, this may be accomplished by the implantation of inflatable balloons under the skin. By far the most common method, the surgeon inserts the inflatable expander beneath the skin and periodically, over weeks or months, injects a saline solution to slowly stretch the overlaying skin. The growth of tissue is permanent, but will retract to some degree when the expander is removed. Topically applied tissue expansion devices also exist. These have the benefit of being inexpensive and do not require a surgical procedure to implant them under the skin.

Breast reconstruction surgery, for example, can use this technique when the mammary gland is removed by surgery (mastectomy). Later, a more permanent breast implant filled with saline or silicone gel is inserted under the expanded skin pocket.

In other applications, excess skin is grown purposely by expansion on the back or the buttocks, so that it can be harvested later for transplantation to another site where skin was lost due to trauma, extensive wounds, surgery, burns, etc.

=== Mechanics of skin expansion ===
Stretching the skin beyond normal expansion invokes several mechanotransduction pathways which increase mitotic activity and promote collagen synthesis. As a result, the skin surface area increases. Continuum mechanics approaches can be used to model skin growth during tissue expansion and non-linear finite element methods can be used to computationally simulate different tissue growth scenarios.

Tissue growth due to skin expansion can be modeled as anisotropic surface area growth as described by the following equations:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is elastic area stretch that is reversible and formula_3 is irreversible area growth described by:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is a vector in the direction of skin thickness. We assume that the skin does not grow in the thickness direction for area growth is equal to volume growth or formula_6.
We also assume that the newly created skin will have the same density, stiffness, and microstructure as the original, non-expanded skin.

===Radial forearm free flaps===
Recent studies have demonstrated that using topical tissue expansion can reduce the need for a split thickness skin graft after harvesting a forearm free flap. The authors noted that this results in less pain as well as reduced healing time. This method has also been shown to be cost effective as well as improve cosmetics.

===In scalp reconstruction===
Tissue expansion has been used on the scalp for treating scalp scarring and baldness, in lieu of hair transplantation when there is insufficient donor hair to transplant on the scar or the scar tissue is not vascularized to support hair growth. For instance, in a patient who had melanomas removed from the scalp resulting in alopecia defects (hair loss), tissue expansion can be used to allow for the removal of scars and complete hair coverage. The two main indications for choosing tissue expansion over hair grafting are the size and shape of the defect relative to potential supply of donor hair, and the quality and thickness of the scar tissue. Areas of significant scarring and/or tissue atrophy, which is likely to make hair grafting unsuccessful, are best excised and replaced by normal expanded scalp skin. According to research from Dr Jeffrey Stuart Epstein while he was a professor at University of Miami, theoretically there is no limit to the amount of tissue that can be created with tissue expansion, provided the process is conducted gradually.

===Foreskin restoration===
Tissue expansion has also been used for the technique of foreskin restoration, which is usually non-surgical and applies tension externally using specialized devices to replace circumcised tissues with new cells.

Non-surgical tissue expansion techniques can expand one&#x27;s surviving penile skin, making it a longer tube so it can function like a foreskin.

Men who have been circumcised stretch and apply tension to their shaft and foreskin remnants to expand and elongate tissue in efforts to produce a functional foreskin. This form of tissue expansion can take years, as the amount of skin growth required is typically around 15 in2.

==Bone expansion==

Bone is another tissue that can be expanded relatively easily, by using external devices which are slowly separated using mechanical contraptions, so that bone grows in response to elongation (bone distractor). Other techniques and external devices have been studied and have shown some success, such as in the fitbone surgery. This technique was pioneered in 1951 by the Russian physician Ilizarov, and is called the Ilizarov apparatus. It is capable of lengthening limbs in cases of pathological loss of bone, asymmetry of limbs, dwarfism, short stature, etc. In reconstructive and cosmetic surgery, bone expanders have been used to elongate the mandibula in cases of congenital disorders, trauma, tumors, etc. Other newer devices such as the orthofix and intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor (ISKD) are also used for limb lengthening. It can add over 6 inches per bone, but is expensive, painful, and time-consuming (each procedure lasts around 8–12 months).

==Muscle expansion==
Muscle tissue may also expand and grow, in a process known as stretch-induced myofibrillogenesis.

==Tissue inflammation==
Inflammation, in the biological sense, refers to the cellular response of the body to disturbances, be they internal or external. In the case of asthma or chronic bronchitis the human body responds to allergens or pollutants by flooding the bronchial tree and airway walls with mononuclear cells. The layers of the airway wall, including the inner epithelial tissue lining thickens and expands anywhere from 10% to 300% of healthy individuals, and obstructs air flow. Enduring the disease long term coupled with airway hyperresponsiveness (smooth muscle contraction or Bronchial hyperresponsiveness) leads to chronic continuous inflammation and thickening, and noticeable airway remodeling consisting of stiffer airways and lost elasticity. Inflammation in a constricted cylinder, as with an airway, eventually folds over on itself, leading to mechanically studied buckling patterns and growth relationships within tissue linings.

==Breast tissue expansion==
Tissue expansion is a common technique used for breast reconstruction. This essentially involves expansion of the breast skin and muscle using a temporary tissue expander. Three to four weeks after the mastectomy, a saline solution will be injected into the expander to gradually fill it. This process is supported by a tiny valve mechanism located inside the expander and it will continue until its size is slightly larger than the other breast. Typically it can take several weeks to months to complete the process. This tissue expander is removed after a few months and microvascular flap reconstruction or the insertion of a permanent breast implant is done at the time. Chemotherapy or radiation is sometimes recommended by the medical/radiation oncologist following mastectomy. These treatments delay the tissue expansion process by approximately four to eight weeks. Tissue expanders have silicone outer shells and either an internal valve or external port to allow for saline fluid injections.

==Alternatives to skin expansion==
Research dedicated to alternative skin grafts is currently within the purview of tissue engineering. Multiple engineered tissue-derived and tissue-like substances have made it through the FDA and into the market, though financial success has been moderate. Limitations of this strategy include long incubation times, as well as difficulty in mimicking that exact mechanical and biological properties of functional skin. However, benefits range from decreased donor site morbidity (as a result of no longer needing to harvest from skin expansion) as well as a ready-available source of materials for emergency medicine in the case of traumatic burn or injury. There remains much clinical interest today in developing inexpensive engineered skin grafts that possess the mechanical and biological properties of skin.

<doc id="300784" wikidata="Q1541241" url="?curid=300784" title="Coffee filter">
<text>A coffee filter is a filter used for various coffee brewing methods including but not limited to drip coffee filtering. Filters made of paper (disposable), cloth (reusable), or plastic, metal or porcelain (permanent) are used. Paper and cloth filters require the use of some kind of filter holder, whereas filters made out of other materials may present an integral part of the holder or not, depending on construction. The filter allows the liquid coffee to flow through, but traps the coffee grounds.

==Overview==
Paper filters remove oily components called diterpenes (like cafestol and kahweol). Metal, nylon or porcelain mesh filters do not remove these components. These organic compounds, present in unfiltered coffee, have anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies also indicate that the mild consumption of paper-filtered coffee may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to reducing these compounds.

Coffee filters of paper are made from about 100 g/m2 filter paper. The raw materials (pulp) for the filter paper are coarse long fiber, often from fast-growing trees, e.g. Melitta uses up to 60% of bambus in their filters since 1998. Both bleached and unbleached filters are made.

Typically, coffee filters are made up of filaments approximately 20 micrometres wide, which allow particles through that are less than approximately 10 to 15 micrometres.

Some baristas claim that paper filters exhibit a &quot;paperish&quot; taste and recommend to wash out the filter with a flush of hot water before filling the ground coffee into the filter.

Since paper filters filter out some components the resulting coffee is said to taste somewhat fruitier compared to permanent filters.

For a filter to be compatible with a filter holder (in the case of drip coffee preparation also called a dripper) or coffee maker, the filter needs to be a specific shape and size.

== Disposable paper filters ==

=== History of paper filters===
In 1782, Johann Georg Krünitz described a then-new method to extract coffee utilizing blotting paper in a (tinned) metal filter cone shape like.

In Germany and the Netherlands, filter paper inserts were used in narrow conical metal filter holders called &quot;&quot; (Hamburg filter) to extract drip coffee. In 1785, a silver filter was manufactured by Johann Christopher Hellmers, suggesting that porcelain versions existed even earlier. Hamburg filters made out of (enameled) metal or porcelain were still very common in the early 1900s in Germany.

In 1847, (aka Elard Romershausen and Elard [von] Rommershausen) experimented with paper filters while constructing an early &quot;air press coffee machine&quot;.

In 1885, Heinrich Böhnke-Reich (aka Boehnke-Reich) warned of using old wall paper as coffee filters, but favorably described sheets of thick wool-style greyish paper which could be cut into shape for use as quick filters in a conical filter holder.

In 1894, the Wilda&#x27;sche coffee filter device by Eugen Wilda used single-use cloth filter bags, which, in the corresponding patent, were considered to be superior to paper filter bags presumably already in use at the time.

On 8 July 1908, the first commercial paper coffee filter was a 94 mm round filter disk devised by the German entrepreneur Melitta Bentz. She wanted to remove the bitter taste caused by overbrewing. She patented her invention and formed a company, Melitta, to sell the coffee filters (in a format and size later named &quot;1&quot;), hiring her husband and two sons to assist her as the first employees.

=== Filter shapes and sizes ===
==== Cone-, fan- or boat-shaped filters ====
===== Melitta filter systems and derivatives =====
Since 1930/1931, there was a conical paper coffee filter named &quot;&quot; (English: flash filter) featuring rims manufactured by the Berlin-based , a filter paper manufacturer, holding a D.R.G.M. utility patent on their filter. In 1931, Paul Ciupka proposed conical paper coffee filters, which reportedly led to the construction of another coffee filter named &quot;&quot; at the (now Alcan) in 1932. It was recommended by the press. Melitta bought the rights to the Göttingen D.R.G.M. filter patent and, still in 1932, introduced their (English: quick filter), a cone-shaped filter holder looking almost identical to the Brasil filter with a circular bottom with 8 (later 4) holes suitable for use with squarish sheets of filter paper, which still had to be pressed into shape through a metal cone (a so called (presser), a type of filter shaping tool also known as &quot;negotiator&quot; today). These quick filter holders were manufactured of porcelain or metal, available in sizes named &quot;100&quot;, &quot;101&quot;, &quot;102&quot;, and &quot;103&quot;. This system was available up to 1939.

Patented in 1935, Melitta introduced the (English: filter bag) in various sizes in 1936 or 1937 In Germany, Melitta holds a trademark on the term &quot;&quot; (English: filter bag) for the conical fan- or boat-shaped paper filter introduced in 1937, that is why other manufacturers use terms like coffee filter, paper filter, etc.

In 1936, Melitta also took over the manufacturer of the &quot;&quot;. The cone-shaped filter holders were refined in 1936 to get a slot-shaped bottom (originally with 4 holes) more suitable for the filter bags, now looking more fan- or boat-shaped. Over the years the system was expanded to eventually consist of filter bag sizes &quot;100&quot; (for 1–2 cups à – litre), &quot;101&quot; (for 2–3 or 2–4 cups), &quot;102&quot; (for 3–6, 4–6 or 4–8 cups), &quot;103&quot; (for 6–15, 8–15 cups or 10–15), &quot;104&quot; (for 15–25 or 15–30 cups), &quot;105&quot; (for 25–50 or 30–60 cups), &quot;106&quot; (for 50–80 or 60–100 cups), &quot;112&quot; (for 2 cups, with pot mount) and &quot;123&quot; (for 6–10 cups). The system also included special types like tea filters &quot;401&quot; (1–6 cups, compatible with &quot;101&quot;) and &quot;402&quot; (for 3–9 cups, compatible with &quot;102&quot;) and the miniature filter &quot;801&quot; (for 1–2 or 1–3 small cups for children, or 1 normal cup). Brigitta once marketed a fan- or boat-shaped filter size &quot;502&quot;. A disadvantage of the system was that one had to pour water continuously or several times while the proper amount of necessary water could only be guessed.

Therefore, in 1963 or 1965 Melitta developed a new fan- or boat-shaped filter system with corresponding &quot;1×&quot; nomenclature: In this system the filters are sized big enough so that the whole amount of water (except for the water needed for blooming) can be poured in one go. Consequently, the filter sizes &quot;1×2&quot;, &quot;1×4&quot;, &quot;1×6&quot; and &quot;1×10&quot; result in 2, 4, 6, and 10 cups of coffee when filling the filter once. Since these filters only differ in height and have otherwise the exact same geometry, bottom width (about 49 mm) and angle (about 54°), the filter bags are interchangeable between filter holders of different sizes.

Both systems are still in use today in principle, but the sizes &quot;103&quot;, &quot;104&quot;, &quot;105&quot;, &quot;106&quot;, &quot;112&quot;, &quot;123&quot;, &quot;401&quot;, &quot;402&quot;, (&quot;502&quot;,) &quot;801&quot; and &quot;1×10&quot; are no longer manufactured.

Common in the US are fan- or boat-shaped filters &quot;#0&quot; (similar to &quot;100&quot;), &quot;#1&quot; (similar to &quot;101&quot;), &quot;#2&quot; (similar to &quot;102&quot;), &quot;#4&quot; (similar to &quot;1×4&quot;), and &quot;#6&quot; (similar to &quot;1×6&quot;), with &quot;#2&quot;, &quot;#4&quot; and &quot;#6&quot; being particularly popular, as well as basket-shaped filters in an 8–12 cup home size and larger restaurant sizes.

===== Hario filter system =====

The Hario &quot;vector 60&quot; V60 is a cone-shaped brewer (with 60° angle), with ribs along the wall (to prevent the paper sticking and allowing air through) and a single large hole (to allow water to pass through unrestricted).
Hario began designing brewers in 1980; the V60 design was released in 2004.
The brewer received the Japanese Good Design Award in 2007
and is used by many of the winners in the World Brewers Cup. In partnership with 2013 World Barista Champion Pete Licata it was further developed into the Hario W60, a brewer with a flat-bottomed mesh filter, to &quot;address the concern baristas have with &#x27;flat bed&#x27; brewing&quot;.
The Hario Switch combines steeping with drip filtering.

Hario has cone-shaped paper filter bag sizes &quot;01&quot; (for 1 cup), &quot;02&quot; (for 1–4 cups) and &quot;03&quot; (for 1–6 cups).

==== Other filter shapes ====
Saint Anthony Industries (SAI) introduced a conical filter called &quot;C70&quot; (2018) and a flat-bottom filter &quot;F70&quot; (2019) with a steep 70° angle.

Other Melitta filter sizes include the pyramid filters &quot;202s&quot;, &quot;203&quot;, &quot;206(G)&quot;, &quot;220(G)&quot;, &quot;240(G)&quot; and &quot;270(G)&quot;, round filter disks &quot;1&quot; (94 mm), &quot;1a&quot; (60 mm), &quot;2&quot; (120 mm) and &quot;2b&quot;, and &quot;50&quot;, circle filter rings (for percolators) &quot;3  in.&quot; (89 mm), &quot;164mm&quot;, &quot;190mm&quot;, &quot;203mm&quot;, &quot;235mm&quot;, &quot;240mm&quot;, &quot;244mm&quot;, &quot;256mm&quot;, &quot;260mm&quot;, &quot;290mm&quot;, &quot;330mm&quot;, &quot;400mm&quot; and &quot;440mm&quot;, prepleated flat-bottom basket filters &quot;(A)250/90&quot; (250 mm/90 mm, also known as &quot;90/250&quot;) and &quot;(A)250/110&quot; (250 mm/110 mm), roll filters &quot;2004&quot; as well as wrap filters (for percolators, 232 × 241 mm). While some of them are still available today, most of them have fallen out of use for long.

A squarish pyramid filter Filtra &quot;602&quot; was available as well.

Other basket filter sizes include &quot;101/317&quot;, &quot;152/350&quot;, &quot;152/457&quot;, &quot;203/533&quot; and &quot;280/635&quot;.

Other round filter disks include 160 mm, 220 mm, 195 mm, 230 mm.

The Aeropress and Ceado Hoop use round paper filter disks with a diameter of c. 63 mm.

The German Tricolate coffee dripper uses round paper filter disks with a diameter of 88 mm.

The Kanas-based NextLevel drippers use proprietary round disk paper filters as well (95 mm for the LVL-10 and 77 mm for the Pulsar).

The Hario cold brew dripper Slow Brew &quot;Shizuku&quot; (WDC-6) and Water Dripper Clear (WDW-6) take 58 mm round filter disks.

===== Chemex filter system =====
The six conical filter holder sizes for the Chemex coffee maker (originally introduced in 1941) and the Funnex utilize two different sizes of paper filters. A half-moon shaped filter paper (bleached: FP-2, unbleached: FP-2N) is used for the 3-cup holders (CM-1, CM-1C, CM-1GH) and the Funnex (CM-FNX), which must be folded before use. The larger holders for 5 (CM-2), 6 (CM-6A, CM-6GH), 8 (CM-3, CM-8A, CM-8GH), 10 (CM-10A, CM-10GH) and 13 cups (CM-4) can alternatively use prefolded square sheets (bleached: FS-100, unbleached: FSU-100), prefolded circle filters (bleached: FC-100) or unfolded circle filters (bleached: FP-1). The paper is 20–30% thicker than regular paper filters.

=== Other filter parameters and properties ===
Other important coffee filter paper parameters are strength, compatibility, efficiency and capacity.

If a coffee filter is not &quot;strong&quot; enough, it will tear or rupture, allowing coffee grains through to the coffee pot. &quot;Compatibility&quot; describes a filter medium&#x27;s resistance to degradation by heat and chemical attack; a filter that is not compatible with the liquid passing through it is likely to break down, losing strength (structural failure). &quot;Efficiency&quot; is the retention of particles in a target (size) category. The efficiency is dictated by the particles or substances to be removed. A large-mesh filter may be efficient at retaining large particles but inefficient at retaining small particles. &quot;Capacity&quot; is the ability to &quot;hold&quot; previously removed particles while allowing further flow. A very efficient filter may show poor capacity, causing increased resistance to flow or other problems as it plugging up prematurely and increasing resistance or flow problems. A balance between particle capture and flow requirements must be met while ensuring integrity.

== Reusable cloth filters ==
Reusable cloth (such as cotton, hemp, linen, silk, wool, hair cloth, horse hair, fustian, muslin or flannel) has been used to filter coffee for a very long time. Like paper, it strains out the coffee grounds, but the cloth filter allows more of the oil to come through than paper filters. An example of a cloth filter is the in Costa Rican chorreador coffee makers.

== Permanent filters ==

Permanent filters can be divided into two groups:

The first type integrates the filter sieve with the holding mechanism into one part.

The second type of permanent filters are inserts to be used with a separate filter holder. For this, they are resembling the shape of disposable paper or reusable cloth filters otherwise used with those filter holders. Like them they can exhibit some amount of water bypass.

Permanent metal filters are also used to prepare filtered coffee, including Vietnamese iced coffee and Indian filter coffee. The &quot;French press&quot; (also referred to as cafetière) uses a metal filter. Other types of permanent filters are made of plastic, porous ceramics, or porcelain (like the double-layered cross-slitted strainer made from through-glazed porcelain of Karlsbad-style coffee makers or the special porcelain filter sieves of Büttner system coffee makers).

== Filter holders ==
Filter holders are made out of plastic (including Makrolon/Exolon, Tritan, Ecozen), metal (stainless steel, copper, aluminium, emaille), ceramics, porcelain or glass, or, rarely, wood. Most of them are designed to be used with disposable paper and reusable cloth filter inserts, but there is also an after-market of permanent filter inserts made out of plastic, metal or ceramics which can be used in filter holders originally designed for paper or cloth filters. Another type of permanent filters combines the actual filter sieve with its holding mechanism into one integral part.

Filter holders for cone-, fan- or boat- as well as for flat-bottom shaped (paper) filters can be distinguished by features of their mechanical construction, some of which also have a significant influence on taste, brewing time, utility and how (easy) to clean the filter holder:

* filter geometry (Melitta-, Hario-, SAI- or Orea-style filter shape and angle, etc.)
* filter size (depending on filter geometry and system for a different number of cups and/or different pouring styles)
* rib structure (straight (Melitta, Hario), interrupted ( or Beem), or origami design), direction (straight down (Melitta), spiral (Hario, Seltmann Weiden, Beem)), spacing (narrow, sparse) and location (whole inner surface of filter cone, only at lower half of filter cone) to influence bypass and clogging
* bottom structure (with or without ridges, conical, apex or flat) to influence channeling and clogging
* number of draining holes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 or 12) and diameter (one large hole as for Hario-, one or more equally-sized small holes as for Melitta-style filters, combination of a large center hole with small surrounding holes as for the Torch Mountain dripper, or an adjustable count of holes as with the &quot;December&quot; dripper)
* material (porcelain, ceramics, stainless steel, copper, aluminium, glass, plastic) and color
* mount (standard plate mount for pots or cups, affixable pot mount (like Melitta 112), ring mount for a coffee stand or tripod, long cylinder outlet to fit Thermos bottles (like Fröfilt &quot;K&quot;, Alfi &quot;Aroma Plus&quot;, or Gefu &quot;Sandro&quot; / Cilio #4 filters, or the Friesland filter adapter), single-cup filter mount, or integrated with coffee pot (like with Melitta &quot;Diabolo&quot;))
* type of handle (none, style of handle, number of grips)
* special features like stopper valves (as for Melitta 401/402 tea filter holders, the Clever Dripper, the Bonavita Immersion Dripper, the Goat Story GINA, the December Dripper, the Hario Switch, the Melitta Amano, the NextLevel Pulsar, or the Sworksdesign Bottomless Dripper) for steep &amp; release brewing, cup-viewing windows (as for Zero Japan Bee House filters, Melitta filter holders since 2018, or the Le Crueset dripper), anti-dribbling &quot;tripod&quot; plate design, design for simultaneous pouring into one or two cups (as for Melitta filter holders since 2018), double-walled design for better thermal insulation (as for Melitta Oslo Form 23 &quot;102 M&quot; filters, KPM Café Berlin LAB filters #2/#4, the Seltmann Weiden No Limits Barista filter #2, the Melitta 111th Anniversary Set filter 102, the Fellow Stagg X/XF drippers, the Chemex Funnex, the notNeutral Gino dripper, the Villeroy &amp; Boch Coffee Passion V60 filter, the Brewista Tornado Duo filters, or the Etkin 8-cup and 2-cup drippers), radial water feeding (like with the Ceado Hoop), or a collapsible design for easier storage
* accessories like a water spreader or cover lid or top-plate to help water distribution and reduce the temperature decline during pouring, a saucer to catch coffee droplets after use, a mounting stand, or coffee chilling stones.

Metal and porcelain filter holders store more heat than glass or plastic filters and therefore should be pre-heated to avoid too large temperature drops during pouring.

<doc id="300785" wikidata="Q105076364" url="?curid=300785" title="Win–loss record (pitching)">
<text>In baseball and softball, a win–loss record (also referred to simply as a record) is a statistic that indicates the number of wins (denoted &quot;W&quot;) and losses (denoted &quot;L&quot;) credited to a pitcher. For example, a 20–10 win–loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses.

In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the &quot;winning pitcher&quot;) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the &quot;losing pitcher&quot;) in their respective statistics. These pitchers are collectively known as the &quot;pitchers of record&quot;. The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a &quot;decision&quot;, and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have &quot;no decision&quot;. In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the pitcher who is awarded the win.

The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league&#x27;s rules. The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited, such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture. If the game is tied (a rare event), no pitcher is awarded any decision. A pitcher&#x27;s winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses), and it is commonly expressed to three decimal places.

==Winning pitcher==
In Major League Baseball, the winning pitcher is defined as the pitcher who last pitched prior to the half-inning when his team maintains the lead that it never relinquishes.

There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is that a starting pitcher must complete a minimum of five innings, the length of an official game, to earn a win. Failure to do so results in the ineligibility to be the winning pitcher, even if he last pitched prior to the half-inning when he maintains his team&#x27;s lead. The official scorer awards the win to the relief pitcher who, in the official scorer&#x27;s judgment, was the most effective.

The second exception applies if the relief pitcher who last pitched prior to the half-inning when the winning team took the lead the last time was &quot;ineffective in a brief appearance&quot; in the official scorer&#x27;s judgment, in which case the win is awarded to the succeeding relief pitcher who, in the official scorer&#x27;s judgment, was the most effective.

In the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, every pitcher is considered as a relief pitcher for the purpose of this rule. For example, Shohei Ohtani, the starter for the American League, was awarded the win in the 2021 All-Star Game despite throwing only 14 pitches in a single inning.

==Losing pitcher==

The losing pitcher is the pitcher who is responsible for the go-ahead run charged to his team, after which his team does not tie the game or regain the lead.

If a pitcher allows a run which gives the opposing team the lead, his team comes back to lead or tie the game, and then the opposing team regains the lead against a subsequent pitcher, the prior pitcher does not get the loss.

If a pitcher leaves the game with his team in the lead or with the score tied, but with the go-ahead run on base, and this runner subsequently scores the go-ahead run, the pitcher who allowed this runner to reach base is responsible for the loss. This is true regardless of the manner in which this batter originally reached base, and how he subsequently scored. If the relief pitching successfully completes the half-inning without surrendering the go-ahead run, the departed pitcher cannot receive a loss.

For example, on April 13, 2007, Carlos Zambrano of the Chicago Cubs was facing the Cincinnati Reds in the top of the 5th inning. He was taken out of the game with the Cubs leading 5–4 and the bases loaded. The pitcher who replaced him, Will Ohman, proceeded to allow two of the runners on base to score, giving the Reds a 6–5 lead. Although Zambrano was not pitching at the time the runs were scored, he was charged with the loss, as the base runners who scored were his responsibility.

==Background==
The pitchers who receive the win and the loss are known, collectively, as the pitchers of record. A pitcher who starts a game but leaves without earning either a win or a loss (that is, before either team gains or surrenders the ultimate lead) is said to have received a no decision, regardless of his individual performance. A pitcher&#x27;s total wins and losses are commonly noted together; for instance, a pitching record of 12–10 indicates 12 wins and 10 losses.

In the early years of Major League Baseball before 1900 it was common for an exceptional pitcher to win 30 or more games in one season, with Old Hoss Radbourn of the defunct Providence Grays holding the record with 60 wins in 1884. Since 1900, however, pitchers have made fewer and fewer starts and the standard has changed. Gradually, as hitting improved, better pitching was needed. This meant, among other things, throwing the ball much harder, and it became unrealistic to ask a pitcher to throw nearly as hard as he could for over 100 pitches a game without giving him several days to recover.

In the first third of the 20th century (especially after the live-ball era), winning 30 games became the rare mark of excellent achievement; this standard diminished to 25 games during the 1940s through 1980s (the only pitcher to win 30 or more games during that time was Denny McLain in 1968, in what was an anomalous pitching-dominated season).

Since 1990, this has changed even further, as winning 20 or more games in a single season is now achieved by only a handful of pitchers each season. For example, in 2004 only three of the more than five hundred major league pitchers did so. In 2006 and again in 2009, no pitcher in either league won 20 games. The last pitcher to win 25 games was Bob Welch in 1990.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2011 that as advanced statistics have expanded, a pitcher&#x27;s win–loss record has decreased in importance. Many times a win is substantially out of the pitcher&#x27;s control; even a dominant pitcher cannot record a win if his team does not score any runs for him. For example, Félix Hernández won the Cy Young Award in 2010 in spite of a 13–12 record. The Mariners (for whom he pitched) scored the fewest runs in the Majors with 513 that season while Félix Hernandez had an ERA of 2.27 and pitched a league-leading 249.2 innings. Similarly, in 2004, Milwaukee Brewers starting pitcher Ben Sheets had a losing record of 12–14, despite displaying a league-best 8:1 strikeout-to-walk ratio and was among the top 5 pitchers in ERA (2.70) and WHIP (0.98). In addition to their dependence on run support, wins for a starting pitcher are also dependent on bullpen support. A starting pitcher can pitch brilliantly, leaving the game with the lead, and then watch helplessly from the dugout as the bullpen blows the save and gives up the lead. That would entitle the starting pitcher to a no-decision instead of a win despite the strong performances, regardless of whether or not the team ends up winning. Starting pitchers on teams with a weak bullpen tend to have fewer wins because of this. Likewise, a pitcher can give a poor performance and give up many runs and leave the game earlier than desired, but still win because his team scored even more runs. Some prefer the quality start statistic as an indication of how many times a starting pitcher gave his team a realistic chance to win.

==Decision records==

Pud Galvin (1883) holds the major league record for most decisions (75) in a season. During the 1908 season, Ed Walsh had 55 decisions, which remains the most in a season since 1900. Wilbur Wood holds the season record for the live-ball era (1920–present), recording 44 decisions in 1973. As of 2024, Roy Halladay and Adam Wainwright (31 decisions each in 2010) were the last pitchers to have had 30 or more decisions in a season. The career record is held by Cy Young, who had 826 decisions between 1890 and 1911.

<text>Great Sankey is a civil parish in the Borough of Warrington in Cheshire, England. It is west of Warrington town centre and has a population of 31,600 according to the 2021 census.

==History==
The township of Great Sankey was originally a chapelry in Prescot parish in Lancashire. It became formally a separate civil parish in 1866, and it was transferred to Cheshire in 1974. There was industrial growth along the banks of the Sankey Canal at Sankey Bridges during the 19th century but otherwise the area was rural. In the 20th century the area became largely a residential area. RAF Burtonwood was built on the outskirts in 1939, and the land is now transformed into Chapelford Urban Village and the Omega Development Site.

==Governance==
Great Sankey forms part of Warrington South constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament. It has three council wards for the election of councillors to Warrington Borough Council: Great Sankey South, Great Sankey North and Whittle Hall, and Chapelford and Old Hall. All are represented by Labour councillors.

The civil parish is governed by a parish council consisting of fifteen elected members.

==Religion==
The Parish Church of the Church of England is in the Diocese of Liverpool and dedicated to St. Mary. The nearest Roman Catholic church is in Penketh (St. Joseph&#x27;s). Similarly, the nearest Methodist Church is also in Penketh.

==Demographics==
Data are based on official 2001 census figures, and also on those of Great Sankey North and Great Sankey South wards.

===Population and ethnicity===
The district of Great Sankey has a total population of 16,960 residents, of which 49.5% are male and 50.5% are female. The average age of the population at the 2001 census was 24.3 years. Of the 16,960 residents, 98.05% describe their racial origin as white. Other major majorities are mixed (0.55%), black (0.15%) and Asian origin (0.75%). Other race accounts for 0.50%.

===Housing and social situation===
At the last count (2001), there were 6,381 households in Great Sankey, of which 87.10% are owner occupied, 9.55% are social accommodation, 2.70% are rented from private landlords and 0.70% have residents who live rent free. The average house price is £136,409. Of the 6,381 houses, 2.80% are classed as overcrowded.
The population density is 43.75 residents per hectare. The majority of residents describe Sankey as a &quot;comfortably well-off&quot; area. On the Index of Multiple Deprivation, Great Sankey was described as one of the most affluent areas of Warrington.

===Affluence===
Great Sankey is one of the more affluent parts of Warrington north of the River Mersey. Its key position near the M62 motorway links, and being in between the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, make it a popular place to live. Relatively unaffected by the 2008 financial bank crisis, unlike other parts of Warrington, the area has continued to see the development of Chapelford Urban Village, with new restaurants and shopping facilities nearby. Developments on the north-western section of the former Burtonwood Airbase, known as Omega, also continue, although most of that is not in the parish.

===Employment and education===
66.20% of all resident in the Great Sankey wards are employed while unemployment stands at 2.25%. Of the population 2.50% of residents are students in full-time education. 26.44% of residents are economically inactive (due to retirement, disability or acting as a full-time carer). In terms of education, 24.05% of residents have no qualifications whatsoever (mainly down to dropping out of school early or failing end of school examinations). 49.70% of residents only have level one or two qualifications (at least 1 GCSE pass (A*-G) or equivalent), and 18.25% have at least level three qualifications (at least 2 A-levels (A-E) or 4 AS levels (A-E) or equivalent).

==Education==
The secondary school is Great Sankey High School. This site also contains facilities for its sixth form under the name of Barrow Hall College. Nine primary schools (Barrow Hall, St Philips, Park Road, Old Hall, St Joseph&#x27;s, Chapelford Village, St James, Callands and Burtonwood) serve Great Sankey.

Sycamore Lane Primary School closed in early 2013, with staff and pupils relocating to Chapelford Village Primary School.

==Transport==
Sankey railway station is on the Liverpool to Manchester line and had an hourly service of stopping trains run by Northern. That was reduced to four services a day from the opening of Warrington West railway station (in Chapelford) on 16 December 2019, where Northern Rail provide two trains per hour, supplemented by peak hour TransPennine Express services between Liverpool and Cleethorpes. Bus services link the area with Warrington Town Centre. Great Sankey is on the A57 road linking Warrington with the M62 motorway at junction 7. The nearest airport is Liverpool John Lennon Airport.
