<doc id="303059" wikidata="Q737068" url="?curid=303059" title="Richard F. Outcault">
<text>Richard Felton Outcault (; January 14, 1863 – September 25, 1928) was an American cartoonist. He was the creator of the series &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; and &quot;Buster Brown&quot; and is considered a key pioneer of the modern comic strip.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Outcault was born on January 14, 1863, in Lancaster, Ohio, to Catherine Davis and Jesse P. —spelled without the &quot;u&quot; their son later added. He attended the McMicken School of Design in Cincinnati from 1878 to 1881, and after graduating did commercial painting for the Hall Safe and Lock Company.

===Early career===
Outcault painted electric light displays for Edison Laboratories for the 1888 Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States in Cincinnati. This led to full-time work with Edison in West Orange, New Jersey, doing mechanical drawings and illustrations. Edison appointed him official artist for the company&#x27;s traveling exhibition in 1889–90, which included supervising the installation of Edison exhibits at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. While there, he studied art in the Latin Quarter and added the &quot;u&quot; to his surname.

In 1890 Outcault returned to the US, married, and moved to Flushing in New York City. He worked making technical drawings to &quot;Street Railway Journal&quot; and &quot;Electrical World&quot;, a magazine owned by one of Edison&#x27;s friends. On the side, he contributed to the humor magazines &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Puck&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

===The Yellow Kid===

The &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper began publishing cartoons in 1889. The &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot; added a color supplement in 1892, the first in the US, and when the &quot;World&quot;″s publisher Joseph Pulitzer saw it, he ordered for his own newspaper the same four-color rotary printing press. A color Sunday humor supplement began to run in the &quot;World&quot; in Spring 1893. The supplement&#x27;s editor Morrill Goddard contacted Outcault via Roy McCardell on the staff of &quot;Puck&quot; and offered Outcault a full-time position with the &quot;World&quot;. Outcault&#x27;s first cartoon for the paper appeared on September 16, 1894: a six-panel, full-page comic strip titled &quot;Uncle Eben&#x27;s Ignorance of the City&quot;. Though not the first strips to employ multi-panel narrative strips—even at the &quot;World&quot;—Outcault&#x27;s were among the earliest. His primary subjects were African Americans who lived in a town called Possumville and Irish immigrants who lived in tenement slums.

An Outcault cartoon from the June 2, 1894 (in &quot;Truth&quot; magazine) featured a big-eared, bald street kid in a gown. Outcault continued to draw the character, who made his debut in the &quot;World&quot; on January 13, 1895. The kid appeared in color for the first time in the May 5 issue in a cartoon titled &quot;At the Circus in Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;. Outcault weekly &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; cartoons appeared from then on in color, starring rambunctious slum kids in the streets, in particular the bald kid, who gained the name Mickey Dugan. In the January 5 episode of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, Mickey&#x27;s gown appeared in bright yellow. He soon became the star of the strip and became known as &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot;, and that May the Kid&#x27;s dialogue began appearing on his yellow gown. The strip&#x27;s popularity drove up the &quot;World&quot;″s circulation and the Kid was widely merchandised. Its level of success drove other papers to publish such strips, and thus the Yellow Kid is seen as a landmark in the development of the comic strip as a mass medium.

Outcault may not have benefited from the strip&#x27;s merchandise revenue. Though he applied at least three times, he does not appear to have been granted a copyright on the strip. Common practice at the time would have given the publisher the copyrights to the strips they printed on a work-for-hire basis, though not to the characters therein.

California newspaperman William Randolph Hearst set up offices in New York after buying the failing &quot;New York Morning Journal&quot;, which he renamed the &quot;New York Journal&quot;. He bought a color press and hired away the &quot;World&quot;″s Sunday supplement staff, including Outcault, at greatly increased salaries. Hearst&#x27;s color humor supplement was named &quot;The American Humorist&quot; and advertised as &quot;eight pages of polychromatic effulgence that make the rainbow look like a lead pipe&quot;. It debuted on October 18, 1896, and an advertisement in the &quot;Journal&quot; the day before boasted: &quot;The Yellow Kid—Tomorrow, Tomorrow!&quot; The strip was titled &quot;McFadden&#x27;s Row of Flats&quot;, as the &quot;World&quot; claimed the &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; title. A week earlier, on October 11, Outcault&#x27;s replacement at the &quot;World&quot; George Luks took over with his own version of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;; he had handled the strip earlier, the first time that May 31. Both papers advertised themselves with posters featuring the Yellow Kid, and soon the association with their sensational style of journalism led to the coining of the term &quot;yellow journalism&quot;.

The installment for October 25, 1896—&quot;The Yellow Kid and his New Phonograph&quot;—featured speech balloons for the first time. Outcault&#x27;s strips appeared twice a week in the &quot;Journal&quot;, and took on a form that was to become standard: multipanel strips in which the images and text were inextricably bound to each other. Comics historian Bill Blackbeard asserted this made it &quot;nothing less than the first definitive comic strip in history&quot;. From January to May 1897, Hearst sent Outcault and the &quot;Humorist&quot;″s editor Rudolph Block to Europe, a trip Outcault reported on in the paper through a mock Yellow Kid diary and an &quot;Around the World with the Yellow Kid&quot; strip, which took the place of &quot;McFadden&#x27;s Row of Flats&quot;.

The Yellow Kid&#x27;s popularity soon faded, and the last strip appeared on January 23, 1898. Luks&#x27; version had ended the month before. The character made rare appearances thereafter. Hearst had launched the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; and made Outcault the editor of the daily comics page. He continued to contribute cartoons to it, as well as to the &quot;World&quot;, where he had &quot;Casey’s Corner&quot; published, a strip about African-American characters that debuted on February 13, 1898, and moved to the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; on April 8, 1898. It was the first newspaper strip to feature continuity.

Outcault freelanced cartoons to other papers in 1899. &quot;The Country School&quot; and &quot;The Barnyard Club&quot; ran briefly in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In the &quot;New York Herald&quot; ran &quot;Buddy Tucker&quot;, about a bellhop, and &quot;Pore Lil Mose&quot;, the first strip with an African-American title character—a prankster portrayed in a heavily stereotyped manner.

===Buster Brown===
Outcault introduced Buster Brown to the pages of the &quot;Herald&quot; on May 4, 1902, about a mischievous, well-to-do boy dressed in Little Lord Fauntleroy style, and his pit-bull terrier Tige. The strip and characters were more popular than the Yellow Kid, and Outcault licensed the name for a wide number of consumer products, such as children&#x27;s shoes from the Brown Shoe Company. In 1904 Outcault sold advertising licenses to 200 companies at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Journalist Roy McCardell reported in 1905 that Outcault earned $75,000 a year from merchandising and employed two secretaries and a lawyer.

At the &quot;Herald&quot;, Outcault worked alongside fellow comic strip pioneer Winsor McCay (who at that point was mostly working on illustrations and editorial cartoons). A rivalry built up between the two cartoonists, which resulted in Outcault leaving the &quot;Herald&quot; to return to his previous employer, William Randolph Hearst at &quot;The New York Journal&quot;. In the &quot;Journal,&quot; Outcault began using multiple panels and speech balloons following the earlier examples of Frederick Burr Opper and Rudolph Dirks.

Outcault took Buster Brown to Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot; in January 1906. The &quot;Herald&quot; continued to publish Buster Brown strips by other cartoonists; Outcault sued, and the &quot;Herald&quot; countersued the &quot;American&quot;″s publishers for the character&#x27;s trademark.

Outcault had not applied for a copyright to Buster Brown, but asserted a &quot;common-law title&quot;—what comics historian Don Markstein asserted is one of the earliest claims to creators&#x27; rights. The court decided the &quot;Herald&quot; owned the &quot;Buster Brown&quot; name and title and the copyright on the strips it published, but the characters themselves were too intangible to qualify for copyright or trademark. Nonetheless a later court case established that Outcault owned all other rights to Buster Brown. This freed Outcault to continue the strip in the &quot;American&quot; as long as he did not use the &quot;Buster Brown&quot; name.

Outcault continued the untitled Buster Brown strip until 1921, though increasingly the work was done by assistants. He focused rather on merchandising, and set up an advertising agency in Chicago at 208 South Dearborn Street to handle it. In 1914 he proposed unsuccessfully a Buster Brown League for boys too young to join the Boy Scouts.

Outcault retired from newspapers and spent the last ten years of his life painting. After a ten-week illness he died on September 25, 1928, in Flushing, New York. His widow later interred his ashes at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Personal life==
Outcault married Mary Jane Martin, the granddaughter of a Lancaster banker, on Christmas Day 1890. The couple had two children.

<text>The Spanish Empire, sometimes referred to as the [[Hispanic Monarchy (political entity)|Hispanic Monarchy]] or the Catholic Monarchy, was a colonial empire that existed between 1492 and 1976. In conjunction with the Portuguese Empire, it ushered in the European Age of Discovery. It achieved a global scale, controlling vast portions of the Americas, Africa, various islands in Asia and Oceania, as well as territory in other parts of Europe. It was one of the most powerful empires of the early modern period, becoming known as &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot;. At its greatest extent in the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Spanish Empire covered , making it one of the largest empires in history.

Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus and continuing for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America. The Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation—the first circumnavigation of the Earth—laid the foundation for Spain&#x27;s Pacific empire and for Spanish control over the East Indies. The influx of gold and silver from the mines in Zacatecas and Guanajuato in Mexico and Potosí in Bolivia enriched the Spanish crown and financed military endeavors and territorial expansion. Another crucial element of the empire&#x27;s expansion was the financial support provided by Genoese bankers, who financed royal expeditions and military campaigns.

In 1700, Philip V became king of Spain after the death of Charles II, the last Habsburg monarch of Spain, who died without an heir. His ascension triggered the War of the Spanish Succession, as various European powers contested his claim to the throne. The conflict concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, allowing Philip, the first Bourbon king of Spain, to retain the throne but resulting in territorial losses for Spain: Gibraltar, Menorca, the Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Italy. In 1763, after the Seven Years&#x27; War, Spain ceded both East Florida and West Florida to Great Britain while gaining Louisiana from France. However, in 1783, following the American Revolutionary War, Britain ceded both Floridas back to Spain as part of the Treaty of Paris. Spain had recaptured West Florida in 1781 through military operations. Both Floridas were ceded to the United States in 1819 as part of the Adams-Onís Treaty. Louisiana was ceded back to France in 1801 in the Treaty of Aranjuez.

The Bourbon monarchy implemented reforms like the &quot;Nueva Planta decrees&quot;, which centralized power and abolished regional privileges. Economic policies promoted trade with the colonies, enhancing Spanish influence in the Americas. Socially, tensions emerged between the ruling elite and the rising bourgeoisie, as well as divisions between peninsular Spaniards and Creoles in the Americas. These factors ultimately set the stage for the independence movements that began in the early 19th century, leading to the gradual disintegration of Spanish colonial authority. By the mid-1820s, Spain had lost its territories in Mexico, Central America, and South America. By 1900, it had also lost Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippine Islands, and Guam in the Mariana Islands following the Spanish–American War.

== Catholic Monarchs and origins of the empire ==

With the marriage of the heirs apparent to their respective thrones Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile created a personal union that most scholars view as the foundation of the Spanish monarchy. The union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon joined the economic and military power of Iberia under one dynasty, the House of Trastámara. Their dynastic alliance was important for a number of reasons, ruling jointly over a number of kingdoms and other territories, mostly in the western Mediterranean region, under their respective legal and administrative status. They successfully pursued expansion in Iberia in the Christian conquest of the Muslim Emirate of Granada, completed in 1492, for which Valencia-born Pope Alexander VI gave them the title of the Catholic Monarchs. Ferdinand of Aragon was particularly concerned with expansion in France and Italy, as well as conquests in North Africa.

With the Ottoman Turks controlling the choke points of the overland trade from Asia and the Middle East, both Spain and Portugal sought alternative routes. The Kingdom of Portugal had an advantage over the Crown of Castile, having earlier retaken territory from the Muslims. Following Portugal&#x27;s earlier completion of the reconquest and its establishment of settled boundaries, it began to seek overseas expansion, first to the port of Ceuta (1415) and then by colonizing the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1418) and the Azores (1427–1452); it also began voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century. Its rival Castile laid claim to the Canary Islands (1402) and retook territory from the Moors in 1462. The Christian rivals Castile and Portugal came to formal agreements over the division of new territories in the Treaty of Alcaçovas (1479), as well as securing the crown of Castile for Isabella whose accession was challenged militarily by Portugal.

Following the voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and first major settlement in the New World in 1493, Portugal and Castile divided the world by the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), which gave Portugal Africa and Asia, and the Western Hemisphere to Spain. The voyage of Columbus, a Genoese mariner, obtained the support of Isabella of Castile, sailing west in 1492, seeking a route to the Indies. Columbus unexpectedly encountered the New World, populated by peoples he named &quot;Indians&quot;. Subsequent voyages and full-scale settlements of Spaniards followed, with gold beginning to flow into Castile&#x27;s coffers. Managing the expanding empire became an administrative issue. The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella began the professionalization of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (&quot;letrados&quot;) who were university graduates (&quot;licenciados&quot;), of Salamanca, Valladolid, Complutense and Alcalá. These lawyer-bureaucrats staffed the various councils of state, eventually including the Council of the Indies and Casa de Contratación, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the empire in the New World, as well as royal government in the Indies.

== Early expansion ==
=== Canary Islands ===

Portugal obtained several papal bulls that acknowledged Portuguese control over the discovered territories, but Castile also obtained from the Pope the safeguard of its rights to the Canary Islands with the bulls &quot;Romani Pontifex&quot; dated 6 November 1436 and &quot;Dominatur Dominus&quot; dated 30 April 1437. The conquest of the Canary Islands, inhabited by Guanche people, began in 1402 during the reign of Henry III of Castile, by Norman nobleman Jean de Béthencourt under a feudal agreement with the crown. The conquest was completed with the campaigns of the armies of the Crown of Castile between 1478 and 1496, when the islands of Gran Canaria (1478–1483), La Palma (1492–1493), and Tenerife (1494–1496) were subjugated. By 1504, more than 90 percent of the indigenous Canarians had been killed or enslaved.

=== Rivalry with Portugal ===
The Portuguese tried in vain to keep secret their discovery of the Gold Coast (1471) in the Gulf of Guinea, but the news quickly caused a huge gold rush. Chronicler Pulgar wrote that the fame of the treasures of Guinea &quot;spread around the ports of Andalusia in such way that everybody tried to go there&quot;. Worthless trinkets, Moorish textiles, and above all, shells from the Canary and Cape Verde islands were exchanged for gold, slaves, ivory and Guinea pepper.

The War of the Castilian Succession (1475–79) provided the Catholic Monarchs with the opportunity not only to attack the main source of the Portuguese power, but also to take possession of this lucrative commerce. The Crown officially organized this trade with Guinea: every caravel had to secure a government license and to pay a tax on one-fifth of their profits (a receiver of the customs of Guinea was established in Seville in 1475—the ancestor of the future and famous Casa de Contratación).
Castilian fleets fought in the Atlantic Ocean, temporarily occupying the Cape Verde islands (1476), conquering the city of Ceuta in the Tingitan Peninsula in 1476 (but retaken by the Portuguese), and even attacked the Azores islands, being defeated at Praia. The turning point of the war came in 1478, however, when a Castilian fleet sent by King Ferdinand to conquer Gran Canaria lost men and ships to the Portuguese who expelled the attack, and a large Castilian armada—full of gold—was entirely captured in the decisive Battle of Guinea.

The Treaty of Alcáçovas (4 September 1479), while assuring the Castilian throne to the Catholic Monarchs, reflected the Castilian naval and colonial defeat: &quot;War with Castile broke out waged savagely in the Gulf [of Guinea] until the Castilian fleet of thirty-five sail was defeated there in 1478. As a result of this naval victory, at the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479 Castile, while retaining her rights in the Canaries, recognized the Portuguese monopoly of fishing and navigation along the whole west African coast and Portugal&#x27;s rights over the Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde islands [plus the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez ].&quot; The treaty delimited the spheres of influence of the two countries, establishing the principle of the Mare clausum. It was confirmed in 1481 by the Pope Sixtus IV, in the papal bull &quot;Æterni regis&quot; (dated on 21 June 1481).

However, this experience would prove to be profitable for future Spanish overseas expansion, because as the Spaniards were excluded from the lands discovered or to be discovered from the Canaries southward—and consequently from the road to India around Africa—they sponsored the voyage of Columbus towards the west (1492) in search of Asia to trade in its spices, encountering the Americas instead. Thus, the limitations imposed by the Alcáçovas treaty were overcome and a new and more balanced division of the world would be reached in the Treaty of Tordesillas between both emerging maritime powers.

=== New World voyages and Treaty of Tordesillas ===


Seven months before the treaty of Alcaçovas, King John II of Aragon died, and his son Ferdinand II of Aragon, married to Isabella I of Castile, inherited the thrones of the Crown of Aragon. The two became known as the Catholic Monarchs, with their marriage a personal union that created a relationship between the Crown of Aragon and Castile, each with their own administrations, but ruled jointly by the two monarchs.

Ferdinand and Isabella defeated the last Muslim king out of Granada in 1492 after a ten-year war. The Catholic Monarchs then negotiated with Christopher Columbus, a Genoese sailor attempting to reach Cipangu (Japan) by sailing west. Castile was already engaged in a race of exploration with Portugal to reach the Far East by sea when Columbus made his bold proposal to Isabella. In the Capitulations of Santa Fe, dated on 17 April 1492, Christopher Columbus obtained from the Catholic Monarchs his appointment as viceroy and governor in the lands &quot;already discovered&quot; and that he might discover thenceforth; thereby, it was the first document to establish an administrative organization in the Indies. Columbus&#x27; discoveries began the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Spain&#x27;s claim to these lands was solidified by the &quot;Inter caetera&quot; papal bull dated 4 May 1493, and &quot;Dudum siquidem&quot; on 26 September 1493.

Since the Portuguese wanted to keep the line of demarcation of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the world was split into two dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims. These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in all of the New World from north to south (later with the exception of Brazil, which Portuguese commander Pedro Álvares Cabral encountered in 1500), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia. The Treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull &quot;Ea quae pro bono pacis&quot; on 24 January 1506.

The Treaty of Tordesillas and the treaty of Cintra (18 September 1509) established the limits of the Kingdom of Fez for Portugal, and the Castilian expansion was allowed outside these limits, beginning with the conquest of Melilla in 1497. Other European powers did not see the treaty between Castile and Portugal as binding on themselves. Francis I of France observed &quot;The sun shines for me as for others and I should very much like to see the clause in Adam&#x27;s will that excludes &quot;me&quot; from a share of the world.&quot;

=== First settlements in the Americas ===
Spanish settlement in the New World was based on a pattern of a large, permanent settlements with the entire complex of institutions and material life to replicate Castilian life in a different venue. Columbus&#x27;s second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that. On Hispaniola, the city of Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus&#x27;s brother Bartholomew Columbus and became a stone-built, permanent city. Non-Castilians, such as Catalans and Aragonese, were often prohibited from migrating to the New World.

Following the settlement of Hispaniola, Europeans began searching elsewhere to begin new settlements, since there was little apparent wealth and the numbers of indigenous were declining. Those from the less prosperous Hispaniola were eager to search for new success in a new settlement. From there Juan Ponce de León conquered Puerto Rico (1508) and Diego Velázquez took Cuba.

Columbus encountered the mainland in 1498, and the Catholic Monarchs learned of his discovery in May 1499. The first settlement on the mainland was Santa María la Antigua del Darién in Castilla de Oro (now Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia), settled by Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1510. In 1513, Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama, and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the West coast of the New World. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown.

=== Navarre and struggles for Italy ===

The Catholic Monarchs had developed a strategy of marriages for their children to isolate their rival, France. The Spanish princesses married the heirs of Portugal, England and the House of Habsburg. Following the same strategy, the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Aragonese house of the Kingdom of Naples against Charles VIII of France in the Italian Wars beginning in 1494. Following Spanish victories at the Battles of Cerignola and Garigliano in 1503, France recognized Ferdinand&#x27;s sovereignty over Naples through a treaty.

After the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, and her exclusion of Ferdinand from a further role in Castile, Ferdinand married Germaine de Foix in 1505, cementing an alliance with France. Had that couple had a surviving heir, probably the Crown of Aragon would have been split from Castile, which was inherited by Charles, Ferdinand and Isabella&#x27;s grandson. Ferdinand joined the League of Cambrai against Venice in 1508. In 1511, he became part of the Holy League against France, seeing a chance at taking both Milan—to which he held a dynastic claim—and Navarre. In 1516, France agreed to a truce that left Milan in its control and recognized Spanish control of Upper Navarre, which had effectively been a Spanish protectorate following a series of treaties in 1488, 1491, 1493, and 1495.

=== Campaigns in North Africa ===

With the Christian reconquest completed in the Iberian peninsula, Spain began trying to take territory in Muslim North Africa. It had conquered Melilla in 1497, and further expansionism policy in North Africa was developed during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by Cardinal Cisneros. Several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile between 1505 and 1510: Mers El Kébir, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, Oran, Bougie, Tripoli, and Peñón of Algiers. On the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña (1476) with support from the Canary Islands, and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the Treaty of Cintra (1509).

== The Spanish Habsburgs (1516–1700) ==

As a result of the marriage politics of the Catholic Monarchs (in Spanish, &quot;&quot;), their Habsburg grandson Charles inherited the Castilian empire in the Americas and the possessions of the Crown of Aragon in the Mediterranean (including all of south Italy), lands in Germany, the Low Countries, Franche-Comté, and Austria, starting the rule of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Austrian hereditary Habsburg domains were transferred to Ferdinand, the Emperor&#x27;s brother, whereas Spain and the remaining possessions were inherited by Charles&#x27;s son, Philip II of Spain, at the abdication of the former in 1556.

The Habsburgs pursued several goals:
* Undermining the power of France and containing it in its eastern borders
* Defending Europe against Islam, notably the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman–Habsburg wars
* Maintaining Habsburg hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire and defending the Roman Catholic Church against the Protestant Reformation
* Spreading (Catholic) Christianity to the unconverted indigenous of the New World and the Philippines
* Exploiting the resources of the Americas (gold, silver, sugar) and trading with Asia (porcelain, spices, silk)
* Excluding other European powers from the possessions it claimed in the New World

&quot;I learnt a proverb here&quot;, said a French traveler in 1603: &quot;Everything is dear in Spain except silver&quot;. The problems caused by inflation were discussed by scholars at the School of Salamanca and the &quot;arbitristas&quot;. The natural resource abundance provoked a decline in entrepreneurship as profits from resource extraction are less risky. The wealthy preferred to invest their fortunes in public debt (&quot;juros&quot;). The Habsburg dynasty spent the Castilian and American riches in wars across Europe on behalf of Habsburg interests, and declared moratoriums (bankruptcies) on their debt payments several times. These burdens led to a number of revolts across the Spanish Habsburg&#x27;s domains, including their Spanish kingdoms.

===Territorial expansion in the Americas===


During the Habsburg rule, the Spanish Empire significantly expanded its territories in the Americas, beginning with the conquest of the Aztec Empire; these conquests were achieved not by the Spanish army, but by small groups of adventurers—artisans, traders, gentry, and peasants—who operated independently under the crown&#x27;s encomienda system.

Defying the opposition of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the governor of Hispaniola, Hernán Cortés organized an expedition of 550 conquistadors and sailed for the coast of Mexico in March 1519. The Castilians defeated a 10,000-strong Chontal Mayan army at Potonchán on 24 March and emerged triumphant against a larger force of 40,000 Mayans three days later. On 2 September, 360 Castilians and 2,300 Totonac Indigenous allies defeated a 20,000-strong Tlaxcalan army. Three days later, a 50,000-strong Otomi-Tlaxcalan force was defeated by Spanish arquebusier and cannon fire, and a Castilian cavalry charge. Thousands of Tlaxcalans joined the invaders against their Aztec rulers. Cortés&#x27;s forces sacked the city of Cholula, massacring 6,000 inhabitants, and later entered Emperor Moctezuma II&#x27;s capital, Tenochtitlan, on 8 November. Velázquez sent a force led by Pánfilo de Narváez to punish the insubordinate Cortés for his unauthorized invasion of Mexico, but they were defeated at the Battle of Cempoala on 29 May 1520. Narváez was wounded and captured and 17 of his troops were killed; the rest joined Cortés. Meanwhile, Pedro de Alvarado triggered an Aztec uprising following the massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, during which 400 Aztec nobles and 2,000 onlookers were killed. The Castilians were driven out of the Aztec capital, suffering heavy losses and losing all of their gold and guns during La Noche Triste.

On 8 July 1520, at Otumba, the Castilians and their allies, without artillery or arquebusiers, repelled 100,000 Aztecs armed with obsidian-bladed clubs. In August, 500 Castilians and 40,000 Tlaxcalans conquered the hilltop town of Tepeaca, an Aztec ally. Most of the inhabitants were either branded on the face with the letter &quot;G&quot; (for guerra, the Spanish word for &quot;war&quot;) and enslaved by the Spanish, or sacrificed and eaten by the Tlaxcalans. Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in 1521 with a new invasion force and laid siege to the Aztec capital in May, which was suffering from a smallpox epidemic that killed thousands. The new emperor, Cuauhtémoc, defended Tenochtitlan with 100,000 warriors armed with slings, bows, and obsidian clubs. The first military encounter occurred after an advance along the causeway at Tlacopan by the armies of Alvarado and Cristóbal de Olid. While fighting on the causeway, the Spanish and their allies came under attack from both sides by Aztecs firing arrows from canoes. Thirteen Spanish brigantines sank 300 out of 400 enemy war canoes sent against them. The Aztecs tried to damage the Spanish vessels by hiding spears beneath the shallow water. The attackers breached the city and engaged in fighting with the Aztec defenders in the streets.

The Aztecs defeated the Spanish-Tlaxcalan forces at the Battle of Colhuacatonco on 30 June 1521. Following this Aztec victory, 53 Spanish prisoners were paraded to the tops of Tlatelolco&#x27;s highest pyramids and publicly sacrificed. In late July, the attackers resumed their assaults, resulting in the massacre of 800 Aztec civilians. By 29 July, the Spanish had reached Tlatelolco&#x27;s center, raising their new flag atop the city&#x27;s twin towers. Having exhausted their gunpowder, they attempted a catapult breach but failed. On 3 August, 12,000 more civilians were killed in another city section. Alvarado&#x27;s destruction of the aqueducts forced the Aztecs to drink from the lake, causing disease and thousands of deaths. Another major assault occurred on 12 August, during which many thousands of non-combatants were massacred in their shelters. The following day, the city fell and Cuauhtémoc was captured. At least 100,000 Aztecs died during the siege, while 100 Spaniards and up to 30,000 of their Indigenous allies were killed or died from disease.

The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of Spanish colonial rule in Mexico, leading to the establishment of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire by capturing its leader Atahualpa during a surprise attack in Cajamarca that resulted in the massacre of thousands of Incas. This conquest facilitated the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542, allowing Spain to exert control over territories in western South America, comprising present-day Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and parts of Chile and Argentina. In the subsequent years, Spanish explorers and conquistadors ventured into northern South America, where they established settlements in present-day Venezuela and Colombia.

===Reign of Philip II===

Philip II of Spain (r. 1556–98) oversaw the colonization of the Philippines, which began in 1565 with the arrival of Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi, making him ruler of one of the first true globe-spanning empires. His victory in the War of the Portuguese Succession led to the annexation of Portugal in 1580, effectively integrating its overseas empire—encompassing coastal Brazil and African and Indian coastal enclaves—into Spain&#x27;s domain. Philip II also reaffirmed Spanish control over the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Duchy of Milan through the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. Italy became the core of Spain&#x27;s power.

===Decline===

By the mid-17th century, Spain&#x27;s global empire burdened its economic, administrative, and military resources. Over the preceding century, Spanish troops had fought in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, suffering heavy casualties. Despite its vast holdings, Spain&#x27;s military lacked essential modernization and heavily relied on foreign suppliers. Nevertheless, Spain possessed abundant bullion from the Americas, which played a crucial role in both sustaining its military endeavors and meeting the needs of its civilian population. During this period, Spain displayed limited military interest in its overseas colonies. The &quot;Criollo&quot; elites (colonial-born Spaniards) and &quot;mestizo&quot; and &quot;mulatto&quot; militia (of mixed Indigenous-Spanish and African-Spanish descent) provided only minimal protection, often assisted by more influential allies with vested interests in maintaining the balance of power and safeguarding the Spanish Empire from falling into enemy hands.

== The Spanish Bourbons (1700–1808) ==
With the 1700 death of the childless Charles II of Spain, the crown of Spain was contested in the War of the Spanish Succession.
Under the Treaties of Utrecht (11 April 1713) ending the war, the French prince of the House of Bourbon, Philippe of Anjou, grandchild of Louis XIV of France, became King Philip V of Spain. He retained the Spanish overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines. The settlement gave spoils to those who had backed a Habsburg for the Spanish monarchy, ceding European territory of the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and parts of Milan to the Duchy of Savoy, and Gibraltar and Menorca to the Kingdom of Great Britain. The treaty also granted British merchants the exclusive right to sell slaves in Spanish America for thirty years, the &quot;asiento de negros&quot;, as well as licensed voyages to ports in Spanish colonial dominions and openings.

Spain&#x27;s economic and demographic recovery had begun slowly in the last decades of the Habsburg reign, as was evident from the growth of its trading convoys and the much more rapid growth of illicit trade during the period. (This growth was slower than the growth of illicit trade by northern rivals in the empire&#x27;s markets.) However, this recovery was not then translated into institutional improvement, rather the &quot;proximate solutions to permanent problems.&quot; This legacy of neglect was reflected in the early years of Bourbon rule in which the military was ill-advisedly pitched into battle in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20). Spain was defeated in Italy by an alliance of Britain, France, Savoy, and Austria. Following the war, the new Bourbon monarchy took a much more cautious approach to international relations, relying on a family alliance with Bourbon France, and continuing to follow a program of institutional renewal.

The crown program to enact reforms that promoted administrative control and efficiency in the metropole to the detriment of interests in the colonies, undermined creole elites&#x27; loyalty to the crown. When French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Iberian peninsula in 1808, Napoleon ousted the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, placing his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. There was a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule in Spanish America, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826).

=== Bourbon reforms ===

The Spanish Bourbons&#x27; broadest intentions were to reorganize the institutions of empire to better administer it for the benefit of Spain and the crown. It sought to increase revenues and to assert greater crown control, including over the Catholic Church. Centralization of power (beginning with the Nueva Planta decrees against the realms of the Crown of Aragon) was to be for the benefit of the crown and the metropole and for the defense of its empire against foreign incursions. From the viewpoint of Spain, the structures of colonial rule under the Habsburgs were no longer functioning to the benefit of Spain, with much wealth being retained in Spanish America and going to other European powers. The presence of other European powers in the Caribbean, with the English in Barbados (1627), St Kitts (1623–25), and Jamaica (1655); the Dutch in Curaçao, and the French in Saint Domingue (Haiti) (1697), Martinique, and Guadeloupe had broken the integrity of the closed Spanish mercantile system and established thriving sugar colonies.

At the beginning of his reign, the first Spanish Bourbon, King Philip V, reorganized the government to strengthen the executive power of the monarch as was done in France, in place of the deliberative, Polysynodial System of Councils.

Philip&#x27;s government set up a ministry of the Navy and the Indies (1714) and established commercial companies, the Honduras Company (1714), a Caracas company; the Guipuzcoana Company (1728), and the most successful ones, the Havana Company (1740) and the Barcelona Trading Company (1755).

In 1717–18, the structures for governing the Indies, the &#x27; and the &#x27;, which governed investments in the cumbersome Spanish treasure fleets, were transferred from Seville to Cádiz, where foreign merchant houses had easier access to the Indies trade. Cádiz became the one port for all Indies trading (see flota system). Individual sailings at regular intervals were slow to displace the traditional armed convoys, but by the 1760s there were regular ships plying the Atlantic from Cádiz to Havana and Puerto Rico, and at longer intervals to the , where an additional viceroyalty was created in 1776. The contraband trade that was the lifeblood of the Habsburg empire declined in proportion to registered shipping (a shipping registry having been established in 1735).

Two upheavals registered unease within Spanish America and at the same time demonstrated the renewed resiliency of the reformed system: the Tupac Amaru uprising in Peru in 1780 and the rebellion of the &quot;comuneros&quot; of New Granada, both in part reactions to tighter, more efficient control.

=== 18th-century economic conditions ===

The 18th century was a century of prosperity for the overseas Spanish Empire as trade within grew steadily, particularly in the second half of the century, under the Bourbon reforms. Spain&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias against a British expedition in the Caribbean port of Cartagena de Indias helped Spain secure its dominance of its possessions in the Americas until the 19th century. But different regions fared differently under Bourbon rule, and even while New Spain was particularly prosperous, it was also marked by steep wealth inequality. Silver production boomed in New Spain during the 18th century, with output more than tripling between the start of the century and the 1750s. The economy and the population both grew, both centered around Mexico City. But while mine owners and the crown benefited from the flourishing silver economy, most of the population in the rural Bajío faced rising land prices, falling wages. Eviction of many from their lands resulted.

With a Bourbon monarchy came a repertory of Bourbon mercantilist ideas based on a centralized state, put into effect in the Americas slowly at first but with increasing momentum during the century. Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63), reflecting in part the success of the Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control. With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years&#x27; War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s.

The end of Cádiz&#x27;s monopoly of trade with the American colonies brought about very important changes, particularly a rebirth of Spanish manufactures. Most notable of those changes were both the beginning of Catalan participation in the Spanish slave trade, and the rapidly growing textile industry of Catalonia which by the mid-1780s saw the first signs of industrialization. This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in Barcelona. This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood in stark contrast to the relative backwardness of most of the country. Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as Cuba, with its tobacco plantations, and a renewed growth of precious metals mining in South America.

Agricultural productivity remained low despite efforts to introduce new techniques to what was for the most part an uninterested, exploited peasant and laboring groups. Governments were inconsistent in their policies. Though there were substantial improvements by the late 18th century, Spain was still an economic backwater. Under the mercantile trading arrangements it had difficulty in providing the goods being demanded by the strongly growing markets of its empire, and providing adequate outlets for the return trade.

From an opposing point of view according to the &quot;backwardness&quot; mentioned above the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt traveled extensively throughout the Spanish Americas, exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific point of view between 1799 and 1804. In his work &quot;Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico&quot; he says that the Amerindians of New Spain were wealthier than any Russian or German peasant in Europe. According to Humboldt, despite the fact that Indian farmers were poor, under Spanish rule they were free and slavery was non-existent, their conditions were much better than any other peasant or farmer in northern Europe.

Humboldt also published a comparative analysis of bread and meat consumption in New Spain compared to other cities in Europe such as Paris. Mexico City consumed 189 pounds of meat per person per year, in comparison to 163 pounds consumed by the inhabitants of Paris, the Mexicans also consumed almost the same amount of bread as any European city, with 363 kilograms of bread per person per year in comparison to the 377 kilograms consumed in Paris. Caracas consumed seven times more meat per person than in Paris. Von Humboldt also said that the average income in that period was four times the European income and also that the cities of New Spain were richer than many European cities.

=== Contesting with other empires ===

Bourbon institutional reforms under Philip V bore fruit militarily when Spanish forces easily retook Naples and Sicily from the Austrians at the Battle of Bitonto in 1734 during the War of the Polish Succession, and during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (1739–42) thwarted British efforts to capture the strategic cities of Cartagena de Indias, Santiago de Cuba and St. Augustine, although Spain&#x27;s invasion of Georgia also ended in failure. The British suffered approximately 20,000 killed or wounded during the war while the Spanish suffered roughly 10,000.

In 1742, the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear merged with the larger War of the Austrian Succession, and King George&#x27;s War in North America. The British, also occupied with France, were unable to capture Spanish treasure convoys, while Spanish privateers targeted British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes and attacked the coast of North Carolina, levying tribute on the inhabitants. In Europe, Spain had been trying to divest Maria Theresa of the Duchy of Milan in northern Italy since 1741, but faced the opposition of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, and warfare in northern Italy remained indecisive throughout the period up to 1746. By the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle, Spain gained (indirectly) Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla in northern Italy.

Spain was defeated during the invasion of Portugal and lost both Havana and Manila to British forces towards the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63). In response, the Bourbon Reforms allowed for Spain to recover from these losses and Spanish forces recaptured Menorca, West Florida (present-day Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida) and temporarily occupied the Bahamas during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). However, a Franco-Spanish attempt to capture Gibraltar ended in failure.

During most of the 18th century, Spanish privateers, particularly from Santo Domingo, were the scourge of the Antilles, with Dutch, British, French and Danish vessels as their prizes.

====Rival empires in the Pacific Northwest====

Spain claimed all of North America in the Age of Discovery, but claims were not translated into occupation until a major resource was discovered and Spanish settlement and crown rule put in place. The French had established an empire in northern North America and took some islands in the Caribbean. The English established colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America and in northern North America and some Caribbean islands as well. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown realized that its territorial claims needed to be defended, particularly in the wake of its visible weakness during the Seven Years&#x27; War when Britain captured the important Spanish ports of Havana and Manila. Another important factor was that the Russian empire had expanded into North America from the mid-eighteenth century, with fur trading settlements in what is now Alaska and forts as far south as Fort Ross, California. Great Britain was also expanding into areas that Spain claimed as its territory on the Pacific coast. Taking steps to shore up its fragile claims to California, Spain began planning California missions in 1769. Spain also began a series of voyages to the Pacific Northwest, where Russia and Great Britain were encroaching on claimed territory. The Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest, with Alessandro Malaspina and others sailing for Spain, came too late for Spain to assert its sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest.

The Nootka Crisis (1789–1791) nearly brought Spain and Britain to war. It was a dispute over claims in the Pacific Northwest, where neither nation had established permanent settlements. The crisis could have led to war, but without French support Spain capitulated to British terms and negotiations took place with the Nootka Convention. Spain and Great Britain agreed to not establish settlements and allowed free access to Nootka Sound on the west coast of what is now Vancouver Island. Nevertheless, the outcome of the crisis was a humiliation for Spain and a triumph for Britain, as Spain had practically renounced all sovereignty on the North Pacific coast.

In 1806, Baron Nikolai Rezanov attempted to negotiate a treaty between the Russian-American Company and the Viceroyalty of New Spain, but his unexpected death in 1807 ended any treaty hopes. Spain gave up its claims in the West of North America in the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, ceding its rights there to the United States, allowing the U.S. to purchase Florida, and establishing a boundary between New Spain and the U.S. When the negotiations between the two nations were taking place, Spain&#x27;s resources were stretched due to the Spanish American wars of independence. Much of the present-day American Southwest later became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain; after the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded to the U.S. present-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and parts of Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming for $15 million.

====Loss of Spanish Louisiana====
The growth of trade and wealth in the colonies caused increasing political tensions as frustration grew with the improving but still restrictive trade with Spain. Alessandro Malaspina&#x27;s recommendation to turn the empire into a looser confederation to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the élites of the empire&#x27;s periphery and center was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control. All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe at the turn of the 19th century with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

The first major territory Spain was to lose in the 19th century was the vast Louisiana Territory, which had few European settlers. It stretched north to Canada and was ceded by France in 1763 under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau. The French, under Napoleon, took back possession as part of the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800 and sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Napoleon&#x27;s sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 caused border disputes between the United States and Spain that, with rebellions in West Florida (1810) and in the remainder of Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi River, led to their eventual cession to the United States.

== End of the global empire (1808–1899) ==
In 1808, Napoleon maneuvered to place the Spanish king under his control, effectively seizing power without facing resistance. This action sparked resistance from the Spanish people, leading to the Peninsular War. This conflict created a power vacuum lasting nearly a decade, followed by civil wars, transitions to a republic, and eventually the establishment of a liberal democracy. Spain lost all the colonial possessions in the first third of the century, except for Cuba, Puerto Rico and, isolated on the far side of the globe, the Philippines, Guam and nearby Pacific islands, as well as Spanish Sahara, parts of Morocco, and Spanish Guinea.

The wars of independence in Spanish America were triggered by another failed British attempt to seize Spanish American territory, this time in the Río de la Plata estuary in 1806. The viceroy retreated hastily to the hills when defeated by a small British force. However, when the &quot;Criollos&quot;&#x27; militias and colonial army decisively defeated the now reinforced British force in 1807, they promptly embarked on the path to securing their own independence, igniting independence movements across the continent. A long period of wars followed in the Americas, and the lack of Spanish troops in the colonies led to war between patriotic rebels and local Royalists. In South America this period of wars led to the independence of Argentina (1810), Gran Colombia (1810), Chile (1810), Paraguay (1811) and Uruguay (1815, but subsequently ruled by Brazil until 1828). José de San Martín campaigned for independence in Chile (1818) and in Peru (1821). Further north, Simón Bolívar led forces that won independence between 1811 and 1826 for the area that became Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia (then Upper Peru). Panama declared independence in 1821 and merged with the Republic of Gran Colombia (from 1821 to 1903). Mexico gained independence in 1821 after more than a decade of struggle, following the War of Independence that began in 1810. Mexico&#x27;s independence led to the independence of Central American provinces—Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica—by 1823.

Estimates of the number killed in the Mexican War of Independence range from 250,000 to 500,000 individuals, and a large number of people also fled Mexico. Throughout the eleven years of fighting, Spain sent only 9,685 troops to Mexico. Over the course of nine years, 20,000 Spanish soldiers were sent to reinforce the Spanish American Royalists in northern South America. However, disease and combat claimed the lives of 16,000–17,000 of these soldiers. Even within the Viceroyalty of Peru, the center of Spanish power in South America, the majority of the Royalist army consisted of Americans. After the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824, the captured Royalist army consisted of 1,512 Spanish Americans and only 751 Spaniards. Only 6,000 troops were sent to Peru directly from Spain, although others arrived from neighboring theaters of operation. In contrast, Spain demonstrated a greater military commitment in the Caribbean, sending 30,000 troops to Santo Domingo in 1861 and maintaining a force of 100,000 soldiers in Cuba in 1876.

Cuba did not experience its first serious independence movement until the late 1860s. The First War for Independence was fought from 1868 to 1878, resulting in between 100,000 and 150,000 Cuban deaths. The Second War for Independence occurred between 1895 and 1898, during which approximately 300,000 Cubans died, with around 200,000 civilian deaths attributed to disease and famine caused by Spanish concentration camps. Two contemporary sources estimated that by December 1895, the rebel army had lost between 29,850 and 42,800 men, and many Cuban generals were killed in combat.

American sympathy for Cuban revolutionaries grew due to reports of atrocities and the sinking of the USS Maine. On 25 April 1898, the U.S. declared war on Spain, leading to victories in both Cuba and the Philippines. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris (1898), which ceded Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the U.S. and sold the Philippines for US$20 million. The following year, Spain then sold its remaining Pacific Ocean possessions to Germany in the German–Spanish Treaty, retaining only its African territories. On 2 June 1899, the second expeditionary battalion &quot;Cazadores&quot; of Philippines, the last Spanish garrison in the Philippines, which had been besieged in Baler, Aurora at war&#x27;s end, was pulled out, effectively ending around 300 years of Spanish hegemony in the archipelago.

== Territories in Africa (1885–1976) ==

By the end of the 17th century, only Melilla, Alhucemas, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (which had been taken again in 1564), and Ceuta (part of the Portuguese Empire since 1415, chose to retain their links to Spain once the Iberian Union ended. The formal allegiance of Ceuta to Spain was recognized by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668), and Oran and Mers El Kébir remained Spanish territories in Africa. The latter cities were lost in 1708, reconquered in 1732 and sold by Charles IV in 1792.

In 1778, Fernando Pó (now Bioko), adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the mainland between the Niger and Ogooué rivers were ceded to Spain by the Portuguese in exchange for territory in South America (Treaty of El Pardo). In the 19th century, some Spanish explorers and missionaries would cross this zone, among them Manuel Iradier. In 1848, Spanish troops occupied the uninhabited Chafarinas Islands, anticipating a French move on the rocks located off the North-African coast.

In 1860, after the Tetuan War, Morocco paid Spain 100 million pesetas as war reparations and ceded Sidi Ifni to Spain as a part of the Treaty of Tangiers, on the basis of the old outpost of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña, thought to be Sidi Ifni. The following decades of Franco-Spanish collaboration resulted in the establishment and extension of Spanish protectorates south of the city, and Spanish influence obtained international recognition in the Berlin Conference of 1884: Spain administered Sidi Ifni and Spanish Sahara jointly. Spain claimed a protectorate over the coast of Guinea from Cape Bojador to Cap Blanc, too, and even try to press a claim over the Adrar and Tiris regions in Mauritania. Río Muni became a protectorate in 1885 and a colony in 1900. Conflicting claims to the Guinea mainland were settled in 1900 by the Treaty of Paris, because of which Spain was left with a mere 26,000 km2 out of the 300,000 stretching east to the Ubangi River which they initially claimed. 

Following a brief war in 1893, Morocco paid war reparations of 20 million pesetas and Spain expanded its influence south from Melilla. In 1912, Morocco was divided between the French and Spanish. The Riffians rebelled, led by Abdelkrim, a former officer for the Spanish administration. The Battle of Annual (1921) during the Rif War was a major military defeat suffered by the Spanish army against Moroccan insurgents. A leading Spanish politician emphatically declared: &quot;We are at the most acute period of Spanish decadence&quot;. After the disaster of Annual, Spain began using German chemical weapons against the Moroccans. In September 1925, the Alhucemas landing by the Spanish Army and Navy with a small collaboration of an allied French contingent put an end to the Rif War. It is considered the first successful amphibious landing in history supported by seaborne air power and tanks.

In 1923, Tangier was declared an international city under French, Spanish, British, and later Italian joint administration. In 1926, Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of Spanish Guinea, a status that would last until 1959. In 1931, following the fall of the monarchy, the African colonies became part of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1934, during the government of Prime Minister Alejandro Lerroux, Spanish troops led by General Osvaldo Capaz landed in Sidi Ifni and carried out the occupation of the territory, ceded &quot;de jure&quot; by Morocco in 1860. Two years later, Francisco Franco, a general of the Army of Africa, rebelled against the republican government and started the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). During the Second World War the Vichy French presence in Tangier was overcome by that of Francoist Spain.

Spain lacked the wealth and the interest to develop an extensive economic infrastructure in its African colonies during the first half of the 20th century. However, through a paternalistic system, particularly on Bioko Island, Spain developed large cocoa plantations for which thousands of Nigerian workers were imported as laborers.

In 1956, when French Morocco became independent, Spain surrendered Spanish Morocco to the new nation, but retained control of Sidi Ifni, the Tarfaya region and Spanish Sahara. Moroccan Sultan (later King) Mohammed V was interested in these territories and unsuccessfully invaded Spanish Sahara in 1957, in the Ifni War, or in Spain, the Forgotten War (&quot;). In 1958, Spain ceded Tarfaya to Mohammed V and joined the previously separate districts of Saguia el-Hamra (in the north) and Río de Oro (in the south) to form the province of Spanish Sahara.

In 1959, the Spanish territory on the Gulf of Guinea was established with a status similar to the provinces of metropolitan Spain. As the Spanish Equatorial Region, it was ruled by a governor general exercising military and civilian powers. The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the Spanish parliament. Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory&#x27;s two provinces. The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea. In March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the United Nations, Spain announced that it would grant the country independence.

In 1969, under international pressure, Spain returned Sidi Ifni to Morocco. Spanish control of Spanish Sahara endured until the 1975 Green March prompted a withdrawal, under Moroccan military pressure. The future of this former Spanish colony remains uncertain.

The Canary Islands and Spanish cities in the African mainland are considered an equal part of Spain and the European Union but have a different tax system.

Morocco still claims Ceuta, Melilla, and &quot; even though they are internationally recognized as administrative divisions of Spain. Isla Perejil was occupied on 11 July 2002 by Moroccan Gendarmerie and troops, who were evicted by Spanish naval forces in a bloodless operation.

== Imperial economic policy ==

The Spanish Empire benefited from favorable factor endowments from its overseas possessions with their large, exploitable indigenous populations and rich mining areas. Thus the crown attempted to create and maintain a classic closed mercantile system, warding off competitors and keeping wealth within the empire, specifically within the Crown of Castile. While in theory the Habsburgs were committed to maintaining a state monopoly, the reality was that the empire was a porous economic realm with widespread smuggling. In the 16th and 17th centuries under the Habsburgs, Spain&#x27;s economic conditions gradually declined, especially in regards to the industrial development of its French, Dutch, and English rivals. Many of the goods being exported to the Empire originated from manufacturers in northwest Europe rather than in Spain. Illicit commercial activities became a part of the Empire&#x27;s administrative structure. Supported by large flows of silver from the Americas, trade prohibited by Spanish mercantilist restrictions flourished as it provided a source of income to both crown officials and private merchants. The local administrative structure in Buenos Aires, for example, was established through its oversight of both legal and illegal commerce. The crown&#x27;s pursuit of wars to maintain and expand territory, defend the Catholic faith, stamp out Protestantism, and beat back the Ottoman Turkish strength outstripped its ability to pay for it all, despite the huge production of silver in Peru and New Spain. Most of that flow paid mercenary soldiers in the European religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and paid foreign merchants for the consumer goods manufactured in northern Europe. Paradoxically, the wealth of the Indies impoverished Spain and enriched northern Europe, a course the Bourbon monarchs would later attempt to reverse in the eighteenth century.

This was well acknowledged in Spain, with writers on political economy, the &quot;arbitristas,&quot; sending the crown lengthy analyses in the form of &quot;memorials, of the perceived problems and with proposed solutions.&quot; According to these thinkers, &quot;Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked. The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated. In this way alone could Castile&#x27;s productivity increase, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end.&quot;
Since the early days of the Caribbean and conquest era, the crown attempted to control trade between Spain and the Indies with restrictive policies enforced by the House of Trade (est. 1503) in Seville. Shipping was through particular ports in Castile: Seville, and subsequently Cádiz, Spanish America: Veracruz, Acapulco, Havana, Cartagena de Indias, and Callao/Lima, and the Philippines: Manila. There were very few Spanish settlers in the Indies in the very early period and Spain could supply sufficient goods to them. But as the Aztec and Inca empires were conquered in the early sixteenth century, and large deposits of silver found in both Mexico and Peru, Spanish immigration increased and the demand for goods rose far beyond Spain&#x27;s ability to supply it. Since Spain had little capital to invest in the expanding trade and no significant commercial group, bankers and commercial houses in Genoa, Germany, the Netherlands, France, and England supplied both investment capital and goods in a supposedly closed system. Even in the sixteenth century, Spain recognized that the idealized closed system did not function in reality. Since the crown did not alter its restrictive structure or advocate fiscal prudence, despite the pleas of the &quot;arbitristas&quot;, the Indies trade remained nominally in the hands of Spain, but in fact enriched the other European countries.
The crown established the system of treasure fleets () to protect the conveyance of silver to Seville (later Cádiz). Produced in other European countries, Sevillian merchants conveyed consumer goods that were registered and taxed by the House of Trade, and then sent to the Indies. Other European commercial interests came to dominate supply, with Spanish merchant houses and their guilds (&quot;consulados&quot;) in both Spain and the Indies acting as mere middlemen, reaping a slice of the profits. However, those profits did not promote a manufacturing sector in Spain&#x27;s economic development, and its economy continued to be based in agriculture. The wealth of the Indies led to prosperity in northern Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and England, which were both Protestant. As Spain&#x27;s power weakened in the seventeenth century, England, the Netherlands, and the French took advantage overseas by seizing islands in the Caribbean, which became bases for a burgeoning contraband trade in Spanish America. Crown officials, who were supposed to suppress contraband trade, were quite often in cahoots with the foreigners, since it was a source of personal enrichment. In Spain, the crown itself participated in collusion with foreign merchant houses, since they paid fines &quot;meant to establish a compensation to the state for losses through fraud.&quot; It became a calculated risk for merchant houses doing business, and for the crown it gained income that would have otherwise been lost. Foreign merchants were part of the supposed monopoly system of trade. The transfer of the House of Trade from Seville to Cádiz meant foreign merchant houses had even easier access to the Spanish trade.

The Spanish imperial economy&#x27;s major global impact was silver mining. The mines in Peru and Mexico were in the hands of a few elite mining entrepreneurs with access to capital and a stomach for the risk that mining entailed. They operated under a system of royal licensing, since the crown held the rights to subsoil wealth. Mining entrepreneurs assumed all the risk of the enterprise, while the crown gained a 20% slice of the profits, the royal fifth (&quot;quinto real&quot;). Further adding to the crown&#x27;s revenues in mining was that it held a monopoly on the mercury supply, used for separating pure silver from silver ore in the patio process. The crown kept the price high, thereby depressing the volume of silver production. Protecting its flow from Mexico and Peru as it transited to ports for shipment to Spain resulted early on in a convoy system (the flota) sailing twice a year. Its success can be judged by the fact that the silver fleet was captured only once, in 1628 by Dutch privateer Piet Hein. That loss resulted in the bankruptcy of the Spanish crown and an extended period of economic depression in Spain.

One practice the Spanish used to gather workers for the mines was called &quot;repartimiento&quot;. This was a rotational forced labor system where indigenous pueblos were obligated to send laborers to work in Spanish mines and plantations for a set number of days out of the year. Repartimiento was not implemented to replace slave labor, but instead existed alongside free wage labor, slavery, and indentured labor. It was, however, a way for the Spanish to procure cheap labor, thus boosting the mining-driven economy.

The men who worked as repartimiento laborers were not always resistant to the practice. Some were drawn to the labor as a way to supplement the wages they earned cultivating fields so as to support their families and, of course, pay tributes. At first, a Spaniard could get repartimiento laborers to work for them with permission from a crown official, such as a viceroy, only on the basis that this labor was absolutely necessary to provide the country with important resources. This condition became laxer as the years went on, and various enterprises had repartimiento laborers who would work in dangerous conditions for long hours and low wages.

During the Bourbon era, economic reforms sought to reverse the pattern that left Spain impoverished with no manufacturing sector and its colonies&#x27; need for manufactured goods supplied by other nations. It attempted to establish a closed trading system, but it was hampered by the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession, with a victory for the Bourbon French candidate for the throne, had a provision for British merchants to legally sell slaves with a license (&quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;) slaves to Spanish America. The provision undermined the possibility of a revamped Spanish monopoly system. The merchants also used the opportunity to engage in contraband trade of their manufactured goods. Crown policy sought to make legal trade more appealing than contraband by instituting free commerce (&quot;comercio libre&quot;) in 1778, whereby Spanish American ports could trade with each other, and they could trade with any port in Spain. It was aimed at revamping a closed Spanish system and outflanking the increasingly powerful British. Silver production revived in the eighteenth century, with production far surpassing the earlier output. The crown reduced the taxes on mercury, meaning that a greater volume of pure silver could be refined. Silver mining absorbed most of the available capital in Mexico and Peru, and the crown emphasized the production of precious metals, which were sent to Spain. There was some economic development in the Indies to supply food, but a diversified economy did not emerge. The economic reforms of the Bourbon era both shaped and were themselves impacted by geopolitical developments in Europe. The Bourbon Reforms arose out of the War of the Spanish Succession. In turn, the crown&#x27;s attempt to tighten its control over its colonial markets in the Americas led to further conflict with other European powers who were vying for access to them. After a sparking a series of skirmishes throughout the 1700s over its stricter policies, Spain&#x27;s reformed trade system led to war with Britain in 1796. In the Americas, meanwhile, economic policies enacted under the Bourbons had different impacts in different regions. On one hand, silver production in New Spain greatly increased and led to economic growth. But much of the profits of the revitalized mining sector went to mining elites and state officials, while in rural areas of New Spain conditions for rural workers deteriorated, contributing to social unrest that would impact subsequent revolts.

==Scientific investigations and expeditions==

The Spanish American Enlightenment produced a huge body of information on Spain&#x27;s overseas empire via scientific expeditions. The most famous traveler in Spanish America was Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt, whose travel writings, especially &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; and scientific observations remain important sources for the history of Spanish America. Humboldt&#x27;s expedition was authorized by the crown, but was self-funded from his personal fortune. The Bourbon crown promoted state-funded scientific work prior to the famous Humboldt expedition. Eighteenth-century clerics contributed to the expansion of scientific knowledge. These include José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, and José Celestino Mutis.

The Spanish crown funded a number of important scientific expeditions: Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru (1777–78); Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada (1783–1816); the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain (1787–1803); which scholars are now examining afresh. Although the crown funded a number of Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest to bolster claims to territory, lengthy transatlantic and transpacific Malaspina-Bustamante Expedition was for scientific purposes. The crown also funded the Balmis Expedition in 1804 to vaccinate colonial populations against smallpox.

Much of the research done in the eighteenth century was never published or otherwise disseminated, in part due to budgetary constraints on the crown. Starting in the late twentieth century, research on the history of science in Spain and the Spanish empire has blossomed, with primary sources being published in scholarly editions or reissued, as well the publication of a considerable number of important scholarly studies.

==Legacy==
Although the Spanish Empire declined from its apogee in the late seventeenth century, it remained a wonder for other Europeans for its sheer geographical span. Writing in 1738, English author Samuel Johnson questioned, &quot;Has heaven reserved, in pity to the poor,/No pathless waste or undiscovered shore,/No secret island in the boundless main,/No peaceful desert yet unclaimed by Spain?&quot;

The Spanish Empire left a huge linguistic, religious, political, cultural, and urban architectural legacy in the Western Hemisphere. With over 470 million native speakers today, Spanish is the second most spoken native language in the world, as result of the introduction of the language of Castile—Castilian, &quot;Castellano&quot; —from Iberia to Spanish America, later expanded by the governments of successor independent republics. In the Philippines, the Spanish–American War (1898) brought the islands under U.S. jurisdiction, with English being imposed in schools and Spanish becoming a secondary official language. Many indigenous languages throughout the empire were often lost either as indigenous populations were decimated by war and disease, or as indigenous people mixed with colonists, and the Spanish language was taught and spread over time.

An important cultural legacy of the Spanish empire overseas is Roman Catholicism, which remains the main religious faith in Spanish America and the Philippines. Christian evangelization of indigenous peoples was a key responsibility of the crown and a justification for its imperial expansion. Although indigenous were considered neophytes and insufficiently mature in their faith for indigenous men to be ordained to the priesthood, the indigenous were part of the Catholic community of faith. Catholic orthodoxy was enforced by the Inquisition, particularly targeting crypto-Jews and Protestants. Not until after their independence in the nineteenth century did Spanish American republics allow religious toleration of other faiths. Observances of Catholic holidays often have strong regional expressions and remain important in many parts of Spanish America. Observances include Day of the Dead, Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, Epiphany, and national saints&#x27; days, such as the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico.

Politically, the colonial era has strongly influenced modern Spanish America. The territorial divisions of the empire in Spanish America became the basis for boundaries between new republics after independence and for state divisions within countries. It is often argued that the rise of caudillismo during and after Latin American independence movements created a legacy of authoritarianism in the region. There was no significant development of representative institutions during the colonial era, and the executive power was often made stronger than the legislative power during the national period as a result.

This has led to a popular misconception that the colonial legacy has caused the region to have an extremely oppressed proletariat. Revolts and riots are often seen as evidence of this supposed extreme oppression. However, the culture of revolting against an unpopular government is not simply a confirmation of widespread authoritarianism. The colonial legacy did leave a political culture of revolt, but not always as a desperate last act. The civil unrest of the region is seen by some as a form of political involvement. While the political context of the political revolutions in Spanish America is understood to be one in which liberal elites competed to form new national political structures, so too were those elites responding to mass lower-class political mobilization and participation.

Hundreds of towns and cities in the Americas were founded during the Spanish rule, with the colonial centers and buildings of many of them now designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites attracting tourists. The tangible heritage includes universities, forts, cities, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, missions, government buildings and colonial residences, many of which still stand today. A number of present-day roads, canals, ports or bridges sit where Spanish engineers built them centuries ago. The oldest universities in the Americas were founded by Spanish scholars and Catholic missionaries. The Spanish Empire also left a vast cultural and linguistic legacy. The cultural legacy is also present in the music, cuisine, and fashion, some of which have been granted the status of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

The long colonial period in Spanish America resulted in a mixing of indigenous peoples, Europeans, and Africans that were classified by race and hierarchically ranked, which created a markedly different society than the European colonies of North America. In concert with the Portuguese, the Spanish Empire laid the foundations of a truly global trade by opening up the great trans-oceanic trade routes and the exploration of unknown territories and oceans for the western knowledge. The Spanish dollar became the world&#x27;s first global currency.

One of the features of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New in the Columbian Exchange. Some cultivars that were introduced to the Americas included grapes, wheat, barley, apples and citrous fruits; animals that were introduced to the New World were horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens. The Old World received from the Americas such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave and others. The result of these exchanges was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in the Americas, but also that of Europe and Asia. Diseases brought by Europeans and Africans, such as smallpox, measles, typhus, and others, devastated almost all indigenous populations that had no immunity.

There were also cultural influences, which can be seen in everything from architecture to food, music, art and law, from southern Argentina and Chile to the United States of America together with the Philippines. The complex origins and contacts of different peoples resulted in cultural influences coming together in the varied forms evident today in the former colonial areas.

<text>The Mockingboard (a pun on &quot;Mockingbird&quot;) is a sound card built by Sweet Micro Systems for the Apple II microcomputers. It improves on the Apple II&#x27;s limited sound capabilities, as did other Apple II sound cards.

In 1981, Sweet Micro Systems began designing products not only for creating music, but speech and general sound effects as well, culminating in the release of the Mockingboard in 1983. The Sound II was introduced at , and the Sound/Speech I at . The Mockingboard&#x27;s hardware allowed programmers to create complex, high-quality sound without need for constant CPU attention. The Mockingboard could be connected to the Apple&#x27;s built-in speaker or to external speakers. However, as the quality of the built-in speaker was not high, the instruction manual recommended obtaining external speakers.

The Mockingboard was available in various models for either the slot-based Apple II / Apple II Plus / Apple IIe systems or in one special model for the Apple IIc. Sound was generated through one or more AY-3-8910 or compatible sound chips, with one chip offering three square-wave synthesis channels. The boards could also be equipped with an optional speech chip (a Votrax SC-01 or compatible chips such as the Arctic-02, SSI 263P, SSI 263AP or 78A263A-P).

Some software products supported more than one Mockingboard. &quot;Ultima V&quot; supported two boards, for a total of 12 voices, of which it used eight. Most other programs supported at most one board with six voices.

Applied Engineering&#x27;s Phasor was compatible with the Mockingboard. It had 4 sound chips and thus provided 12 audio channels. Few programs supported using it for more than six voices, however.

An IBM PC-compatible version was developed, but was only distributed with Bank Street Music Writer.

==Models==
===Early models===

* Sound I: one AY-3-8910 chip for three audio channels, clocked at 1 MHz
* Speech I: one SC-01 chip
* Sound II: two AY-3-8910 chips for six audio channels
* Sound/Speech I: one AY-3-8910 and one SC-01

===Later models===
* Mockingboard A: two AY-3-8913 chips for six audio channels and two open sockets for SSI-263 speech chips
* Mockingboard B: SSI-263 speech chip upgrade for Mockingboard A
* Mockingboard C: two AY-3-8913 and one SSI-263 (&quot;A+B=C&quot;, essentially a Mockingboard A with the Mockingboard B upgrade pre-installed, only one speech chip allowed)
* Mockingboard D: for Apple IIc only, not software compatible with the other Mockingboards, two AY-3-8913 and one SSI-263
* Mockingboard M: Bundled with Mindscape&#x27;s Bank Street Music Writer, with two AY-3-8913 chips and an open socket for one speech chip. This model included a headphone jack and a jumper to permit sound to be played through the Apple&#x27;s built-in speaker.

===Other compatible cards===
*Echo+: emulates 1 x Mockingboard card, two AY-3-8913 for six channels, speech is provided by a Texas Instruments TMS5220NL Speech Synthesizer, compatibility with SC-01 or SSI-263 unknown.
* Mustalgame Card: Mockingboard clone from Capital Computer Co (Hong Kong) with two AY-3-891x chips. Integrated Software Automatic Mouth (S.A.M.) for speech synthesis. Amplifies Apple II speaker sound without need for interconnecting cable.
* Phasor: emulates 2 × Mockingboard cards with optional voice support, 1 x ALF Music Card. Developed by Applied Engineering.

===Modern cards===
* Mockingboard-T: A variant of the Mockingboard Sound II using tubes. Developed by A2Heaven.
* Mega Audio: emulates 2 x Mockingboard cards without voice support, 1 x ALF Music card, 4 x S.A.M.-cards (4 x DAC). Developed by A2Heaven.
* Mockingboard v1: A clone of the Mockingboard A from GSE-Reactive
* Mockingboard v2.2: A variant of the Mockingboard A with some minor enhancements from ReActiveMicro.
* Mockingboard for IIc: This Mockingboard variant is software compatible with the other Mockingboard A/C without voice designed for the Apple IIc. It installs on the CPU socket. Uses two AY-3-8912 and CPLD for IO Bus interface. Developed by Ian Kim in South Korea.
* SD Music card: First FM sound card for Apple II, uses a YM2413 and ATmega128 to emulate Mockingboard A/C without voice support. It provides a maximum of nine voices and provides direct register control for the YM2413. Developed by Ian Kim in South Korea.
* SD Music Deluxe (OPL3): OPL3(YMF262) Mockingboard I/II/A/C emulated sound card, Stereo sound and user defined instruments voice channels, Direct control for RAW data. VGM player supported. Developed by Ian Kim in South Korea.
* A2FPGA Multicard: Provides a variant of Mockingboard Sound II using YM2149 logic with output mixed into HDMI. Available from ReActiveMicro.

==Defects==
French Touch member fenarinarsa investigated and documented a problem with the AY-3-8913 chip, whereby the output had poor bass response. This affects all cards that use the AY-3-8913 and can be demonstrated with Cybernoid. A hardware patch is available that replaces the AY-3-8913 with a AY-3-8910 or YM2149.

<text>The iron law of wages is a proposed law of economics that asserts that real wages always tend, in the long run, toward the minimum wage necessary to sustain the life of the worker. The theory was first named by Ferdinand Lassalle in the mid-nineteenth century. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels attribute the doctrine to Lassalle (notably in Marx&#x27;s 1875 &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;), the idea to Thomas Malthus&#x27;s (1798) &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population,&quot; and the terminology to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;great, eternal iron laws&quot; in &quot;Das Göttliche&quot;.

It was coined in reference to the views of classical economists such as David Ricardo&#x27;s law of rent, and the competing population theory of Thomas Malthus. It held that the market price of labor (which tends toward the minimum required for the subsistence of the laborers) would always, or almost always, reduce as the working population increased and vice versa. Ricardo believed that this happened only under particular conditions.

== Lassalle ==
According to Alexander Gray, Ferdinand Lassalle &quot;gets the credit of having invented&quot; the phrase the &quot;iron law of wages&quot;, as Lassalle wrote about &quot;das eiserne und grausame Gesetz&quot; (the iron and cruel law).

According to Lassalle, wages cannot fall below subsistence wage level because without subsistence, laborers will be unable to work. However, competition among laborers for employment will drive wages down to this minimal level. This follows from Malthus&#x27; demographic theory, according to which population rises when wages are above the &quot;subsistence wage&quot; and falls when wages are below subsistence. Assuming the demand for labor to be a given monotonically decreasing function of the real wage rate, the theory then predicted that, in the long-run equilibrium of the system, labor supply (i.e. population) will rise or fall to the number of workers needed at the subsistence wage.

The justification for this was that when wages are higher, the supply of labor will increase relative to demand, creating an excess supply and thus depressing market real wages; when wages are lower, labor supply will fall, increasing market real wages. This would create a dynamic convergence towards a subsistence-wage equilibrium with constant population, in accordance with supply and demand theory.

As Ricardo noticed, this prediction would not come true as long as new investment, technology, or some other factor causes the demand for labor to increase faster than population: in that case, both real wages and population would increase over time. The demographic transition (a transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a country industrializes) changed this dynamic in most of the developed world, leading to wages much higher than the subsistence wage. Even in countries which still have rapidly expanding populations, the need for skilled labor in certain occupations causes some wages to rise much faster than in others.

To answer the question of why wages might fall towards a subsistence level, Ricardo put forth the law of rent. Ricardo and Malthus debated this concept in a lengthy personal correspondence.

== Ricardo ==

The content of the iron law of wages has been attributed to economists writing earlier than Lassalle. For example, Antonella Stirati notes that Joseph Schumpeter claimed that Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot first formulated the concept. Some (e.g., John Kenneth Galbraith) attribute the idea to David Ricardo. According to Terry Peach, economists interpreting Ricardo as having a more flexible view of wages include Haney (1924), J. R. Hicks (1973), Frank Knight (1935), Ramsay (1836), George Stigler (1952), and Paul Samuelson (1979). She sees Ricardo, for example, as being closer to the more flexible views of population characteristic of economists prior to Malthus. The theorist Henry George noticed that Ricardo&#x27;s Law of Rent did not imply that a reduction of wages to subsistence is an immutable fact, but that it instead points the way towards reforms that could greatly increase real wages, such as a land value tax. Ricardo drew a distinction between a natural price and a market price. For Ricardo, the natural price of labor was the cost of maintaining the laborer. However, Ricardo believed that the market price of labor or the actual wages paid could exceed the natural wage level indefinitely due to countervailing economic tendencies:

Ricardo also claimed that the natural wage was not necessarily what was needed to physically sustain the laborer, but could be much higher depending on the &quot;habits and customs&quot; of a nation. He wrote:

== Criticism ==

There have been socialist critics of Lassalle and of the alleged iron law of wages both Marxist and Anarchist. Karl Marx, argued that although there was a &quot;tendency&quot; for wages to fall to subsistence levels, there were also tendencies which worked in opposing directions. Marx criticized the Malthusian basis for the iron law of wages. According to Malthus, humanity is largely destined to live in poverty because an increase in productive capacity results in an increase in population. Marx criticized Lassalle for misunderstanding David Ricardo. Marx also noted that the foundation of what he called &quot;modern political economy&quot; needs, for the theory of value, only for wages to be a given magnitude. He did so in praising the Physiocrats. The French Anarchist and Revolutionary Syndicalist Émile Pouget also criticised the alleged iron law stating that “It isn’t even a law of rubber!&quot;. He argued, on a simply empirical basis, that England, the United States, and Australia had a higher pay rate and lower cost of basic necessities than France.

<doc id="303070" wikidata="Q77245" url="?curid=303070" title="Floris V, Count of Holland">
<text>Floris V (24 June 1254 – 27 June 1296) reigned as Count of Holland and Zeeland from 1256 until 1296. His life was documented in detail in the Rijmkroniek by Melis Stoke, his chronicler. He is credited with a mostly peaceful reign, modernizing administration, policies beneficial to trade, generally acting in the interests of his peasants at the expense of nobility, and reclaiming land from the sea. His dramatic murder, said by some to have been arranged by King Edward I of England and Guy, Count of Flanders, made him a hero in Holland.

==Early life==
Floris was the son of Count William II (1227–1256) and Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His father was slain in 1256 by Frisians when Floris was just two years old. Custody over Floris fell first to his uncle (Floris de Voogd from 1256 to 1258), then to his aunt (Adelaide of Holland from 1258 to 1263). The fight over custody of Holland culminated in the battle of Reimerswaal on 22 January 1263, where Count Otto II of Guelders defeated Aleidis and was chosen regent by the nobles who opposed Aleidis.

Otto II served as Floris V&#x27;s guardian until he was twelve years old (1266) and considered capable of administering Holland himself. Floris&#x27;s mother, Elisabeth, continued to reside in Holland after her husband&#x27;s death in 1256. She died on 27 May 1266 and is buried in Middelburg abbey church. She died in the same year that Count Floris V was declared old enough to rule without guardianship, on 10 July 1266.

==Political life==

Floris was supported by the count of Hainaut of the house of Avesnes, who was an arch-enemy of the count of Flanders of the house of Dampierre. Floris married Beatrix of Dampierre, the daughter of Guy of Dampierre, count of Flanders, in 1269.

In 1272 Floris unsuccessfully attacked the Frisians (culminating in the Battle of Heiloo) in a first attempt to retrieve the body of his father. In 1274 he faced an uprising by nobles led by the powerful lords Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel, Zweder of Abcoude, Arnoud of Amstel, and Herman VI van Woerden, who held lands on the border with the adjacent bishopric of Utrecht (the area of Amsterdam, Abcoude, IJsselstein, and Woerden) at the expense of the bishop. Gijsbrecht and Herman were supported by the craftsmen of Utrecht, the peasants of Kennemerland (Alkmaar, Haarlem, and surroundings), Waterland (north of Amsterdam) and Amstelland (Amsterdam and surroundings) and the West Frisians. He assisted the weak bishop, John I of Nassau, by making a treaty with the craftsmen. The bishop would become dependent on Holland&#x27;s support, and eventually added the lands of the rebellious lords to Holland in 1279. He gave concessions to the peasants of Kennemerland. Kennemerland was a duneland, where the farmers had far fewer rights than the farmers in the polders. Floris got rid of the Avesnes influence and switched allegiance to the Dampierres.

In 1282 Floris again attacked the troublesome Frisians in the north, defeating them at the battle of Vronen, and succeeded in retrieving the body of his father. After a campaign in 1287–1288 he finally defeated the Frisians. In the meantime he had received Zeeland-bewester-Schelde (the area that controls access to the Scheldt river) as a loan from the Holy Roman King Rudolf I of Germany in 1287, but the local nobility sided with the count of Flanders who invaded in 1290. Floris arranged a meeting with count Guy of Flanders, but he was taken prisoner in Biervliet and was forced to abandon his claims and then set free.

Floris immediately wanted to resume war, but King Edward I of England, who had an interest in access to the great rivers for wool and other English goods, convinced Floris to stop hostilities with Flanders. When in 1292 Floris claimed the throne of Scotland in the Great Cause (his great-grandmother Ada being the sister of King William I of Scotland), he did not receive the expected support from Edward, but England did support his claims in a new, this time more successful, war on Flanders.

==Capture and death==

Amid the Gascon War between England and France, EdwardI moved his trade in wool from Dordrecht in Holland to Mechelen in Brabant to aid Flanders in its own war against France. Floris then switched sides to France in 1296. Edward I subsequently prohibited all English trade with Holland and conspired with Guy of Flanders to have Floris kidnapped and taken to France. The humiliated lords Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel and Herman of Woerden, together with Gerard van Velsen, captured Floris during a hunting party and brought him to Muiderslot castle. The news of the capture spread quickly; afraid of the people, four days later the lords together with their captive left the castle to get to a safer place. They were stopped by an angry mob of local peasants. In panic Gerard of Velzen killed the count, and the lords fled. Gerard was eventually captured and killed in Leiden. The other conspirators fled to Brabant, Flanders and perhaps to Prussia, to which many colonists and crusaders from Holland migrated.

==Legacy==

The life and death of Floris V inspired songs, plays, and books in the Netherlands. Best known is the play by 17th century playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel, which is about the sacking of Amsterdam in the days after the death of Floris V.

The nickname &quot;God of the Peasants&quot; was introduced after Floris&#x27; death in the nobility and was originally intended to be an insult. He earned the name because he behaved &quot;as if he were the Good Lord himself with his peasants&quot;. He apparently knighted 40 peasants as members of the Order of St. James without permission of the church, provoking the anger of the church and of the 12 existing noble members of that knightly order. This story has no historical basis, just like another story that claims that Gerard of Velzen participated in the conspiracy because Floris supposedly raped his wife. What is certain is that Floris was remembered as a saint by the peasants of Holland and that the &quot;God of the Peasants&quot; became a symbolic hero in the struggle for independence from Spain in the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648).

==Family==
Floris V was the son of Count William II of Holland and Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In c. 1271 Floris married Beatrice of Flanders, daughter of Guy de Dampierre, count of Flanders and Matilda, heiress of Bethune, Dendermonde, Richebourg and Warneton. Floris and Beatrice had several children including:
* John I, Count of Holland, who married Elizabeth, daughter of King Edward I of England. No issue. After John&#x27;s death Elizabeth returned to England and married Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.
* Margaret, engaged to Alphonso, Earl of Chester, son of King Edward I of England from 1281 to his death in 1284.

Floris had several illegitimate children, including:
* Witte van Haemstede (c. 1281-1321), son of Anna van Heusden (daughter of Jan van Heusden). Married Agnes van der Sluys had issue.
* Catherina van Holland (Katherin) (c. 1280- after 1328), married Zweder van Montfoort

<doc id="303071" wikidata="Q622970" url="?curid=303071" title="Neon lamp">
<text>A neon lamp (also neon glow lamp) is a miniature gas-discharge lamp. The lamp typically consists of a small glass capsule that contains a mixture of neon and other gases at a low pressure and two electrodes (an anode and a cathode). When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange glow discharge. The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer neon signs are also glow discharges, but they use the positive column which is not present in the ordinary neon lamp. Neon glow lamps were widely used as indicator lamps in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances. They are still sometimes used for their electrical simplicity in high-voltage circuits.

==History==

Neon was discovered in 1898 by William Ramsay and Morris Travers. The characteristic, brilliant red color that is emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately; Travers later wrote, &quot;the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.&quot;

Neon&#x27;s scarcity precluded its prompt application for electrical lighting along the lines of Moore tubes, which used electric discharges in nitrogen. Moore tubes were commercialized by their inventor, Daniel McFarlan Moore, in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude&#x27;s company, Air Liquide, was producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business, and in December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon. In 1915 a U.S. patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for neon tube lights; this patent became the basis for the monopoly held in the U.S. by his company, Claude Neon Lights, through the early 1930s.

Around 1917, Daniel Moore developed the neon lamp while working at the General Electric Company. The lamp has a very different design from the much larger neon tubes used for neon lighting. The difference in design was sufficient that a U.S. patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, &quot;These small, low power devices use a physical principle called coronal discharge. Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps.

Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the widespread commercialization of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the 1970s.

== Description ==

A small electric current (for a 5 mm bulb diameter NE-2 lamp, the quiescent current is about 400 μA), which may be AC or DC, is allowed through the tube, causing it to glow orange-red. The gas is typically a Penning mixture, 99.5% neon and 0.5% argon, which has lower striking voltage than pure neon, at a pressure of .

The lamp glow discharge lights at its striking voltage. The striking voltage is reduced by ambient light or radioactivity. To reduce the &quot;dark effect&quot;, some lamps were made with a small amount of radioactive material, typically Krypton-85, added to the envelope to provide ionization in darkness. 

The voltage required to sustain the discharge is significantly (up to 30%) lower than the striking voltage. This is due to the organization of positive ions near the cathode. Neon lamps operate using a low current glow discharge. 

Higher power devices, such as mercury-vapor lamps or metal halide lamps use a higher current arc discharge. Low pressure sodium-vapor lamps use a neon Penning mixture for warm up and can be operated as giant neon lamps if operated in a low power mode.

===Limiting current===
Once the neon lamp has reached breakdown, it can support a large current flow. Because of this characteristic, electrical circuitry external to the neon lamp must limit the current through the circuit or else the current will rapidly increase until the lamp is destroyed. 

For indicator-sized lamps, a resistor typically limits the current. In contrast, larger sized lamps often use a specially constructed high voltage transformer with high leakage inductance or other electrical ballast to limit the available current (see neon sign).

===Flicker flame===
When the current through the lamp is lower than the current for the highest-current discharge path, the glow discharge may become unstable and not cover the entire surface of the electrodes. This may be a sign of aging of the indicator lamp, and is exploited in the decorative &quot;flicker flame&quot; neon lamps. However, while too low a current causes flickering, too high a current increases the wear of the electrodes by stimulating sputtering, which coats the internal surface of the lamp with metal and causes it to darken.

The potential needed to strike the discharge is higher than what is needed to sustain the discharge. When there is not enough current, the glow forms around only part of the electrode surface. Convective currents make the glowing areas flow upwards, not unlike the discharge in a Jacob&#x27;s ladder. A photoionization effect can also be observed here, as the electrode area covered by the glow discharge can be increased by shining light at the lamp.

===Efficiency===
In comparison with incandescent lamps, neon lamps have much higher luminous efficacy. Incandescence is heat-driven light emission, so a large portion of the electric energy put into an incandescent lamp is converted into heat. Non-incandescent light sources such as neon lamps, fluorescent lamps, and light-emitting diodes are therefore much more energy efficient than normal incandescent lamps. 

Green neon lamps can produce up to 65 lumens per watt of power input, while white neon lamps have an efficacy of around 50 lumens per watt. In contrast, a standard incandescent lamp only produces around 13.5 lumens per watt.

===Environmental effects===
The precise values of starting and maintaining voltages of neon lamps is subject to change due to several effects. External light falling on the electrodes provides a source of ionization to start the lamp; in total darkness, lamps may reach a high and erratic starting voltage. One measure to mitigate for this effect is to include a pilot lamp within the enclosure to provide an initial source of light. Lamps are also somewhat sensitive to external electrostatic fields, temperature, and aging. Lamps intended for use as circuit components may be specially processed to eliminate most of the initial aging effects.

== Applications ==

=== Visual indicator ===

Even after the widespread availability of cheap LEDs, small neon lamps are still widely used as visual indicators in electronic equipment and appliances, due to their low power consumption, long life, and ability to operate on mains power.

=== Voltage surge suppression ===
Neon lamps are commonly used as low-voltage surge protectors, but they are generally inferior to gas discharge tube (GDT) surge protectors (which can be designed for higher voltage applications). Neon lamps have been used as an inexpensive method to protect RF receivers from voltage spikes (lamp connected to RF input and chassis ground), but they are not suitable for higher-power RF transmitters.

=== Voltage tester ===
Most small neon (indicator-sized) lamps, such as the common NE-2, have a break-down voltage of around 90 volts. When driven from a DC source, only the negatively charged electrode (cathode) will glow. When driven from an AC source, both electrodes will glow (each during alternate half cycles). These attributes make neon lamps (with series resistors) a convenient low-cost voltage tester. By examining which electrode is glowing they can reveal whether a given voltage source is AC or DC, and if DC, the polarity of the points being tested.

=== Voltage regulation ===
The breakdown characteristic of glow-discharge lamps allows them to be used as voltage regulators or overvoltage protection devices. Starting around the 1930s, General Electric (GE), Signalite, and other firms made voltage regulator tubes.

=== Switching element/oscillator ===
Like other gas discharge lamps, the neon lamp has negative resistance; its voltage falls with increasing current after the lamp reaches its breakdown voltage. Therefore, the lamp has hysteresis; its turn-off (extinction) voltage is lower than its turn-on (breakdown) voltage. 

This allows it to be used as an active switching element. Neon lamps were used to make relaxation oscillator circuits, using this mechanism, sometimes referred to as the Pearson–Anson effect for low frequency applications such as flashing warning lights, stroboscopes tone generators in electronic organs, and as time bases and deflection oscillators in early cathode ray oscilloscopes. 

Neon lamps can also be bistable, and were even used to build digital logic circuits such as logic gates, flip-flop, binary memories, and digital counters. These applications were sufficiently common that manufacturers made neon lamps specifically for this use, sometimes called &quot;circuit-component&quot; lamps. At least some of these lamps have a glow concentrated into a small spot on the cathode, which made them unsuited to use as indicators. To provide more repeatable lamp characteristics and reduce &quot;dark effect&quot; ( a rise in starting voltage observed in lamps kept in total darkness), some types of lamp such as NE83 (5AH) include a small amount of a radioisotope to provide initial ionization. 

A variant of the NE-2 type lamp for circuit applications, the NE-77, have three wire electrodes in the lamp (in a plane) instead of the usual two, the third for use as a control electrode.

=== Detector ===
Neon lamps have been historically used as microwave and millimeter-wave detectors (&quot;plasma diodes&quot; or glow discharge detectors (GDDs)) up to about 100 GHz or so and in such service were said to exhibit comparable sensitivity (of the order of a few 10s to perhaps 100 microvolts) to the familiar 1N23-type catwhisker-contacted silicon diodes once ubiquitous in microwave equipment. More recently it has been found that these lamps work well as detectors even at sub-millimeter (&quot;terahertz&quot;) frequencies and they have been successfully used as pixels in several experimental imaging arrays at these wavelengths.

In these applications the lamps are operated either in &quot;starvation&quot; mode (to reduce lamp-current noise) or in normal glow discharge mode; some literature references their use as detectors of radiation up into the optical regime when operated in abnormal glow mode. Coupling of microwaves into the plasma may be in free space, in waveguide, by means of a parabolic concentrator (e.g., Winston cone), or via capacitive means via a loop or dipole antenna mounted directly to the lamp.

Although most of these applications use ordinary off-the-shelf dual-electrode lamps, in one case it was found that special three (or more) electrode lamps, with the extra electrode acting as the coupling antenna, provided even better results (lower noise and higher sensitivity). This discovery received a US patent.

=== Alphanumerical display ===

Neon lamps with several shaped electrodes were used as alphanumerical displays known as Nixie tubes. These have since been replaced by other display devices such as light emitting diodes, vacuum fluorescent displays, and liquid crystal displays.

Since at least the 1940s, argon, neon, and phosphored &quot;glow thyratron&quot; latching indicators (which would light up upon an impulse on their starter electrode and extinguish only after their anode voltage was cut) were available for example as self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays, or, combined in a 4×4, four-color phosphored-thyratron matrix, as a stackable 625-color RGBA pixel for large video graphics arrays.
Multiple-cathode and/or anode &quot;glow thyratrons&quot; called Dekatrons could count forwards and backwards while their count state was visible as a glow on one of the numbered cathodes. These were used as self-displaying divide-by-n counter/timer/prescalers in counting instruments, or as adder/subtracters in calculators.

=== Other ===
In 1930s radio sets, neon lamps were used as tuning indicators, called &quot;tuneons&quot; and would give a brighter glow as the station was tuned in correctly.

Because of their comparatively short response time, in the early development of television neon lamps were used as the light source in many mechanical-scan TV displays.

Novelty glow lamps with shaped electrodes (such as flowers and leaves), often coated with phosphors, have been made for artistic purposes. In some of these, the glow that surrounds an electrode is part of the design.

==Color==
Neon indicator lamps are normally orange, and are frequently used with a colored filter over them to improve contrast and change their color to red or a redder orange.
They can also be filled with argon, krypton, or xenon rather than neon, or mixed with it. While the electrical operating characteristics remain similar, these lamps light with a bluish glow (including some ultraviolet) rather than neon&#x27;s characteristic reddish-orange glow. Ultraviolet radiation then can be used to excite a phosphor coating inside of the bulb and provide a wide range of various colors, including white. A mixture of 95% neon, 2.5% krypton, and 2.5% argon can be used for a green glow, but nevertheless &quot;green neon&quot; lamps are more commonly phosphor-based.

<text>In the signage industry, neon signs are electric signs lighted by long luminous gas-discharge tubes that contain rarefied neon or other gases. They are the most common use for neon lighting, which was first demonstrated in a modern form in December 1910 by Georges Claude at the Paris Motor Show. While they are used worldwide, neon signs were popular in the United States from about the 1920s to 1950s. The installations in Times Square, many originally designed by Douglas Leigh, were famed, and there were nearly 2,000 small shops producing neon signs by 1940. In addition to signage, neon lighting is used frequently by artists and architects, and (in a modified form) in plasma display panels and televisions. The signage industry has declined in the past several decades, and cities are now concerned with preserving and restoring their antique neon signs.

Light emitting diode arrays can be formed and covered with a light diffuser to simulate the appearance of neon lamps.

==History==
The neon sign is an evolution of the earlier Geissler tube, which is a sealed glass tube containing a &quot;rarefied&quot; gas (the gas pressure in the tube is well below atmospheric pressure). When a voltage is applied to electrodes inserted through the glass, an electrical glow discharge results. Geissler tubes were popular in the late 19th century, and the different colors they emitted were characteristics of the gases within. They were unsuitable for general lighting, as the pressure of the gas inside typically declined with use. The direct predecessor of neon tube lighting was the Moore tube, which used nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas and a patented mechanism for maintaining pressure. Moore tubes were sold for commercial lighting for a number of years in the early 1900s. 

The discovery of neon in 1898 by British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers included the observation of a brilliant red glow in Geissler tubes. Travers wrote, &quot;the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.&quot; Following neon&#x27;s discovery, neon tubes were used as scientific instruments and novelties. A sign created by Perley G. Nutting and displaying the word &quot;neon&quot; may have been shown at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, although this claim has been disputed; in any event, the scarcity of neon would have precluded the development of a lighting product. After 1902, Georges Claude&#x27;s company in France, Air Liquide, began producing industrial quantities of neon, essentially as a byproduct of their air liquefaction business. From December 3–18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two long bright red neon tubes at the Paris Motor Show. This demonstration lit a peristyle of the &quot;Grand Palais&quot; (a large exhibition hall). Claude&#x27;s associate, Jacques Fonsèque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth Cinzano illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the Paris Opera was adorned with neon tube lighting. Over the next several years, patents were granted to Claude for two innovations still used today: a &quot;bombardment&quot; technique to remove impurities from the working gas of a sealed sign, and a design for the internal electrodes of the sign that prevented their degradation by sputtering.

In 1923, Georges Claude and his French company Claude Neon introduced neon gas signs to the United States by selling two to a Packard car dealership in Los Angeles. Earle C. Anthony purchased the two signs reading &quot;Packard&quot; for $1,250 apiece. Neon lighting quickly became a popular fixture in outdoor advertising. The signsdubbed &quot;liquid fire&quot;were visible in daylight; people would stop and stare. What may be the oldest surviving neon sign in the United States, still in use for its original purpose, is the sign &quot;Theatre&quot; (1929) at the Lake Worth Playhouse in Lake Worth Beach, Florida.

The next major technological innovation in neon lighting and signs was the development of fluorescent tube coatings. Jacques Risler received a French patent in 1926 for these. Neon signs that use an argon/mercury gas mixture emit a good deal of ultraviolet light. When this light is absorbed by a fluorescent coating, preferably inside the tube, the coating (called a &quot;phosphor&quot;) glows with its own color. While only a few colors were initially available to sign designers, after the Second World War, phosphor materials were researched intensively for use in color televisions. About two dozen colors were available to neon sign designers by the 1960s, and today there are nearly 100 available colors.

==Fabrication==
Neon tube signs are produced by bending glass tubing into shapes for the sign. After shaping, the hollow tube is evacuated with vacuum pumps and filled with gases to produce the desired color, e.g. neon gas for red lighting. Electrodes are placed at each end of the shaped tubing and the entire tube is sealed to prevent gases from leaking in or out which leads to tube failure.
==Applications==
Light-emitting tubes form colored lines with which a text can be written or a picture drawn, including various decorations, especially in advertising and commercial signage. By programming sequences of switching parts on and off, there are many possibilities for dynamic light patterns that form animated images.

In some applications, neon tubes are increasingly being replaced with LEDs, given the steady advance in LED luminosity and decreasing cost of high-brightness LEDs. However, proponents of neon technology maintain that they still have significant advantages over LEDs. But, LED neon has expanded design possibilities like bendable shapes, gradient lighting, and multicolor displays that traditional neon cannot achieve.

Neon illumination is valuable to invoke the 1940s or 1950s nostalgia in marketing and in the historic restoration of architectural landmarks from the neon era. Architecture in the streamline moderne era often deployed neon to accent structural pigmented glass built into the façade of a 1930s or 1940s structure; many of these buildings now qualify for inclusion on historic registers such as the U.S. National Register of Historic Places if their historic integrity is faithfully maintained.

<doc id="303081" wikidata="Q3634144" url="?curid=303081" title="Pseudo-secularism">
<text>The term pseudo-secularism is used to describe individuals who claim to be secular but may display biases towards a particular religion, whether consciously or unconsciously. This term has gained popularity in recent Indian politics, where it is often used to criticize individuals who identify as secular and advocate for minority rights while remaining silent or opposing concerns faced by the majority religion. Some Hindu nationalist parties employ this term as a counter-accusation against their critics, alleging that the secularism followed by the Indian National Congress and other self-declared secular parties are flawed or distorted.

== Background ==

The first recorded use of the term &quot;pseudo-secularism&quot; was in the 1951 book &quot;Philosophy and Action of the R.S.S. for the Hind Swaraj&quot;, by Anthony Elenjimittam. In his book Elenjimittam accused leaders of the Indian National Congress of pretending to uphold secularism. According to the Indian lawyer, historian, A. G. Noorani &quot;pseudo-secularism&quot; was coined by K.M. Munshi.

After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was accused of representing the Hindu communalism in Indian politics it started using the counter-charge of &quot;pseudo-secularism&quot; against the Congress and other parties. The BJP leader LK Advani characterizes pseudo-secular politicians as those for whom &quot;secularism is only a euphemism for vote-bank politics&quot;. According to him, these politicians are not concerned with the welfare of the minorities, but only interested in their vote.

The Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has criticized the term as propaganda by Hindu nationalists. Left leaning historian Mridula Mukherjee has described it as &quot;a term propounded by the ideologues of Hindu nationalism to delegitimize and deny the genuineness of secularism. The subtext is that secularism is only a veneer put on to hide alleged policies of minority appeasement. The proponents of the term allege the secularists of being pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu.&quot;

==Examples==

The state policies of independent India accorded special rights to Muslims, along with other religious minorities like Christians and Parsis, in matters of personal law. For example,

* In 1986, a Muslim woman Shah Bano Begum was denied alimony even after winning a court case, because the then INC government reversed the court judgement under pressure of Islamic orthodoxy by passing bill in the parliament.
* Sharia inspired laws for Muslims, such as those allowing triple talaq (now banned), Half Inheritance for Females, Child Marriage and Polygyny
* The religion-based reservations in civil and educational institutions to improve the representation of minorities. The Hindu nationalist BJP is openly against reservation of Muslims in educational institutions and the parliament.
* In 1998, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh accused BJP of playing along with pseudo-secular parties for compromising on issues like Article 370, Ram temple and Uniform civil code of India.
* In 2006, Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India said that &quot;We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. These must have the first claim on resources.&quot; during his speech at the 52nd meeting of the National Development Council. TOI reported that the former PM statement came after the Sachar Committee report which highlighted how Muslim communities were lagging behind in education and livelihood opportunities in India.
* Hindu Temples are managed by each state&#x27;s government in India. Religious places of minority religions like Islam, Christianity and Sikhism are managed by their followers. Some argue that state regulation is necessary to prevent caste and gender based discrimination in places of worship, and hence should be expanded to all religion instead of &#x27;freeing the Hindu temples&#x27;.

<doc id="303084" wikidata="Q1430040" url="?curid=303084" title="Corn smut">
<text>Corn smut is a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Mycosarcoma maydis, synonym &quot;Ustilago maydis&quot;. One of several cereal crop pathogens called smut, the fungus forms galls on all above-ground parts of corn species such as maize and teosinte. The infected corn is edible; in Mexico, it is considered a delicacy, called , often eaten as a filling in quesadillas and other tortilla-based dishes, as well as in soups.

== Etymology ==

In Mexico, corn smut is known as (, sometimes spelled ). This word entered Spanish in Mexico from Classical Nahuatl, though the Nahuatl words from which is derived are debated. In modern Nahuatl, the word for is (), and some sources deem to be the classical form.

Some sources wrongly give the etymology as coming from the Nahuatl words (&quot;excrement&quot; or &quot;rear-end&quot;, actually meaning &quot;&quot;) and (&quot;sleeping&quot;, from &quot;to sleep&quot;), thus giving a combined mis-meaning of &quot;sleeping/hibernating excrement&quot;, but actually meaning &quot;sleeping excrescence&quot;, referring to the fact that the fungus grows between the kernels of corn and impedes them from developing, thus they remain &quot;sleeping&quot;.

A second group of sources deem the word to mean &quot;raven&#x27;s excrement.&quot; These sources appear to be combining the word for &quot;thrasher&quot; with , meaning &quot;excrement,&quot; actually meaning &quot;excrescence&quot;. However, the avian meaning of derives from the Nahuatl word &quot;song&quot; , from the verb &quot;to sing&quot; . This root then clashes with this reconstruction&#x27;s second claim that the segment comes from (&quot;excrement&quot;).

One source derives the meaning as &quot;corn excrescence,&quot; using again and &quot;corn&quot; . This requires the linguistically unlikely evolution of &quot;corn&quot; into .

In Peru, it is known as or .

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Mycosarcoma maydis&quot; is the best known and studied fungus of the Ustilaginomycetes, a sub class of basidiomycota, and is often used as the exemplar species when talking about its entire class.

Formerly it was placed in genus &quot;Ustilago&quot;, but in 2016, it was placed in genus &quot;Mycosarcoma&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The fungus infects all parts of the host plant by invading the ovaries of its host. The infection causes the corn kernels to swell up into tumor-like galls, wherein the tissues, texture, and developmental pattern are mushroom-like. The galls grow to 4 to 5 inches in diameter. These galls are made up of hypertrophied cells of the infected plant, along with resulting fungal threads and blue-black spores. These dark-colored spores give the cob a burned, scorched appearance.

== Biology ==

=== Life cycle ===

When grown in the lab on very simple media, &quot;M. maydis&quot; behaves like baker&#x27;s yeast, forming single cells called sporidia. These cells multiply by budding off daughter cells. When two compatible sporidia meet on the surface of the plant, however, they switch to a different mode of growth. First, they produce one or another pheromone, and begin producing one or the other type of pheromone receptor - this depends on mating type &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, as determined by alleles at two unlinked mating loci. If this signaling is successful, they then send out conjugation tubes to find each other, after which they fuse and make a hypha to enter the corn plant. Hyphae growing in the plant are dikaryotic; they possess two haploid nuclei per hyphal compartment. In contrast to sporidia, the dikaryotic phase of &quot;M. maydis&quot; only occurs during successful infection of a corn plant, and cannot be maintained in the laboratory.

Proliferation of the fungus inside the plant leads to disease symptoms such as chlorosis, anthocyanin formation, reduced growth, and the appearance of tumors harboring the developing teliospores. These teliospores help to overwinter the pathogen into the next season. They survive in the soil.

Mature tumors release spores that are dispersed by rain and wind. Under appropriate conditions, a metabasidium is formed in which meiosis occurs. Resulting haploid nuclei migrate into elongated single cells. These cells detach from the metabasidium to become the sporidia, thus completing the life cycle.

=== Host/pathogen conflict ===
Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes. A rapid plant defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst, which involves the production of reactive oxygen species at the site of the attempted invasion. As a pathogen, &quot;M. maydis&quot; can respond by an oxidative stress response, regulated by gene &quot;YAP1&quot;. This response protects &quot;M. maydis&quot; from the host attack and is necessary for the pathogen&#x27;s virulence. Furthermore, &quot;M. maydis&quot; has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system. This repair system involves a homolog of Rad51 that has a very similar sequence and size to its mammalian counterparts. This system also involves a protein, Rec2, that is more distantly related to Rad51 and Brh2 proteins, and is a streamlined version of the mammalian Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA2) protein. When any of these proteins is inactivated, sensitivity of &quot;M. maydis&quot; to DNA damaging agents is increased. Also, mitotic recombination becomes deficient, mutation frequency increases, and meiosis fails to complete. These observations suggest that recombinational repair during mitosis and meiosis in &quot;M. maydis&quot; may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host&#x27;s oxidative defensive response to infection, as well as from other DNA damaging agents.

=== Proteome ===
&quot;M. maydis&quot; is known to produce four Gα proteins, and one each of Gβ and Gγ.

== Management ==

Losses from corn smut can vary greatly; however, annual yield losses rarely exceed 2% when resistant cultivars are planted. This disease can have a large economic impact on sweet corn, specifically when smut galls replace the kernels. There are many ways to control and manage corn smut; however, corn smut cannot be controlled by any common fungicide at this time, as &quot;M. maydis&quot; infects individual corn kernels instead of infecting the entire cob, like head smut.

Some beneficial ways to contain corn smut include resistant corn plants, crop rotation, and avoiding mechanical injury to the plant. A mechanical injury can cause the corn to become easily accessible to &quot;M. maydis&quot;, enhancing infection. Additionally, clearing the planting area of debris can help control corn smut, as the teliospores from corn smut overwinter in debris. This is not the best practice, though, because corn smut can also overwinter in the soil; crop rotation is recommended. Lastly, as excess nitrogen in the soil augments infection rate, using fertilizer with low nitrogen levels or just limiting the amount of nitrogen in the soil proves to be another way to control corn smut.

== Environment ==

Although not all the conditions that favor growth of &quot;M. maydis&quot; are known, there are certain environments where corn smut seems to thrive, depending on both abiotic and biotic factors. Hot and dry weather during pollination followed by a heavy rainy season appear to improve the pathogenicity of corn smut. Furthermore, excess manure (and therefore nitrogen) in the soil also increases pathogenicity. Not only do these abiotic factors increase infectability, they also increase disease spread. High winds and heavy rain also increase disease spread as the spores of corn smut can be more easily transmitted. Other biotic factors largely have to do with the extent by which humans interact with the corn and corn smut. If corn debris is not cleared at the end of the season, the spores can overwinter in the corn fragments and live to infect another generation. Finally, humans wounding the corn (with shears or other tools) present the opportunity for corn smut to easily enter the plant.

==Culinary use==

Smut feeds on the corn plant and decreases the yield. Smut-infected crops are often destroyed, although some farmers use them to prepare silage. However, the immature infected galls are still edible, and in Mexico, they are highly esteemed as a delicacy. It is known as &quot;huitlacoche&quot; and sold for a significantly higher price than uninfected corn. The consumption of corn smut in Mexico originated directly from Aztec cuisine. For culinary use, the galls are harvested while still immature — fully mature galls are dry and almost entirely spore-filled. The immature galls, gathered 2 to 3 weeks after an ear of corn is infected, still retain moisture and, when cooked, have a flavor described as mushroom-like, sweet, savory, woody, and earthy. Flavor compounds include sotolon and vanillin, as well as the sugar glucose.

&quot;Huitlacoche&quot; is a source of the essential amino acid lysine, which the body requires but cannot manufacture. It also contains levels of beta-glucans similar to, and protein content equal or superior to, most edible fungi.

The fungus has had difficulty entering into the American and European diets as most farmers see it as blight, despite attempts by government and high-profile chefs to introduce it into food products. In the mid-1990s, due to demand created by high-end restaurants, Pennsylvania and Florida farms were allowed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to intentionally infect corn with &quot;huitlacoche&quot;. Most observers consider the program to have had little impact, although the initiative is still in progress. The cursory show of interest is significant because the USDA has spent a considerable amount of time and money trying to eradicate corn smut in the United States. Moreover, in 1989, the James Beard Foundation held a high-profile &quot;huitlacoche&quot; dinner, prepared by Josefina Howard, chef at Rosa Mexicano restaurant. This dinner tried to get Americans to eat more of it by renaming it the &quot;Mexican truffle&quot; and it is often compared to truffles in food articles describing its taste and texture.

Native American tribes in North America ate corn smut as well. The North Dakota Hidatsa tribe&#x27;s practice of preparing and eating corn smut is described vividly in &quot;Buffalo Bird Woman&#x27;s Garden&quot;.

Native Americans of the American Southwest, including the Zuni people, have used corn smut in an attempt to induce labor. It has similar medicinal effects to ergot, but weaker, due to the presence of the chemical ustilagine.

=== Recipes of Mexico ===
A simple Mexican-style succotash can be made from chorizo, onions, garlic, serrano peppers, &quot;huitlacoche&quot;, and shrimp with &quot;salsa taquera&quot;. The mild, earthy flavors of the &quot;huitlacoche&quot; blend nicely with the fats of the chorizo and bond to mellow out the heat from the peppers and salsa.

Another Maya favorite on the Riviera Maya (Cancun to Tulum) is to add &quot;huitlacoche&quot; to omelets. Its earthy flavors bond with the fats that cook the eggs to mellow the flavors into a truffle-like taste.
Huitlacoche is also popular in quesadillas with Mexican cheese, sautéed onions, and tomatoes.

The blueish color transforms into the recognizable black color only with heat. Any dish with &quot;huitlacoche&quot; must include a slow simmer of the fungus until it becomes black, which also removes most of the starch of the corn, and what is left is a black oily paste.

=== Availability ===
In Mexico, &quot;huitlacoche&quot; is mostly consumed fresh and can be purchased at restaurants, streets, or farmer&#x27;s markets throughout the country and, to a much lesser extent, can also be purchased as a canned good in some markets and via the internet. Farmers in the countryside spread the spores around intentionally to create more of the fungus. In some parts of the country, they call the fungus &quot;hongo de maiz&quot;, i.e., &quot;maize fungus&quot;.

=== Nutritional value ===
When corn smut grows on a corn cob, it changes the nutritional worth of the corn it affects. Corn smut contains more proteins than the uninfected grains normally do. The amino acid lysine, of which corn contains very little, abounds in corn smut.

== Non-culinary ==

=== Model organism ===
The yeast-like growth of &quot;M. maydis&quot; makes it an appealing model organism for research, although its relevance in nature is unknown. The fungus is exceptionally well-suited for genetic modification. This allows researchers to study the interaction between the fungus and its host with relative ease. The availability of the entire genome is another advantage of this fungus as a model organism.

&quot;M. maydis&quot; is not only used to study plant disease, but it also is used to study plant genetics. In 1996, a study on &quot;M. maydis&quot; genetics led to the discovery of synthesis-dependent strand annealing, a method of homologous recombination used in DNA repair. Other studies in the fungus have also investigated the role of the cytoskeleton in polarized growth. It is largely due to work with &quot;M. maydis&quot; that the function of the breast-cancer gene BRCA2 is now known. The fungus is mostly studied as a model organism for host pathogen interaction and delivery of effectors protein.

=== Industrial biotechnology ===
&quot;M. maydis&quot; is able to produce a broad range of valuable chemicals such as ustilagic acid, itaconic acid, malic acid, and hydroxyparaconic acid. Thus, corn smut is gaining more relevance in industrial applications.

<text>The Global Greens Charter is a document that 800 delegates from the Green parties of 72 countries decided upon a first gathering of the Global Greens in Canberra, Australia in April 2001. The first part contains six guiding principles, whereas the second part specifies what political action should be taken. The second part of the charter was modified in Dakar, Senegal in 2012 at the third Global Greens Congress.

The signatory parties and political movements of the &quot;Global Greens Charter&quot; commit themselves to global partnership and to six guiding principles. These principles are:
* ecological wisdom
* social justice
* participatory democracy
* nonviolence
* sustainability
* respect for diversity

The Charter builds on earlier Greens statements including in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, the Millennium Declaration made at Oaxaca in 1999 and the Accord between the Green Parties of the Americas and the Ecologist Parties of Africa.

== Guiding documents ==
The draft Charter was prepared by Louise Crossley, a member of the Australian Greens, based upon the following documents.

* Ten Key Values of the Green Committees of Correspondence (US)
* Taiwanese interpretation of the Ten Key Values
* Ten Key Values of the Canadian Greens
* The Earth Charter - Benchmark Draft II, April 1999
* Declaracion de principios (Mexico)
* Valores fundamentais (Brazil)

<doc id="303086" wikidata="Q2740420" url="?curid=303086" title="Bowie Kuhn">
<text>Bowie Kent Kuhn (; October 28, 1926 – March 15, 2007) was an American lawyer and sports administrator who served as the fifth commissioner of Major League Baseball from February 4, 1969, to September 30, 1984. He served as legal counsel for Major League Baseball owners for almost 20 years prior to his election as commissioner.

Kuhn was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Early life and career==
Kuhn was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, the son of Alice Waring (Roberts) and Louis Charles Kuhn, a fuel company executive. His father was a Bavarian (German) immigrant, and his mother had deep roots in Maryland. Kuhn grew up in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School. He then attended Franklin and Marshall College in the V-12 Navy College Training Program before going to Princeton University in 1945. Kuhn graduated from Princeton with honors in 1947 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He then received his J.D. degree in 1950 from the University of Virginia School of Law where he served on the editorial board of the law review.

Following his graduation from law school, Kuhn worked at the New York City law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher because the firm represented the National League. While working in baseball&#x27;s legal affairs, Kuhn served as a counselor for the NL in a lawsuit brought against it by the City of Milwaukee when the Milwaukee Braves moved to Atlanta following the 1965 season.

After the owners forced out William Eckert in 1968, Kuhn seemed like a logical replacement for the job of commissioner. He, unlike Eckert, was very aware of the inner workings of Major League Baseball before taking office. Kuhn&#x27;s closest challengers for the commissionership were E. Michael Burke, president of the New York Yankees; and San Francisco Giants head of baseball operations Chub Feeney, who instead became president of the National League. At 42, Kuhn remains the youngest commissioner in history.

==Actions as commissioner==
His tenure was marked by labor strikes (most notably in 1981), owner disenchantment, and the end of baseball&#x27;s reserve clause, yet baseball enjoyed unprecedented attendance gains (from 23 million in 1968 to 45.5 million in 1983) and television contracts during the same time frame.

Kuhn suspended numerous players for involvement with drugs and gambling, and took a strong stance against any activity that he perceived to be &quot;not in the best interests of baseball&quot;.

In 1970, he suspended star Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain indefinitely (the suspension was later set at three months) due to McLain&#x27;s involvement in a bookmaking operation, and later suspended McLain for the rest of the season for carrying a gun. He barred both Willie Mays (in 1979) and Mickey Mantle (in 1983) from the sport due to their involvement in casino promotion; neither was directly involved in gambling, and both were reinstated by Kuhn&#x27;s successor Peter Ueberroth in 1985.

Also in 1970, Kuhn described Jim Bouton&#x27;s &quot;Ball Four&quot; as &quot;detrimental to baseball&quot; and demanded that Bouton retract it. The book has been republished several times and is now considered a classic.

On October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for the first time. Kuhn, who thought that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number.

Through the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, weekday World Series games were played at night while most weekend games continued to be scheduled in the daytime. An exception came in 1976, when Game 2 was played on a Sunday night to avoid conflicts with NBC&#x27;s NFL coverage; Kuhn responded to criticism of the scheduling by attending the game, held at Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium, without an overcoat in spite of the chilly nighttime weather. Kuhn&#x27;s primetime vision has been manifested, however, as all World Series games are now shown in prime time.

In 1980, during the Iranian hostage crisis, Kuhn sat at a baseball game with Jeremiah Denton, a Navy admiral and former POW in Vietnam who would be elected U.S. Senator later that year from the state of Alabama. Recalling the event to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Kuhn believed that &quot;that afternoon...the idea of a lifetime baseball pass was discussed,&quot; and upon their return from Iran, each of the 52 hostages was given one of these unique passes.

===Curt Flood===

On October 7, 1969, the St. Louis Cardinals traded Curt Flood, catcher Tim McCarver, outfielder Byron Browne, and left-handed pitcher Joe Hoerner to the Philadelphia Phillies for first baseman Dick Allen, second baseman Cookie Rojas, and right-handed ace relief pitcher Jerry Johnson.

However, Flood refused to report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team&#x27;s poor record and the fact that they played in dilapidated Connie Mack Stadium and played in front of racist fans. Flood forfeited a relatively lucrative US$100,000 contract by his refusal to be traded to the Phillies.

In a letter to Kuhn, Flood demanded that the commissioner declare him a free agent.

====Flood&#x27;s letter to Kuhn====
&quot;December 24, 1969&quot;

====&quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot;====
Kuhn denied his request, citing the propriety of the reserve clause, which was language in contracts that essentially prevented a player from playing with another team even after his contract expired. In response, Flood filed a lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball on January 16, 1970, alleging that Major League Baseball had violated federal antitrust laws. Flood likened the reserve clause to slavery. It was a controversial analogy, even among those who opposed the reserve clause.

The case, &quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot; (407 U.S. 258) eventually went to the Supreme Court. Flood&#x27;s attorney, former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, asserted that the reserve clause depressed wages and limited players to one team for life. Major League Baseball&#x27;s counsel countered that Commissioner Kuhn acted in accordance with the rules, which were set up (and therefore his duty to uphold, in so many words) &#x27;&quot;for the good of the game.&quot;&quot;

Ultimately, the Supreme Court, acting on &quot;stare decisis&quot; &quot;to stand by things decided&quot;, ruled 5–3 in favor of Major League Baseball, upholding a 1922 ruling in the case of &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, (259 U.S. 200).

===Charles O. Finley===
Though he had a reputation as an owners&#x27; commissioner, Kuhn did not avoid confronting at least one owner whom he disliked. He was a major adversary of Oakland Athletics owner Charles O. Finley. A major embarrassment for baseball resulted from Finley&#x27;s actions during the 1973 World Series. Finley forced player Mike Andrews to sign a false affidavit saying he was injured after the reserve infielder committed two consecutive errors in the 12th inning of Oakland&#x27;s Game 2 loss to the New York Mets. Andrews&#x27;s teammates as well as manager Dick Williams rallied to his defense. Kuhn in response forced Finley to reinstate Andrews. In 1976, when Finley attempted to sell several players to the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees for $3.5 million, Kuhn blocked the deals on the grounds that they would be bad for the game. Kuhn&#x27;s decision may simply have been a revenge tactic aimed at Finley after he attempted to force an owners&#x27; vote to remove Kuhn as commissioner in 1975.

===Hank Aaron===
At the start of the 1974 season, Kuhn inadvertently got into the middle of a small controversy during Hank Aaron&#x27;s pursuit of Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 714 career home runs. Aaron&#x27;s Atlanta Braves opened the season on the road in Cincinnati with a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Braves management wanted him to break the record at home in Atlanta and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But Kuhn ruled that Aaron had to play two out of three. The result was that Aaron tied Ruth&#x27;s record in his very first at bat, but did not hit another home run in the series. Kuhn did not attend the game where Aaron broke the record, citing a previous engagement.

===Ted Turner===
In 1977, Kuhn battled the brash new owner of the Atlanta Braves, Ted Turner. Turner admitted that he had made remarks at a cocktail party about acquiring San Francisco Giants star Gary Matthews, at a time when Kuhn had ordered owners not to speak about potential free agents. Kuhn concluded that Turner&#x27;s statement was not in the &quot;best interest of baseball&quot; and fined Turner, suspended him from baseball for one year, and penalized his club with the loss of a draft choice. Turner sued but both the trial and appellate courts refused to grant Turner relief, emphasizing the limited-extent of judicial review over baseball and the commissioner&#x27;s office.

=== Melissa Ludtke case ===
In 1977, Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for &quot;Sports Illustrated,&quot; sued Kuhn and the baseball commission for access to the locker room of the New York Yankees. She was denied access to the Yankees clubhouse during the 1977 World Series and asserted her 14th amendment right was violated. She won her suit. The court stated her fourteenth amendment right was violated since the Yankees clubhouse was controlled by New York City. The court also stated that her fundamental right to pursue a career was violated based on her sex.

===Race===
When baseball writers came out in support of inducting Negro league players into the Hall of Fame, Kuhn supported recognizing the players in the Hall, but was unable to garner sufficient support from the Hall of Fame board of directors. As a compromise, Kuhn established a committee to select the greatest Negro leaguers, to be honored with a display at the museum in Cooperstown. Satchel Paige was selected as the initial inductee for the Negro leagues display.

The decision to honor the Negro leaguers with a separate exhibit received significant criticism. Sportswriter Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;They segregated the Hall of Fame! ... To have kept Satchel Paige from playing in the white leagues for 24 years and then bar him from the pearly gates on the grounds he didn&#x27;t play the required 10 years [in the major leagues] is a shocking bit of insolent cynicism, a disservice to America. What is this – 1840? Either let him in the front of the hall – or move the damn thing to Mississippi.&quot; Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League, commented, &quot;With another wing ... whatever good they&#x27;ve done, they&#x27;ve torn it down.&quot;

Kuhn, in his autobiography, claimed that he &quot;knew that the furor would be heard by the board of directors and that the public outcry would be hard to resist. That is exactly what happened.&quot; Within a few months, the Hall of Fame board of directors changed its mind and agreed to give Paige, and future honorees of the Negro leagues selection committee, full membership in the Hall.

Bill James, in his book &quot;The Politics of Glory: How Baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame Really Works&quot;, wrote that Kuhn seemed &quot;very proud of how he handled the affair, doing an end run around the Hall of Fame board of directors by exposing the Hall – and himself – to public criticism. Perhaps this does reflect some personal courage, and he was able to see that the right thing was done. But the Hall of Fame was also damaged. ... The message that got through to the public, loosely translated, was that the Hall of Fame was a racist institution. ... Bowie Kuhn would have been a better friend to the Hall of Fame if he had led them to come to terms with their institutional racism in private, rather than leading them to expose it to the public.&quot;

===Kuhn&#x27;s war on drugs===
After being in office for over ten years, Kuhn had grown a strong reputation for being hard on players who abused drugs. Kuhn was quick to punish players who used drugs with heavy fines and suspensions. Kansas City Royals catcher Darrell Porter told the Associated Press that during the winter of 1979–1980 he became paranoid, convinced that Kuhn knew about his drug abuse, was trying to sneak into his house, and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach, clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. Ironically, when Porter was named the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series while playing for the Cardinals, Kuhn was on hand to congratulate him.

In 1983, four players from the Kansas City Royals – Willie Wilson, Jerry Martin, Willie Aikens, and Vida Blue – were found guilty of cocaine use. In addition, such established stars as Ferguson Jenkins, Keith Hernandez, Dave Parker, and other veteran players such as Dale Berra, admitted to having problems with drugs. In 1980, during a customs search in Toronto, Ferguson Jenkins was found possessing 3.0 grams cocaine, 2.2 grams hashish, and 1.75 grams marijuana. In response, on September 8, Kuhn suspended him indefinitely. However, Jenkins&#x27; suspension lasted only two weeks before, in an unprecedented action, an independent arbiter reinstated him and he returned to the league. Jenkins was not further punished by MLB for the incident, as he remained active until his retirement following the 1983 season.
===Leaving office===
Kuhn was both praised and attacked for the firm stand that he levied against offenders. However, his hardline stand on PEDs and the 1981 strike caused most of the MLB owners to turn against him. In 1983, Kuhn and his supporters made a last-ditch effort to renew his contract but ultimately failed. The owners elected Peter Ueberroth as the sixth Commissioner of Baseball, however since Ueberroth was serving at the time as president of the organizing committee for the 1984 Summer Olympics Kuhn was allowed to remain Commissioner for the 1984 regular season before leaving office.

==Life after baseball==
Following baseball, Kuhn returned to the law firm of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher and assumed presidency of the Kent Group, a business, sports and financial consulting firm. Kuhn left Willkie, Farr &amp; Gallagher in 1987 to join with Harvey D. Myerson, a former senior partner in the firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey, to form the firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn. He also became an adviser and board member for Domino&#x27;s Pizza and the Ave Maria Foundation.

Kuhn had been a longtime resident of Ridgewood, New Jersey. According to an AP wire story, he partnered in a law firm with Harvey Myerson which subsequently went bankrupt and then sold his New Jersey home and moved to Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, because his home and other assets were shielded from the bankruptcy.

Kuhn became the Chairman of the Catholic Advisory Board of the Ave Maria Mutual Funds upon the inception of their first mutual fund, Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund, in May 2001. Bowie was a member of the Catholic organization for presidents and CEOs, Legatus, and was influential in chartering the Legatus chapter in Jacksonville, FL. Legatus later memorialized him for his dedication and service to the organization by establishing the &quot;Bowie Kuhn Award for Evangelization&quot;.

In July 2001, Kuhn appeared on an hour-long episode of The Journey Home, in which he explained the role that his Catholic faith had played in his life and career.

During a telecast of the 2004 World Series, broadcaster Joe Buck announced that just prior to his 78th birthday, Kuhn was scheduled to undergo open-heart surgery. He died on March 15, 2007, at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, after being hospitalized for several weeks with pneumonia.

Kuhn was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008, after having been elected by the Veterans Committee nine months after his death.

<text>Bret Sergeant Hart (born July 2, 1957) is a Canadian-American retired professional wrestler. A member of the Hart wrestling family and a second-generation wrestler, he has an amateur wrestling background at Ernest Manning High School and Mount Royal College. A major international draw within professional wrestling, he is credited with changing the perception of mainstream North American professional wrestling in the early 1990s by bringing technical wrestling to the fore. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; Sky Sports noted that his legacy is that of &quot;one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle&quot;. For the majority of his career, he used the nickname &quot;the Hitman&quot;.

Hart joined his father Stu Hart&#x27;s promotion Stampede Wrestling in 1976 as a referee and made his in-ring debut in 1978. He gained championship success during the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he helmed The Hart Foundation stable. He left for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) following the controversial &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot; in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 concussion, he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. He returned to sporadic in-ring competition from 2010 to 2011 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined the 2010 SummerSlam event, and served as the general manager of Raw. Throughout his career, He headlined WrestleMania IX, X, and XII, and headlined Starrcade in 1999. He was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame upon its inception in 1996, while still an active performer.

Hart held championship titles in five decades from the 1970s to the 2010s, 32 throughout his career and 17 between the WWF/WWE and WCW. Among other accolades, he is a seven-time world champion; a five-time WWF Champion and a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He went the most combined days as WWF Champion during the 1990s (654) and was the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion born outside the United States. He is the second WWF Triple Crown Champion and fifth (with Goldberg) WCW Triple Crown Champion, and the first man to win both the WWF and WCW Triple Crown Championships. He is also the 1994 Royal Rumble match winner (with Lex Luger), and the only two-time King of the Ring, winning the 1991 tournament and the first King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1993. Stone Cold Steve Austin, with whom he headlined multiple pay-per-view events as part of an acclaimed rivalry from 1996 to 1997, inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006. In 2019, he became one of seven people to enter the WWE Hall of Fame twice, when he was inducted again as a member of The Hart Foundation, with brother-in-law Jim Neidhart.

Outside of wrestling, Hart has appeared in numerous films and television shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as well as featuring in several documentaries, both about himself specifically and others about his family or the wrestling industry in general. He also helped found and lent his name to the major junior ice hockey team the Calgary Hitmen and has written two biographies along with a weekly column for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; for over a decade. After his retirement, he spent much of his time on charitable efforts concerning stroke recovery and cancer awareness, due to his experiences with the two.

== Early life ==
The eighth child of wrestling patriarch Stu Hart and his wife Helen, Bret Hart was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada into the Hart wrestling family. He is of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and of Irish descent through his maternal grandfather. His father was of Scottish, Irish and English ancestry. Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States since his mother Helen was born in New York. Hart has stated that he considers himself to be North American and that he is equally proud of his U.S. and Canadian nationality. His maternal grandfather was long-distance runner Harry Smith.

Hart grew up in a household with eleven siblings, seven brothers Smith, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Ross and Owen, as well as four sisters, Ellie, Georgia, Alison and Diana. As a child he was the closest with his older brother Dean who was the nearest to him in age of all his older brothers, being three years his senior. Together they would often fight with Bret&#x27;s two older sisters, Ellie, who was two years older, and Georgia, who was one year older. Hart&#x27;s family were non-denominational Christians, but he and all of his siblings were baptized by a local Catholic priest.

Hart spent the vast majority of his childhood in the Hart family mansion which was owned by his father. During one period his father was housing a bear known as Terrible Ted chained under the building, the bear had had all of its teeth removed and Hart would sometimes as a very young child let the bear lick ice cream off his toes since he thought it was a good way to keep them clean.

His introduction to professional wrestling came at an early age. As a child, he witnessed his father training future wrestlers like Superstar Billy Graham in the Dungeon, his household basement which served as a training room. Before school, Hart&#x27;s father, also a wrestling promoter, had him hand out fliers to local wrestling shows. In the 1998 documentary &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot;, Hart reflected on his father&#x27;s discipline, describing how Stu uttered morbid words while inflicting excruciating submission holds that left broken blood vessels in Bret&#x27;s eyes. Hart claimed his father had an otherwise pleasant demeanour.

Hart&#x27;s first work in wrestling involved pulling out lucky numbers out of a metal box during intermission at the Stampede Wrestling shows when he was four years old. When he got slightly older, he would sell programs to the shows, something all Hart&#x27;s seven brothers would do. He would often compete for customers with his little brother Ross since the fans would often want to buy from the youngest Hart child.

== Amateur wrestling ==
Like his father, Hart was an excellent amateur wrestler since an early age, having begun training as a nine-year-old. At Ernest Manning High School, Hart became a standout student in the amateur wrestling division. Hart has stated that he joined the wrestling team &quot;for the sole reason that my dad expected me to... no-one asked me to&quot;. He won significant championships in tournaments throughout Alberta, including the 1974 city championships in Calgary. He scored a victory over competitor Bob Eklund – who would go on to become a Canadian Interuniversity Sport national champion, winning &quot;Outstanding Wrestler of the Year 1980–1981&quot; – en route to the championship. He described his display of the medal to Stu as a &quot;powerful moment&quot;, and said his relationship with his father &quot;took a different direction from that point on&quot;. Hart considered the medals to be one of his most prized possessions.

By 1977, Hart was collegiate champion at Mount Royal College, where he was studying filmmaking; his coaches and other people around him felt that he had shown sufficient promise to compete at the following year&#x27;s Commonwealth Games and encouraged him to begin training for the event. He began to find amateur wrestling unrewarding amid injuries and fluctuating weight. Stu still believed his son capable of making it to the Olympic or Commonwealth Games if he put forth the effort. Bret said he believed that even if he became an exceptionally successful amateur wrestler, it would not have led to a career that interested him, rather one as a wrestling coach or high school gym teacher.

Hart felt the only way to give up amateur wrestling without disappointing his father was to become a professional wrestler. His college grades became poorer as his interest in filmmaking waned; he dedicated himself to professional wrestling and began training with his father&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling promotion. Hart has spoken of how helpful his amateur background was in his professional wrestling career, and also of what a positive effect amateur wrestling has on junior high school and high school-aged boys in terms of building self-confidence.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Stampede Wrestling (1976–1984) ===
In 1976, Hart began working for his father&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling promotion in Calgary. Hart first began helping the promotion by refereeing matches. At a 1978 event in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a wrestler was unable to perform his match, forcing Stu to ask his son to stand in as a replacement. Before long, he became a regular contender, eventually partnering with brother Keith to win the Stampede International Tag Team Championship four times.

Hart gained some of his most prominent experience with Japanese combatants and real-life trainers Mr. Hito and Mr. Sakurada. Hart also had high-impact matches against Tom Billington, who was better known by his in-ring name as the Dynamite Kid. In the midst of wrestling alongside his family, Hart made a point not to ride on the shoulders of his elders. Hart faithfully jobbed as requested of him, taking pride in the believability of his performances. As he said himself, &quot;No one could take a shit-kicking like Bret Hart&quot;. Although he dreaded partaking in interviews and speaking in front of a crowd, Hart went on to win the promotion&#x27;s top titles, including two British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championships, five International Tag Team Championships, and six North American Heavyweight Championships. Hart also wrestled Tiger Mask in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), a promotion for whom he often wrestled during the early to mid-1980s. He remained one of Stampede&#x27;s most successful performers until the promotion, along with several wrestlers, was acquired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in August 1984.

=== World Wrestling Federation ===

==== The Hart Foundation (1984–1991) ====

Hart was asked to start out in the WWF as a singles wrestler with a cowboy gimmick but refused, stating that in Calgary, &quot;if you called yourself a cowboy, you&#x27;d better be one&quot;. He made his televised WWF debut on August 29, 1984, in a tag team match where he teamed with the Dynamite Kid. On September 11, in Poughkeepsie, New York, Hart defeated Aldo Marino in his televised debut singles match, which aired on the September 29 episode of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;. In 1985, after acquiring the nickname of &quot;Hit Man&quot;, he requested to join Jimmy Hart&#x27;s heel stable, The Hart Foundation, which included brother-in-law Jim Neidhart. Bret began to increasingly team with Neidhart, in order to build the promotion&#x27;s tag team division. The &quot;Hart Foundation&quot; name then became exclusive to Bret, Neidhart and manager Jimmy Hart, due to the similar family names of both team members and their manager. Bret&#x27;s agile, technical style – which earned him the moniker &quot;The Excellence of Execution&quot; (coined by Gorilla Monsoon) – created a contrast with his partner Neidhart&#x27;s strength and brawling skills. During this time, Hart began wearing his signature sunglasses, initially to conceal his nervousness during promos. Hart considers his microphone work to have been a weakness throughout his early career.

In 1986, Hart began his first singles program with Ricky Steamboat, and in a singles match originally planned for WrestleMania 2, he lost to Steamboat at the Boston Garden on March 8, 1986, which would be included on Hart&#x27;s 2005 DVD as one of his all-time favourite matches. At WrestleMania 2, Hart instead participated in a 20-man battle royal which was eventually won by André the Giant. He lost to Steamboat again on the July 28, 1986, episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;. Hart headlined his first televised WWF card when he beat Ray Rougeau, of The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, in the main event of the November 3, 1986, episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;.

The Hart Foundation won their first of two WWF Tag Team Championship on the February 7, 1987, episode of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; when they defeated The British Bulldogs. They then teamed with Danny Davis to face The British Bulldogs and Tito Santana at WrestleMania III. They won the match when Davis pinned Davey Boy Smith after hitting him with Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone.

The Hart Foundation adopted the nickname, &quot;The Pink and Black Attack&quot;, which Hart continued to use after the tag team&#x27;s disbandment. This was in reference to the team&#x27;s ring attire, as well as Hart&#x27;s signature mirrored sunglasses, which he would routinely give away to a young audience member before matches, following his face turn in 1988. As Hart&#x27;s WWF career progressed, he increasingly described himself as &quot;The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be&quot; (derived from the 1984 film &quot;The Natural&quot;), which he would later justify through three claims: he never injured an opponent through any fault of his own; through the entire course of his career, he missed only one show (as a result of flight difficulties); and that he only once refused to lose a match – his final WWF match with long-time adversary Shawn Michaels at the Survivor Series event in 1997, which culminated in the Montreal Screwjob.
The Hart Foundation lost the WWF Tag Team Championship titles to Strike Force on the October 27 episode of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;. Hart subsequently competed in his most high-profile singles contest to date on the November 28, 1987, episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XIII&quot;, when he faced &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage in a losing effort. He began 1988 with a decisive victory over Paul Roma of The Young Stallions (who had scored an upset victory over The Hart Foundation the previous year) on the January 11 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, and, at the Royal Rumble in January 1988, was the first entrant in the inaugural Royal Rumble match. He lasted 25 minutes and 42 seconds before being eliminated by Don Muraco.

Entered into another battle royal at WrestleMania IV, Hart was again one of the final two combatants as he was enlisted by former frequent Stampede opponent Bad News Brown to eliminate Junkyard Dog before Brown turned on Hart, eliminating him to win the event. This turned Hart back into a fan favourite and triggered a feud between the two. Neidhart soon came to Hart&#x27;s side in the feud, but manager Jimmy Hart discouraged the feud, leading to a fallout between the team and manager. This led to matches pitting Hart against Davis and also his first singles championship opportunity, in which he challenged The Honky Tonk Man for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the July 18 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, with the match ending in a double countout. As relations between the Harts and their former mentor further deteriorated, Jimmy Hart assisted tag team champions Demolition in a successful defence of their belts against the Harts at SummerSlam in August 1988, before enlisting old enemies The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, who had recently turned heel, to resume their feud with the Harts.

At the Royal Rumble in January 1989, The Hart Foundation teamed with Jim Duggan to defeat the Rougeaus and Dino Bravo. They also defeated Greg Valentine and The Honky Tonk Man, who were also managed by Jimmy Hart, at WrestleMania V. At an event in Milan on April 8, 1989, broadcast live on Tele+2, André the Giant requested to work a singles match with Hart, who lost the match, which was later released on his 2013 DVD set, &quot;The Dungeon Collection&quot;, but considered André&#x27;s praise and encouragement after the match to be of key importance in his singles career. He wrestled his first pay-per-view singles match on October 10, losing to Dino Bravo in the first British WWF pay-per-view, which was held at the London Arena and broadcast on Sky Television (Hart was in fact booked to win the match, but incurred a broken sternum, causing an unplanned countout loss).

At SummerSlam in August 1989, The Hart Foundation lost a non-title match against then WWF Tag Team Champions The Brain Busters. In the first televised contest of a rivalry that would span Hart&#x27;s WWF and WCW careers, he lost to Mr. Perfect on the November 6, 1989, episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, when Perfect pulled Hart&#x27;s tights during a roll-up. In their first ever singles meeting, Shawn Michaels and Hart wrestled to a double countout on the February 11, 1990, episode of the &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;.

After participating at the Royal Rumble in January 1990, The Hart Foundation defeated The Bolsheviks in 19 seconds at WrestleMania VI and began feuding with Demolition, who had just won the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Colossal Connection at WrestleMania VI. At SummerSlam in 1990, The Hart Foundation began their second, and final, WWF Tag Team Championship reign by defeating Demolition members Crush and Smash in a two out of three falls match with some help from Legion of Doom. On October 30, the Hart Foundation lost the title to The Rockers (Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels), but a few days later, President Jack Tunney reversed the decision and the win was never acknowledged on television. The Hart Foundation&#x27;s reign lasted until WrestleMania VII, where they lost to The Nasty Boys, after which the team split.

==== Intercontinental Champion (1991–1992) ====
Hart won his first WWF Intercontinental Championship by defeating Mr. Perfect with the Sharpshooter at SummerSlam in 1991, and subsequently won the 1991 King of the Ring tournament on September 7, 1991, at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Hart&#x27;s first pay-per-view title defense occurred at This Tuesday in Texas, where he beat the undefeated Skinner.

In January 1992, Hart was placed in a feud with Jacques Rougeau, who by now was wrestling as &quot;The Mountie&quot; and using the gimmick of a power-hungry, corrupt member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This feud, the first for Hart and Rougeau as singles competitors, came about when the Mountie&#x27;s manager, Jimmy Hart, threw water on Hart, and The Mountie proceeded to shock Hart with a cattle prod. On January 17, 1992, Hart dropped the Intercontinental Championship to The Mountie. Following the loss, Roddy Piper defeated Mountie with a sleeper hold two days later at the 1992 Royal Rumble, and Bret later pinned Piper for his second Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania VIII later that year, making him the first wrestler in the WWF – and one of few wrestlers ever – to pin Piper&#x27;s shoulders to the mat. At a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping on July 21, 1992, Hart defeated Shawn Michaels, with the Intercontinental Championship belt suspended above the ring, in the WWF&#x27;s first ever ladder match. Hart dropped the Intercontinental Championship to his brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith, in Hart&#x27;s first WWF pay-per-view main event at SummerSlam in August 1992, held before over 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers voted it the &quot;Match of the Year&quot;, and WWE named the match as the greatest in the history of SummerSlam. Upon induction into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006, Hart cited the contest as his favourite match of his career.

==== WWF Champion (1992–1996) ====

Hart won the WWF Championship from Ric Flair at a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping at Saskatchewan Place in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on October 12 of that year, in a match not originally broadcast on WWF television – the match was instead made available on a series of Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases. Hart dislocated one of the fingers on his left hand during the match and popped it back in himself so it would not affect the rest of the match. He made successful title defenses against Kamala, The Berzerker and Papa Shango. He would headline his first pay-per-view as champion with a successful title defense against Shawn Michaels at the 1992 Survivor Series, and defeated Razor Ramon at the 1993 Royal Rumble. He would also defend the title against contenders such as Papa Shango and former champion Ric Flair before losing the title to Yokozuna in his first WrestleMania main event at WrestleMania IX, after interference from Mr. Fuji. Fuji then challenged Hulk Hogan, who had come out to help Hart, to compete for the title; Hogan then won his fifth WWF Championship from Yokozuna. In June, Hart won the first pay-per-view King of the Ring tournament, defeating Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, and Bam Bam Bigelow, thus becoming the only two-time King of the Ring. According to Hart, he was scheduled to regain the WWF Championship from Hulk Hogan at SummerSlam, but Hogan chose to drop the title to Yokozuna instead at King of the Ring. Hart instead entered a feud with Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, who interrupted Hart&#x27;s coronation, claimed he was the only king, attacked Hart and began a barrage against Hart and his family. The two met at SummerSlam in 1993, to determine the &quot;Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation&quot;. Hart originally won the match by submission, via the Sharpshooter, but as he would not let go of the hold, the decision was reversed to a Lawler victory by disqualification. Hart and his younger brother, Owen Hart, would also feud with Lawler during 1993 in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with Lawler notably defeating Owen for Owen&#x27;s USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship. Hart&#x27;s feud with Lawler was named &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, and voted &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; by readers of &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;.

After months of dealing with Lawler, Hart received a WrestleMania IX rematch with WWF Champion Yokozuna on the November 20 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;. When Bret appeared to have the match won, with Yokozuna locked in the sharpshooter, Owen came to ringside to congratulate his brother. The referee began questioning Owen&#x27;s motives, which allowed Fuji to assault Bret. Owen then involved himself in the match, resulting in a victory for Yokozuna via disqualification. On the non-televised but now-canon November 22 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Hart again challenged Yokozuna for the WWF Championship, and again failed to regain the championship due to similar involvement from Owen. The brothers&#x27; disagreements set the wheels in motion for a family feud that would span the entirety of 1994. At Survivor Series, the Harts (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) took on Shawn Michaels (a substitution for Lawler, who was facing legal troubles) and his knights. The Harts won the match, with all of the brothers surviving except for Owen, the only Hart family member eliminated when he was rolled up by Michaels after inadvertently knocking Bret off the apron. Bitter about his elimination, Owen blamed Bret for this and in the weeks ahead, blamed Bret for holding him back. Owen demanded a one-on-one match with Bret, which Bret refused to accept. In the storyline, Bret, along with his parents, worked over the Christmas holidays to reunite the family and to settle their rivalry. Bret was voted &quot;WWF Superstar of the Year&quot; 1993 by fans, as well as the greatest wrestler of the year by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers.
At the Royal Rumble in January, Bret and Owen took on The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Referee Tim White stopped the match after he considered Bret unable to continue after he sustained a kayfabe knee injury during the match. After the match, Owen berated his brother for costing him a title opportunity and attacked the injured knee, setting the feud between the two. Later on, Hart managed to participate and win the 1994 Royal Rumble match amid controversy. Hart and Lex Luger were the final two participants and the two were eliminated over the top rope at the same time. Therefore, both men were named co-winners of the 1994 Royal Rumble match and received title shots at WrestleMania X. Luger won the chance to face Yokozuna first, with Hart having to wrestle his brother Owen, before receiving his title shot. Hart lost his match against Owen but went on to defeat Yokozuna for his second WWF Championship.

Hart continued to feud with his brother Owen while he also started feuding with Diesel. Hart&#x27;s friend and former tag team partner Jim Neidhart returned to the WWF and reunited with Hart. At King of the Ring, Hart defended the WWF Championship against Diesel. When Hart was winning the match, Shawn Michaels interfered on Diesel&#x27;s behalf; Diesel appeared close to victory after he delivered a Jackknife Powerbomb yet before he could pin Hart, Neidhart interfered, therefore Diesel won by disqualification, but Hart retained his title. Neidhart left when Diesel and Michaels attacked Hart following the match. Neidhart&#x27;s motivation was made clear when he helped Owen win the tournament that night, so that he could receive a title shot against his brother. At SummerSlam, Hart successfully retained the WWF Championship against Owen in a steel cage match. This match received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer of &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, and the brothers&#x27; feud was voted &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; by readers of &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;.

Hart eventually lost his WWF Championship at Survivor Series in a submission match against Bob Backlund where the manager of either competitor (Davey Boy Smith for Hart, Owen for Backlund) would have to &quot;throw in the towel&quot; for the wrestler they were representing. When Hart was in Backlund&#x27;s crossface chickenwing and Davey Boy was kayfabe knocked out, Owen persuaded his mother Helen to throw in the towel for Hart, giving Backlund the championship victory. Bret&#x27;s feud with Backlund would continue into the following year. He was voted the greatest wrestler of 1994 by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers, winning the vote for the second straight year.
Three days after Hart&#x27;s title loss, Diesel defeated Backlund in eight seconds with a jackknife powerbomb to become the new WWF Champion. By 1995, Hart was focusing on projects outside the business, such as acting, and shifted to the number two face in the company, behind Diesel. Hart challenged for Diesel&#x27;s WWF Championship at the 1995 Royal Rumble, in a match that was continually marred by outside interference and ruled a draw. Both men embraced in a display of sportsmanship after the match. In a rematch from Survivor Series, Hart defeated Bob Backlund in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at WrestleMania XI. Hart was critical with the match against Backlund, claiming it was &quot;probably my worst pay-per-view match I ever had&quot;. Hart would be the focal point of the first event in the In Your House pay-per-view series, competing in two matches at In Your House 1. He defeated Hakushi in the first match of the in Your House series. Hart&#x27;s acclaimed feud with Jerry Lawler was reignited at the event when Lawler defeated Hart due to Hakushi&#x27;s (now Lawler&#x27;s protégé) interference. Hart beat Lawler in a &quot;Kiss My Foot&quot; match at King of the Ring, and defeated Lawler&#x27;s kayfabe dentist, Isaac Yankem, by disqualification at SummerSlam 1995. Their King of the Ring match ended with Hart shoving his foot into Lawler&#x27;s mouth, then forcing Lawler to kiss his own foot. Although Hart was victorious in their in-ring feud, Lawler remained strongly opposed to Hart as a commentator, and would routinely encourage Hart&#x27;s opponents during matches; it would not be until Over the Limit, sixteen years later, that both men would finally bury the hatchet. After disposing of Lawler, Hart engaged in a three-month feud with Jean-Pierre Lafitte, who would be stealing the mirrored sunglasses from fans at ringside and his trademark leather jacket. At In Your House 3, Hart defeated Lafitte, to end the feud. Hart shifted his focus back to the WWF Championship, defeating Diesel in a no disqualification match at Survivor Series to commence his third reign.

In a rematch from their SummerSlam 1992 encounter, Hart successfully defended his title against the now heel Davey Boy Smith at In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings. He lost to The Undertaker by disqualification at the 1996 Royal Rumble when Diesel interfered, ultimately retaining the WWF Championship, and defeated The Undertaker by disqualification in a rematch on the February 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, again due to Diesel&#x27;s interference. Hart retained his title once again against Diesel in a steel cage match at In Your House 6, and defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley, who was undefeated on &quot;Raw&quot;, on the March 4 episode of the show. WWF Commissioner Rowdy Roddy Piper ruled that Hart would face Shawn Michaels, who had earned a WWF Championship match at WrestleMania XII by winning the Royal Rumble, in a 60-minute Iron Man match at the event. The wrestler with the most decisions during the 60 minutes would win the match and the WWF Championship.

At WrestleMania, with less than a minute left on the clock and the score still 0–0, Michaels jumped from the middle rope; his legs were caught by Hart, and Hart locked in his Sharpshooter. Michaels did not submit in the last 30 seconds, so the match ended in a tie. WWF President Gorilla Monsoon ruled that the match would continue in sudden death overtime. Michaels hit a superkick to win the championship. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers voted it the &quot;Match of the Year&quot;; in 2004, WWE fans voted the match as the greatest in the history of WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Hart went on a European tour over the next two weeks, coming out victorious against Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hunter Hearst Helmsley. The tour ended on April 22, and after this he took his hiatus from television. His final televised appearance was an interview taped while on the European tour in which he described his passion for wrestling was diminished and stated that although there were offers from competing companies, he might be finished with wrestling.

That fall, Hart would indeed receive competing offers of employment from both WWF and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). WCW presented a 3-year, $9M contract offer to Hart, while the World Wrestling Federation responded with an unprecedented 20-year contract. Finishing up his original WWF deal, Hart returned to action on a tour of South Africa on September 8, 1996, defeating Davey Boy Smith in Durban. On October 21, Hart elected to re-sign with the World Wrestling Federation. He was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame Class of 1996.

==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1996–1997) ====
Over the summer, Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was fresh from winning the 1996 King of the Ring, continually taunted Hart and challenged him to come back and have a match. After an eight-month hiatus from television, Hart returned and defeated Austin at Survivor Series in a match for the number one contender spot to the WWF Championship. Hart challenged champion Sycho Sid at the following month&#x27;s In Your House 12: It&#x27;s Time; Shawn Michaels, who was serving as a guest commentator at ringside, accidentally cost Hart the victory when he attempted to become involved in the match after being assaulted by Sid. The building tension between Hart and Michaels climaxed after the match when Hart assaulted Michaels. Hart&#x27;s feud with Austin escalated at the Royal Rumble, when Hart tossed Austin out of the ring, only for Austin (unbeknownst to the referees) to climb back into the ring and win the Royal Rumble match, while the referees were distracted by Mankind. Hart quit the WWF the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; in protest. In order to deal with this controversy, a Fatal Four-Way between Austin and the participants he eliminated after re-entering the ring (Vader, The Undertaker, and Hart) was set up for In Your House 13: Final Four, with the winner becoming the number one contender. After then-champion Shawn Michaels relinquished the belt, though, the match officially became for the WWF Championship. Hart defeated Austin, Vader, and The Undertaker in the Fatal Four-Way. Austin ensured Hart&#x27;s fourth reign was short-lived, costing him a title match against Sid the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;. Hart challenged for Sid&#x27;s WWF Championship in a steel cage match shortly before WrestleMania 13, which saw Austin actually attempt to help Hart win, in order to make their scheduled match at WrestleMania 13 a title match. Concurrently, The Undertaker, who had a scheduled title match with Sid at WrestleMania, attempted to help Sid win. Sid ultimately retained, leading to a pure grudge match for Hart and Austin. Following his loss to Sid, Hart shoved Vince McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview, and engaged in a worked shoot, expletive-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This incident has been cited as one which helped lay the foundations of the WWF&#x27;s Attitude Era, as well as the starting point of McMahon&#x27;s on-air character, the tyrannical WWF owner &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot;.

At WrestleMania 13, Hart and Austin had their rematch in a submission match that would later get a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer. In the end, Hart locked the Sharpshooter on a bloody Austin, who refused to give up. In fact, Austin never quit, but passed out from the blood loss and pain. Ken Shamrock, the special guest referee, awarded Hart the match, after which he continued to assault Austin, thus turning heel for the first time since 1988. It was named &quot;Match of the Year&quot; by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; and voted &quot;Match of the Year&quot; by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers. Later that night, Hart confronted Sycho Sid and The Undertaker prior to their match for the WWF Championship; Hart insulted Undertaker and told Shawn Michaels (who was a guest commentator for the match) not to interfere. Undertaker won the match, which ended with Hart hot shotting Sid on the ropes, therefore costing him the title.

Hart challenged Rocky Maivia for the Intercontinental Championship in the main event of the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Rocky Maivia won by disqualification when Hart refused to release a figure-four leglock applied around the ring post. He faced Austin again in the main event of In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, to determine who would challenge the WWF Champion Undertaker in a title match at the following month&#x27;s In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell. Austin had Hart locked in his own finishing move, the Sharpshooter, in the middle of the ring when The British Bulldog interfered on Hart&#x27;s behalf, resulting in disqualification and giving Austin the victory and title match. They met once again in a street fight on the April 21 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, in which Austin injured Hart&#x27;s ankle with a steel chair. The match was ruled a no-contest and Austin afterward continued to beat Hart while on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance.
In the ensuing weeks, Hart denounced American fans, because of their negative reaction to him in the recent weeks in contrast to his continued popularity through the rest of the world and reunited with brother Owen and brothers-in-law Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart. The family members formed a new Hart Foundation with Brian Pillman; this incarnation was an anti-American stable which was popular within Canada and Europe. As the leader of this stable, Hart routinely carried a Canadian flag to the ring and engaged in promos where he declared the superiority of his home nation; he became so despised by U.S. audiences that they would often throw debris during his ring entrances, interviews, and matches. He was voted by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers as the &quot;Most Hated Wrestler of the Year&quot; in 1997. At In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede, in Hart&#x27;s home town of Calgary, the Hart Foundation defeated the team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and The Legion of Doom, representing the United States, in a ten-man tag team match main event. The Canada vs. U.S. rivalry escalated on the July 21 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Bret, Owen, and Davey Boy Smith, representing Canada and the Hart Foundation, defeated the team of Dude Love, Austin, and The Undertaker, representing the U.S., in a Flag match. The Hart Foundation&#x27;s feud with Austin was named &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; and voted &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; by readers of &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. Hart vowed that if he could not defeat The Undertaker for the WWF Championship at SummerSlam, he would never wrestle in the United States again. The Undertaker agreed to the match, and Hart won his fifth and last WWF Championship after spitting in guest referee Shawn Michaels&#x27; face; Michaels swung a steel chair in retaliation, which accidentally struck the Undertaker. Michaels, who, as part of another pre-match stipulation, would be banned from wrestling in the United States if he did not remain impartial as referee, had no option but to count the pinfall, giving his rival Hart the victory.

After SummerSlam, Michaels was pushed as the top heel in the company and negative fan reactions toward Hart in the United States softened somewhat, as he declared: &quot;I&#x27;m not so much anti-American as I am just very, very pro-Canadian.&quot; In real life, Hart did not like the new Attitude Era, instead preferring traditional values. This was used as part of his character, as Hart would insult the U.S. fans because of the success of the Attitude Era. Hart successfully defended his title against The Patriot, with whom Hart had become involved in a feud as part of the Canada vs. U.S. storyline, at Ground Zero: In Your House, avenging a loss to him on the July 28 &quot;Raw&quot;. The Canada vs. U.S. feud would conclude at Badd Blood: In Your House, where Hart and Davey Boy Smith, representing Canada and The Hart Foundation, defeated The Patriot and Vader, representing the U.S., in a Flag match. Erstwhile, in a rematch from SummerSlam, The Undertaker challenged Hart for the WWF Championship at One Night Only; after reversing a Tombstone Piledriver attempt from Hart, The Undertaker dumped Hart on the apron when he would not let go of the ropes. As a result, Hart&#x27;s neck was caught in the ropes, and The Undertaker was disqualified. Hart later cited this as his favourite of all his matches with The Undertaker, and his last great match in the WWF.

In September 1997, Hart faced Terry Funk at Terry Funk&#x27;s WrestleFest in what was billed as Funk&#x27;s retirement match.

During the Hart Foundation&#x27;s feud with the Shawn Michaels-led D-Generation X (DX), DX framed the Hart Foundation in vandalizing the locker room of the African American stable, Nation of Domination with racist motifs. In retaliation, during a promo with DX, Hart called members Triple H (previously billed as &quot;Hunter Hearst Helmsley&quot;) and Shawn Michaels &quot;homos&quot;. Hart later apologized for his participation in the storyline and said that he had been pressured into it, saying, &quot;I am not in any shape or form a racist. And I don&#x27;t believe it is anything to kid around about. I also want to apologize for any remarks I made about gay people. It was a stupid mistake on my part&quot;. Hart successfully defended his title against Nation of Domination leader, Faarooq, on the October 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. In his penultimate title defence, Hart wrestled Ken Shamrock to a no-contest on the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;; while the referee was knocked out, Shamrock put Hart in an ankle lock; members of the Hart Foundation then attacked Shamrock until Shawn Michaels made the save for Shamrock and attacked Hart.

==== The Montreal Screwjob and departure (1997) ====
Around this time, Hart&#x27;s on-air rivalry with Vince McMahon also escalated. A heated ringside altercation between the two led many fans to dislike McMahon, who at the time was being exposed as owner of the WWF more and more frequently on-air. Although Hart had signed a 20-year contract back in 1996, the WWF was in a rough financial position by late 1997 and could no longer afford to honour the contract. Although Hart was arguably the biggest wrestler in the world during the mid-1990s, McMahon also felt that the value of his character was beginning to wane, and he encouraged Hart to approach World Championship Wrestling (WCW) about a contract, hopefully one similar to their original offer. This was despite Hart&#x27;s reluctance to leave the WWF and willingness to re-negotiate. Hart subsequently signed a three-year contract with WCW. His final match with the WWF would be a title match against his real-life rival Shawn Michaels at Survivor Series in Montreal. Hart did not want to end his WWF career with a loss to Michaels in his home country particularly with the context of their nationality-fueled feud; and offered to lose, forfeit or otherwise give over the belt to Michaels in any other way that McMahon wanted. McMahon agreed to Hart&#x27;s idea of forfeiting the championship the next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; or losing it a few weeks later.

Although Hart stated to McMahon he would not take the WWF Championship with him to WCW television and despite insistence from then-WCW President Eric Bischoff that Hart would join WCW with a &quot;clean slate&quot;, McMahon was still concerned and paranoid; this led to him breaking his word in what eventually came to be known as the Montreal Screwjob. Even though Hart did not submit to the Sharpshooter, referee Earl Hebner called for the bell as if he had, on McMahon&#x27;s orders. This resulted in Hart &quot;losing&quot; the WWF Championship to Michaels. The night ended with an irate Hart spitting in McMahon&#x27;s face, destroying television equipment, and punching McMahon backstage in front of Gerald Brisco, Pat Patterson, and McMahon&#x27;s son Shane. Hart also confronted Michaels backstage about the match finish. Many behind-the-scenes events leading up to the Montreal Screwjob were filmed for the documentary &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot;, released in 1998. WWE has described the Montreal Screwjob as &quot;arguably the most controversial, most jarring moment in the annals of sports entertainment&quot;.

Hart&#x27;s likeness would continue to be featured in WWF media into 1998, including the title video of &quot;Raw&quot; (brawling in a ring within a warehouse), action figure for Slammers Series 1 and the &quot;WWF War Zone&quot; video game.

=== World Championship Wrestling ===

==== United States Heavyweight Champion (1997–1999) ====
Hart&#x27;s three-year contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) included a salary of $2.5 million per year (a $1 million annual increase from his WWF contract), as well as a light schedule and a measure of creative control over his television character. A day after the WWF&#x27;s Survivor Series pay-per-view, Eric Bischoff, while with the New World Order (nWo), announced that Hart was going to be coming to WCW and joining the nWo. Hart made his debut on &quot;Nitro&quot; on December 15, 1997. He was also heavily involved in that month&#x27;s Starrcade pay-per-view. Due to a 60-day no-compete clause from the WWF, he served as the special guest referee for the match between Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko; during the Sting versus Hollywood Hogan main event for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, he stepped in toward the conclusion of the match as impromptu referee, declaring Sting the winner and new champion by submission, establishing Hart as a face in the process. In January, his no-compete clause expired, and his first feud in WCW was against Ric Flair, as both wrestlers considered themselves the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Hart defeated Flair at Souled Out in his first WCW match. After this, Hart elected to defend the honour of WCW against the nWo, defeating members Brian Adams in his debut &quot;Nitro&quot; match on March 2, and Curt Hennig at Uncensored. In April 1998, Hart interfered in a &quot;Nitro&quot; main event between Hollywood Hogan and Randy Savage, helping Hogan recapture the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel in the process. He became an associate of the nWo, but did not officially join the group.
Hart competed in his second &quot;Nitro&quot; match on June 22, defeating Chris Benoit with assistance from nWo members: Hart had attempted to recruit his long-time friend into the nWo, but the offer was rejected. At Bash at the Beach, Hart competed in his first championship match in WCW when he faced Booker T for the WCW World Television Championship. He was disqualified after hitting Booker with a steel chair. He headlined his first &quot;Nitro&quot; card on July 20, defeating Diamond Dallas Page for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship, with assistance from nWo member, The Giant. On the August 10 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hart lost his title to Lex Luger. He regained it from Luger the next night on &quot;Thunder&quot;. In the main event of Fall Brawl, Hart was defeated in a WarGames match for the No. 1 contender spot to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

Hart subsequently asked the fans for forgiveness, pretending to turn his back on Hogan and the nWo. A match between Hart and Hogan was booked for the September 28 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. During the match, Hart sustained a knee injury, with the bout ending in a no-contest; Sting came to Hart&#x27;s aid and initiated a match with Hogan. Hart turned on Sting, delivering a DDT, and this bout was also ruled a no-contest. Sting, a member of the rival nWo Wolfpac, was assaulted after the match; this betrayal began an intense feud between Hart and Sting. On the October 12 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Sting and The Warrior beat Hart and Hogan by disqualification. Hart&#x27;s feud with Sting ended at Halloween Havoc with Hart controversially defending the United States Heavyweight Championship and (kayfabe) injuring Sting. On the October 26 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hart lost the title to Diamond Dallas Page. The two headlined the following month&#x27;s World War 3 pay-per-view in a title match which Hart lost. Hart regained the title from Page on the November 30 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; in a No Disqualification match with help from The Giant.

On the February 8, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hart lost the United States Heavyweight Championship to family friend Roddy Piper. On the March 29 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; held at Toronto&#x27;s Air Canada Centre, Hart appeared in street clothes and derided WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair, as well as Hogan, for avoiding a match with him. Finally, he called out &quot;franchise player&quot; Goldberg, claiming he could beat him in five minutes and verbally coercing Goldberg into giving him the spear. Hart was wearing a metal breastplate under his Toronto Maple Leafs jersey, which resulted in Goldberg being knocked out. Hart then counted his own pinfall over Goldberg&#x27;s unconscious body and announced over the mic: &quot;Hey Bischoff, and the WCW, I quit!&quot; In reality, he had sustained a groin injury at the hands of Dean Malenko in November and needed time off for surgery.

On May 23, 1999, the night before Hart was scheduled to make an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to hype his imminent WCW return, his brother Owen Hart died in an accident during a WWF pay-per-view. Hart took a further four months off from WCW to be with his family.

Hart returned to wrestling on the September 13, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; in a tag team match with Hulk Hogan against Sting and Lex Luger, reestablishing himself as a face in the process. On the October 4 &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hart defeated Chris Benoit in a special &quot;Owen Hart Tribute Match&quot; at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri, where Owen had died that previous May. Hart challenged for Sting&#x27;s WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the October 18 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, but lost the match when he was attacked by Luger. Due to controversy over a series of WCW World Heavyweight Championship matches between Sting, Hogan, and Goldberg at Halloween Havoc, the title was declared vacant. A tournament then took place over several episodes of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Hart&#x27;s first round match came against Goldberg the night after Halloween Havoc, with the bout being a tournament match for a berth in the next round, as well as being a match for the United States Heavyweight Championship that Goldberg had won the night before. Thanks to outside interference by Sid Vicious and The Outsiders, Hart defeated Goldberg and won the U.S. Heavyweight Championship for the fourth time. On the November 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hart lost the title to Scott Hall in a ladder match that also involved Sid Vicious and Goldberg.

==== World Heavyweight Champion and injury (1999–2000) ====
Hart won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship tournament by defeating Perry Saturn, Billy Kidman, Sting, and Chris Benoit at Mayhem. On December 7, Hart and Goldberg won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Creative Control, making Hart a double champion. Hart and Goldberg lost the tag team titles to The Outsiders on the December 13 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. At Starrcade, Hart defended his WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg. During the match, Hart was struck with a thrust kick to the head, resulting in a severe concussion. Hart later speculated that he may have suffered up to three additional concussions within matches over the course of that day along with the days immediately following Starrcade, having been unaware of the severity of his injuries. For example, Hart placed Goldberg on the post in a figure four leglock which ended with Hart hitting his head on the concrete floor when Goldberg failed to receive the move correctly. The sum total of those injuries left Hart with post-concussion syndrome and ultimately forced his retirement from professional wrestling. Hart later claimed that Goldberg &quot;had a tendency to injure everyone he worked with&quot;. As part of his DVD documentary, Hart expressed regret that &quot;someone as good-hearted as Bill Goldberg&quot; was responsible for hurting him. Referee Roddy Piper rang the bell when Hart held Goldberg in the Sharpshooter, although Goldberg did not submit. Piper simply walked away, leaving both Goldberg and Hart bewildered.

Out of respect for Goldberg, Hart vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the December 20 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and suggested that he, without the championship advantage, face Goldberg that night to determine the true champion. During the match, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash came to the ring looking to attack Goldberg with baseball bats. Hart convinced them to stop, then hit Goldberg with one of the bats, turning heel once again. The three continued to beat down Goldberg and were eventually joined by Jeff Jarrett. Hart regained the championship, even though it was Roddy Piper who was covering Goldberg (to try and protect him) when the three count was made. The nWo was reformed (now billed as &quot;nWo 2000&quot;). Hart wrestled Terry Funk to a no contest in a non-title, hardcore rules match on the January 6 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;. In his final match in WCW, he defended the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Nash on the January 10 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which also ended in a no contest. Hart vacated the title in late January 2000 when he was forced to withdraw from the main event of WCW&#x27;s Souled Out due to his injuries. Hart continued to make appearances on WCW television, generally cutting promos. On the May 3 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Hart made a run in during an over the top rope battle royal where he hit Hogan with a chair. His final WCW appearance occurred on the September 6, 2000, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, in a promo where he confronted Goldberg on the injury he sustained nine months prior. WCW terminated Hart&#x27;s contract via FedEx letter on October 20, 2000, due to his ongoing incapacity, and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling 6 days later on October 26, 2000.

Hart and several critics considered his storylines during his tenure to be lacklustre. Former WCW wrestler Chris Jericho attributed this to backstage politics and creative mayhem. Hart cited his &quot;steel plate&quot; segment with Goldberg and his tribute match to Owen, against Chris Benoit, as his two worthwhile moments with WCW. He said he was &quot;proud&quot; to have been WCW World Heavyweight Champion for a short time prior to his injury.

=== Independent wrestling appearances (2001–2009) ===
In 2001, Hart became the on-screen commissioner of World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA), a role that ended prematurely due to a 2002 stroke, which temporarily required him to use a wheelchair. In his first major appearance since recovering, Hart travelled to Auckland, New Zealand to appear at another WWA event in May 2003.

In 2007, Hart signed autographs at &quot;The Legends of Wrestling&quot; show at the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. On the weekend of July 11, 2009, he made an appearance at One Pro Wrestling in Doncaster, England, where he held a Q&amp;A, and then entered the ring to address the fans at the show. On September 27, 2009, Hart appeared in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan Center to sign autographs during a Ring of Honor event. He spoke to the crowd, reminiscing about some of his more memorable matches in New York.

=== Return to WWE ===

==== WWE Hall of Fame (2004–2007) ====
In 2004, Bret Hart appeared in a WWE game for the first time since 1998&#x27;s &quot;WWF War Zone&quot; in the GameCube game &quot;WWE Day of Reckoning&quot; followed by &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot; on the PlayStation 2. In mid-2005, Hart worked with the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment for the first time since 1997, contributing hours of interview footage and selecting matches for his WWE Home Video release, &quot;Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart: The Best There Is, the Best There Was, the Best There Ever Will Be&quot;. He returned to WWE programming as a guest on the November 16 episode of web series, &quot;Byte This&quot;.

On April 1, 2006, Hart was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006 by Stone Cold Steve Austin. He did not appear alongside his fellow inductees at WrestleMania 22 the following night. On June 11, 2007, Hart made his first appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; since October 27, 1997, when he appeared in a pretaped interview voicing his opinions on Vince McMahon as part of &quot;Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night&quot;.

==== In-ring return and second retirement (2010–2011) ====

On December 28, 2009, after weeks of speculation surrounding Hart and his presence in World Wrestling Entertainment, Vince McMahon announced that Hart would be special guest host on the January 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Hart thanked the fans for their continued support, jokingly teased announcer Jerry Lawler about their long-running 1990s feud, and confronted Shawn Michaels and McMahon regarding the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series in 1997. Hart and Michaels were able to agree on a truce, shaking hands and hugging. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine and not part of storyline. It also appeared that he had buried the hatchet with McMahon later in the night, until McMahon subsequently kicked Bret in the crotch (this was in fact part of a storyline, as Hart and McMahon had been on speaking terms since 2005).

During different encounters the following month, Hart and McMahon reproduced events similar to those that occurred in the Montreal Screwjob: McMahon spitting in Hart&#x27;s face (as Hart did to McMahon), and Hart destroying parts of the technical equipment that goes into producing &quot;Raw&quot; (as he did to the Survivor Series equipment). On the February 15 &quot;Raw&quot;, Hart made a farewell from WWE, but as he left to go inside his limousine, another vehicle reversed into the door of his limo and injured his left leg. On the March 1 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon challenged Hart to a match at WrestleMania XXVI; Hart accepted. The match was later changed to a No Holds Barred match as Hart revealed (with help from &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, the special guest host that night) the staging of his injury. Hart, along with his family, inducted his father Stu Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2010, a controversial decision that aggravated Hart and McMahon&#x27;s rivalry in 2010. At WrestleMania, McMahon paid the Hart family to betray Bret. They doublecrossed McMahon instead and helped him lose.
Hart stood with The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd), a stable stemmed from the Hart family, throughout their feud with ShoMiz (Big Show and The Miz); they ultimately won the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 26. When The Miz lost a match that guaranteed a WWE United States Championship match to a Hart family member, he chose Bret; with the help of the Dynasty, Hart defeated The Miz to win his fifth United States Championship on May 17 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On the May 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hart was named the new general manager of Raw. His first orders included vacating his United States Championship, which R-Truth won, and setting up qualifying matches for Fatal 4-Way, which the injured Batista took exception to and quit. The next week, Hart declared a Viewer&#x27;s Choice episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He was attacked by NXT rookies after firing Wade Barrett and declining to offer them contracts on the June 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A week later, McMahon fired Hart as general manager for failing to control the rookies.

Hart returned five weeks later, where it was announced by John Cena that he, The Great Khali, R-Truth, Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison and Hart would face the NXT rookies, now known as The Nexus, at SummerSlam. The following week, Hart teamed with Cena to wrestle SummerSlam teammates Edge and Chris Jericho to a no contest. In the SummerSlam main event, he was disqualified for using a steel chair on Skip Sheffield; his team ultimately won the match. On the August 16, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hart introduced the new tag team title belts to the champions, The Hart Dynasty. Later on in the night during The Nexus vs. &quot;Raw&quot; challenge, Hart was scheduled to face Justin Gabriel, but was unable to compete after the Anonymous Raw General Manager, citing his disdain for Hart, removed him from the match and replaced him with Randy Orton. On September 25, WWE hosted a tribute event to Hart in Madison Square Garden, where he and the Hart Dynasty defeated Nexus members Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel and Michael Tarver in a six-man tag team match, when Gabriel submitted to Hart&#x27;s Sharpshooter. In November 2010, Hart&#x27;s WWE contract had expired.

Hart has made infrequent appearances in minor roles, appearing on the April 25, 2011 episode of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. At Over the Limit, Hart came to the support of his long-running 1990s rival, Jerry Lawler, forcing Michael Cole to kiss Lawler&#x27;s foot. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hart refereed the main event, which saw John Cena and Rey Mysterio defeat R-Truth and CM Punk with Hart&#x27;s assistance. On the August 23, 2011, tapings of &quot;SmackDown&quot; (aired August 26), Hart served as guest general manager. On September 12 tapings of &quot;Raw&quot; in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Hart teamed with John Cena in a match against Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez, which he won after putting Rodriguez into a sharpshooter. This was Hart&#x27;s final match.

==== Sporadic appearances (2012–present) ====

At &quot;Raw 1000&quot; and on the May 4, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; he served as guest ring announcer; he interviewed John Cena on September 10, 2012, during which CM Punk interrupted and got into a confrontation with Hart. He participated in backstage segments at the 2013 Royal Rumble and WrestleMania 31. On the post-show of &quot;Raw&quot; on May 27, 2013, Hart was honoured by the city of Calgary and the WWE with a &quot;Bret Hart Appreciation Night&quot;, a celebration of the work he had done in his career. Also present in the ring for this celebration were Pat Patterson, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon, who each paid their own tributes to Hart. He has also served as an expert on panels, including the March 25, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and at the NXT Arrival pre-show. Hart was in the corner of his niece Natalya on the March 27, 2014, episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, at the second NXT TakeOver event and at the 2016 Payback event. The match ended when the referee, Charles Robinson, called for the bell as Charlotte had Natalya locked in the Sharpshooter. After the match both Natalya and Hart placed Charlotte and her father, Ric Flair, respectively in the Sharpshooter.

On April 6, 2019, Hart became a two-time WWE Hall of Famer when he was inducted as a member of The Hart Foundation alongside Jim Neidhart. During Hart&#x27;s speech, an audience member named Zach Madson charged into the ring and tackled Hart and his niece Natalya to the ground, but they were quickly saved by multiple wrestlers and security, and after several minutes, Hart continued and finished his speech. WWE later released a statement saying that the attacker was sent to the local authorities. In August 2019, Hart appeared at WWE SummerSlam pay-per-view backstage wishing Seth Rollins good luck in his match against Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship.

In September 2022, Hart appeared at ringside for WWE&#x27;s first UK stadium show in 30 years, Clash at the Castle. Hart returned to Raw on the September 9, 2024 episode, sharing a segment with Sami Zayn and World Heavyweight Champion Gunther.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019) ===
On May 25, 2019, Hart made a surprise special appearance at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s (AEW) inaugural pay-per-view, Double or Nothing, to unveil the AEW World Championship.

In July 2023, it was revealed that Hart offered his services to AEW as an agent, but was turned down.

=== Impact Wrestling (2020) ===
On October 24, 2020, Hart was among those who appeared at Impact Wrestling&#x27;s 2020 Bound for Glory via video message to congratulate Ken Shamrock for his induction into the Impact Hall of Fame.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Hart is nicknamed &quot;The Hitman&quot;, and often dubbed &quot;The Best There Is, the Best There Was, and the Best There Ever Will Be&quot;. Hart usually wrestled in a pink attire and, during his time as The Hart Foundation, the tag team was nicknamed &quot;The Pink and Black Attack&quot;, a nickname Hart used for himself during his singles career.

Hart used the Sharpshooter as his finishing maneuver. In his biography, Hart said he learned the hold from Konnan and Pat Patterson named it. Due to Hart&#x27;s success, the Sharpshooter is usually used by Canadian wrestlers. Before ending his matches, Hart usually employed a sequence of five moves: inverted atomic drop, Russian leg sweep, backbreaker, elbow drop from the second rope, and Sharpshooter, being known as the &quot;Five Moves of Doom&quot;. During his time in the original Hart Foundation, he and Jim Neidhart performed the Hart Attack as their finishing manoeuver.

== Legacy ==

BBC and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; writers noted that Hart is &quot;widely regarded&quot; as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.

Sky Sports described his legacy as &quot;one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle&quot;.

Veteran industry journalist Dave Meltzer called Hart &quot;one of the best ever,&quot; and further praised his ring psychology as the best in WWE history (alongside that of Ricky Steamboat, and &quot;maybe Jake Roberts&quot;). Jon Robinson of IGN called him &quot;one of the greatest (if not the single best) pure wrestler to ever walk that aisle&quot;.

Veteran wrestlers including CM Punk, Booker T and Michael Hayes have named Hart &quot;the greatest of all time&quot;, with Hayes noting that he is considered by many as the best Canadian performer ever, if not the single greatest overall.

Veteran announcer Gene Okerlund dubbed Hart &quot;the greatest ever&quot;, and stressed that he should appear in anyone&#x27;s list of the all-time top 10 wrestlers. Viscera commented: &quot;He was the best [WWF] Champion of all time. I mean, as far as international rapport, it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s a god.&quot; Olympic wrestling gold medalist and six-time WWE world champion Kurt Angle studied tapes of Hart in order to learn the art of pro wrestling; he and Stone Cold Steve Austin have ranked Hart as the best in-ring performer ever (Austin tying Hart with Shawn Michaels). Similarly, former opponent Harley Race described Hart as being &quot;as good as they got&quot;. Whilst WWE chairman, Vince McMahon described Hart as having &quot;unparalleled&quot; technical wrestling and storytelling skills, and retrospectively characterized the late 1990s Hart as a performer &quot;who you know is going to give you the best match of the night every time he goes out there&quot;. Asked where he would rank Hart among the pantheon of wrestling greats, longtime announcer Jim Ross stated, &quot;Right at the top. Bret was one of the all time best.&quot;

IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest wrestler ever.

Sports Illustrated ranked him as the sixteenth greatest wrestler ever.

Asked for his favourite opponent, Ted DiBiase said: &quot;In my own era, without a doubt, Bret Hart.&quot; The Undertaker named Hart as his toughest opponent, adding: &quot;Some of my favourite matches are with him... I think my matches with Bret were some of the best&quot;. Recalling their WWF Championship bout from July 1994, Sean Waltman affirmed: &quot;[Hart] gave me the best singles match of my career, and one of the best matches that&#x27;s ever been on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;.&quot; Curt Hennig stated: &quot;Out of all the matches I had, probably the best match I ever had would be with Bret [at SummerSlam 1991]... I have a good thing with Bret forever.&quot; Shawn Michaels, who did not get along with Hart on a personal level, conceded that Hart was an &quot;unbelievable&quot; performer (an opinion shared by WWE executive and former opponent Triple H), calling him a &quot;sheer joy&quot; to work with and saying that the pair&#x27;s match at WrestleMania XII was one of, if not his favourite WrestleMania bout. Roddy Piper described Hart as &quot;one great man&quot;, and &quot;one of the few guys who has a &#x27;total package&#x27;&quot;. Lance Storm remarked: &quot;[Hart&#x27;s] matches always seemed more important than the individuals involved in them, and that&#x27;s what made him great. Bret managed to dominate this sport... by wrestling, which is no easy task, and is to his credit&quot;. On Hart&#x27;s influence, Storm said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to pattern my ring style or work ethic, at least, after that of &#x27;The Hitman&#x27;&quot;.

Along with Storm, Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn point to Hart as their top wrestling inspiration; Seth Rollins and Jinder Mahal called him an idol, and Jon Moxley cited him as an influence. Edge listed his three idols within the business as &quot;Bret, Shawn and Hulk&quot;. Chris Jericho named Bret as his hero (along with Owen Hart), and said he aspired to be &quot;half of&quot; what Bret was. Chris Benoit remarked: &quot;I always emulated him... I spent so many years looking up to, idolizing [Hart]; he was somewhat of a role model to me&quot;. Benoit added that his matches against Hart were &quot;up on a pedestal&quot;. Koji Nakagawa modelled his character and entire career on Bret Hart by adopting Hart&#x27;s pink and black attire, an entrance theme identical to Hart&#x27;s theme song, while also adopting his moveset. Ryback recalled a WWF event from his childhood, saying: &quot;I remember it was Bret Hart against Diesel inside a steel cage in the main event, and I just knew I wanted to be a WWE wrestler... Bret [Hart], I love&quot;. Drew McIntyre named Hart his favourite wrestler, while Wade Barrett named Hart along with The British Bulldog, The Ultimate Warrior and The Undertaker; he called Hart vs. Bulldog, at SummerSlam 1992, his all-time favorite match. Scott Dawson said that Hart&#x27;s work at King of the Ring in 1993 made him want to become a professional wrestler. Upon joining All Elite Wrestling for his hotly anticipated return to professional wrestling after seven years, CM Punk wore a Bret Hart T-shirt in one of his first televised appearances, and his first match, against Darby Allin, included several sequences that mirrored a 1994 Hart match against Sean Waltman.

&quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; (PWI) readers voted Hart the greatest wrestler of 1993 and 1994 in the &quot;PWI 500&quot;, as well as the &quot;Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year&quot; 1994. He was voted &quot;WWF Superstar of the Year&quot; 1993 by fans. PWI ranked him No. 4 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the &quot;PWI Years&quot; in 2003, after Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and André the Giant. WWE has also credited Hart as the top &quot;Submission Specialist&quot; in professional wrestling history, and for popularizing the Sharpshooter, named by the organization as the most devastating submission hold in professional wrestling history. Hart&#x27;s rise to singles success was seen to revolutionize the business; IGN wrote: &quot;After Bret beat Ric Flair for the WWE Championship in 1992, it changed the entire industry, re-setting the WWF back to the days of technical wizardry and reshaping all our notions of what a great wrestling match should actually look and feel like&quot;. According to prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer, Hart was &quot;a major draw in the United States and probably more so in Europe&quot;. Fellow journalists Bob Ryder and Dave Scherer described him as &quot;an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe.&quot; Fin Martin of &quot;Power Slam&quot; also spoke to Hart&#x27;s drawing power, placing him number 7 in &quot;The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders&quot;, a list that considered drawing ability, along with workrate and promo skills. &quot;Vice&quot;″s Corey Erdman wrote, &quot;1997 was one of the hottest periods in the history of professional wrestling... Hart was the [WWF&#x27;s] biggest star, arguably its biggest live gate draw globally.&quot; Recalling WCW&#x27;s acquisition of Hart that year, then WWE owner Vince McMahon argued that his chief competitor &quot;could have really built the entire franchise... around this extraordinary star.&quot; McMahon felt that WCW misused Hart, which was &quot;fortunate&quot; for the WWF.

On the February 16, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that Hart would be an inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006. Hart had also been approached by Vince McMahon for a potential match between the two at WrestleMania 22 but declined the offer. On April 1, 2006, Hart was inducted by &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin. He thanked every wrestler he worked with (even thanking Vince McMahon) and said he&#x27;s &quot;in a good place in life.&quot; Veteran industry personality and former WWE executive Paul Heyman referred to Hart&#x27;s oeuvre as &quot;a body of work so spectacular that it is beyond comprehension how brilliant a career he enjoyed&quot;.

On July 15, 2006, Hart was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa. The induction took place in an immensely crowded and humid display room showcasing one of Hart&#x27;s ring entrance jackets. The honour is only awarded to those with both a professional and amateur wrestling background, making Hart one of the youngest inductees. During his acceptance, Hart compared this induction to his place in the WWE Hall of Fame, saying &quot;This is a much bigger honour for me.&quot; In June 2008, Hart returned to the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame ceremony, this time to induct his father Stu Hart. In 2021, Hart would be inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame by Chris Jericho and the Rock.

== Other media and Post-Wrestling Career ==

=== Writing ===
Hart wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; from June 1991 until October 2004.

Hart used his poetry skills to win over Gord Kirke to act as his legal counsel.

On October 16, 2007, Hart&#x27;s autobiography titled &quot;Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling&quot;, was released in Canada by Random House Canada, and released in fall 2008 in the United States by Grand Central Publishing, with a U.S. book signing tour. Hart began writing the book in July 1999 with Marcy Engelstein, his longtime close friend and business associate. They did not complete the book until eight years later in September 2007 due to Hart having his stroke in 2002, among numerous other tragedies that occurred during the writing. Hart&#x27;s chronicle is based on an audio diary that he kept for all of his years on the road in professional wrestling.

Hart also provided the forewords to Roddy Piper&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;In the Pit with Piper&quot;, Harley Race&#x27;s autobiography &quot;King of the Ring&quot; and Dave Meltzer&#x27;s book &quot;Tributes II: Remembering More of the Worlds Greatest Wrestlers&quot;.

=== Honorary degree ===
In 2018, at the age of 60, he received an honorary degree — a Bachelor of Health and Physical Education/Physical Literacy from Mount Royal University.

=== Charity and Business ===
In 2019, he and Calgary Hitmen Team donated $16,300 to Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre. 

In February 2023, he opened Hitman&#x27;s Bar in Calgary, Hart’s most iconic memorabilia is displayed the bar, including the world heavyweight championship belt he won in 1992 against Ric Flair in Saskatoon, Sask.

=== Acting ===
In 1994, Hart played a prison inmate in a deleted scene from Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, restored for the director&#x27;s cut. From 1994 to 1995, he appeared in &quot;Lonesome Dove: The Series&quot; television show playing &quot;Luther Root&quot;. He has made numerous televised appearances since, including a guest spot on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1997 (as himself, in &quot;The Old Man and the Lisa&quot;) and episodes of the &quot;Honey I Shrunk The Kids TV series&quot; (along with his brother Owen), &quot;The Adventures of Sinbad&quot;, &quot;Big Sound&quot;, and &quot;The Immortal&quot;. He provided the voice of pro wrestler character &quot;The Hooded Fang&quot; in &quot;Jacob Two-Two&quot;.

Hart also guest starred on the sketch comedy series &quot;MADtv&quot; in 1997 where he acted as enforcer at a fan&#x27;s house, appearing with his WWF Championship belt. He later appeared again on &quot;MADtv&quot; in 1999 and 2000 in an angle with actor Will Sasso in which the two feuded on the set of &quot;MADtv&quot; and in World Championship Wrestling; this culminated in a grudge match on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, which he decisively won.

Hart donned his &quot;Hit Man&quot; singlet, along with additional costume, and executed wrestling maneuvers on villain characters, as part of his performance as the Genie in a 2004 stage production of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. He reprised the role in 2006.

In 2024, he played himself in the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Under (and Over, and Beside) the Boardwalk&quot;.

=== Wrestling-related ===
Hart was the subject of the 1998 documentary, &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot;, which chronicled many of the events in Hart&#x27;s personal and professional life from September 1996 to November 1997, including the Montreal Screwjob and its immediate aftermath.

A clip of Hart applying the sharpshooter to Benoit at WCW Mayhem in 1999 is featured in the opening credits of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;.

In mid-2005, WWE announced the release of a three-disc DVD originally named &quot;Screwed: The Bret Hart Story&quot;, with the title a reference to the Montreal Screwjob. Hart filmed over seven hours of interview footage for the DVD, which was renamed &quot;Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be&quot;. The collection was released on November 15, 2005.

Hart appeared on many talk shows (including &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Nancy Grace&quot;, &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, &quot;On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren&quot;) discussing the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide. Hart was a longtime friend of Benoit.

On April 6, 2010, WWE released &quot;Hart &amp; Soul: The Hart Family Anthology&quot;, which is a 3 DVD set featuring a documentary on the Hart wrestling family as well as 12 matches. It is unique in that it also features previously unseen home movies from the Harts as well as interviews from family members.

In 2010, The Fight Network produced a documentary titled &quot;Bret Hart – Survival of the Hitman&quot; produced by John Pollock, Jorge Barbosa and Wai Ting chronicling the rise of Hart, his split with WWE in 1997 and his road back to the company in January 2010. The documentary features interviews with Hart, members of the Hart family, Hart&#x27;s former business manager Carl De Marco, former sports agent Gord Kirke, and producer of &quot;Wrestling with Shadows&quot; Paul Jay.

A DVD entitled &quot;Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart: WWE&#x27;s Greatest Rivalries&quot; was released in November 2011. The subject of the DVD was their on-screen rivalry and real-life conflicts, with a particular focus on the Montreal Screwjob.

In 2016, Hart starred in the documentary film &quot;Nine Legends&quot;. Early that year, Hart launched a podcast named &quot;The Sharpshooter Show&quot;.

== Video games ==

Hart has appeared in numerous video games. They include:



== Personal life ==
Hart lent his nickname to the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League; he was a founder and part-owner. 

On August 23, 2018, Hart was honoured with a traditional Niitsitapi naming ceremony and named &#x27;Courageous Chief&#x27; by Siksika Elder Miiksika&#x27;am (Clarence Wolfleg). The ceremony was done as recognition for his and his father Stu Hart&#x27;s cultural relationship building contributions, such as promoting interest of the sport of amateur wrestling among indigenous youth throughout Western Canada.

=== Family ===

Hart married Julie Smadu (born March 25, 1960) on July 8, 1982. They have four children. The four hearts located on the right thigh of his tights symbolize his children, as do the four dots following his signature. Julie&#x27;s sister Michelle was married to Tom Billington from 1982 to 1991. Bret and Julie separated in May 1998, and after several brief reunions over the next four years, eventually divorced on June 24, 2002, just hours before Hart had his stroke. Hart married an Italian woman named Cinzia Rota on September 15, 2004, but they divorced in 2007 after failing to agree on where they should live. He married Stephanie Washington, an African-American woman several decades his junior, in 2010; although at first his children were wary of their new stepmother, they have since embraced her as they realized that despite their differences in age, the love between her and their father is deep and genuine. 
His seven brothers were either wrestlers or involved backstage with the wrestling business; his four sisters all married professional wrestlers. Two of his brothers-in-law, Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart, had successful careers in the business. His youngest brother, Owen Hart, had become a decorated wrestler in his own right before his death in 1999, caused by an accident at the WWF pay-per-view Over the Edge. Hart&#x27;s niece Natalya is a professional wrestler.

Fellow pro wrestler Roddy Piper claimed in his autobiography to be a cousin of Hart. Hart has also stated that Piper was the only wrestler to visit him in the hospital after his stroke.

=== Health problems ===
On June 24, 2002, Hart had a stroke after hitting his head in a bicycle accident. &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot; reported that Hart hit a pothole, flew over the handlebars of the bike, and landed on the back of his head. Hart developed total paralysis on his left side, which required months of physical therapy. Hart has since recovered much of his mobility and is in good health, although he has had other lasting effects common to stroke survivors (such as emotional imbalance). Hart wrote in detail about his stroke in his autobiography, &quot;Hitman: My Real Life In The Cartoon World of Wrestling&quot;. Hart later became a spokesperson for March of Dimes Canada&#x27;s Stroke Recovery Canada program. While recovering from his stroke Hart would train three days a week at B.J&#x27;s Gym in Calgary, which was owned by his brother-in-law B. J. Annis.

On February 1, 2016, Hart announced through a Facebook post that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Jim Ross claimed on March 2, 2016, that Hart had beaten the disease following successful surgery and that it appeared not to have spread to other areas of his body. Hart responded to Jim Ross&#x27; comments through Facebook saying that although the surgery was a success and that he and his doctors were optimistic, he would continue to be monitored every three months by doctors until he can actually be cancer free.

=== Personal issues with Ric Flair ===
In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Ric Flair &quot;sucks&quot;, and described his workplace, WCW, as &quot;minor league&quot;. In his autobiography, Flair accused Hart of exploiting the death of his brother, Owen Hart, and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that, despite Hart&#x27;s popularity in Canada, he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as &quot;plain ridiculous&quot; in a column written for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot;. Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold-out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage. Hart did acknowledge a decline in the WWF&#x27;s popularity during the mid-1990s, but he, and others, felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF&#x27;s well-publicised sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW&#x27;s acquisition of former top WWF stars. Hart also took aim at Flair in his autobiography, criticizing his in-ring talents and what Hart perceived as Flair&#x27;s unsubtle blading.

Flair and Hart have since reconciled and are now friends.

===Claims Shawn Michaels and Triple H bullied The Rock===

On an episode on his &quot;Confessions with the Hitman&quot; podcast, Hart revealed that in 1996–97, Dwayne Johnson, at that time a rookie in WWE, was a &quot;marked guy&quot; and that both Shawn Michaels and Triple H bullied him and did everything in their power to make The Rock leave the company. He claimed both superstars were jealous of him which is why they used to &quot;work him&quot; for the smallest of reasons; &quot;He (Triple H) was always out to get The Rock. Shawn was out to get him and they just worked on him, and worked on him, and worked on him, and I left. [The Rock] was still in the doghouse with those guys. They wanted him [out] as bad as they wanted me out.&quot;

In 2021, Johnson himself acknowledged and praised Hart for his attitude, professionalism, as being a great person and for being exceptionally kind to him when he was a rookie in WWE during an interview with Joseph Deckelmeier of The Illuminerdi. Once he noticed that Deckelmeier was wearing a Hart shirt, he stated: &quot;The t-shirt he&#x27;s wearing is a guy who didn&#x27;t have to be, but was so good to me when I was a rookie professional wrestler, and his name is Bret &#x27;The Hitman&#x27; Hart. He comes from a very famous wrestling family, but at that time, he was world champion, and there were a lot of guys in that world at that time in &#x27;96 that didn&#x27;t necessarily embrace me, just when I was a rookie coming in, because everyone is hungry for their spots, and he&#x27;ll tell you, there&#x27;s a lot of sharks in the water. But that guy, Bret, and he was world champion, to show me how it&#x27;s done...I think [he did it] because he knew that our families (Anoaʻi and Hart) knew each other and knew that I came from a lineage of pro wrestling and that I had a real love and respect for wrestling, and he was just a great guy, and I always like to give him props where I can.&quot;

<text>Francis Thomas &quot;Fay&quot; Vincent Jr. (May 29, 1938 – February 1, 2025) was an American entertainment lawyer, securities regulator, and sports executive who served as the eighth commissioner of baseball from September 13, 1989, to September 7, 1992.

==Early life and education==
Vincent was born on May 29, 1938, in Waterbury, Connecticut, the son of Alice (née Lynch), a teacher, and Francis Thomas Vincent, a telephone company employee and sports official. He was a graduate of the Hotchkiss School.

He attended Williams College, where a near-fatal accident left him with a crushed spine and paralyzed legs. He had been locked inside his dorm room as a prank; while climbing onto the roof to escape he slipped off a four-story ledge. Surgery and three months in traction followed. Doctors said that he would never walk again and his leg never fully recovered, however he was able to walk relying on a cane for the rest of his life.

He received a B.A. degree from Williams (class of 1960) with honors and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School (class of 1963). He went on to become a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Caplin &amp; Drysdale. He also served as Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Beginning in 1978 he became the chairman of Columbia Pictures, and senior vice president of Coca-Cola when it purchased Columbia in March 1982. In April 1986 he was promoted to Executive Vice President. During his nine years as chief executive officer with Columbia, the film studio produced financially successful movies such as &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; and &quot;Tootsie&quot; and box-office bombs like &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

==Commissioner of Baseball==
At the behest of his longtime friend, incoming Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, Vincent accepted the position of deputy commissioner. As deputy commissioner, Vincent played a major role in negotiating a settlement to the betting scandal involving Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose. As part of the settlement, Rose agreed to withdraw from the sport for an indefinite period of time to avoid further punishment.

Vincent became acting commissioner when Giamatti died suddenly on September 1, 1989. After consulting with Giamatti&#x27;s widow, Toni, he agreed to succeed Giamatti as commissioner and was duly elected by MLB owners as the eighth commissioner of baseball on September 13. In his first year as commissioner, he presided over the 1989 World Series, which was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake; the owners&#x27; lockout during Spring Training of the 1990 season; and the expulsion of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner from the game.

In 1990, National League president Bill White was prepared to suspend umpire Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the field, but Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed. On September 4, 1991, the Committee for Statistical Accuracy, appointed by Vincent, changed the definition of a no-hitter to require that a pitcher or pitching staff hold a team hitless for at least nine full innings and a complete game. Since New York Yankee Andy Hawkins (who never gave up a hit during a game against the Chicago White Sox on July 1, 1990, despite the White Sox winning the game 4–0) played for the visiting team, the White Sox never batted in the ninth inning and Hawkins lost the credit for a no-hitter.

This same committee also ruled that Roger Maris was (then) the one and only single-season home run record holder, overturning the 1961 decision of former commissioner Ford Frick that Maris and Ruth&#x27;s home run totals should be listed side-by-side for 154- and 162-game seasons. (Contrary to popular belief, Frick never mentioned using an asterisk). Also during his commissionership, Vincent made it known (e.g. while being interviewed by Pat O&#x27;Brien during CBS&#x27; coverage of Game 4 of the 1991 World Series) that if he had the chance, he would get rid of the designated hitter rule. During and after his tenure, Vincent defended the indefinite suspension of Rose and his role in its imposition. When Rose applied for re-instatement, which he was permitted to do under the terms of the settlement, Vincent never acted on the request.

In the 2004 made-for-television movie about the Rose scandal, &quot;Hustle&quot;, Vincent was portrayed by actor Alan Jordan.

===1989 World Series===

On October 17, 1989, Vincent sat in a field box behind the left dugout at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park. At 5:04 p.m., just prior to Game 3 of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics, the 6.9 Mw Loma Prieta earthquake hit with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). At approximately 5:35 p.m., after coming to the conclusion that the power couldn&#x27;t be restored before sunset, Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. According to Vincent, he had already made the decision to postpone Game 3 without telling anybody first. As a result, the umpires filed a formal protest of Vincent&#x27;s decision. However, the game had to be postponed due to trouble with gas lines as well as the power issue.
The World Series ultimately resumed after a 10-day postponement (and some initial conflict between Vincent and San Francisco mayor Art Agnos, who felt that the World Series ought to have been delayed much longer) on October 27, 1989. While presenting the World Series Trophy to the Athletics, who wound up winning the World Series in a four-game sweep, Vincent summed up the 1989 World Series as a &quot;remarkable World Series in many respects.&quot;

===1990 lockout===

In February 1990, owners announced that spring training would not be starting as scheduled. This occurred after MLBPA Executive Director Donald Fehr became afraid that the owners would institute a salary cap. Fehr believed that a salary cap could possibly restrict the number of choices free agents could make and a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multiyear contracts. The lockout, which was the seventh work stoppage in baseball since 1972, lasted 32 games and wiped out almost all of spring training.

Vincent worked with both the owners and MLBPA, and on March 19, 1990, Vincent was able to announce a new Basic Agreement (which raised the minimum major league salary from $68,000 to $100,000 and established a six-man study committee on revenue sharing). As a consequence for the lockout, Opening Day for the 1990 season was moved back a week to April 9, and the season was extended by three days to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule.

===George Steinbrenner===
On July 30, 1990, Vincent banned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner from baseball for life after Steinbrenner paid Howard Spira, a small-time gambler, $40,000 for &quot;dirt&quot; on his outfielder Dave Winfield after Winfield sued Steinbrenner for failing to pay his foundation the $300,000 guaranteed in his contract. Steinbrenner was eventually reinstated in 1992 for a return in the spring of 1993.

It came out later from Vincent that he had wanted to suspend Steinbrenner for only two years. It was Steinbrenner who asked for a lifetime ban as he was tired of baseball and wanted to help run the US Olympic effort (at the time, he was vice president of the US Olympic Committee) while his family could run the team around his absence. Steinbrenner knew he could not run the Olympic effort if he was suspended, so he asked for a lifetime ban, which he received after 11 hours of negotiation. Steinbrenner then applied for (and received) reinstatement after two years.

===Steve Howe===
On June 24, 1992, Vincent permanently suspended pitcher Steve Howe for repeated drug offenses. Vincent was incensed when upper Yankee management (Buck Showalter, Gene Michael, and Jack Lawn) agreed to testify on Howe&#x27;s behalf, and threatened them with expulsion from the game:
The three men testified for Howe as promised, and remained active in baseball. Three months later, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner. An arbitrator overturned Vincent&#x27;s suspension of Howe on November 11, 1992.

===Collusion===
Fay Vincent on the effects of collusion:

===1993 expansion===
In June 1991, Vincent declared that the American League would receive $42 million of the National League&#x27;s $190 million in expansion revenue and that the AL would provide players in the National League expansion draft (involving the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins).

In an attempt to win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed that the AL owners were entitled to 22 percent of the $190 million take. This decision marked the first time in expansion history that leagues were required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league&#x27;s expansion draft. He said the owners expanded to raise money to pay their collusion debt.

===Realignment===
Just prior to leaving office, Vincent had plans to realign the National League. Vincent wanted the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to switch divisions with the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves. When Major League Baseball realigned in 1969, this geographical anomaly was created in order to give the Chicago and St. Louis franchises more games during television&#x27;s prime time schedule. National League president Bill White warned Vincent that realigning without league approval would be in violation of the National League Constitution.

Many thought that plan would be beneficial to the league as a whole, especially by building a regional rivalry between the new franchise in Miami and the Atlanta Braves. The Cubs, however, opposed the move, suggesting that fans in the Central Time Zone would be forced to watch more games originating on the West Coast with later broadcast times (had the realignment included the use of a balanced schedule, the Cubs would have actually played more games against teams outside their division). On July 17, 1992, the Chicago Cubs sued Vincent and asked the U.S. District Court in Chicago for a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation, which was granted two weeks later. After Vincent&#x27;s attorneys appealed, oral arguments were scheduled for August 30 of that year. Ultimately, Vincent resigned before the litigation was scheduled to resume, so as a result, the Cubs dropped their suit.

Although Vincent&#x27;s vision never really came into fruition, Major League Baseball did in fact realign in 1994, albeit in the form of three divisions in each league, and the addition of an expanded playoff format with the Wild Card.

===Relationship with the owners===
Vincent&#x27;s relationship with baseball&#x27;s owners was always tenuous at best; he resigned in 1992 after the owners gave him an 18–9 no confidence vote. The owners were still angry at Vincent over his intervention during the 1990 lockout, and disappointed over upwardly spiraling player salaries, and dwindling television ratings in light of a $1.2 billion, four-year deal with CBS. The deal ultimately cost the network approximately $500 million beginning in 1990, Vincent&#x27;s first full season as commissioner. CBS itself contributed to decreasing ratings thanks to their haphazard scheduling of &quot;Game of the Week&quot; broadcasts during the regular season to the point that fans grew tired of tuning into no baseball on summer Saturdays. until after the network had aired that year&#x27;s NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA&#x27;s move to NBC Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled The broadcasts would have been on each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11–12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added – two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season.

The owners accused Vincent of acting in a high-handed manner, especially in the Howe affair; Vincent reportedly &quot;believes that the game is bigger than one person and he’s not afraid to take a controversial stance and stick with it&quot; even if it was against public opinion. Vincent also &quot;didn&#x27;t see himself as a lackey whose job it was to massage the owner’s egos and do their bidding&quot;.

The leaders in the movement to oust Vincent were members of what &quot;The Sporting News&quot; later dubbed The Great Lakes Gang: 
*Bud Selig, president of the Milwaukee Brewers;
*Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago White Sox;
*Stanton Cook, head of the Tribune Co., which owned the Chicago Cubs;
*Carl Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota Twins;
*Peter O&#x27;Malley, the longtime majority-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers
*William Bartholomay, longtime part-owner and Chairman of the Atlanta Braves

In his farewell, Vincent said 

Vincent was never able to complete the five-year term that he had inherited from Bart Giamatti. Vincent contended that Major League Baseball made a huge mistake by not appointing his deputy commissioner Stephen Greenberg — the son of the Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg — as Commissioner. Vincent was replaced on an interim basis by Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, who was named the permanent replacement in 1998 and whose family continued to maintain ownership over the Brewers.

==Life after baseball==

After stepping down from the commissioner&#x27;s office, Vincent became a private investor and the president of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. Vincent served as the NECBL&#x27;s president from 1998 to 2004. In 2001, when baseball owners voted to contract two clubs, Vincent criticized them for not consulting the players&#x27; union. In 2002, Vincent wrote his autobiography, &quot;The Last Commissioner: A Baseball Valentine&quot;.

In 2005, during an interview with Fox Sports Radio, Vincent shared his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Texas Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers, who received a 20-game suspension for a tirade directed at two TV cameramen. Vincent believed that Rogers, who had a record of 9–4 with 2.45 ERA at the time of the incident, shouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to play in the All-Star Game in Detroit. Vincent said 

Vincent had been critical of Major League Baseball&#x27;s handling of the strike in 1994. Some observers feel that Vincent&#x27;s absence (or any other permanent commissioner at the time) could have been a decisive turn in finding a compromise agreement. While being interviewed for ESPN Classic&#x27;s &quot;SportsCentury&quot; (about the year in sports in 1994), Vincent believed that the strike turned out to be a lost cause since the result was federal judge Sonia Sotomayor ruling that work had to resume under the previous collective bargaining agreement.

In March 2006, Vincent called on baseball to investigate (similar to the Dowd Report surrounding Pete Rose) possible steroids use by Barry Bonds, saying the cloud hanging over his pursuit of the home run record is a crisis akin to the Black Sox scandal from 1919: 

Vincent wrote in the April 24, 2006, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, that with most of Bonds&#x27; official troubles being off the field, and with the strength of the players&#x27; union, there was little Bud Selig could do beyond appointing an investigating committee. Vincent said that Selig is largely &quot;an observer of a forum beyond his reach.&quot; On October 18, 2007, Vincent appeared with sportscaster Bob Costas at Williams College for &quot;A Conversation About Sports&quot;, moderated by Will Dudley, associate professor of philosophy. On May 28, 1992, Vincent was awarded an honorary doctoral degree at Central Connecticut State University. He also gave the 1992 Vance Distinguished Lecture at the university.

On May 18, 2008, Fairfield University conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Vincent where he served on the Board of Trustees from 1991 to 2002. He created the Alice Lynch Vincent Scholarship Fund, which is based on need, there in memory of his mother in December 1996.

In April 2021, Vincent criticized commissioner Rob Manfred over Major League Baseball&#x27;s decision to move that year&#x27;s All-Star Game out of Atlanta in protest of the Georgia State Legislature&#x27;s passage of the controversial Election Integrity Act of 2021, which overhauls voter access in the state. According to Vincent, Manfred made his decision &quot;without first protesting the substance of the law.&quot;

==Personal life==
Vincent married Valerie McMahon in 1965. They raised three children and divorced in 1994. Vincent&#x27;s second marriage, to Christina Watkins was from 1998 until his death.

Vincent died from bladder cancer at a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida, on February 1, 2025. He was 86.

<text>Yoshio Shinozuka (篠塚良雄; 1923 – 20 April 2014) was a Japanese Imperial Army soldier who served as an army medic with a top secret biological warfare group called Unit 731 in World War II. He was a member of the Association of Returnees from China.

== Wartime service in Unit 731 ==
According to his testimony, he was conscripted into Unit 731 at the age of 16. Shinozuka claimed to have been involved in conducting experiments and vivisections on Chinese captives near the northern Chinese city of Harbin. He was held in detention in China for over a decade, finally being released in 1956.

== Testimony regarding war crimes ==
In 1997, Shinozuka gave testimony on the activities of Unit 731 on behalf of 180 Chinese who were suing the Japanese government for compensation and an apology for deaths of family members they claimed were killed in experiments at the biological warfare laboratory. &quot;I was a member of Unit 731 and I have done what no human being should ever do&quot;, Shinozuka said.

In 1998, he wanted to give a speech at a peace conference in the United States and Canada. However, the government administrations denied his entry into their countries claiming it was because there may be controversy in the United States.

<text>Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.

Because protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.

As opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.

Structural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.

While most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A &quot;Science&quot; article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.

One advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers.

== Goals==
One goal of structural genomics is to identify novel protein folds. Experimental methods of protein structure determination require proteins that express and/or crystallize well, which may inherently bias the kinds of proteins folds that this experimental data elucidate. A genomic, modeling-based approach such as &quot;ab initio&quot; modeling may be better able to identify novel protein folds than the experimental approaches because they are not limited by experimental constraints.

Protein function depends on 3-D structure and these 3-D structures are more highly conserved than sequences. Thus, the high-throughput structure determination methods of structural genomics have the potential to inform our understanding of protein functions. This also has potential implications for drug discovery and protein engineering. Furthermore, every protein that is added to the structural database increases the likelihood that the database will include homologous sequences of other unknown proteins. The Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is a multifaceted effort funded by the National Institutes of Health with various academic and industrial partners that aims to increase knowledge of protein structure using a structural genomics approach and to improve structure-determination methodology.

== Methods ==
Structural genomics takes advantage of completed genome sequences in several ways in order to determine protein structures. The gene sequence of the target protein can also be compared to a known sequence and structural information can then be inferred from the known protein&#x27;s structure. Structural genomics can be used to predict novel protein folds based on other structural data. Structural genomics can also take modeling-based approach that relies on homology between the unknown protein and a solved protein structure.

=== &quot;de novo&quot; methods ===
Completed genome sequences allow every open reading frame (ORF), the part of a gene that is likely to contain the sequence for the messenger RNA and protein, to be cloned and expressed as protein. These proteins are then purified and crystallized, and then subjected to one of two types of structure determination: X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The whole genome sequence allows for the design of every primer required in order to amplify all of the ORFs, clone them into bacteria, and then express them. By using a whole-genome approach to this traditional method of protein structure determination, all of the proteins encoded by the genome can be expressed at once. This approach allows for the structural determination of every protein that is encoded by the genome.

=== Modelling-based methods===

==== &quot;ab initio&quot; modeling====
This approach uses protein sequence data and the chemical and physical interactions of the encoded amino acids to predict the 3-D structures of proteins with no homology to solved protein structures. One highly successful method for &quot;ab initio&quot; modeling is the Rosetta program, which divides the protein into short segments and arranges short polypeptide chain into a low-energy local conformation. Rosetta is available for commercial use and for non-commercial use through its public program, Robetta.

====Sequence-based modeling====
This modeling technique compares the gene sequence of an unknown protein with sequences of proteins with known structures. Depending on the degree of similarity between the sequences, the structure of the known protein can be used as a model for solving the structure of the unknown protein. Highly accurate modeling is considered to require at least 50% amino acid sequence identity between the unknown protein and the solved structure. 30-50% sequence identity gives a model of intermediate-accuracy, and sequence identity below 30% gives low-accuracy models. It has been predicted that at least 16,000 protein structures will need to be determined in order for all structural motifs to be represented at least once and thus allowing the structure of any unknown protein to be solved accurately through modeling. One disadvantage of this method, however, is that structure is more conserved than sequence and thus sequence-based modeling may not be the most accurate way to predict protein structures.

====Threading====
Threading bases structural modeling on fold similarities rather than sequence identity. This method may help identify distantly related proteins and can be used to infer molecular functions.

== Examples of structural genomics ==
There are currently a number of on-going efforts to solve the structures for every protein in a given proteome.

===&quot;Thermotoga maritima&quot; proteome===
One current goal of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG), a part of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is to solve the structures for all the proteins in &quot;Thermotoga maritima&quot;, a thermophillic bacterium. &quot;T. maritima&quot; was selected as a structural genomics target based on its relatively small genome consisting of 1,877 genes and the hypothesis that the proteins expressed by a thermophilic bacterium would be easier to crystallize.

Lesley &quot;et al&quot; used &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; to express all the open-reading frames (ORFs) of &quot;T. martima&quot;. These proteins were then crystallized and structures were determined for successfully crystallized proteins using X-ray crystallography. Among other structures, this structural genomics approach allowed for the determination of the structure of the TM0449 protein, which was found to exhibit a novel fold as it did not share structural homology with any known protein.

===&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; proteome===
The goal of the TB Structural Genomics Consortium is to determine the structures of potential drug targets in &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The development of novel drug therapies against tuberculosis are particularly important given the growing problem of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

The fully sequenced genome of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has allowed scientists to clone many of these protein targets into expression vectors for purification and structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Studies have identified a number of target proteins for structure determination, including extracellular proteins that may be involved in pathogenesis, iron-regulatory proteins, current drug targets, and proteins predicted to have novel folds. So far, structures have been determined for 708 of the proteins encoded by &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;.

<doc id="303103" wikidata="Q1002108" url="?curid=303103" title="Buffalo Soldier">
<text>Buffalo Soldiers were United States Army regiments composed exclusively of African American soldiers, formed during the 19th century to serve on the American frontier. On September 21, 1866, the 10th Cavalry Regiment was formed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The nickname &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; was purportedly given to the regiments by the American Indian tribes who fought against them during the American Indian Wars, and the term eventually became synonymous with all of the African American regiments that were established in 1866, including the 9th Cavalry Regiment, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Regiment and 38th Infantry Regiment.

Although numerous African American Union Army regiments were raised during the Civil War (referred to collectively as the United States Colored Troops), &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; were established by the U.S Congress as the first all-black Army regiments in peacetime. The regiments were racially segregated, as the U.S. military would not desegregate until 1948. On November 15, 2024, Robert Dixon, the last surviving Buffalo Soldier, died aged 103. The oldest living Buffalo Soldier, Mark Matthews, died in 2005 at the age of 111 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Etymology==
Sources disagree on how the nickname &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; began. According to the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum the name originated with the Cheyenne warriors in the winter of 1877, the actual Cheyenne translation being &quot;Wild Buffalo&quot;. However, writer Walter Hill documented the account of Colonel Benjamin Grierson, who founded the 10th Cavalry regiment, recalling an 1871 campaign against Comanches. Hill attributed the origin of the name to the Comanche, due to Grierson&#x27;s assertions. The Apache used the same term (&quot;We called them &#x27;buffalo soldiers,&#x27; because they had curly, kinky hair ... like bison&quot;) a claim supported by other sources. Another possible source could be from the Plains Indians who gave them that name because of the bison coats they wore in winter. The term Buffalo Soldiers became a generic term for all black soldiers. It is now used for U.S. Army units that trace their direct lineage back to any of the African-American regiments formed in 1866.

==Service==
During the Civil War, the U.S. government formed regiments known as the United States Colored Troops, composed of black soldiers and Native Americans. The USCT was disbanded in the fall of 1865. In 1867 the Regular Army was set at ten regiments of cavalry and 45 regiments of infantry. The Army was authorized to raise two regiments of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th (Colored) Cavalry) and four regiments of black infantry (the 38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st (Colored) Infantry), who were mostly drawn from USCT veterans. The first draft of the bill that the House Committee on Military Affairs sent to the full chamber on March 7, 1866, did not include a provision for regiments of black cavalry; however, this provision was added by Senator Benjamin Wade prior to the bill&#x27;s passing on July 28, 1866. In 1869 the Regular Army was kept at ten regiments of cavalry but cut to 25 regiments of Infantry, reducing the black complement to two regiments (the 24th and 25th (Colored) Infantry). The 38th and 41st were reorganized as the 25th, with headquarters in Jackson Barracks in New Orleans, Louisiana, in November 1869. The 39th and 40th were reorganized as the 24th, with headquarters at Fort Clark, Texas, in April 1869. The two black infantry regiments represented 10 percent of the size of all twenty-five infantry regiments. Similarly, the two black cavalry units represented 20 percent of the size of all ten cavalry regiments.

During the peacetime formation years (1865–1870), the black infantry and cavalry regiments were composed of black enlisted soldiers commanded by white commissioned officers and black noncommissioned officers. These included the first commander of the 10th Cavalry Benjamin Grierson, the first commander of the 9th Cavalry Edward Hatch, Medal of Honor recipient Louis H. Carpenter, and Nicholas M. Nolan. The first black commissioned officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers and the first black graduate of West Point, was Henry O. Flipper in 1877.

From 1870 to 1898, the total strength of the US Army totaled 25,000 service members, with black soldiers maintaining their ten percent representation.

==History==
===Indian Wars===
From 1867 to the early 1890s, these regiments served at a variety of posts in the Southwestern United States and the Great Plains regions. They participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars. In addition to the military campaigns, the Buffalo Soldiers served a variety of roles along the frontier, from building roads to escorting the U.S. mail. On April 17, 1875, regimental headquarters for the 10th Cavalry was transferred to Fort Concho, Texas. Companies actually arrived at Fort Concho in May 1873. The 9th Cavalry was headquartered at Fort Union from 1875 to 1881. At various times from 1873 through 1885, Fort Concho housed 9th Cavalry companies A–F, K, and M, 10th Cavalry companies A, D–G, I, L, and M, 24th Infantry companies D–G, and K, and 25th Infantry companies G and K.

From 1879 to 1881, portions of all four of the Buffalo Soldier regiments were in New Mexico pursuing Victorio and Nana and their Apache warriors in Victorio&#x27;s War. The 9th Cavalry spent the winter of 1890 to 1891 guarding the Pine Ridge Reservation during the events of the Ghost Dance War and the Wounded Knee Massacre. Cavalry regiments were also used to remove Sooners (whites), who were squatting (illegally occupying) native lands in the late 1880s and early 1890s.
 Buffalo Soldiers fought in the last engagement of the Indian Wars, the small Battle of Bear Valley in southern Arizona which occurred in 1918 between U.S. cavalry and Yaqui natives. In total, 23 Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.

===Range Wars===

The Buffalo Soldiers, specifically the 9th Cavalry, participated in two of the largest range conflicts in the American Old West. Range wars were battles fought between large cattle ranchers against smaller ranchers and farmers who competed for land, water, and livestock in the open range. Many of these conflicts resulted in military intervention to pacify and maintain peace. A lesser known action was the 9th Cavalry&#x27;s participation in the Colfax County War in Colfax County, New Mexico in 1873. Buffalo Soldiers were among the units sent, and on one occasion, some of them had a shootout with a group of Texas cowboys in the St. James Hotel. Three soldiers died during the shootout and a few months later one of the cowboys, Davy Crockett, who was involved, was killed by the local sheriffs. Notorious gunfighter, Clay Allison, shot and killed a black sergeant in a bar where he was drinking.

The 9th cavalry had a much larger participation in the fabled Johnson County War in Johnson County, Wyoming. It culminated in a lengthy shootout between local farmers, a band of hired killers, and a sheriff&#x27;s posse. The 6th Cavalry was ordered in by President Benjamin Harrison to quell the violence and capture the band of hired killers. Soon afterward, however, the 9th Cavalry was specifically called on to replace the 6th. The 6th Cavalry was swaying under the local political and social pressures and was unable to keep the peace in the tense environment. The Buffalo Soldiers responded within about two weeks from Nebraska, and moved the men to the rail town of Suggs, Wyoming, creating &quot;Camp Bettens&quot; despite a hostile local population. One soldier was killed and two wounded in a gun battle with locals. Nevertheless, the 9th Cavalry remained in Wyoming for nearly a year to quell tensions in the area.

===1898–1918===
After most of the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and participated in the 1898 Spanish–American War (including the Battle of San Juan Hill) in Cuba, where five more Medals of Honor were earned.

The men of the Buffalo Soldiers were the only African Americans that fought in Cuba during the war. Additionally, the 6th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment had a company of African-American soldiers, company L, that saw action in Puerto Rico. Up to 5,000 &quot;Black men&quot; enlisted in volunteer regiments in the Spanish–American War in Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, and some had all black officers. Several other African-American regiments of United States Volunteer Infantry (USVI) were formed and nicknamed &quot;Immune Regiments&quot;, due to having more natural resistance to malaria, yellow fever &amp; other tropical diseases, but only the 9th Immunes served overseas in the war.

The Buffalo Soldier regiments also took part in the Philippine–American War from 1899 to 1903 and the 1916 Mexican Expedition. There was strong opposition to war in the Philippines among African Americans. Many black soldiers established a rapport with &quot;the brown-skinned natives on the islands,&quot; and an unusually large number of black troops deserted during the campaign, some of whom joined the Filipino rebels, of whom the most famous was the celebrated David Fagen.

In 1918, the 10th Cavalry fought at the Battle of Ambos Nogales during the First World War, where they assisted in forcing the surrender of the federal Mexican and Mexican militia forces. In 1917, after being stationed in Houston, Texas, members of the 24th Infantry Regiment participated in the Houston riot of 1917 in which soldiers mutinied and marched on the city of Houston, killing over a dozen whites.

==Park Rangers==
Another little-known contribution of the Buffalo Soldiers involved eight troops of the 9th Cavalry Regiment and one company of the 24th Infantry Regiment who served in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada as some of the first national park rangers. In 1899, Buffalo Soldiers from Company H, 24th Infantry Regiment briefly served in Yosemite National Park, Sequoia National Park, and General Grant (Kings Canyon) National Parks.

U.S. Army regiments had been serving in these national parks since 1891, but until 1899, the soldiers serving were white. Beginning in 1899, and continuing in 1903 and 1904, African American regiments served during the summer in the second and third oldest national parks in the United States (Sequoia and Yosemite). Because these soldiers served before the National Park Service was created in 1916, they were &quot;park rangers&quot; before the term was coined.

A lasting legacy of the soldiers as park rangers is the campaign hat they wore (popularly known as the Smokey Bear hat). Although not officially adopted by the Army until 1911, the distinctive hat crease, called a Montana peak, (or pinch) can be seen being worn by several of the Buffalo Soldiers in park photographs dating back to 1899. Soldiers serving in the Spanish–American War began to re-crease the Stetson hat with a Montana &quot;pinch&quot; to better shed water from the torrential tropical rains. Many retained that distinctive crease upon their return to the U.S. The park photographs, in all likelihood, show Buffalo Soldiers who were veterans from that war.

One particular Buffalo Soldier stands out in history: Captain Charles Young, who served with Troop I, 9th Cavalry Regiment in Sequoia National Park during the summer of 1903. Young was the third African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy. At the time of his death, he was the highest-ranking African American in the U.S. military. He made history in Sequoia National Park in 1903 by becoming Acting Military Superintendent of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. Young was also the first African American superintendent of a national park. During Young&#x27;s tenure in the park, he named a giant sequoia for Booker T. Washington. Recently, another giant sequoia in Giant Forest was named in Captain Young&#x27;s honor. Some of Young&#x27;s descendants attended the ceremony.


In 1903, 9th Cavalrymen in Sequoia built the first trail to the top of Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous United States. They also built the first wagon road into Sequoia&#x27;s Giant Forest, the most famous grove of giant sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park.

In 1904, 9th Cavalrymen in Yosemite built an arboretum on the South Fork of the Merced River in the southern section of the park. This arboretum had pathways and benches, and some plants were identified in both English and Latin. Yosemite&#x27;s arboretum is considered to be the first museum in the National Park System. The NPS cites a 1904 report, where Yosemite superintendent (Lt. Col.) John Bigelow, Jr. declared the arboretum &quot;To provide a great museum of nature for the general public free of cost ...&quot; Unfortunately, the forces of developers, miners, and greed cut the boundaries of Yosemite in 1905 and the arboretum was nearly destroyed.

In the Sierra Nevada, the Buffalo Soldiers regularly endured long days in the saddle, slim rations, racism, and separation from family and friends. As military stewards, the African American cavalry and infantry regiments protected the national parks from illegal grazing, poaching, timber thieves, and forest fires. Yosemite Park Ranger Shelton Johnson researched and interpreted the history in an attempt to recover and celebrate the contributions of the Buffalo Soldiers of the Sierra Nevada.

==West Point==
On March 23, 1907, the United States Military Academy Detachment of Cavalry was changed to a colored unit. It had been proposed in 1897 at the &quot;Cavalry and Light Artillery School&quot; at Fort Riley, Kansas that West Point cadets learn their riding skills from the black noncommissioned officers who were considered the best. The 100-man detachment from the 9th, and 10th Cavalry served to teach future officers at West Point riding instruction, mounted drill, and tactics until 1947.

The West Point &quot;Escort of Honour&quot; detachment of the 10th Cavalry was distinguished in 1931 by being the last regular army unit to be issued with the M1902 blue dress uniform for all ranks. This parade uniform had ceased to be worn by other regiments after 1917.

The last commanding officer of the West Point detachment of the Buffalo Soldiers, (9th and 10th Cavalry,) was Lt. Col. John &quot;Duke&quot; Nazzaro. Nazzaro was known and recognized for standing with his detachment on and off the field. He established a college scholarship for descendants of the Buffalo Soldiers in his son, Thomas Nazzaro&#x27;s name.

==Prejudice==
The Buffalo Soldiers were often confronted with racial prejudice from other members of the U.S. Army. Civilians in the areas where the soldiers were stationed occasionally reacted to them with violence. Buffalo Soldiers were attacked during racial disturbances in Rio Grande City, Texas, in 1899, Brownsville, Texas, in 1906, and Houston, Texas, in 1917.

During the Spanish–American War, the 9th Cavalry faced violent conflict with white citizens in multiple cities in Florida including Lakeland and Tampa.

During the Indian Wars from 1866 to 1891, 416 soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor. Although the Buffalo Soldiers were 12% of the U.S. Army infantry force and 20% of the cavalry force in this era, Buffalo Soldiers were awarded less than 4% of all Medals of Honor awarded. Other regiments during the era received a greater number of Medals of Honor but were not distinguished enough to see duty in Cuba for the Spanish–American War. For example, the 8th Cavalry Regiment with 84 Medals of Honor, were not assigned duty to fight in Cuba in 1898. Scholars have hypothesized that commanders were reticent to award behavior that they expected from soldiers, the bureaucracy impeded awards, and the posting of black soldiers to remote outposts reduced the visibility of black soldiers (the 1st Cavalry participated in twenty-one campaigns and the 2nd cavalry participated in nineteen campaigns during this era, compared to the 9th Cavalry&#x27;s eight campaigns). Historian Thomas Phillips counted 2,704 engagements with native tribes during this era, of which the four black regiments participated in 141 or about 5%.

==Camp Logan mutiny==
The Camp Logan Mutiny, also known as the Houston riot of 1917, was a mutiny and riot by 156 soldiers from the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army, taking place on August 23, 1917, in Houston, Texas. 118 soldiers were tried in three courts-martial; 110 were convicted, of whom 19 were executed; and 63 sentenced to life imprisonment. The Army announced on November 13, 2023, that the convictions of the 110 soldiers were overturned after a thorough review by the Army Board for Correction of Military Records found that the soldiers were wrongly treated because of their race and not given fair trials.

==John J. Pershing==
General of the Armies John J. Pershing is a controversial figure regarding the Buffalo Soldiers. He served with the 10th Cavalry Regiment from October 1895 to May 1897, starting as a first lieutenant when he took command of a troop of the 10th in October 1895.

In 1897, Pershing became an instructor at West Point, where he joined the tactical staff. West Point cadets upset over Pershing&#x27;s disciplinary treatment and high standards took to calling him &quot;Nigger Jack&quot;, because he had learned to have full respect for black soldiers while leading them. Later during the Spanish–American War, where Pershing served with the 10th for six months in Cuba, the press softened the term to &quot;Black Jack&quot;, which they continued to use in World War I.

At the start of the Spanish–American War, First Lieutenant Pershing was offered a brevet rank and commissioned a major of volunteers on August 26, 1898. He fought with the 10th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) on Kettle and San Juan Hills in Cuba and was cited for gallantry.

During World War I, Pershing was the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, at this time he did not defend their full participation on the battlefield, but bowed to the racist policies of President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, and the Southern Democratic Party with its &quot;separate but equal&quot; philosophy.

Baker was cognizant of the many problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision-making during wartime, and gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit, but Pershing practiced careful realpolitik where black participation was concerned, not engaging in issues that might distract or diminish his command. Even so, Pershing allowed American soldiers (African Americans) to be under the command of a foreign power for the first time in American history.

==The Punitive Expedition, U.S.–Mexico border, and World War I==
The outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 against the long-time rule of President Porfirio Díaz initiated a decade-long period of high-intensity military conflict along the U.S.–Mexico border as different political/military factions in Mexico fought for power. The access to arms and customs duties from Mexican communities along the U.S.–Mexico boundary made border towns such as Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Ojinaga, Chihuahua, and Nogales, Sonora, important strategic assets. As the various factions in Mexico vied for power, the U.S. Army, including the Buffalo Soldier units, was dispatched to the border to maintain security. The Buffalo Soldiers played a key role in U.S.–Mexico relations as the maelstrom that followed the ousting of Díaz and the assassination of his successor Francisco Madero intensified.

By late 1915, the political faction led by Venustiano Carranza received diplomatic recognition from the U.S. government as the legitimate ruling force in Mexico. Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, who had previously courted U.S. recognition and thus felt betrayed, then attacked the rural community of Columbus, New Mexico, directly leading to further border tensions as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson unilaterally dispatched the Punitive Expedition into Chihuahua, Mexico, under General John Pershing to apprehend or kill Villa. The 9th and 10th regiments were deployed to Mexico along with the rest of Pershing&#x27;s units. Although the manhunt for Villa failed, small-scale confrontations in the communities of Parral and Carrizal nearly brought about a war between Mexico and the United States in the summer of 1916. Tensions cooled through diplomacy as the captured Buffalo Soldiers from Carrizal were released. Despite the public outrage over Villa&#x27;s Columbus raid, Wilson and his cabinet felt that the U.S.&#x27;s attention ought to be centered on Germany and World War I, not the apprehension of the &quot;Centauro del Norte&quot;. The Punitive Expedition exited Mexico in early 1917, just before the U.S. declaration of war against Germany in April 1917.

The Buffalo Soldiers did not participate with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I, but experienced noncommissioned officers were provided to other segregated Black units for combat service—such as the 317th Engineer Battalion. The soldiers of the 92nd and the 93rd infantry divisions were the first Americans to fight in France. The four regiments of the 93rd fought under French command for the duration of the war.

On August 27, 1918, the 10th Cavalry supported the 35th Infantry Regiment in a border skirmish in the border towns of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, between U.S. military forces, Mexican Federal troops, and armed Mexican civilians (militia) in the Battle of Ambos Nogales. This was the only incident in which German military advisers allegedly fought along with Mexican soldiers against United States soldiers on North America soil during World War I.

===Battle of Ambos Nogales===
The 35th Infantry Regiment was stationed at Nogales, Arizona, on August 27, 1918, when at about 4:10 p.m., a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the U.S. Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the U.S. Border Patrol did not exist until 1924). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regiment soldiers, and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated, and several soldiers were killed, and others wounded on both sides, including the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza (killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane). A cease-fire was arranged later after the US forces took the heights south of Nogales, Arizona.

Due in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops they led. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales before the August 27, 1918, battle documented the departure of part of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels.

Despite the Battle of Ambos Nogales controversy, the presence of the Buffalo Soldiers in the community left a significant impact on the border town. The famed jazz musician Charles Mingus was born in the Camp Stephen Little military base in Nogales in 1922, son of a Buffalo Soldier. The African American population, centered on the stationing of Buffalo Soldiers such as the 25th Infantry in Nogales, was a significant factor in the community, though they often faced racial discrimination in the binational border community in addition to racial segregation at the elementary-school level in Nogales&#x27;s Grand Avenue/Frank Reed School (a school reserved for black children). The redeployment of the Buffalo Soldiers to other areas and the closure of Camp Little in 1933 initiated the decline of the African American community in Nogales.

==World War II==
Before World War II, the black 25th Infantry Regiment was based at Ft Huachuca (Arizona). During the war, Ft Huachuca served as the home base of the Black 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions. The 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments were mostly disbanded, and the soldiers were moved into service-oriented units, along with the entire 2nd Cavalry Division. The 92nd Infantry Division, the &quot;Buffalo Division&quot;, served in combat during the Italian campaign. The 93rd Infantry Division—including the 25th Infantry Regiment—served in the Pacific theater. Separately, independent Black artillery, tank, and tank destroyer battalions, as well as quartermaster and support battalions served in World War II. All of these units to a degree carried out the traditions of the Buffalo Soldiers.

Despite some official resistance and administrative barriers, Black airmen were trained and played a part in the air war in Europe, gaining a reputation for skill and bravery (see Tuskegee Airmen). In early 1945, after the Battle of the Bulge, American forces in Europe experienced a shortage of combat troops, so the embargo on using black soldiers in combat units was relaxed. The American Military History says:

==Korean War and Desegregation ==
In 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981, which desegregated the military and marked the first federal piece of legislation that went against the societal norms implemented through Jim Crow laws. During the Korean War, black and white troops operated in integrated units for the first time.

The 24th Infantry Regiment saw combat during the Korean War and was the last segregated regiment to engage in combat. The 24th was deactivated in 1951, and its soldiers were integrated into other units in Korea. On December 12, 1951, the last Buffalo Soldier units, the 27th Cavalry and the 28th (Horse) Cavalry, were disbanded. The 28th Cavalry was inactivated at Assi-Okba, Algeria, in April 1944 in North Africa, and marked the end of the regiment.

Monuments to the Buffalo Soldiers are in Kansas at Fort Leavenworth and Junction City. Then–Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, who initiated the project to get a statue to honor the Buffalo Soldiers when he was posted as a brigadier general to Fort Leavenworth, was guest speaker for the unveiling of the Fort Leavenworth monument in July 1992.

==Controversy==
In the 21st century, the employment of the Buffalo Soldiers by the United States Army in the American Indian Wars has led some to call for the critical reappraisal of the African American regiments. In the opinion of some, the Buffalo Soldiers were used as mere shock troops or accessories to the forceful settler-colonialist and westward expansionist ambitions of the Federal U.S. government done at the expense of American Indian tribes.

==Legacy and honors==
Memorials
In 1973, West Point Academy would become the first military academy to honor the Buffalo Soldier, renaming the area at the academy where the Buffalo Soldiers trained future officers &quot;Buffalo Soldier Field&quot; and placing a memorial rock.at the northeast corner of the field.

The Buffalo Soldier Monument by American sculptor Eddie Dixon was installed at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, in 2021.

A monument dedicated to the Buffalo Soldiers, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, were initiated and dedicated in 1992 by Gen. Colin Powell to the memory of the 9th &amp; 10th Cavalry Regiments in the United States Army that were once only made up of black soldiers.

On March 25, 2013, the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906 was designated by United States President Barack Obama as a unit of the National Park Service. The 19th-century house museum also has an exhibit on African American soldier, Charles Young and the Buffalo Soldiers.

On February 20, 2014, officials at the United States Army post, Fort Bliss, changed the name of Robert E. Lee Road to Buffalo Soldier Road, recognizing the African-American units that moved through the fort in the 19th century; it also honors them since they protected American settlers in the west during the aftermath of the American Civil War.

On June 23, 2020, The El Paso, Texas City Council voted unanimously to rename Robert E. Lee Road in east-central El Paso as Buffalo Soldiers Road.

In September 2021, a new monument featuring a black soldier on horseback would be erected in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers on the west side of West Point Academy&#x27;s Buffalo Soldier Field. The plaque from the original memorial rock that was dedicated in 1973 would also be relocated and placed at the base of the new statue.

* At Fort Bliss, there is Buffalo Soldier Gate and Buffalo Soldier Visitor Center.
* The song and music of &quot;Soul Saga (Song of the Buffalo Soldier)&quot; has had several renditions. In 1974, it was produced by Quincy Jones in the album &quot;Body Heat&quot;. In 1975, the album &quot;Symphonic Soul&quot; contained another variation and was released by Henry Mancini and his Orchestra.
* The song &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;, co-written by Bob Marley and King Sporty, first appeared on the 1983 album &quot;Confrontation&quot;. Many Jamaicans, especially Rastafarians like Marley, identified with the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; as an example of black men who performed with exceeding courage, honor, valor, and distinction in a field that was dominated by whites and persevered despite endemic racism and prejudice.
* The song &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; by The Flamingos specifically refers to the 10th Cavalry Regiment. The song was a minor hit in 1970. &quot;A cappella&quot; group The Persuasions remade the song on their album &quot;Street Corner Symphony&quot;. This version was produced by David Dashev and Eric Malamud.
* The 1960 film &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; directed by John Ford and starring Jeffrey Hunter, Constance Towers, Woody Strode and Billie Burke. The film starred Strode as Sergeant Rutledge, a Black first sergeant in a colored regiment of the United States Cavalry, the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;. At a U.S. Army fort in the early 1880s, he is being tried by a court-martial for the rape and murder of a white girl as well as for the murder of the girl&#x27;s father, who was the commanding officer of the fort.

* A 1964 episode of &quot;Rawhide&quot; (&quot;Incident at Seven Fingers&quot;, season 6, episode 30, aired May 7, 1964) was about a top sergeant of Troop F, 110th Cavalry Regiment (played by William Marshall) who is accused of being a coward and a deserter. Other Buffalo Soldiers and an officer track him down.
* A 1968 episode of television series &quot;The High Chaparral&quot; (&quot;The Buffalo Soldiers&quot;, season 2, episode 10, aired November 22, 1968), starring Yaphet Kotto, had the 10th Cavalry, C Company called in to establish martial law at the request of the citizens of Tucson, to help relieve it from the grip of a crime boss.

* The 1997 television film &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; directed by Charles Haid and starring an ensemble cast including Lamont Bentley, Tom Bower, Timothy Busfield, Gabriel Casseus, Danny Glover, Bob Gunton, Keith Jefferson, Robert Knott, Carl Lumbly, Clifton Powell, Matt Ross, Glynn Turman, Michael Warren, and Mykelti Williamson. Set in 1880, the film tells the true story of the black cavalry corps known as the Buffalo Soldiers, who protected the Western territories after the end of the Civil War.
* A character named Buffalo Soldier makes an appearance in Rockstar Games&#x27; 2004 &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot;. Buffalo Soldier also makes an appearance in the &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; Legends and Killers pack as a returnable character.
* The 2017 Netflix Western series &quot;Godless&quot; has a camp of former Buffalo Soldiers that have turned to farming (their fighting days behind them). In the series it is explained that the term &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; is derived from when John Randall held off 70 Indians with only a pistol, having killed 13 of them while he sustained multiple wounds. This explanation however is largely fictitious.

<doc id="303111" wikidata="Q2456058" url="?curid=303111" title="Jamie Madrox">
<text>James Arthur Madrox, also called the Multiple Man, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/editor Len Wein, he first appeared in &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; #4 (February 1975).

A mutant with the ability to create instant duplicates of himself, Madrox was mainly a minor or supporting character until his appearance in the 1987 miniseries &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. The character underwent greater development under writer Peter David through his appearance in David&#x27;s run of the monthly series &quot;X-Factor&quot; (vol. 1) in the 1990s, and in David&#x27;s second and ongoing run of the title (vol. 3) in the 2000s.

The character has appeared in multiple television, film and video game adaptations, most notably in the 2006 film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Eric Dane.

==Creation==
Len Wein spoke on the creation of the character stating he wanted to name the character Xerox after the popular copying machine.

&quot;My original name for the character was Jamie ZERROX (Zerrox, the Multiple Man. Get it? Boy, was I clever in those days, When I passed the name by then Editor-in-Chief Roy Thomas, he looked at me like I had three heads. &quot;You&#x27;re kidding, right?&quot; he said. &quot;Who&#x27;s gonna pay off the huge lawsuit, you?&quot; &quot;But it&#x27;s not even spelled the same,&quot; I said. &quot;Not happening,&quot; said Roy. So I came up with a bunch of alternative until I came up with Madrox, that sounded like an action word, and thus it has been ever since.&quot;

==Publication history==

Jamie Madrox first appeared in &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; #4. 
In the 1990s, he played a major role in the series &quot;X-Factor&quot;. Writer Peter David later admitted that he was unhappy that he had to use Madrox in &quot;X-Factor&quot;, and it was only over the course of writing the series that he became one of his favorite characters. A &quot;MadroX&quot; miniseries was published in 2004, also written by David. He and the other members of his detective agency later starred in a revamped &quot;X-Factor&quot; monthly series that was again written by Peter David.

In 2018 he was featured in a second five-part solo series called &quot;Multiple Man&quot; written by Matthew Rosenberg and drawn by Andy MacDonald.

==Fictional character biography==

===Youth===
Jamie Madrox is born to a family living near the Los Alamos research facility in New Mexico; the background radiation may have stimulated his mutation. When Jamie is born, the doctor&#x27;s slap causes him to multiply into two identical babies. Professor Charles Xavier, a friend of the Madrox family, suggests that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy. Dr. Daniel Madrox, Jamie&#x27;s father, creates a suit for him to wear which is designed to absorb kinetic energy, the source of the duplication.

Later, Damian Tryp of Singularity Investigations makes his own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie is not just a normal mutant, but actually a &quot;changeling&quot;, a predecessor to mutants who develops its powers at birth. Jamie&#x27;s parents refuse to give Jamie to Tryp. When Jamie is fifteen years old, his parents are killed by a tornado alleged to have been caused by Tryp, and Jamie begins to run the farm by himself along with his duplicates, or &quot;dupes&quot;, until his suit is damaged.

In his first appearance his date of birth was listed as September 7, 1953.

===Muir Island===
Jamie Madrox goes to New York City for help where he meets Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four. He contacts Professor Xavier, who sends the youth to Muir Island with Moira McTaggert, to work in her laboratory and help her with research. He later helps Moira and fellow mutants Havok and Polaris in searching for the escaped mutant Proteus. Proteus hijacks one of Madrox&#x27;s duplicates as his own body, although this does not harm Madrox. Following the X-Men&#x27;s battle with Proteus on Muir Island, Madrox is invited to join the X-Men, but he declines.

One of Jamie&#x27;s renegade duplicates joins Siryn in the search for runaway New Mutants Sunspot and Warlock. After finding the two, Jamie joins the Fallen Angels.

===X-Factor===
Jamie Madrox is then one of the residents of Muir Island who comes under the mental control of the Shadow King. Following the destruction of Muir Island and the defeat of the Shadow King, he becomes a member of the second incarnation of the X-Factor team, which is assembled by Val Cooper as a U.S. government response team. Here, he develops a reputation as a prankster, forming a friendship with teammate Strong Guy. Also on the team is former New Mutant Wolfsbane who later joins his X-Factor Investigations.

In the first day of the team, one of his duplicates is shot and killed, and Madrox learns for the first time that he cannot absorb a deceased duplicate. This makes him realize for the first time how independent his duplicates actually are. This becomes clearer to him when a duplicate, working for Mister Sinister, decides that it wants to absorb the original, which it does for a short time, until Jamie&#x27;s dominant personality breaks free and reabsorbs the wayward dupe.

After he is exposed to the Legacy Virus while performing CPR on an infected Genoshan mutate, Jamie is forced to kill the Acolyte Seamus Mellencamp in self-defense by creating a dupe inside the mutant while his hand is in Mellencamp&#x27;s mouth. The clone later died from the Legacy Virus. Madrox does not often fight in cosmic battles like most of the other X-Men, but he fought doppelgangers during the Infinity War and, being religious, is taken by the cosmic entity Goddess during the Infinity Crusade.

Jamie&#x27;s health continues to deteriorate due to the Legacy Virus. An attempted cure by Haven leaves him dead, until it is revealed that it was a duplicate who had been infected and died; the real Madrox was alive and suffering from amnesia.

Jamie is the motivation for the Government-sponsored version of X-Factor to break ties with the government and go underground when the team is tricked into thinking Jamie and his duplicates are actually a squad of super-powered terrorists. Eventually, the team discovers this was a manipulation and the group goes rogue, splitting from the government.

He seeks out Strong Guy, ill after Jamie&#x27;s alleged death. Unfortunately, this makes Strong Guy even weaker, but Jamie&#x27;s mistake is fixed by the genius of new team leader Forge.

He then serves as majority staff for Banshee&#x27;s X-Corps. Banshee hires ex-criminals to police other mutants but things get bad when Mystique goes on a murderous rampage and has Mastermind&#x27;s daughter mind control them. The X-Men manage to defeat the renegade X-Corps members, he transfers to one of Xavier&#x27;s official &quot;non X-Men&quot; mutant teams in Paris&#x27;s X-Corporation, fighting Weapon XII in the Channel which results in the death of teammate Darkstar.

===Mutant Town===
After the fall of the X-Corporation, Jamie Madrox begins working as a private detective in the &quot;Mutant Town&quot; area of New York, along with former X-Factor teammates Wolfsbane and Strong Guy. In the passing time, Madrox has been sending out his duplicates to lead lives of their own. Among these dupes are a Shaolin monk and an Olympic Gymnast. By this point, his powers are developed to such an extent that any dupe who gains sufficient skills can pass its knowledge on to Jamie, giving him a wide variety of training instantly.

The side effect of excessive withdrawal from absorbing the duplicates leads him to gain their new personalities as well, which gives him a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which any new dupes may spontaneously generate any individual personality aspect of Jamie Prime, making them unpredicatible, as they more often than not disobey his orders or manifest as personalities that are too volatile or meek.

It is during this period that he encounters an assassin named Clay who has the same powers as Jamie. Although killed after telling Jamie that the Multiple Man has no idea what he truly is, Clay would come back later.

===X-Factor Investigations===
Following the elimination of all but a couple of hundred mutants from the face of the Earth in the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Jamie Madrox has upgraded his private detective agency to a new building, under the name X-Factor Investigations. He bought the building using money from a &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;-type show, using a room full of dupes as lifelines.

Still suffering from uncontrollable duplicate personalities, Jamie sends one to talk a de-powered Rictor out of jumping off a building who instead pushes him off. The dupe calls himself &quot;The X-Factor&quot; and threatens Madrox that he will come out whenever dupes are made, and Madrox won&#x27;t be able to tell before being reabsorbed, and Jamie&#x27;s new team adds Rictor to the group, along with M, and Siryn. Celebrating a victory after discovering he is not a mutant, but a changeling (see opening biography entry), Jamie has sex with Siryn, and an accidentally forgotten duplicate with M. When Jamie discovers and absorbs the duplicate, both women are furious with him.

Later, Layla Miller, without a home after House of M&#x27;s reality is shattered, reveals to Jamie that one day they will get married, and Wolfsbane will kill them both on their wedding night.

During &quot;Civil War&quot;, a duplicate Jamie had created a few years ago eventually becomes agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.; since he is an enforcer of the Superhuman Registration Act, he registered M and Rictor. However, the true Jamie and X-Factor stand opposed to the legislation, going so far as to make a public statement regarding their position, leading Jamie to go in direct opposition to the neutral stance taken by X-Men leader Cyclops upset at for Jamie withholding the truth about M-Day. Jamie also declares that the empty Mutant Town will be a sanctuary for superheroes being pursued by the government.

Agent Madrox recently met &quot;his&quot; end when he was surprised and re-absorbed by the original Madrox during an investigation of a HYDRA cell. Jamie continues the task of hunting down his stray duplicates and reabsorbing them, but he leaves one, John Maddox, who has carved out a life for himself as an Episcopal priest, husband and father, and Jamie decided not to reabsorb him. Siryn also discovers that she is pregnant by Jamie.

====&quot;Messiah Complex&quot;====
During the 2007 - 2008 &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, Cyclops sends Jamie Madrox and Layla Miller to go see Forge having built a machine that allows to monitor alternate timelines. Madrox sends two dupes to find information on two timelines that showed &quot;spikes&quot;, after the birth of the Mutant baby, due to two different timelines: one in which the newborn becomes the planet&#x27;s savior and another where it becomes its dominator. Before anyone can react, Layla jumps into the portal along with one of the dupes, and Madrox collapses into a coma.

Layla and one Madrox duplicate arrive eighty years in the negative future to discover that the mutant race has been severely decimated. Mutants are imprisoned in concentration camps overseen by humans. Layla and the dupe are captured and tattooed with an &quot;M&quot; for mutant over their eyes. There, they encounter a youthful Lucas Bishop that would gladly go back in time to kill the mutant baby responsible for the way this timeline has turned out. Layla straps a stolen grenade to the duplicate, killing him and sending his memories of the event back to Jamie so he can tell of Bishop&#x27;s treachery. When Jamie awakens, he develops an M tattoo because his body takes on scarring from duplicates. Jamie leaves and returns to X-Factor Investigations, disillusioned due to Layla&#x27;s loss.

The other duplicate later returns as the character Cortex.

====Sean====
Siryn goes into labor and proposes to Jamie Madrox, who accepts. Siryn gives birth to a boy, named Sean after her own father. Just hours after his birth, however, Sean, much to the horror of Jamie, Theresa and X-Factor, is absorbed into Jamie&#x27;s body as Jamie holds the boy, completely against Jamie&#x27;s will. Jamie realizes that the baby must have been fathered by a dupe rather than by him, and that &quot;the offspring of a dupe isn&#x27;t really anything more than a dupe&quot;. Siryn, filled with rage toward Jamie, breaks his finger and tells him to leave.

Jamie goes to see his preacher dupe John Maddox. Jamie realizes that if the child of a dupe is merely an &quot;infant dupe&quot;, then John&#x27;s son should have been absorbed either by John himself, or when Jamie ruffled the boys hair; therefore John&#x27;s son must not be his. John admits that he already knows his wife had an affair. Jamie reveals that he plans to kill himself over the grief caused by Sean, but is prevented by a holographic projection of an adult Layla Miller who takes him into the future.

====Summers Rebellion====
Jamie Madrox is transported to the future in the midst of the Summers Rebellion, where mutants rise up against Sentinel and human oppressors, which is led by Ruby Summers, the daughter of Cyclops and Emma Frost, with Cyclops&#x27;s optic blasts and Emma&#x27;s organic mineral body, Layla Miller, and a cyborg Cyclops whose predicament is Jamie&#x27;s fault.

After kissing Layla (now an adult) out of happiness at seeing her, Cyclops wants Jamie to find out why some mutants are winking out of existence. The group visit an aging senile Doctor Doom who says Layla told him in the past that he&#x27;d have to instruct Jamie and her on something in the future, and it is now.

In the present, a former mutant named Lenore ask assistance to X-Factor, claiming that someone was trying to kill her. She felt she was being followed, but every time she looked, it was a different person doing it. Her best friend Candy, another former mutant, was found dead of a gunshot wound which the police ruled a suicide. Lenore didn&#x27;t believe it, because Candy had a pathological fear of guns. Before Candy died, she told Lenore that she thought she was being followed. Later, Lenore&#x27;s mother showed up at Lenore&#x27;s apartment and attempted to shoot her, but was foiled by Longshot. Escaping, Lenore&#x27;s mother took Darwin hostage. At the last minute, she turned the gun on herself, but it backfired due to Longshot&#x27;s luck powers. At the hospital, Monet St. Croix attempted to read Lenore&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mind, but was overpowered and collapsed. When she woke up, she grabbed Longshot&#x27;s throat and said &quot;Cortex&quot;.

While Strong Guy and Rictor were visiting John Maddox in Vermont, Shatterstar busted through the window and tried to stab Rictor, saying only &quot;Cortex&quot;. Once freed of Cortex&#x27; control, Shatterstar and Rictor shared a passionate kiss. When Cortex tried to bring Longshot under his mental and physical control, he noted that Longshot and Shatterstar were in many ways identical.

Once she calmed down, Monet told the group that her violent outburst was because of psychic feedback that occurred after she had broken through a psychic barrier in Lenore&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mind, but that whatever was controlling her had fled. She then manipulated the group into moving Lenore out of her apartment and hiding her in a penthouse suite in an expensive hotel. There she tried to seduce Darwin, but he figured out that she was acting out of character only to try to get Lenore alone, and so resisted. Monet&#x27;s body turned bright purple and became covered in tint lights and circuitry. She said that she would then have to kill Darwin, even though he wasn&#x27;t on Cortex&#x27;s list. This suggests that whatever Monet had become, she was acting somewhat independently of Cortex himself while receiving instructions from him.

When Cortex loses control over Monet, he is attacked and his hood falls back revealing that he is a duplicate of Madrox. Having his identity uncovered Cortex reveals himself as the second duplicate sent to one of the two &quot;remaining&quot; futures for mutantkind during the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, to search for a cure for the depowering of 98% of the world&#x27;s mutants following M-Day, then die in some fashion so that his memories would be transferred back to Madrox.

How this duplicate travelled from the alternative future he was sent to Earth-1191 remains a mystery. The only thing known is that under the direction of Anthony Falcone, who in turn was under the guidance of Damian Tryp from Earth-616, this duplicate was turned into a &quot;doomlock&quot;, a chronal variance inhibitor which stops the creation of divergent timelines, which required massive cybernetic modification of his body. He was then sent back in time from Earth-1191 to Earth-616 to kill a list of specific individuals, including Multiple Man, for fear how they might affect the future. As Cortex, Madrox&#x27;s duplicate apparently has the power to mentally control several people at once.

Meanwhile, on Earth-1191, the Multiple Man was tasked by Cyclops with discovering why certain people seemed to be blinking out and then back into existence. Multiple Man theorized that someone might be altering the past to affect the future. Cortex was attempting to kill Lenore to prevent Hecat&#x27;e (of the Summers Rebellion) from being born.

====2010–present====
During the 2010 &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Multiple Man is among the heroes that Hercules assembles to help combat the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Because of what happened in the death realms, the Multiple Man dupes that fell in battle return from the dead alongside the other X-Men that died in battle.

In the 2012 &quot;They Keep Killing Madrox&quot; storyline, Jamie Madrox is fatally impaled by a demon named Bloodbath, and finds himself being repeatedly transported to a series of alternate Earths, including one in which Layla Miller was murdered on the night of her marriage to Madrox by Rahne Sinclair&#x27;s daughter, another in which Captain America has become Deathlok, and another in which Doctor Strange has been killed by the demonic Dormammu. When Madrox returns to his own Earth, the overjoyed Layla Miller passionately confesses feelings to him. The X-Factor team then discover that Deathlok, Rahne&#x27;s daughter, and Dormammu have been transported to Madrox&#x27;s home Earth as well. Madrox and Layla later marry in Las Vegas without incident. After the events of the Hell on Earth War, Jamie and Layla retire and decide to live on Madrox&#x27;s family farm.

During the 2016 &quot;Death of X&quot; storyline Madrox and his dupes fatally succumb to the Terrigen Mist, alerting the X-Men to the danger of the Mist.

In the 2018 miniseries &quot;Multiple Man&quot;, one of Madrox&#x27;s dupes is found locked in a bunker on Muir Island, and brought to the X-Men. This dupe is revealed to embody the treacherous aspects of the original Madrox and deliberately locked himself up for several years to find a way to become the new Jamie Prime. However, tests reveal that he is also inflicted with the M-Pox. The dupe convinces Beast to create a serum that would allow him to become the new Prime. He also steals a time machine from Bishop and goes into the future, and becomes the emperor of a totalitarian regime that is policed by his own dupes, although he is opposed by a Resistance that is mostly composed of his other dupes who don&#x27;t approve his ways. The dupes from the Resistance are sent into the timestream to find help from a heroic-time traveling Madrox, who is revealed to be the Emperor from the further in the future who had a change of heart. After the death of the Emperor, all of the dupes die. However, one of the dupes, who was supposed to find Tony Stark, ends up becoming a bartender on a beach. He survives the Emperor&#x27;s death, as he was in a different time period at the time, and only returns to the present-day after that time period took a turn for the worst, as evident by the &quot;X&quot; tattoo over his right eye. He takes the serum Beast made for him and sets out to find the wife and child of the original Madrox.

During the 2019 &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; storyline, Madrox rejoins Cyclops&#x27;s new team of X-Men. He and a number of his dupes are all killed by Sentinels after acting as a human shield for his teammates.

==Powers and abilities==
Jamie Madrox has the power to create perfect copies of himself, which he calls &quot;dupes&quot;, and all items on his person (clothing, weaponry, etc.) through impact when he absorbs kinetic energy (although this sometimes has happened at will) through an unknown process. Most of the time, this is caused by him snapping his fingers, stomping his foot, being struck, or collisions. Each of the duplicates has exactly the same power as Jamie himself, and has independent thought, though Madrox &quot;Prime&quot; is usually telepathically and empathically linked to the dupes. His powers have, at least once, been shown to affect the actual design of the shirt he was wearing.

Jamie &quot;Prime&quot; can absorb a dupe back into himself at will, which also makes him absorb the memories, knowledge, and skills of the duplicate. The dupe usually appears right beside the body it &quot;springs&quot; from. It has been noted that dupes have trouble creating more dupes themselves if they have not used their powers for a while, while Madrox is able to use his ability whenever he wants without any such issue.

Jamie was formerly unable to control the duplication process, wearing a special shock-absorbent synthetic stretch fabric costume that contained mechanisms that absorbed kinetic energy so that an army of Madroxes would not instantly appear every time he was struck. The original suit was designed by his father, Dr. Daniel Madrox, and later modified by Reed Richards. Jamie currently wears a stylized shirt with only six large green shock-absorbent pads on the front of the torso. Whether this indicates a greater degree of control over when his dupes manifest, an advance in technology or if it is simply an ordinary shirt with the same design is unclear.

During his time with X-Factor, the maximum number of dupes Madrox could create, including duplicates of the dupes themselves, was approximately 50, but the limit has grown far beyond that, as when Hydra tried to manipulate Jamie into becoming one of them. Their plan backfired because he cannot be mind-controlled, which instead resulted in an immense number of Madroxes that drowned the organization&#x27;s cohorts. Duplicates have independent minds from the original, but are usually willing to merge back because their memories and knowledge are retained. However, there have been exceptions where duplicates have wished for independence completely, even going so far as to have malicious duplicates intending great harm to the Prime during Peter David&#x27;s original and modern &quot;X-Factor&quot; runs (which featured Madrox&#x27;s dupes manifesting as aspects of the Prime Madrox&#x27;s personality rather than straightforward duplicates).

As a last-ditch effort, Madrox&#x27;s abilities can be used to deadly effect, which were used in self-defense against Seamus Mellencamp, when Madrox jammed his hand into Mellencamp&#x27;s mouth and activated his power, creating a duplicate inside Mellencamp and exploding him from the inside out. He has used this method to threaten people before, as well.

Madrox&#x27;s duplicates can perish without long term physical harm to himself, as demonstrated when the mutant Proteus possessed a duplicate then consumed its life force — leaving only a burnt out husk, as with all victims of Proteus. The possession caused Madrox to collapse in pain, aware of what was happening, but he later recovered. Another Madrox dupe died of the Legacy Virus, but Madrox himself was unaffected, although he would presumably have received the virus if he absorbed the infected dupe.

Madrox also uses merging with his duplicates as a form of healing. Uninjured dupes &quot;share&quot; the damage when they merged. If an injured Madrox or dupe merged with an uninjured version, the &quot;new&quot; version had an injury half as severe as the original injury. This method may depend upon the severity of the injury, such as when the M-tattooed dupe sent his scarring to the original.

As a consequence of splitting into multiple selves, Jamie has accumulated a vast wealth of knowledge and experience, along with some confusion over which Jamie did what. For example, although he says his duplicates have had active sex lives, he is not sure whether he himself ever has, to the point that he was once uncertain whether he or a dupe had conceived his son Sean with Siryn (with the result that his body absorbed his infant son the first time he held the boy, as his body regarded the baby as another dupe rather than an independent entity).

Specific special skills accumulated through his vast experience include picking locks, some proficiency in Shaolin Kung Fu, handgun training, multiple languages including Russian and Hawaiian, and playing-card throwing. One of his dupes was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, giving him all the prerequisite espionage training. Along the way, he or his duplicates participated in an Olympic gymnastics team and apparently became a licensed attorney.

Madrox has generally been considered a mutant. Unlike most mutants, whose mutant powers emerge during adolescence, Madrox exhibited his gifts from the day he was born. In &quot;X-Factor,&quot; Damian Tryp declares Madrox is not a mutant, but a &quot;killcrop&quot; like him, so named because they were believed to cause bad harvests in olden times.

<text>The Cordillera Central or Cordillera Range is a massive mountain range long north–south and east-west situated in the north-central part of the island of Luzon, in the Philippines. The mountain range encompasses all provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region (Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province), as well as portions of eastern Ilocos Norte, eastern Ilocos Sur, eastern La Union, northeastern Pangasinan, western Nueva Vizcaya, and western Cagayan.

To the north, the mountain range terminates at the northern shores of Luzon along the Babuyan Channel in Ilocos Norte and Cagayan provinces. At its southeastern part, the Central Cordillera is linked to the Sierra Madre Mountains, the longest mountain range in the country, through the Caraballo Mountains in Nueva Vizcaya province. During Spanish colonial period, the whole range was called &quot;Nueva Provincia&quot; (New Province).

==Geography==


The Cordillera Central is the highest mountain range in the Philippines. It comprises about 1/6 of the whole Luzon island with a total area of . The highest mountain in the range, Mount Pulag, is also the highest mountain in Luzon at . It is officially the third highest mountain in the country after Mount Dulang-dulang and Mount Apo on Mindanao Island, the second largest island of the Philippines.

The mountain range separates the Ilocos plains on the west and the Cagayan Valley on the east. It also affects the weather pattern in the island of Luzon in such it acts as a barrier against the Northeast and Southwest monsoons as well as cyclones crossing the island.

This is the biggest and highest mountain chain in the Philippines, measuring long north to south, and width east to west, and consists of three ranges. The Malayan Range is located in the northern and western portion of the Cordillera, followed by the Central Range, and then the Polis Range in the eastern portion. Mount Data contains the headwaters for Suyoc, which flows into the Abra River, the Chico flows into the Cagayan River, the Asin flows into the Magat River, and the Agno River flows into Lingayen Gulf.

==Environment==
The mountains support a number of different types of habitat. Elevations above are covered in Luzon tropical pine forests of Benguet pine (&quot;Pinus insularis&quot;) except in the north of the range where the high slopes consist of Luzon montane rain forests. Elevations below 1000 meters are in the Luzon rain forests ecoregion.

Two major problems threaten the environment of the Cordillera: dam projects flood river valleys and remove habitat and also cause people to flee their houses and seek refuge in other areas; mining project destroy forest areas and also don&#x27;t create wealth and resources for the upkeep of the tribal lands.

==People==
===Inhabitants===

Most of the Cordillera Central is the ancestral domain of the &#x27;people of the mountains.&#x27; These ethno-linguistic groups include: Abra (Itneg), Apayao (Apayao), Benguet (Kankanaey and Ibaloi), Ifugao (Ifugao), Kalinga (Kalinga) and Mountain Province (Bontoc and Kankanaey). Each of these major ethno-linguistic groups has its own family of languages and cultures.

An alternative listing for the Northern Philippine tribes is: Apayao/Isnag, Abra/Tinguian, Kalinga, Gaddang, Applai, Bontoc, Bago, I-lagod, Kankana-ey, Kangkanai, Balangao, Ibaloi, Ifugao, Ikalahan, Kalanguya, Karao and Ilongot.

===Culture and language===
Beside their own tribal cultures, there is a Cordilleran culture which is largely molded by the geography of the Cordilleras, and their common heritage of resisting the invading imperial powers (Spain, United States, and Japan in the past – and after 1946 the central government in Manila is also regarded as such), including the continuing adverse encroachments by lowlanders.

==Economy==
The Cordillera Central is one of the country&#x27;s richest regions in terms of natural resources, a major resource base of the Philippines. It contains 11% of the total area is agricultural rice fields, orchards, pig farms and pasture lands. 60% of the country&#x27;s temperate vegetables are produced in the area. It is the country&#x27;s premier mining district. There are eight big mining companies operating which are mostly foreign controlled. Some 80% of the total Philippine gold production comes from the Cordillera.

The range is also home to the headwaters of the major rivers in Northern Luzon, with several dams which include the Ambuklao and Binga in Benguet.

==History==
The Philippines was already of interest to Spain before the Spaniards even reached the land. In 1565, reports of huge gold mines in the Cordillera reached the Viceroy of Mexico, which led to the first official Spanish expedition to the Cordillera in 1576. King Philip III, waging the Thirty Year War which needed funding, sent orders for large expeditions to the Philippines.

In 1620, Captain Garcia de Aldana Cabrera offered the resisting Igorot tribal leaders clemency if they were willing to accept Catholic religion, obey the Spanish government and pay a fifth of all their mined gold to the Spanish king. They refused and the Spanish conquerors built forts and organized military troops to start the exploitation of the gold mines.

During the years that followed, the Spanish managed to trade gold despite setbacks from the Igorots, who because of their resistance remained relatively independent from Spanish rule. The price that the Igorots had to pay for this independence was that they became different from their colonized brothers.

The Philippines staged Asia&#x27;s first nationalistic revolution in 1896, and declared its independence on June 12, 1898. The newly founded country was soon taken over by the United States of America. The US was the first foreign nation to fully invade the highlands of the Cordillera to push the mining operations in the territory.

Spain relinquished control of the Philippines to the United States of America due to the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which officially ended the hostilities of the Spanish–American War. After a short period of peace in the region after the treaty was finalized the Philippine–American War began until 1902, though pockets of fighting did not end until 1913. The result of these conflicts led to the US declaring the Philippines a protectorate, a form of colonialism with local autonomy. The United States established strategic military bases in the Philippines with the consent of the established government in Manila. During World War II, the Japanese temporarily seized control of the Philippines. A combined effort between the American armed forces and the Philippine commonwealth military managed to successfully drive out the Japanese by 1945.

On September 27, 1927, the Benguet Consolidated Mining Company discovered one of the richest veins of gold ever, at a time when the US was entering the Great Depression. This was the start of a real gold rush into Cordillera region: in 1929, there were 94 mining companies, by 1933 there were 17,812.

This extreme growth had tremendous results for the landscape; it changed the original one way Mountain Trail into a busy highway despite the road slides and cuts that occur up to this day. Again, similar to the fight against the Spanish, the indigenous inhabitants protested against the destruction of their land and the neglecting of their rights. Mining operations continued to grow and by 1939 the Philippines ranked among the world&#x27;s leading gold producers, and second to the state of California among US producers.

From 1936 to 1946, the Philippines was granted domestic self-administration under the Commonwealth of the Philippines as a transitional period for complete independence. From 1941 to 1945, the country fell under Japanese rule and was liberated by military forces of the United States of America, and dare inside by the combined forces of the Allied Philippine Commonwealth military forces and local Igorot and Cordilleran guerrilla forces in Northern Luzon. The US subsequently recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946.

The independent republic&#x27;s policy shifted towards the integration of the &#x27;cultural minorities&#x27; into mainstream culture. In 1966 the Philippine Congress passed the &#x27;Separation Bill&#x27;, dividing the old Mountain Province into four: Benguet, Mountain Province (Bontoc), Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao. The political elite hoped that the creation of several provinces would, by increasing the region&#x27;s representation, increase development spending in the area.

Under the Marcos&#x27; administration, politicization of the Cordillera took a new turn. National government development projects in the area were against the interests of the indigenous peoples, and were strongly resisted by them. Particularly important were the Chico River Dam project and the Cellophil project. The first threatened to inundate traditional villages, the second gave outsiders control over vast forest lands. Resistance resulted in increased regional consciousness rather than local ethnic consciousness.

In 1986 the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown by the People Power Revolution of the Philippines and he was succeeded by Corazon Aquino.

However, the Aquino administration failed to tackle substantial issues such as land reform and the restructuring of the economy. After the collapse of the negotiations between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF), Aquino declared the &quot;Total War Policy&quot;, aimed at recovering New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) controlled areas and to destroy the NPA&#x27;s organizational and infrastructure base. The NPA had moved into the Cordillera to assist in the resistance against the projects.

<text>Darrell Ray Porter (January 17, 1952 – August 5, 2002) was an American professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1971 to 1987 for the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, St. Louis Cardinals, and Texas Rangers. The four-time All-Star was known for his excellent defensive skills and power hitting ability.
He struggled but was never able to overcome a substance abuse problem, yet went on to become the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals. Porter died from accidental drug toxicity in 2002 at the age of 50.

==Biography==

===Playing career===
Born in Joplin, Missouri, Porter was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (4th overall) of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft out of Southeast High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He made his major league debut on September 2, 1971, with the Brewers at age 19. He finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting. Porter was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1974. On December 6, 1976, the Milwaukee Brewers traded Porter along with Jim Colborn to the Kansas City Royals for Jamie Quirk, Jim Wohlford and Bob McClure.

Porter replaced Buck Martinez as the Royals starting catcher. He had the best season of his career in 1979 when, he posted a .291 batting average along with 20 home runs, 112 runs batted in, and led the league with 121 walks. He became only the sixth catcher in Major League history to score 100 runs and have 100 runs batted in. The feat had previously been accomplished by Mickey Cochrane, Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Johnny Bench, and Carlton Fisk—all in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Only Porter and Cochrane had 100 walks, 100 runs, and 100 RBI in a single season. He ended the 1979 season ranked third in Wins Above Replacement behind Fred Lynn and his Royals teammate George Brett. With the Royals, he was selected to three consecutive American League All-Star teams.

====Drug problems====
Porter told the Associated Press that during the winter of 1979–1980, he became paranoid, and he was convinced by teammates that baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn—who was known to be tough on drug use—knew about his drug abuse. Porter said he believed that Kuhn was trying to sneak into his house and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out of the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach while clutching billiard balls and a shotgun.

During spring training in 1980, former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe paid a visit to the Kansas City clubhouse. He asked the players ten questions, the point of which being if a player answered three or more of the questions with an affirmation, the player might have a problem with drugs or alcohol. Porter affirmed all ten questions and checked himself into a rehabilitation center, admitting he had abused alcohol, cocaine, Quaaludes, and marijuana.

====Later career====
After checking into the rehab center, Porter became a born-again Christian, married, and became a spokesman for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. His production on the field declined after rehab, and he never again approached his 1979 levels. He went on to play in three World Series—in 1980 with the Royals and in 1982 and 1985 with the St. Louis Cardinals. Porter won both the 1982 National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award and the 1982 World Series MVP Award. At the time, Porter was only the second player in baseball history to win both awards in a single postseason; Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates won both awards in 1979. After the 1985 season, the Cardinals released Porter, and he wound up his career with two seasons with the Texas Rangers as a catcher and designated hitter. In 1986 Porter led Major League Baseball with a home run every 12.9 at bats, the best ratio that season for any player with 10 or more home runs. He also broke his ankle during the 1986 season and was on the disabled list for eight weeks. He appeared in his final major league game on October 4, 1987, and retired at the age of 35.
===Personal life===
Porter was married twice. His first marriage, in 1972 to the former Teri Brown, ended in divorce in 1976. On November 29, 1980, Porter married Deanne Gaulter, who survived him in death. The couple had three children: Lindsey, Jeffrey, and Ryan.

In 1984, Porter wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Snap Me Perfect!&quot;, in which he detailed his life in baseball and his struggles with substance abuse.
===Later life and death===
In 2000, Porter was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

On August 5, 2002, Porter left his home in Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri, saying he was going to buy a newspaper and go to the park. That afternoon at 5:26 p.m. CDT, he was found dead outside his vehicle in Sugar Creek, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City. An autopsy found he had died of &quot;toxic effects of cocaine.&quot; The autopsy indicated that the level of cocaine in Porter&#x27;s system—consistent with recreational use—induced a condition called excited delirium (a diagnosis that is now rejected by the medical community) that caused his heart to stop. Police theorized that Porter&#x27;s car went off a road and got caught on a tree stump in La Benite Park in Sugar Creek. Police say Porter got out of the car, walked to the nearby Missouri River, and then walked back to his car. Authorities had initially speculated that he overheated while trying to push the car off the stump in high heat and humidity, but there was no evidence to indicate that he tried to move the car. The exact details surrounding his death remain unknown.

==Career statistics==
In a 17-year major league career, Porter played in 1,782 games, accumulating 1,369 hits in 5,539 at bats for a .247 career batting average along with 188 home runs, 826 runs batted in and a .354 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .982 fielding percentage. As of the 2009 season, he ranked 21st on the all-time list for home runs by a catcher and 20th all-time for RBI by a catcher. Porter caught two no-hitters during his career—Jim Colborn in 1977 and Bob Forsch&#x27;s second career no-hitter in 1983. Porter was also notable for being one of the few Major League catchers of his time to wear eyeglasses behind the plate at a time when most players needing vision correction were using contact lenses.

<doc id="303126" wikidata="Q2115975" url="?curid=303126" title="Festivus">
<text>Festivus () is a secular holiday celebrated on December 23 as an alternative to the perceived pressures and commercialism of the Christmas season. Originally created by author Daniel O&#x27;Keefe, Festivus entered popular culture after it was made the focus of the 1997 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Strike&quot;, which O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s son, Dan O&#x27;Keefe, co-wrote.

The non-commercial holiday&#x27;s celebration, as depicted on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, occurs on December 23 and includes a Festivus dinner, an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole, practices such as the &quot;airing of grievances&quot; and &quot;feats of strength&quot;, and the labeling of easily explainable events as &quot;Festivus miracles&quot;. The episode refers to it as &quot;a Festivus for the rest of us&quot;.

It has been described both as a parody holiday festival and as a form of playful consumer resistance. Journalist Allen Salkin describes it as &quot;the perfect secular theme for an all-inclusive December gathering&quot;.

== History ==
Festivus was conceived by author and editor Daniel O&#x27;Keefe, the father of television writer Dan O&#x27;Keefe, and was celebrated by his family as early as 1966. While the Latin word means &quot;excellent, jovial, lively&quot;, and derives from &quot;fēstus&quot;, meaning &quot;joyous; holiday, feast day&quot;, &quot;Festivus&quot; in this sense was coined by the elder O&#x27;Keefe. According to him, the name &quot;just popped into my head&quot;. In the original O&#x27;Keefe tradition, the holiday would take place to celebrate the anniversary of Daniel O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s first date with his future wife, Deborah. The phrase &quot;a Festivus for the rest of us&quot; originally referred to those remaining after the death of the elder O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s mother, Jeanette, in 1976; i.e., the &quot;rest of us&quot; are the living, as opposed to the dead.

In 1982, Daniel O&#x27;Keefe wrote a book, &quot;Stolen Lightning: The Social Theory of Magic&quot;, that deals with idiosyncratic ritual and its social significance, a theme relevant to Festivus tradition.

It is now celebrated on December 23, as depicted in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode written by the younger O&#x27;Keefe.

=== &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ===
The &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode that featured Festivus was titled &quot;The Strike&quot;, although O&#x27;Keefe notes that the writers later wished they had named it &quot;The Festivus&quot;. It was first broadcast on December 18, 1997. The plot revolves around Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards) returning to work at his old job, H&amp;H Bagels. While dining at Monk&#x27;s Restaurant, as George Costanza (Jason Alexander) is opening his mail, he receives a card from his father saying, &quot;Dear Son, Happy Festivus.&quot; This leads to Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) discussing George&#x27;s father&#x27;s creation of Festivus despite George not wanting it to be discussed. Kramer then becomes interested in resurrecting the holiday when, at the bagel shop, Frank Costanza (Jerry Stiller) tells him how he created Festivus as an alternative holiday in response to the commercialization of Christmas.

Meanwhile, George creates donation cards for a fake charity called The Human Fund (with the slogan &quot;Money for People&quot;) in lieu of having to give office Christmas presents. When his boss, Mr. Kruger (Daniel von Bargen), questions George about a $20,000 check he gave George to donate to the Human Fund as a corporate donation, George hastily concocts the excuse that he made up the Human Fund because he feared persecution for his beliefs, of celebrating Festivus instead of Christmas. Attempting to call his bluff, Kruger goes home with George to see Festivus in action.

Kramer eventually goes back on strike from his bagel-vendor job when his manager tells him he cannot take December 23 off to celebrate his newfound holiday. Kramer is then seen on the sidewalk picketing H&amp;H Bagels, carrying a sign reading &quot;Festivus yes! Bagels no!&quot; and chanting to anyone passing the store: &quot;Hey! No bagel, no bagel, no bagel...&quot;

Finally, at Frank&#x27;s house in Queens, New York, Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and George gather to celebrate Festivus. George brings Kruger to prove to him that Festivus is &quot;all too real&quot;.

O&#x27;Keefe was initially reluctant to insert his family&#x27;s tradition into this episode, but when executive producers Alec Berg and Jeff Schaffer learned of the bizarre holiday through O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s brother, they became curious, then enthusiastic, then insisted that it be included in the episode. Schaffer later reflected: &quot;That&#x27;s the thing with &quot;Seinfeld&quot; stories, the real ones are always the best ones. There&#x27;s a nuance to reality sometimes that is just perfect. We could have sat in a room for a billion years and we never would have made up Festivus. It&#x27;s crazy and hilarious and just so funny and so disturbing. It&#x27;s awesome.&quot;

== Festivus practices and traditions ==

The Festivus practices and traditions began as original O&#x27;Keefe family practices, and later expanded to include the traditions introduced in the 1997 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Strike&quot;.

===O&#x27;Keefe family practices (1966–1997)===
The O&#x27;Keefe family holiday featured other practices, as detailed in &quot;The Real Festivus&quot; (2005), a book by Daniel O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s son, Dan O&#x27;Keefe. Besides providing a first-person account of the early version of the Festivus holiday as celebrated by the O&#x27;Keefe family, the book relates how Dan O&#x27;Keefe amended or replaced details of his father&#x27;s invention to create the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode.

==== Festivus clock ====
In a 2013 CNN segment on the origins of Festivus, O&#x27;Keefe spoke about the real-life experiences related to the holiday. O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s father, who originated some of the now-recognized Festivus traditions, used a clock in a bag nailed to a wall, not an aluminum pole. It was never the same bag, rarely the same clock, but always the same wall. The nailing was most often done in secret and then revealed proudly to his family. The younger O&#x27;Keefe told CNN: &quot;The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year...I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t know what it means, he would never tell me. He would always say, &#x27;That&#x27;s not for you to know.

===Fictional practices introduced due to the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; television episode (1997–onwards)===

The holiday, as portrayed in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, includes practices such as the &quot;airing of grievances&quot;. During the Festivus meal, each person is given the chance to &quot;air their grievances&quot; by telling everyone else at the table all of the ways that they have disappointed the speaker during the past year. After the meal, the &quot;feats of strength&quot; are performed, involving wrestling the head of the household to the floor, with the holiday ending only if the head of the household is pinned.

==== Festivus pole ====
In the episode, the tradition of Festivus begins with an aluminum pole. Frank Costanza cites its &quot;very high strength-to-weight ratio&quot; as appealing. During Festivus, the pole is displayed unadorned, as Frank finds &quot;tinsel distracting.&quot; Dan O&#x27;Keefe credits fellow &quot;Seinfeld&quot; writer Jeff Schaffer with introducing the concept. The aluminum pole was not part of the original O&#x27;Keefe family celebration, which centered on putting a clock in a bag and nailing it to a wall.

In 2021 the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; Twitter, YouTube and other social media accounts, along with the environmental organization One Tree Planted, tried to give a new environmental meaning to the pole, pledging to plant a tree for every person that posted a selfie with a pole using the hashtag #FestivusSavesTrees. Pointing out that using a Festivus pole instead of a Christmas tree saves a tree, they also said that for this purpose the pole would not have to be aluminum but could be any kind of pole of any size.

==== Festivus dinner ====
In &quot;The Strike&quot;, a celebratory dinner is shown on the evening of Festivus prior to the feats of strength and during the airing of grievances. The on-air meal shows Estelle Costanza serving a sliced reddish meatloaf-shaped food on a bed of lettuce. In the episode no alcohol is served at the dinner, but George&#x27;s boss, Mr. Kruger, drinks something from a hip flask.

The original holiday dinner in the O&#x27;Keefe household featured turkey or ham as described in Dan O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;The Real Festivus&quot;.

==== Airing of grievances ====
The &quot;airing of grievances&quot; takes place immediately after the Festivus dinner has been served. In the television episode, Frank Costanza began it with the phrase, &quot;I got a lotta problems with you people, and now you&#x27;re going to hear about it!&quot; It consists of each person given a chance to lash out at both their dinner companions and the world in general, and tell them how they&#x27;ve disappointed them during the past year. Some mental health professionals believe that having a space for people to air some of their grievances to their families and friends could actually be good for mental health, although it is something other holidays usually avoid.

==== Feats of strength ====
The &quot;feats of strength&quot; are the final tradition observed in the celebration of Festivus, celebrated immediately following (or in the case of &quot;The Strike&quot;, during) the Festivus dinner. The head of the household selects one person at the Festivus celebration and challenges them to a wrestling match. Tradition states Festivus is not over until the head of the household has been pinned. In &quot;The Strike&quot;, however, Kramer manages to circumvent the rule by creating an excuse to leave. The feats of strength are mentioned twice in the episode before they take place. In both instances, no detail was given as to what had happened, but in both instances, George Costanza ran out of the coffee shop in a mad panic, implying he had bad experiences with the feats of strength in the past. What the feats of strength entailed was revealed at the very end of the episode when it occurred.

==== Festivus miracles ====
Cosmo Kramer twice declares a &quot;Festivus miracle&quot; during the Festivus celebration in the Costanza household. Kramer caused the two &quot;miracles&quot; himself, by inviting two off-track betting bookies (Tracy Letts and Colin Malone) to dinner with Elaine (men whom Elaine wished to avoid), and by causing Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend Gwen to believe that Jerry is cheating on her.

== Wider adoption ==
Some people, many of them inspired by the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, subsequently began to celebrate the holiday with varying degrees of seriousness. Allen Salkin&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Festivus: The Holiday for the Rest of Us&quot; chronicles the early adoption of Festivus. Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;A Kosher Christmas: &#x27;Tis the Season to Be Jewish&quot;&#x27; references Festivus. Martin Bodek&#x27;s 2020 book &quot;The Festivus Haggadah&quot; fuses Passover with Festivus. Others have adopted Festivus as a way of engaging in a non-religious celebration over the traditional holiday season, such as by showcasing winter festivities.

During the Baltimore Ravens&#x27; run to the Super Bowl XXXV championship in 2000, head coach Brian Billick superstitiously issued an organizational ban on the use of the word &quot;playoffs&quot; until the team had clinched its first postseason berth. &quot;Playoffs&quot; was instead referred to as &quot;Festivus&quot; and the Super Bowl as &quot;Festivus Maximus&quot;.

In 2005, Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle was declared &quot;Governor Festivus&quot;, and during the holiday season displayed a Festivus pole in the family room of the Executive Residence in Madison, Wisconsin. Doyle&#x27;s 2005 Festivus pole is now part of the collection of the Wisconsin Historical Museum.

In 2010, a CNN story featuring Jerry Stiller detailed the increasing popularity of the holiday, including US Representative Eric Cantor&#x27;s Festivus fundraiser. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that Festivus was a top trend on Twitter that year. In 2012, Google introduced a custom search result for the term &quot;Festivus&quot;. In addition to the normal results, an unadorned aluminum pole was displayed running down the side of the list of search results and &quot;A festivus miracle!&quot; prefixed the results count and speed. Also in 2012, a Festivus Pole was erected on city property in Deerfield Beach, Florida, alongside religious-themed holiday displays. A similar Festivus pole was displayed next to religious displays in the Wisconsin State Capitol, along with a banner provided by the Freedom From Religion Foundation advocating for the separation of government and religion. In 2013 and 2014, Chaz Stevens erected a Festivus pole constructed with of beer cans next to a nativity scene and other religious holiday displays in the Florida State Capitol Building, as a protest supporting separation of church and state. In 2015, the same man was granted permission to display a Festivus pole decorated with a gay pride theme and topped with a disco ball to celebrate the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on same-sex marriage, at state capitols in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Washington.

In 2016, US Senator Rand Paul released a special Festivus edition of &quot;The Waste Report&quot;. The Festivus &quot;airing of grievances&quot; has become an annual tradition for Paul on Twitter. In 2016, the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; became the first newspaper to allow anyone to submit Festivus grievances through its website, with the promise to publish them on December 23, the day of the Festivus holiday. The &quot;Times&quot; continues to solicit and publish grievances from around the world annually. An annual public Festivus celebration has been held in Pittsburgh since 2005, featuring live bands, a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; trivia contest, and holiday traditions. In 2017, the &quot;Pittsburgh City Paper&quot; called its 13th iteration &quot;the longest-running celebration of Sein-Culture in the &#x27;Burgh&quot;. 
In 2018, Wollongong City Council (New South Wales, Australia) named a lane &quot;Festivus Lane&quot; in the suburb of Corrimal. The name was chosen as the celebration of Festivus started by locals grew to become a local annual fixture.

In 2021, WWE world heavyweight wrestling Champion Big E started wearing custom-designed singlets on-air adorned with catchphrases and images of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s version of Festivus.

== Attempts at national recognition ==
In 2022, the official &quot;Seinfeld&quot; social media accounts created a petition on the website change.org to make Festivus a national holiday on December 23, and encouraged the use of the hashtag #MakeFestivusOfficial. The video promoting the petition notes that Festivus is as worthy of recognition as other unofficial national holidays, such as National Bagel Day, Boss&#x27;s Day, and Hug a Musician Day.

<doc id="303130" wikidata="Q240454" url="?curid=303130" title="Savannah (actress)">
<text>Shannon Michelle Wilsey (October 9, 1970 – July 11, 1994), better known by her stage name Savannah, was an American pornographic film actress who starred in over 100 videos during her career. One of the most prominent adult industry models of her time, she achieved notoriety within her short (1990–1994) career due to her onscreen presence and personal life. In January 2002, &quot;AVN&quot; ranked her at #19 on its list of the top 50 porn stars of all time.

Wilsey reportedly took her stage name from &quot;Savannah Smiles&quot; (1982), a movie she enjoyed. Following a car crash that broke her nose, she attempted suicide by firearm and died at the hospital after being removed from life support.

==Career==
Wilsey was introduced to the adult film industry by actor and director Rex Cabo. She started at first in photo spreads for &quot;Cheri&quot;, &quot;Hustler&quot;, &quot;Swank&quot;, and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and then she signed an exclusive contract with Vivid Entertainment in 1991 and became one of the early Vivid Girls. Wilsey began using drugs and spending large amounts of money, and she reportedly had severe financial troubles despite her substantial income. She also garnered a reputation for arriving late to film shoots, being temperamental and acting like a diva, and sometimes getting drunk or abusing drugs during the film/video shoots. These antics eventually led to Vivid severing its association with her in 1993. She ended her career by mainly freelancing for lower-budget porn companies by capitalizing on her still big but clearly fading name in the industry. Wilsey also appeared in a variety of minor roles in B movies (mostly comedy, horror and/or sci-fi) in which she was credited with her real name. These roles included &quot;The Invisible Maniac&quot; (1990) and &quot;Camp Fear&quot; (1991). She also had a credit for her performance on a soundtrack in the video &quot;The Spectacle&quot; (1991). After her death, Wilsey continued to appear via archival footage. She appeared as Santana on Joe Bob&#x27;s &quot;Drive-In Theater&quot; when the show aired &quot;Sorority House Massacre II&quot; (October 1994).

==Personal life==
In a video interview for Vivid, Wilsey stated that the first time she saw &quot;erotic material&quot; was when she was &quot;snooping through her parents&#x27; things&quot; and found some magazines when she was 11 years old. She later stated that she used to watch porn videos with her boyfriend on his tour bus.

Wilsey became involved in a long-term relationship with fellow pornographic actress Jeanna Fine, with whom she later claimed to have fallen deeply in love. In a 1999 interview, following the airing of the &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; about Wilsey&#x27;s life and death, Fine commented: &quot;We had an ongoing, on-again, off-again, volatile, loving relationship. At that time, I was having a lot of problems myself. Between [male porn actor] Sikki Nixx and Savannah pushing and pulling, I pretty much at one point ran away from them both. I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer. But I feel I left her behind when she needed me most. It&#x27;s very sad.&quot;

Savannah also had relationships with singer Billy Idol, Mötley Crüe member Vince Neil, Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth, bassist Billy Sheehan who was in Roth&#x27;s solo band, comedian Pauly Shore, guitarist Slash, actor Mark Wahlberg, and Rapper Danny Boy O’Connor. According to an interview with &quot;Adult Video News&quot;, Wilsey stated: &quot;I love sex, and I love sex with rockers more than anything else.&quot;

==Death==
Wilsey died by suicide in 1994 by shooting herself after a car accident. On the evening of July 11, Wilsey was involved in an auto accident with her Corvette in which she reportedly broke her nose and injured her face. Upset over the accident and worried that she would suffer permanent scarring on her face, she went home to Universal City, California, asked a friend to walk her dog, and then called her manager Nancy Pera. It was Pera who later discovered Wilsey in the garage of Wilsey&#x27;s home. Wilsey did not die immediately; she died hours later in the hospital after her father decided to shut down her life support systems once it became obvious that she would not survive her injury. Wilsey&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, comedian Pauly Shore, stated that he was with her when she died in St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital.

Wilsey&#x27;s funeral, two days later, was attended by friends, family, and limited numbers of adult industry associates. Shore was the only one of her ex-boyfriends to attend the service. Of Wilsey, Shore said &quot;She was the nicest, most beautiful girl I ever met...[her death] was a very dramatic thing for me.&quot; When asked why she killed herself, he said &quot;She became Savannah. She became her character, who was into drugs, and needed reassurance all the time. She forgot who Shannon was...I knew she wanted out [of the porn business].&quot; At the time, Wilsey&#x27;s death was considered the third high-profile suicide in the adult industry, after fellow performers Shauna Grant and Megan Leigh. After her death, Bill Margold founded Protecting Adult Welfare (P.A.W.), a non-profit organization that provides counseling for adult performers in need. Her body was cremated and the ashes given to family and friends.

==Legacy==

After her death, Wilsey was profiled in two documentaries:
* The Playboy Entertainment Group produced &quot;Playboy: The Story of X&quot; (1998), which featured archival footage of her. 
* The &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;: &quot;Savannah&quot; (October 31, 1999) is dedicated to Wilsey&#x27;s early life, family, career, and unexpected death.

* &quot;OC Weekly&quot; (February 2014) featured Wilsey, remembering her as not only a resident of Orange County, California, but as well as &quot;Arguably the first superstar porn goddess of the 1990s&quot;.
* In 2015, actress Amber Tamblyn published her third book of poetry—&quot;Dark Sparkler&quot;—&quot;featuring elegies to late actresses both legendary and unknown, all who suffered untimely deaths.&quot; Wilsey is the subject of one such poem along with Child actress Bridgette Andersen (1975-1997) who played the part of &quot;Savannah&quot; in Wilsey&#x27;s favorite film: &quot;Savannah Smiles&quot;. Wilsey&#x27;s poem is written as &quot;a meta-poem, where she&#x27;s writing for Bridgette Andersen, and telling her how they&#x27;re the same.&quot;

<doc id="303134" wikidata="Q510690" url="?curid=303134" title="Copperhead (politics)">
<text>In the 1860s, the Copperheads, also known as Peace Democrats, were a faction of the Democratic Party in the Union who opposed the American Civil War and wanted an immediate peace settlement with the Confederates.

Republicans started labeling anti-war Democrats &quot;Copperheads&quot; after the eastern copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;), a species of venomous snake. Those Democrats embraced the moniker, reinterpreting the copper &quot;head&quot; as the likeness of Liberty, which they cut from Liberty Head large cent coins and proudly wore as badges. By contrast, Democratic supporters of the war were called War Democrats. Notable Copperheads included two Democratic Congressmen from Ohio: Reps. Clement L. Vallandigham and Alexander Long. Republican prosecutors accused some prominent Copperheads of treason in a series of trials in 1864.

Copperheadism was a highly contentious grassroots movement. It had its strongest base just north of the Ohio River and in some urban ethnic wards. In the State of Ohio, perhaps in contrast with Indiana and Illinois, the counties that had Peace Democrat majorities tended not to be along the Ohio River, but more in the central and northwestern portions of the state. Historians such as Wood Gray, Jennifer Weber and Kenneth M. Stampp have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party and that it looked back to Jacksonian democracy for inspiration. Weber argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by opposing conscription, encouraging desertion, and forming conspiracies. Still, other historians say that the draft was already in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.

Historians such as Gray and Weber argue that the Copperheads were inflexibly rooted in the past and were naive about the refusal of the Confederates to return to the Union. Convinced that the Republicans were ruining the traditional world they loved, they were obstructionist partisans. In turn, the Copperheads became a significant target of the National Union Party in the 1864 presidential election, when they were used to discredit the leading Democratic candidates.

Copperhead support increased when Union armies did poorly and decreased when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, Union military success seemed assured, and Copperheadism collapsed.

==Name==

A possible origin of the name came from a &quot;New York Times&quot; newspaper account in April 1861 that stated that when postal officers in Washington, D.C., opened a mail bag from a state now in the Confederacy:

== Agenda ==

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Copperheads nominally favored the Union and strongly opposed the war, about which they faulted abolitionists. They demanded immediate peace and resisted draft laws. They wanted President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans ousted from power, seeing the President as a tyrant destroying American republican values with despotic and arbitrary actions.

Some Copperheads tried to persuade Union soldiers to desert. They talked of helping Confederate prisoners of war seize their camps and escape. They sometimes met with Confederate agents and took money. The Confederacy encouraged their activities whenever possible.

== Newspapers ==
The Copperheads had numerous important newspapers, but the editors never allied. In Chicago, Wilbur F. Storey made the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; into Lincoln&#x27;s most vituperative enemy. The New York &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot;, originally abolitionist, was sold to owners who became Copperheads, giving them an important voice in the largest city. A typical editor was Edward G. Roddy, owner of the Uniontown, Pennsylvania &quot;Genius of Liberty&quot;. He was an intensely partisan Democrat who saw African Americans as an inferior race and Lincoln as a despot and dunce. Although he supported the war effort in 1861, he blamed abolitionists for prolonging the war and denounced the government as increasingly despotic. By 1864, he was calling for peace at any price.

John Mullaly&#x27;s &quot;Metropolitan Record&quot; was the official Catholic newspaper in New York City. Reflecting Irish American opinion, it supported the war until 1863 before becoming a Copperhead organ. In the spring and summer of 1863, the paper urged its Irish working-class readers to pursue armed resistance to the draft passed by Congress earlier in the year. When the draft began in the city, working-class European Americans, largely Irish, responded with violent riots from July 13 to 16, lynching, beating and hacking to death more than 100 black New Yorkers and burning down black-owned businesses and institutions, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, an orphanage for 233 black children. On August 19, 1864, John Mullaly was arrested for inciting resistance to the draft.

Even in an era of extremely partisan journalism, Copperhead newspapers were remarkable for their angry rhetoric. Wisconsin newspaper editor Marcus M. Pomeroy of the &quot;La Crosse Democrat&quot; referred to Lincoln as &quot;Fungus from the corrupt womb of bigotry and fanaticism&quot; and a &quot;worse tyrant and more inhuman butcher than has existed since the days of Nero ... The man who votes for Lincoln now is a traitor and murderer ... And if he is elected to misgovern for another four years, we trust some bold hand will pierce his heart with dagger point for the public good&quot;.

== Copperhead resistance ==

The Copperheads sometimes talked of violent resistance and, in some cases, started to organize. However, they never actually made an organized attack. As war opponents, Copperheads were suspected of disloyalty, and their leaders were sometimes arrested and held for months in military prisons without trial. One famous example was General Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s 1863 General Order Number 38, issued in Ohio, which made it an offense (to be tried in military court) to criticize the war in any way. The order was used to arrest Ohio congressman Clement L. Vallandigham when he criticized the order itself. However, Lincoln commuted his sentence but exiled him to the Confederacy.

Probably the largest Copperhead group was the Knights of the Golden Circle. Formed in Ohio in the 1850s, it became politicized in 1861. It reorganized as the Order of American Knights in 1863 and again in early 1864 as the Order of the Sons of Liberty, with Vallandigham as its commander. One leader, Harrison H. Dodd, advocated the violent overthrow of the governments of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri in 1864. Democratic Party leaders and a Federal investigation thwarted his &quot;Northwest Conspiracy&quot;. Despite this Copperhead setback, tensions remained high. The Charleston Riot took place in Illinois in March 1864. Indiana Republicans then used the sensational revelation of an antiwar Copperhead conspiracy by elements of the Sons of Liberty to discredit Democrats in the 1864 House elections. The military trial of Lambdin P. Milligan and other Sons of Liberty revealed plans to set free the Confederate prisoners held in the state. The culprits were sentenced to hang, but the Supreme Court intervened in &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot;, saying they should have received civilian trials.

Most Copperheads actively participated in politics. On May 1, 1863, former Congressman Vallandigham declared that the war was being fought not to save the Union but to free the blacks and enslave Southern whites. The U.S. Army then arrested him for declaring sympathy for the enemy. He was court-martialed by the Army and sentenced to imprisonment, but Lincoln commuted the sentence to banishment behind Confederate lines. The Democrats nevertheless nominated him for governor of Ohio in 1863. He left the Confederacy and went to Canada, where he campaigned for governor but lost after an intense battle. He operated behind the scenes at the 1864 Democratic convention in Chicago. This convention adopted a largely Copperhead platform and selected Ohio Representative George Pendleton, a Peace Democrat, as the vice-presidential candidate. However, it chose a pro-war presidential candidate, General George B. McClellan. The contradiction severely weakened the party&#x27;s chances to defeat Lincoln.

== Characteristics ==
The values of the Copperheads reflected the Jacksonian democracy of an earlier agrarian society. The Copperhead movement attracted Southerners who had settled north of the Ohio River, and the poor and merchants who had lost profitable Southern trade. They were most numerous in border areas, including southern parts of Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana (in Missouri, comparable groups were avowed Confederates).

The movement had scattered bases of support outside the lower Midwest. A Copperhead element in Connecticut dominated the Democratic Party there. The Copperhead coalition included many Irish American Catholics in eastern cities, mill towns and mining camps (especially in the Pennsylvania coal fields). They were also numerous in German Catholic areas of the Midwest, especially Wisconsin.

Historian Kenneth Stampp has captured the Copperhead spirit in his depiction of Congressman Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana: 

== Historiography ==

Two central questions have run through the historiography of the Copperheads: &quot;How serious a threat did they pose to the Union war effort and hence to the nation&#x27;s survival?&quot; and &quot;To what extent and with what justification did the Lincoln administration and other Republican officials violate civil liberties to contain the perceived menace?&quot;

The first book-length scholarly treatment of the Copperheads was &quot;The Hidden Civil War: The Story of the Copperheads&quot; (1942) by Wood Gray. In it, Gray decried the &quot;defeatism&quot; of the Copperheads and argued that they deliberately served the Confederacy&#x27;s war aims. Also in 1942, George Fort Milton published &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Fifth Column&quot;, which likewise condemned the traitorous Copperheads and praised Lincoln as a model defender of democracy.

Gilbert R. Tredway, a professor of history, in his 1973 study &quot;Democratic Opposition to the Lincoln Administration in Indiana&quot; found most Indiana Democrats were loyal to the Union and desired national reunification. He documented Democratic counties in Indiana having outperformed Republican counties in recruiting soldiers. Tredway found that Copperhead sentiment was uncommon among the rank-and-file Democrats in Indiana.

The chief historians who look more favorably on the Copperheads are Richard O. Curry and Frank L. Klement. Klement devoted most of his career to debunking the idea that the Copperheads represented a danger to the Union. Klement and Curry have downplayed the treasonable activities of the Copperheads, arguing the Copperheads were traditionalists who fiercely resisted modernization and wanted to return to the old ways. Klement argued in the 1950s that the Copperheads&#x27; activities, especially their supposed participation in treasonous anti-Union secret societies, were mostly false inventions by Republican propaganda machines designed to discredit the Democrats at election time. Curry sees Copperheads as poor traditionalists battling against the railroads, banks, and modernization. In his standard history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; (1988), James M. McPherson asserted Klement had taken &quot;revision a bit too far. There was some real fire under that smokescreen of Republican propaganda&quot;.

Jennifer Weber&#x27;s &quot;Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln&#x27;s Opponents in the North&quot; (2006) agrees more with Gray and Milton than with Klement. She argues that first, Northern antiwar sentiment was strong, so strong that Peace Democrats came close to seizing control of their party in mid-1864. Second, she shows the peace sentiment led to deep divisions and occasional violence across the North. Third, Weber concluded that the peace movement deliberately weakened the Union military effort by undermining both enlistment and the operation of the draft. Indeed, Lincoln had to divert combat troops to retake control of New York City from the anti-draft rioters in 1863. Fourth, Weber shows how the attitudes of Union soldiers affected partisan battles back home. The soldiers&#x27; rejection of Copperheadism and overwhelming support for Lincoln&#x27;s reelection in 1864 was decisive in securing the Northern victory and the preservation of the Union. The Copperheads&#x27; appeal, she argues, waxed and waned with Union failures and successes in the field.

== Flags ==
There was no official flag for Copperheads: they differed from area to area. Most contemporary accounts indicate some flags had a white field with the inscription &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;nation.&quot; Others were the standard national flag with 13 to 22 stars and 11-7 stripes known as &quot;exclusionary flags&quot;. They mostly removed the stars of rebel states or Union states. The flags were also popular with the opposition Some retained their 34 stars but put political slogans in their stripes.

<text>Shing-Tung Yau (; ; born April 4, 1949) is a Chinese-American mathematician. He is the director of the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center at Tsinghua University and professor emeritus at Harvard University. Until 2022, Yau was the William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics at Harvard, at which point he moved to Tsinghua.

Yau was born in Shantou in 1949, moved to British Hong Kong at a young age, and then moved to the United States in 1969. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982, in recognition of his contributions to partial differential equations, the Calabi conjecture, the positive energy theorem, and the Monge–Ampère equation. Yau is considered one of the major contributors to the development of modern differential geometry and geometric analysis.
The impact of Yau&#x27;s work are also seen in the mathematical and physical fields of convex geometry, algebraic geometry, enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, general relativity, and string theory, while his work has also touched upon applied mathematics, engineering, and numerical analysis.

==Biography==
Yau was born in Shantou, Guangdong, Republic of China in 1949 to Hakka parents. His ancestral hometown is Jiaoling County, China. His mother, Yeuk Lam Leung, was from Meixian District, China; his father, Chen Ying Chiu (), was a Republic of China Kuomintang scholar of philosophy, history, literature, and economics. He was the fifth of eight children.

During the Communist takeover of mainland China when he was only a few months old, his family moved to British Hong Kong where his schooling was (except for English classes) entirely in the Cantonese language instead of his parents&#x27; native Hakka Chinese language. He was not able to revisit until 1979, at the invitation of Hua Luogeng, when mainland China entered the reform and opening era. They lived in Yuen Long at first, and then moved to Shatin in 1954. They had financial troubles from having lost all of their possessions, and his father and second-oldest sister died when he was thirteen. Yau began to read and appreciate his father&#x27;s books, and became more devoted to schoolwork. After graduating from Pui Ching Middle School, he studied mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1966 to 1969, without receiving a degree due to graduating early. He left his textbooks with his younger brother, Stephen Shing-Toung Yau, who then decided to major in mathematics as well.

Yau left for the Ph.D. program in mathematics at University of California, Berkeley in the fall of 1969. Over the winter break, he read the first issues of the &quot;Journal of Differential Geometry&quot;, and was deeply inspired by John Milnor&#x27;s papers on geometric group theory. Subsequently, he formulated a generalization of Preissman&#x27;s theorem, and developed his ideas further with Blaine Lawson over the next semester. Using this work, he received his Ph.D. the following year, in 1971, under the supervision of Shiing-Shen Chern.

He spent a year as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton before joining Stony Brook University in 1972 as an assistant professor. In 1974, he became an associate professor at Stanford University. In 1976, he took a visiting faculty position at UCLA and married physicist Yu-Yun Kuo, whom he knew from his time as a graduate student at Berkeley. In 1979, he moved back to the Institute for Advanced Study and he became a professor there in 1980. In 1984, he took a chair professorship at University of California, San Diego. In 1987, he moved to Harvard University. In April 2022, Yau retired from Harvard, where he was William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics Emeritus. In the same year, he moved to Tsinghua University as a professor of mathematics.

According to Yau&#x27;s autobiography, he became &quot;stateless&quot; in 1978 after the British Consulate revoked his Hong Kong residency due to his United States permanent residency status. Regarding his status when receiving his Fields Medal in 1982, Yau stated &quot;I am proud to say that when I was awarded the Fields Medal in mathematics, I held no passport of any country and should certainly be considered Chinese.&quot; Yau remained &quot;stateless&quot; until 1990, when he obtained United States citizenship.

With science journalist Steve Nadis, Yau has written a non-technical account of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string theory, a history of Harvard&#x27;s mathematics department, a case for the construction of the Circular Electron Positron Collider in China, an autobiography, and a book on the relation of geometry to physics.

==Academic activities==
Yau has made major contributions to the development of modern differential geometry and geometric analysis. As said by William Thurston in 1981:

His most widely celebrated results include the resolution (with Shiu-Yuen Cheng) of the boundary-value problem for the Monge-Ampère equation, the positive mass theorem in the mathematical analysis of general relativity (achieved with Richard Schoen), the resolution of the Calabi conjecture, the topological theory of minimal surfaces (with William Meeks), the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem (done with Karen Uhlenbeck), and the Cheng−Yau and Li−Yau gradient estimates for partial differential equations (found with Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Peter Li). Many of Yau&#x27;s results (in addition to those of others) were written into textbooks co-authored with Schoen.

In addition to his research, Yau is the founder and director of several mathematical institutes, mostly in China. John Coates has commented that &quot;no other mathematician of our times has come close&quot; to Yau&#x27;s success at fundraising for mathematical activities in mainland China and Hong Kong. During a sabbatical year at National Tsinghua University in Taiwan, Yau was asked by Charles Kao to start a mathematical institute at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. After a few years of fundraising efforts, Yau established the multi-disciplinary Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1993, with his frequent co-author Shiu-Yuen Cheng as associate director. In 1995, Yau assisted Yongxiang Lu with raising money from Ronnie Chan and Gerald Chan&#x27;s Morningside Group for the new Morningside Center of Mathematics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Yau has also been involved with the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University, at Tsinghua University, at National Taiwan University, and in Sanya. More recently, in 2014, Yau raised money to establish the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (of which he is the director), the Center for Green Buildings and Cities, and the Center for Immunological Research, all at Harvard University.

Modeled on an earlier physics conference organized by Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, Yau proposed the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians, which is now held every three years. The first congress was held at the Morningside Center from December 12 to 18, 1998. He co-organizes the annual &quot;Journal of Differential Geometry&quot; and &quot;Current Developments in Mathematics&quot; conferences. Yau is an editor-in-chief of the Journal of Differential Geometry, Asian Journal of Mathematics, and Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics. As of 2021, he has advised over seventy Ph.D. students.

In Hong Kong, with the support of Ronnie Chan, Yau set up the Hang Lung Award for high school students. He has also organized and participated in meetings for high school and college students, such as the panel discussions &quot;Why Math? Ask Masters!&quot; in Hangzhou, July 2004, and &quot;The Wonder of Mathematics&quot; in Hong Kong, December 2004. Yau also co-initiated a series of books on popular mathematics, &quot;Mathematics and Mathematical People&quot;.

In 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted preprints to the arXiv claiming to prove the Thurston geometrization conjecture and, as a special case, the renowned Poincaré conjecture. Although his work contained many new ideas and results, his proofs lacked detail on a number of technical arguments. Over the next few years, several mathematicians devoted their time to fill in details and provide expositions of Perelman&#x27;s work to the mathematical community. A well-known August 2006 article in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; written by Sylvia Nasar and David Gruber about the situation brought some professional disputes involving Yau to public attention.
* Alexander Givental alleged that Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Yau illegitimately took credit from him for resolving a well-known conjecture in the field of mirror symmetry. Although it is undisputed that Lian−Liu−Yau&#x27;s article appeared after Givental&#x27;s, they claim that his work contained gaps that were only filled in following work in their own publication; Givental claims that his original work was complete. Nasar and Gruber quote an anonymous mathematician as agreeing with Givental.
* In the 1980s, Yau&#x27;s colleague Yum-Tong Siu accused Yau&#x27;s Ph.D. student Gang Tian of plagiarizing some of his work. At the time, Yau defended Tian against Siu&#x27;s accusations. In the 2000s, Yau began to amplify Siu&#x27;s allegations, saying that he found Tian&#x27;s dual position at Princeton University and Peking University to be highly unethical due to his high salary from Peking University compared to other professors and students who made more active contributions to the university. Science Magazine covered the broader phenomena of such positions in China, with Tian and Yau as central figures.
* Nasar and Gruber say that, having allegedly not done any notable work since the middle of the 1980s, Yau tried to regain prominence by claiming that Xi-Ping Zhu and Yau&#x27;s former student Huai-Dong Cao had solved the Thurston and Poincaré conjectures, only partially based on some of Perelman&#x27;s ideas. Nasar and Gruber quoted Yau as agreeing with the acting director of one of Yau&#x27;s mathematical centers, who at a press conference assigned Cao and Zhu thirty percent of the credit for resolving the conjectures, with Perelman receiving only twenty-five (with the rest going to Richard Hamilton). A few months later, a segment of NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; covering the situation reviewed an audio recording of the press conference and found no such statement made by either Yau or the acting director. 
Yau claimed that Nasar and Gruber&#x27;s article was defamatory and contained several falsehoods, and that they did not give him the opportunity to represent his own side of the disputes. He considered filing a lawsuit against the magazine, claiming professional damage, but says he decided that it wasn&#x27;t sufficiently clear what such an action would achieve. He established a public relations website, with letters responding to the &quot;New Yorker&quot; article from several mathematicians, including himself and two others quoted in the article.

In his autobiography, Yau said that his statements in 2006 such as that Cao and Zhu gave &quot;the first complete and detailed account of the proof of the Poincaré conjecture&quot; should have been phrased more carefully. Although he does believe Cao and Zhu&#x27;s work to be the first and most rigorously detailed account of Perelman&#x27;s work, he says he should have clarified that they had &quot;not surpassed Perelman&#x27;s work in any way.&quot; He has also maintained the view that (as of 2019) the final parts of Perelman&#x27;s proof should be better understood by the mathematical community, with the corresponding possibility that there remain some unnoticed errors.

==Technical contributions to mathematics==
Yau has made a number of major research contributions, centered on differential geometry and its appearance in other fields of mathematics and science. In addition to his research, Yau has compiled influential sets of open problems in differential geometry, including both well-known old conjectures with new proposals and problems. Two of Yau&#x27;s most widely cited problem lists from the 1980s have been updated with notes on progress as of 2014. Particularly well-known are a conjecture on existence of minimal hypersurfaces and on the spectral geometry of minimal hypersurfaces.

===Calabi conjecture===

In 1978, by studying the complex Monge–Ampère equation, Yau resolved the Calabi conjecture, which had been posed by Eugenio Calabi in 1954. As a special case, this showed that Kähler-Einstein metrics exist on any closed Kähler manifold whose first Chern class is nonpositive. Yau&#x27;s method adapted earlier work of Calabi, Jürgen Moser, and Aleksei Pogorelov, developed for quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations and the real Monge–Ampère equation, to the setting of the complex Monge–Ampère equation.

*In differential geometry, Yau&#x27;s theorem is significant in proving the general existence of closed manifolds of special holonomy; any simply-connected closed Kähler manifold which is Ricci flat must have its holonomy group contained in the special unitary group, according to the Ambrose–Singer theorem. Examples of compact Riemannian manifolds with other special holonomy groups have been found by Dominic Joyce and Peter Kronheimer, although no proposals for general existence results, analogous to Calabi&#x27;s conjecture, have been successfully identified in the case of the other groups.
* In algebraic geometry, the existence of canonical metrics as proposed by Calabi allows one to give equally canonical representatives of characteristic classes by differential forms. Due to Yau&#x27;s initial efforts at disproving the Calabi conjecture by showing that it would lead to contradictions in such contexts, he was able to draw striking corollaries to the conjecture itself. In particular, the Calabi conjecture implies the Miyaoka–Yau inequality on Chern numbers of surfaces, in addition to homotopical characterizations of the complex structures of the complex projective plane and of quotients of the two-dimensional complex unit ball.
* A special case of the Calabi conjecture asserts that a Kähler metric of zero Ricci curvature must exist on any Kähler manifold whose first Chern class is zero. In string theory, it was discovered in 1985 by Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten that these &quot;Calabi–Yau manifolds&quot;, due to their special holonomy, are the appropriate configuration spaces for superstrings. For this reason, Yau&#x27;s resolution of the Calabi conjecture is considered to be of fundamental importance in modern string theory.

The understanding of the Calabi conjecture in the noncompact setting is less definitive. Gang Tian and Yau extended Yau&#x27;s analysis of the complex Monge−Ampère equation to the noncompact setting, where the use of cutoff functions and corresponding integral estimates necessitated the conditional assumption of certain controlled geometry near infinity. This reduces the problem to the question of existence of Kähler metrics with such asymptotic properties; they obtained such metrics for certain smooth quasi-projective complex varieties. They later extended their work to allow orbifold singularities. With Brian Greene, Alfred Shapere, and Cumrun Vafa, Yau introduced an ansatz for a Kähler metric on the set of regular points of certain surjective holomorphic maps, with Ricci curvature approximately zero. They were able to apply the Tian−Yau existence theorem to construct a Kähler metric which is exactly Ricci-flat. The Greene−Shapere−Vafa−Yau ansatz and its natural generalization, now known as a &quot;semi-flat metric&quot;, has become important in several analyses of problems in Kähler geometry.

===Scalar curvature and general relativity===

The positive energy theorem, obtained by Yau in collaboration with his former doctoral student Richard Schoen, can be described in physical terms:

However, it is a precise theorem of differential geometry and geometric analysis, in which physical systems are modeled by Riemannian manifolds with nonnegativity of a certain generalized scalar curvature. As such, Schoen and Yau&#x27;s approach originated in their study of Riemannian manifolds of positive scalar curvature, which is of interest in and of itself. The starting point of Schoen and Yau&#x27;s analysis is their identification of a simple but novel way of inserting the Gauss–Codazzi equations into the second variation formula for the area of a stable minimal hypersurface of a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The Gauss–Bonnet theorem then highly constrains the possible topology of such a surface when the ambient manifold has positive scalar curvature.

Schoen and Yau exploited this observation by finding novel constructions of stable minimal hypersurfaces with various controlled properties. Some of their existence results were developed simultaneously with similar results of Jonathan Sacks and Karen Uhlenbeck, using different techniques. Their fundamental result is on the existence of minimal immersions with prescribed topological behavior. As a consequence of their calculation with the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, they were able to conclude that certain topologically distinguished three-dimensional manifolds cannot have any Riemannian metric of nonnegative scalar curvature.

Schoen and Yau then adapted their work to the setting of certain Riemannian asymptotically flat initial data sets in general relativity. They proved that negativity of the mass would allow one to invoke the Plateau problem to construct stable minimal surfaces which are geodesically complete. A noncompact analogue of their calculation with the Gauss–Bonnet theorem then provides a logical contradiction to the negativity of mass. As such, they were able to prove the positive mass theorem in the special case of their Riemannian initial data sets.

Schoen and Yau extended this to the full Lorentzian formulation of the positive mass theorem by studying a partial differential equation proposed by Pong-Soo Jang. They proved that solutions to the Jang equation exist away from the apparent horizons of black holes, at which solutions can diverge to infinity. By relating the geometry of a Lorentzian initial data set to the geometry of the graph of such a solution to the Jang equation, interpreting the latter as a Riemannian initial data set, Schoen and Yau proved the full positive energy theorem. Furthermore, by reverse-engineering their analysis of the Jang equation, they were able to establish that any sufficient concentration of energy in general relativity must be accompanied by an apparent horizon.

Due to the use of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, these results were originally restricted to the case of three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds. Schoen and Yau established an induction on dimension by constructing Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on minimal hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds which have positive scalar curvature. Such minimal hypersurfaces, which were constructed by means of geometric measure theory by Frederick Almgren and Herbert Federer, are generally not smooth in large dimensions, so these methods only directly apply up for Riemannian manifolds of dimension less than eight. Without any dimensional restriction, Schoen and Yau proved the positive mass theorem in the class of locally conformally flat manifolds. In 2017, Schoen and Yau published a preprint claiming to resolve these difficulties, thereby proving the induction without dimensional restriction and verifying the Riemannian positive mass theorem in arbitrary dimension.

Gerhard Huisken and Yau made a further study of the asymptotic region of Riemannian manifolds with strictly positive mass. Huisken had earlier initiated the study of volume-preserving mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces of Euclidean space. Huisken and Yau adapted his work to the Riemannian setting, proving a long-time existence and convergence theorem for the flow. As a corollary, they established a new geometric feature of positive-mass manifolds, which is that their asymptotic regions are foliated by surfaces of constant mean curvature.

===Omori−Yau maximum principle===
Traditionally, the maximum principle technique is only applied directly on compact spaces, as maxima are then guaranteed to exist. In 1967, Hideki Omori found a novel maximum principle which applies on noncompact Riemannian manifolds whose sectional curvatures are bounded below. It is trivial that &quot;approximate&quot; maxima exist; Omori additionally proved the existence of approximate maxima where the values of the gradient and second derivatives are suitably controlled. Yau partially extended Omori&#x27;s result to require only a lower bound on Ricci curvature; the result is known as the Omori−Yau maximum principle. Such generality is useful due to the appearance of Ricci curvature in the Bochner formula, where a lower bound is also typically used in algebraic manipulations. In addition to giving a very simple proof of the principle itself, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau were able to show that the Ricci curvature assumption in the Omori−Yau maximum principle can be replaced by the assumption of the existence of cutoff functions with certain controllable geometry.

Yau was able to directly apply the Omori−Yau principle to generalize the classical Schwarz−Pick lemma of complex analysis. Lars Ahlfors, among others, had previously generalized the lemma to the setting of Riemann surfaces. With his methods, Yau was able to consider the setting of a mapping from a complete Kähler manifold (with a lower bound on Ricci curvature) to a Hermitian manifold with holomorphic bisectional curvature bounded above by a negative number.

Cheng and Yau extensively used their variant of the Omori−Yau principle to find Kähler−Einstein metrics on noncompact Kähler manifolds, under an ansatz developed by Charles Fefferman. The estimates involved in the method of continuity were not as difficult as in Yau&#x27;s earlier work on the Calabi conjecture, due to the fact that Cheng and Yau only considered Kähler−Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature. The more subtle question, where Fefferman&#x27;s earlier work became important, is to do with geodesic completeness. In particular, Cheng and Yau were able to find complete Kähler-Einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature on any bounded, smooth, and strictly pseudoconvex subset of complex Euclidean space. These can be thought of as complex geometric analogues of the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space.

===Differential Harnack inequalities===
Yau&#x27;s original application of the Omori−Yau maximum principle was to establish gradient estimates for a number of second-order elliptic partial differential equations. Given a function on a complete and smooth Riemannian manifold which satisfies various conditions relating the Laplacian to the function and gradient values, Yau applied the maximum principle to various complicated composite expressions to control the size of the gradient. Although the algebraic manipulations involved are complex, the conceptual form of Yau&#x27;s proof is strikingly simple.

Yau&#x27;s novel gradient estimates have come to be called &quot;differential Harnack inequalities&quot; since they can be integrated along arbitrary paths in to recover inequalities which are of the form of the classical Harnack inequalities, directly comparing the values of a solution to a differential equation at two different input points. By making use of Calabi&#x27;s study of the distance function on a Riemannian manifold, Yau and Shiu-Yuen Cheng gave a powerful localization of Yau&#x27;s gradient estimates, using the same methods to simplify the proof of the Omori−Yau maximum principle. Such estimates are widely quoted in the particular case of harmonic functions on a Riemannian manifold, although Yau and Cheng−Yau&#x27;s original results cover more general scenarios.

In 1986, Yau and Peter Li made use of the same methods to study parabolic partial differential equations on Riemannian manifolds. Richard Hamilton generalized their results in certain geometric settings to matrix inequalities. Analogues of the Li−Yau and Hamilton−Li−Yau inequalities are of great importance in the theory of Ricci flow, where Hamilton proved a matrix differential Harnack inequality for the curvature operator of certain Ricci flows, and Grigori Perelman proved a differential Harnack inequality for the solutions of a backwards heat equation coupled with a Ricci flow.

Cheng and Yau were able to use their differential Harnack estimates to show that, under certain geometric conditions, closed submanifolds of complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian spaces are themselves complete. For instance, they showed that if is a spacelike hypersurface of Minkowski space which is topologically closed and has constant mean curvature, then the induced Riemannian metric on is complete. Analogously, they showed that if is an affine hypersphere of affine space which is topologically closed, then the induced affine metric on is complete. Such results are achieved by deriving a differential Harnack inequality for the (squared) distance function to a given point and integrating along intrinsically defined paths.

===Donaldson−Uhlenbeck−Yau theorem===

In 1985, Simon Donaldson showed that, over a nonsingular projective variety of complex dimension two, a holomorphic vector bundle admits a hermitian Yang–Mills connection if and only if the bundle is stable. A result of Yau and Karen Uhlenbeck generalized Donaldson&#x27;s result to allow a compact Kähler manifold of any dimension. The Uhlenbeck–Yau method relied upon elliptic partial differential equations while Donaldson&#x27;s used parabolic partial differential equations, roughly in parallel to Eells and Sampson&#x27;s epochal work on harmonic maps. The results of Donaldson and Uhlenbeck–Yau have since been extended by other authors. Uhlenbeck and Yau&#x27;s article is important in giving a clear reason that stability of the holomorphic vector bundle can be related to the analytic methods used in constructing a hermitian Yang–Mills connection. The essential mechanism is that if an approximating sequence of hermitian connections fails to converge to the required Yang–Mills connection, then they can be rescaled to converge to a subsheaf which can be verified to be destabilizing by Chern–Weil theory.

Like the Calabi–Yau theorem, the Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau theorem is of interest in theoretical physics. In the interest of an appropriately general formulation of supersymmetry, Andrew Strominger included the hermitian Yang–Mills condition as part of his Strominger system, a proposal for the extension of the Calabi−Yau condition to non-Kähler manifolds. Ji-Xiang Fu and Yau introduced an ansatz for the solution of Strominger&#x27;s system on certain three-dimensional complex manifolds, reducing the problem to a complex Monge−Ampère equation, which they solved.

Yau&#x27;s solution of the Calabi conjecture had given a reasonably complete answer to the question of how Kähler metrics on compact complex manifolds of nonpositive first Chern class can be deformed into Kähler–Einstein metrics. Akito Futaki showed that the existence of holomorphic vector fields can act as an obstruction to the direct extension of these results to the case when the complex manifold has positive first Chern class. A proposal of Calabi&#x27;s suggested that Kähler–Einstein metrics exist on any compact Kähler manifolds with positive first Chern class which admit no holomorphic vector fields. During the 1980s, Yau and others came to understand that this criterion could not be sufficient. Inspired by the Donaldson−Uhlenbeck−Yau theorem, Yau proposed that the existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics must be linked to stability of the complex manifold in the sense of geometric invariant theory, with the idea of studying holomorphic vector fields along projective embeddings, rather than holomorphic vector fields on the manifold itself. Subsequent research of Gang Tian and Simon Donaldson refined this conjecture, which became known as the Yau–Tian–Donaldson conjecture relating Kähler–Einstein metrics and K-stability. In 2019, Xiuxiong Chen, Donaldson, and Song Sun were awarded the Oswald Veblen prize for resolution of the conjecture.

===Geometric variational problems===

In 1982, Li and Yau resolved the Willmore conjecture in the non-embedded case. More precisely, they established that, given any smooth immersion of a closed surface in the 3-sphere which fails to be an embedding, the Willmore energy is bounded below by 8π. This is complemented by a 2012 result of Fernando Marques and André Neves, which says that in the alternative case of a smooth embedding of the 2-dimensional torus , the Willmore energy is bounded below by 2π2. Together, these results comprise the full Willmore conjecture, as originally formulated by Thomas Willmore in 1965. Although their assumptions and conclusions are quite similar, the methods of Li−Yau and Marques−Neves are distinct. Nonetheless, they both rely on structurally similar minimax schemes. Marques and Neves made novel use of the Almgren–Pitts min-max theory of the area functional from geometric measure theory; Li and Yau&#x27;s approach depended on their new &quot;conformal invariant&quot;, which is a min-max quantity based on the Dirichlet energy. The main work of their article is devoted to relating their conformal invariant to other geometric quantities.

William Meeks and Yau produced some foundational results on minimal surfaces in three-dimensional manifolds, revisiting points left open by older work of Jesse Douglas and Charles Morrey. Following these foundations, Meeks, Leon Simon, and Yau gave a number of fundamental results on surfaces in three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds which minimize area within their homology class. They were able to give a number of striking applications. For example, they showed that if is an orientable 3-manifold such that every smooth embedding of a 2-sphere can be extended to a smooth embedding of the unit ball, then the same is true of any covering space of . Interestingly, Meeks-Simon-Yau&#x27;s paper and Hamilton&#x27;s foundational paper on Ricci flow, published in the same year, have a result in common, obtained by very distinct methods: any simply-connected compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere.

===Geometric rigidity theorems===
In the geometry of submanifolds, both the extrinsic and intrinsic geometries are significant. These are reflected by the intrinsic Riemannian metric and the second fundamental form. Many geometers have considered the phenomena which arise from restricting these data to some form of constancy. This includes as special cases the problems of minimal surfaces, constant mean curvature, and submanifolds whose metric has constant scalar curvature.
* The archetypical example of such questions is Bernstein&#x27;s problem, as completely settled in famous work of James Simons, Enrico Bombieri, Ennio De Giorgi, and Enrico Giusti in the 1960s. Their work asserts that a minimal hypersurface which is a graph over Euclidean space must be a plane in low dimensions, with counterexamples in high dimensions. The key point of the proof of planarity is the non-existence of conical and non-planar stable minimal hypersurfaces of Euclidean spaces of low dimension; this was given a simple proof by Richard Schoen, Leon Simon, and Yau. Their technique of combining the Simons inequality with the formula for second variation of area has subsequently been used many times in the literature.
* Given the &quot;threshold&quot; dimension phenomena in the standard Bernstein problem, it is a somewhat surprising fact, due to Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau, that there is no dimensional restriction in the Lorentzian analogue: any spacelike hypersurface of multidimensional Minkowski space which is a graph over Euclidean space and has zero mean curvature must be a plane. Their proof makes use of the maximum principle techniques which they had previously used to prove differential Harnack estimates. Later they made use of similar techniques to give a new proof of the classification of complete parabolic or elliptic affine hyperspheres in affine geometry.
* In one of his earliest papers, Yau considered the extension of the constant mean curvature condition to higher codimension, where the condition can be interpreted either as the mean curvature being parallel as a section of the normal bundle, or as the constancy of the length of the mean curvature. Under the former interpretation, he fully characterized the case of two-dimensional surfaces in Riemannian space forms, and found partial results under the (weaker) second interpretation. Some of his results were independently found by Bang-Yen Chen.
* Extending Philip Hartman and Louis Nirenberg&#x27;s earlier work on intrinsically flat hypersurfaces of Euclidean space, Cheng and Yau considered hypersurfaces of space forms which have constant scalar curvature. The key tool in their analysis was an extension of Hermann Weyl&#x27;s differential identity used in the solution of the Weyl isometric embedding problem.
Outside of the setting of submanifold rigidity problems, Yau was able to adapt Jürgen Moser&#x27;s method of proving Caccioppoli inequalities, thereby proving new rigidity results for functions on complete Riemannian manifolds. A particularly famous result of his says that a subharmonic function cannot be both positive and L&quot;p&quot; integrable unless it is constant. Similarly, on a complete Kähler manifold, a holomorphic function cannot be L&quot;p&quot; integrable unless it is constant.

===Minkowski problem and Monge–Ampère equation===
The Minkowski problem of classical differential geometry can be viewed as the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature. In the 1950s, Louis Nirenberg and Aleksei Pogorelov resolved the problem for two-dimensional surfaces, making use of recent progress on the Monge–Ampère equation for two-dimensional domains. By the 1970s, higher-dimensional understanding of the Monge–Ampère equation was still lacking. In 1976, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau resolved the Minkowski problem in general dimensions via the method of continuity, making use of fully geometric estimates instead of the theory of the Monge–Ampère equation.

As a consequence of their resolution of the Minkowski problem, Cheng and Yau were able to make progress on the understanding of the Monge–Ampère equation. The key observation is that the Legendre transform of a solution of the Monge–Ampère equation has its graph&#x27;s Gaussian curvature prescribed by a simple formula depending on the &quot;right-hand side&quot; of the Monge–Ampère equation. As a consequence, they were able to prove the general solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the Monge–Ampère equation, which at the time had been a major open question except for two-dimensional domains.

Cheng and Yau&#x27;s papers followed some ideas presented in 1971 by Pogorelov, although his publicly available works (at the time of Cheng and Yau&#x27;s work) had lacked some significant detail. Pogorelov also published a more detailed version of his original ideas, and the resolutions of the problems are commonly attributed to both Cheng–Yau and Pogorelov. The approaches of Cheng−Yau and Pogorelov are no longer commonly seen in the literature on the Monge–Ampère equation, as other authors, notably Luis Caffarelli, Nirenberg, and Joel Spruck, have developed direct techniques which yield more powerful results, and which do not require the auxiliary use of the Minkowski problem.

Affine spheres are naturally described by solutions of certain Monge–Ampère equations, so that their full understanding is significantly more complicated than that of Euclidean spheres, the latter not being based on partial differential equations. In the &quot;parabolic&quot; case, affine spheres were completely classified as paraboloids by successive work of Konrad Jörgens, Eugenio Calabi, and Pogorelov. The &quot;elliptic&quot; affine spheres were identified as ellipsoids by Calabi. The &quot;hyperbolic&quot; affine spheres exhibit more complicated phenomena. Cheng and Yau proved that they are asymptotic to convex cones, and conversely that every (uniformly) convex cone corresponds in such a way to some hyperbolic affine sphere. They were also able to provide new proofs of the previous classifications of Calabi and Jörgens–Calabi–Pogorelov.

===Mirror symmetry===

A Calabi–Yau manifold is a compact Kähler manifold which is Ricci-flat; as a special case of Yau&#x27;s verification of the Calabi conjecture, such manifolds are known to exist. Mirror symmetry, which is a proposal developed by theoretical physicists dating from the late 1980s, postulates that Calabi−Yau manifolds of complex dimension three can be grouped into pairs which share certain characteristics, such as Euler and Hodge numbers. Based on this conjectural picture, the physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes proposed a formula of enumerative geometry which encodes the number of rational curves of any fixed degree in a general quintic hypersurface of four-dimensional complex projective space. Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Yau gave a rigorous proof that this formula holds. A year earlier, Alexander Givental had published a proof of the mirror formulas; according to Lian, Liu, and Yau, the details of his proof were only successfully filled in following their own publication. The proofs of Givental and Lian–Liu–Yau have some overlap but are distinct approaches to the problem, and each have since been given textbook expositions.

The works of Givental and of Lian−Liu−Yau confirm a prediction made by the more fundamental mirror symmetry conjecture of how three-dimensional Calabi−Yau manifolds can be paired off. However, their works do not logically depend on the conjecture itself, and so have no immediate bearing on its validity. With Andrew Strominger and Eric Zaslow, Yau proposed a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry might be systematically understood and proved to be true. Their idea is that a Calabi−Yau manifold with complex dimension three should be foliated by &quot;special Lagrangian&quot; tori, which are certain types of three-dimensional minimal submanifolds of the six-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlying the Calabi−Yau structure. Mirror manifolds would then be characterized, in terms of this conjectural structure, by having &quot;dual&quot; foliations. The Strominger−Yau−Zaslow (SYZ) proposal has been modified and developed in various ways since 1996. The conceptual picture that it provides has had a significant influence in the study of mirror symmetry, and research on its various aspects is currently an active field. It can be contrasted with the alternative homological mirror symmetry proposal by Maxim Kontsevich. The viewpoint of the SYZ conjecture is on geometric phenomena in Calabi–Yau spaces, while Kontsevich&#x27;s conjecture abstracts the problem to deal with purely algebraic structures and category theory.

===Comparison geometry===
In one of Yau&#x27;s earliest papers, written with Blaine Lawson, a number of fundamental results were found on the topology of closed Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive curvature. Their &quot;flat torus theorem&quot; characterizes the existence of a flat and totally geodesic immersed torus in terms of the algebra of the fundamental group. The &quot;splitting theorem&quot; says that the splitting of the fundamental group as a maximally noncommutative direct product implies the isometric splitting of the manifold itself. Similar results were obtained at the same time by Detlef Gromoll and Joseph Wolf. Their results have been extended to the broader context of isometric group actions on metric spaces of nonpositive curvature.

Jeff Cheeger and Yau studied the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold. They established the special case of Riemannian metrics for which geodesic spheres have constant mean curvature, which they proved to be characterized by radial symmetry of the heat kernel. Specializing to rotationally symmetric metrics, they used the exponential map to transplant the heat kernel to a geodesic ball on a general Riemannian manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetric &quot;model&quot; space under-estimates the Ricci curvature of the manifold itself, they carried out a direct calculation showing that the resulting function is a subsolution of the heat equation. As a consequence, they obtained a lower estimate of the heat kernel on a general Riemannian manifold in terms of lower bounds on its Ricci curvature. In the special case of nonnegative Ricci curvature, Peter Li and Yau were able to use their gradient estimates to amplify and improve the Cheeger−Yau estimate.

A well-known result of Yau&#x27;s, obtained independently by Calabi, shows that any noncompact Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature must have volume growth of at least a linear rate. A second proof, using the Bishop–Gromov inequality instead of function theory, was later found by Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, and Michael Taylor.

===Spectral geometry===

Given a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, spectral geometry studies the eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator, which in the case that the manifold has a boundary is coupled with a choice of boundary condition, usually Dirichlet or Neumann conditions. Paul Yang and Yau showed that in the case of a closed two-dimensional manifold, the first eigenvalue is bounded above by an explicit formula depending only on the genus and volume of the manifold. Earlier, Yau had modified Jeff Cheeger&#x27;s analysis of the Cheeger constant so as to be able to estimate the first eigenvalue from below in terms of geometric data.

In the 1910s, Hermann Weyl showed that, in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions on a smooth and bounded open subset of the plane, the eigenvalues have an asymptotic behavior which is dictated entirely by the area contained in the region. His result is known as Weyl&#x27;s law. In 1960, George Pólya conjectured that the Weyl law actually gives control of each individual eigenvalue, and not only of their asymptotic distribution. Li and Yau proved a weakened version of Pólya&#x27;s conjecture, obtaining control of the &quot;averages&quot; of the eigenvalues by the expression in the Weyl law.

In 1980, Li and Yau identified a number of new inequalities for Laplace–Beltrami eigenvalues, all based on the maximum principle and the differential Harnack estimates as pioneered five years earlier by Yau and Cheng−Yau. Their result on lower bounds based on geometric data is particularly well-known, and was the first of its kind to not require any conditional assumptions. Around the same time, a similar inequality was obtained by isoperimetric methods by Mikhael Gromov, although his result is weaker than Li and Yau&#x27;s. In collaboration with Isadore Singer, Bun Wong, and Shing-Toung Yau, Yau used the Li–Yau methodology to establish a gradient estimate for the quotient of the first two eigenfunctions. Analogously to Yau&#x27;s integration of gradient estimates to find Harnack inequalities, they were able to integrate their gradient estimate to obtain control of the &quot;fundamental gap,&quot; which is the difference between the first two eigenvalues. The work of Singer–Wong–Yau–Yau initiated a series of works by various authors in which new estimates on the fundamental gap were found and improved.

In 1982, Yau identified fourteen problems of interest in spectral geometry, including the above Pólya conjecture. A particular conjecture of Yau&#x27;s, on the control of the size of level sets of eigenfunctions by the value of the corresponding eigenvalue, was resolved by Alexander Logunov and Eugenia Malinnikova, who were awarded the 2017 Clay Research Award in part for their work.

===Discrete and computational geometry===
Xianfeng Gu and Yau considered the numerical computation of conformal maps between two-dimensional manifolds (presented as discretized meshes), and in particular the computation of uniformizing maps as predicted by the uniformization theorem. In the case of genus-zero surfaces, a map is conformal if and only if it is harmonic, and so Gu and Yau are able to compute conformal maps by direct minimization of a discretized Dirichlet energy. In the case of higher genus, the uniformizing maps are computed from their gradients, as determined from the Hodge theory of closed and harmonic 1-forms. The main work is thus to identify numerically effective discretizations of the classical theory. Their approach is sufficiently flexible to deal with general surfaces with boundary. With Tony Chan, Paul Thompson, and Yalin Wang, Gu and Yau applied their work to the problem of matching two brain surfaces, which is an important issue in medical imaging. In the most-relevant genus-zero case, conformal maps are only well-defined up to the action of the Möbius group. By further optimizing a Dirichlet-type energy which measures the mismatch of brain landmarks such as the central sulcus, they obtained mappings which are well-defined by such neurological features.

In the field of graph theory, Fan Chung and Yau extensively developed analogues of notions and results from Riemannian geometry. These results on differential Harnack inequalities, Sobolev inequalities, and heat kernel analysis, found partly in collaboration with Ronald Graham and Alexander Grigor&#x27;yan, were later written into textbook form as the last few chapters of her well-known book &quot;Spectral Graph Theory&quot;. Later, they introduced a Green&#x27;s function as defined for graphs, amounting to a pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian. Their work is naturally applicable to the study of hitting times for random walks and related topics.

In the interest of finding general graph-theoretic contexts for their results, Chung and Yau introduced a notion of Ricci-flatness of a graph. A more flexible notion of Ricci curvature, dealing with Markov chains on metric spaces, was later introduced by Yann Ollivier. Yong Lin, Linyuan Lu, and Yau developed some of the basic theory of Ollivier&#x27;s definition in the special context of graph theory, considering for instance the Ricci curvature of Erdős–Rényi random graphs. Lin and Yau also considered the &quot;curvature–dimension inequalities&quot; introduced earlier by Dominique Bakry and Michel Émery, relating it and Ollivier&#x27;s curvature to Chung–Yau&#x27;s notion of Ricci-flatness. They were further able to prove general lower bounds on Bakry–Émery and Ollivier&#x27;s curvatures in the case of locally finite graphs.

<text>Jug Rock is a natural geological formation located outside of Shoals, Indiana, in the valley of the East Fork of the White River. It is composed of sandstone, and is the largest free-standing table rock formation (also called a &quot;mushroom rock&quot;) in the United States east of the Mississippi River. It is part of the Mansfield formation, laid down in the Pennsylvanian geological epoch, roughly 325 to 286 million years ago. Erosion along fracture lines separated it from a nearby cliff. A companion feature, House Rock, stands opposite Jug Rock.

==References Geological Publication==
In the &quot;Second Report of the Geological Survey of Indiana&quot;, published in 1871, State Geologist E. T. Cox wrote:
One of the most interesting spots to visit, for obtaining a view of this character of scenery, is near the town of Shoals, on the road to the Indian Sulphur Springs. A high ridge of millstone grit, here, terminates within a few yards of the East Fork of the White River, from the top of which, there is a projecting mass of conglomerate sandstone, called the &quot;Pinnacle,&quot; which stands one hundred and seventy feet above the level of the stream. Cyclopean blocks, that have broken off, lie around the foot of the ridge, in every conceivable position. On the north side of this ridge, the conglomerate has been cut through by disintegrating forces, which left, at some distance from the main ledge, a tall mass of rock, which has received the name of &quot;Jug Rock,&quot; from the fancied resemblance which it bears to a jug. It is forty-two feet high and supports, on its top, a flat projecting layer, which is called the &quot;stopper.&quot; Just above the bulge of the jug are irregular lines of stratification, known as false bedding. The lower part is thickly set with quartz pebbles. The frontispiece to this volume presents a view of the &quot;Jug Rock&quot; which was copied from a photograph taken by D. Allbright. For this faithful representative of a highly interesting geological scene, I am indebted to B. F. Devol, and D. Allbright, of Shoals.

Jug Rock is currently part of a nature preserve owned by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

This unusual rock feature gives its name to the team of nearby Shoals High School, &quot;Shoals Jug Rox.&quot; The Jug Rock- named &quot;Roxer Boxer,&quot; is the school&#x27;s mascot.

<doc id="303158" wikidata="Q4879201" url="?curid=303158" title="Omni Bedford Springs Resort">
<text>The Omni Bedford Springs Resort &amp; Spa is a resort hotel which is located outside of Bedford, Pennsylvania. Established in 1806, it is one of the last and best-preserved of 19th-century resort hotels based around mineral springs.

The hotel was documented in 2005 by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). Omni Bedford Springs Resort &amp; Spa is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The resort is part of the Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts brand, based out of Dallas, Texas.

A portion of the resort property, including the hotel, golf course, and spring areas, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1984.

== History ==
In 1796, Nicholas Shauffler discovered a high mineral content in the natural freshwater springs located on the property of Fredrick Naugel, outside of Bedford, Pennsylvania. These springs were reputed to have &#x27;healing powers&quot; by the Native Americans who had come to this spot to drink from and bathe in the waters for centuries. Doctor John Anderson, then practicing in the town of Bedford, purchased the land containing the springs in 1798 and proceeded to build bathing facilities for his patients; thus starting the tradition of people traveling to experience the waters of the Bedford springs and setting the foundation for what is today Bedford Springs Resort, an upscale destination, located just off the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The popularity and reputation of the Dr. Anderson&#x27;s treatments grew throughout the early 19th Century and by 1809, there were three buildings on the site, including The Stone House, Crockford and a precursor to the Evitt House. According to a travelogue by Joshua Galpin in 1809, these buildings included a &quot;large frame lodging house and several smaller ones for families – warm and cold baths and a billiard room.&quot; In 1824, Bedford Springs was hailed as the &quot;Montpelier of America&quot; in a column in the July edition of the National Gazette &amp; Library Register, which noted with praise the waters, accommodations, activities, food and wine. The popularity of the resort benefited from the emphasis on outdoor life in the mid-nineteenth century as east coast American cities became increasingly industrialized and polluted, and from the establishment of stops in Bedford for the B&amp;O and Pennsylvania Railroads beginning in 1872, providing easy accessibility from cities such as Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City.

Bedford Springs became an attraction for politicians, and, in addition to serving as the &quot;Summer White House&quot; for President James Buchanan from 1857 to 1861, also served as a getaway and meeting place for other presidents such as William Henry Harrison, James K. Polk and Zachary Taylor, as well as a multitude of senators and congressmen, and their families. The first transatlantic cable sent from England to the United States was received by President Buchanan at the hotel on August 12, 1858.
The decades of the 1870s through the 1890s, the &quot;golden age&quot; of America&#x27;s grand resorts, saw the &quot;resort gold standard&quot; set at Bedford Springs. A series of colorful spring houses, bridges, and gates dotted the expansive grounds, and a &quot;serpentine trail&quot; led party excursions from one spring to the next. In the beginning of the 20th century, as medicine and health-awareness advanced, the validity of the Springs&#x27; healing powers decreased slightly, but the hotel still flourished, and in 1905, a major renovation of the complex included a monumental double-decked colonnade, which connected the hotel&#x27;s main dining room to a columned pavilion at the Magnesia Springs across Shober&#x27;s Run, as well as a new building with a spring-fed indoor pool, reportedly the first such facility in the United States at the time it was built.

In the 1930s, the hotel&#x27;s resident physician, Dr. William E. Fitch, established the &quot;Bedford Cure,&quot; a health regimen that required a three-week stay at the resort, which still operated successfully throughout the 1930s and 1940s. During World War II, the hotel and its grounds were used by the U.S. Navy as the Naval Training School (Radio) and then later as a detention center for interned Japanese diplomats.

The decade of the 1950s saw numerous improvements and renovations to the property, including the installation of modern environmental controls and sprinkler systems. Bedford Springs was also open year-round for the first time in 1950. The hotel continued to operate for the next three decades, highlighted by then California Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s stay in 1975, making him the seventh current, former or future president to spend time at Bedford Springs. However tastes in leisure travel had changed significantly over the years and the property eventually shut its doors in 1986. Two years later, a flash flood severely damaged several buildings at Bedford Springs and the site fell into disrepair. Even so, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Then in 1998, the property was purchased by Bedford Resort Partners Limited for $8 million and the massive undertaking of restoring Bedford Springs to its former prestige began.

==The springs==
The Bedford Springs were believed to have various and diverse medicinal values due to each spring&#x27;s unique mix of minerals. The &quot;Bedford Cure&quot; required the patient to imbibe each type of water (or a specific type of water depending on the individual&#x27;s ailment) on a daily basis during their three-week stay. Examples of the unique springs and their uses are &quot;Magnesium Spring,&quot; used for stomach ailments, the &quot;Iron Spring,&quot; which was prescribed for iron deficiencies and healthy bones, the &quot;Black Spring&quot; which was used primarily to irrigate the golf course; and the &quot;Sweet Spring&quot; the waters of which were the most palatable. An eighth spring, named the Eternal Spring was discovered in 2006, during the expansion and renovation of the resort.

==The restored resort==
The hotel re-opened for overnight guests on July 12, 2007. The hotel buildings were completely restored and renovated, and additional wings added. In January 2009, the resort was purchased by Omni Hotels, a luxury hotel brand that operates properties across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The restored resort is a 216-room hotel with 4 suites, golf course, spa, and conference facility. The spa wing accommodates additional rooms and a full-service spa. The hotel contains a 130-seat restaurant along with a fully restored colonial-style tavern in the Stone House, with original, massive stone walls and beams dating to 1806.

The revitalized resort also contains a new outdoor pool and a complete restoration of the original indoor pool. The resort offers outdoor activities including a network of hiking trails to nearby Rainsburg and Buchanan State Forest, bicycling, off-road Segways, UTVs, cross-country skiing, fly fishing, river rafting, carriage rides and day excursions to many of Bedford&#x27;s famous historic sites and beautiful covered bridges.

==Golf course==
The resort&#x27;s golf course was originally designed by Spencer Oldham in 1895 and is one of the oldest courses in the United States. In 1901, head professional Charles Thorn worked to improve the course by rebuilding greens and tee boxes and installing an irrigation system using the natural springs found in the area as a water source.

In 1912, A.W. Tillinghast redesigned the course bringing it down to 9 holes. In 1923, Donald Ross redesigned the course again and brought it back to 18 holes. During the resorts extensive restoration, the golf course was brought back to the design that Donald Ross created in 1923.

As part of the resorts relaunch, an extensive renovation of the Tillinghast/Ross course was undertaken. The historical course had suffered over time from sediment filling in the margins of the waterways, and from &quot;modern&quot; approaches to landscape in the 1950s, which tried to &quot;tidy-up&quot; the creek edges with a &quot;mown-lawn&quot; approach. The renovation of the course, renamed the Bedford Springs Old Course, restored the natural spring bed with native grasses and other natural materials indigenous to the flood plain. Befitting the course&#x27;s siting next to Shober&#x27;s Run, there are water features apparent at nearly every hole.

==The spa==
Fed by the recently discovered eighth spring, the Springs Eternal Spa is a spa and salon that pays homage to what has historically made Bedford Springs such an alluring destination. The spa&#x27;s signature treatment, called The Bedford Baths, is a ritual of immersing the body alternatively in hot and cool pools and soaking in herb-infused steam from the mineral-rich springs.
