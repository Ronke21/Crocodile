<text>Charlotte&#x27;s Web is a book of children&#x27;s literature by American author E. B. White and illustrated by Garth Williams. It was published on October 15, 1952, by Harper &amp; Brothers. It tells the story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered, Charlotte writes messages in her web praising him, such as &quot;Some Pig&quot;, &quot;Terrific&quot;, &quot;Radiant&quot;, and &quot;Humble&quot;, to persuade the farmer to let him live.

The book is considered a classic of children&#x27;s literature, enjoyed by readers of all ages. The description of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is an often-cited example of rhythm in writing, as the pace of the sentences reflects the motion of the swing. In 2000, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; listed the book as the best-selling children&#x27;s paperback of all time.

The book was adapted into an animated feature film by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. Paramount released a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web 2: Wilbur&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;, in the US in 2003. Universal Home Entertainment Productions released the film internationally. A live-action feature film version of E. B. White&#x27;s original story was released in 2006. A video game based on this adaptation was released that same year.

==Plot==
The Arable family are a farm family who raise and sell animals. One day, John Arable attempts to slaughter the runt of a litter of piglets that were born the night before, but his daughter Fern pleads for the piglet&#x27;s life, and John gives him to her. Naming him Wilbur, Fern treats him as a pet, and the two become incredibly close. Eventually, Wilbur is no longer small, and so John decides to sell him, to Fern&#x27;s dismay. Wilbur is given to Fern&#x27;s maternal uncle, Homer Zuckerman, allowing her to periodically visit him.

From here on, the various farm animals are depicted as anthropomorphic. In Zuckerman&#x27;s barnyard, Wilbur yearns for Fern and is met with varying reactions from the other animals, with some, such as the motherly goose, showing him compassion, and others, such as the head ram, treating him with scorn. One day, the ram offhandedly tells Wilbur that Zuckerman is raising him for slaughter and consumption, leaving him distraught. As he mourns his fate, a barn spider named Charlotte, whose web sits in a doorway overlooking his pigpen, comforts him. She promises to find a way to save his life and takes on a motherly role for him. Meanwhile, Fern often listens in on the animals&#x27; conversations, to her mother&#x27;s concern.

As summer passes, Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur. Reasoning that Zuckerman would not kill a famous pig, she weaves words and short phrases in praise of Wilbur into her web, the first phrase being &quot;Some Pig&quot;. This turns Wilbur, and the barn as a whole, into a tourist attraction because many people believe the web to be a miracle. After the excitement dies down, the phrase gets destroyed. On the goose&#x27;s suggestion, Charlotte weaves the word &quot;Terrific&quot; into her web, beginning the cycle anew. Although Zuckerman is pleased with Wilbur&#x27;s fame, his plan to slaughter him stays firm. In another effort to maintain the public&#x27;s interest in him, Charlotte tells Templeton, a gluttonous rat that lives under Wilbur&#x27;s trough and holds a contentious relationship with the other animals, to get another word for the web. Templeton finds a laundry detergent ad with the word &quot;Radiant&quot;, which Charlotte then weaves into her web.

As a result of this latest round of fame, Zuckerman enters Wilbur in the county fair, and Charlotte and Templeton accompany him. The Arables also go to the fair, but Fern, despite still cherishing Wilbur, has matured, and instead spends time with her childhood sweetheart, Henry Fussy. Charlotte weaves another word brought by Templeton, &quot;Humble&quot;, into the web she spins at Wilbur&#x27;s stall at the fair. Wilbur fails to win first prize, but is awarded a special prize by the judges. Charlotte, who has laid an egg sac at the fair, hears the presentation of the award over the public address system and realizes that the prize means Zuckerman will cherish Wilbur for as long as he lives and will never slaughter him. However, Charlotte, being a barn spider with a naturally short lifespan, is already dying of natural causes by the time the award is announced. Knowing that she has saved Wilbur, and satisfied with the outcome of her life, she decides not to return to the barn with Wilbur and Templeton. She gives them her final request to have her egg sac taken back to the barn, and then dies alone at the fairgrounds.

Wilbur waits out the winter, during which Charlotte&#x27;s children hatch. Most of them fly away, to Wilbur&#x27;s dismay, but three choose to remain. Future descendants of Charlotte keep Wilbur company for many years, though he always holds Charlotte in more esteem than them all.

==Characters==

* Wilbur is a rambunctious pig, the runt of his litter. He is often strongly emotional.
* Charlotte A. Cavatica, or simply Charlotte, is a spider who befriends Wilbur. In some passages, she is the heroine of the story.
* John Arable is Wilbur&#x27;s first owner.
* Fern Arable, John&#x27;s daughter, who adopts Wilbur when he&#x27;s a piglet, and later visits him. She is the only human in the story capable of understanding animal conversation.
* Lurvy, the hired man at Zuckerman&#x27;s farm, who is the first to read the message in Charlotte&#x27;s web.
* Templeton is a rat who helps Charlotte and Wilbur only when offered food. He serves as a somewhat caustic, self-serving comic relief to the plot.
* Avery Arable is Fern&#x27;s elder brother and John&#x27;s son. Like Templeton, he is a source of comic relief.
* Homer Zuckerman is Fern&#x27;s uncle who keeps Wilbur in his barn. He has a wife named Edith and an assistant named Lurvy.
* Other animals in Zuckerman&#x27;s barn, with whom Wilbur converses, include a disdainful lamb, a talkative goose, and an intelligent &quot;old sheep&quot;.
* Henry Fussy is a boy of Fern&#x27;s age, of whom Fern becomes fond.
* Dr. Dorian is the family physician/psychologist consulted by Fern&#x27;s mother and something of a wise old man character.
* Uncle is a large pig whom Charlotte disdains for coarse manners but is recognized as Wilbur&#x27;s rival at the fair.
* Charlotte&#x27;s children are the 514 children of Charlotte the spider. Although they were born at the barn, all but three of them (Joy, Aranea, and Nellie) go their own ways by ballooning.

==Themes==

===Death===
Death is a major theme seen throughout the book and is brought forth by that of Charlotte. According to Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte&#x27;s web acts as a barrier that separates the two worlds of life and death. Scholar Amy Ratelle says that through Charlotte&#x27;s continual killing and eating of flies throughout the book, White makes the concept of death normal for Wilbur and the readers. Neither Wilbur nor Templeton sees death as a part of their lives; Templeton sees it only as something that will happen at some time in the distant future, while Wilbur views it as the end of everything.

Wilbur constantly has death on his mind at night when he is worrying over whether or not he will be slaughtered. Even though he is able to escape his death, Charlotte, who takes care of him, is not able to escape her own. She passes away, but, according to Trudelle H. Thomas, &quot;even in the face of death, life continues and ultimate goodness wins out&quot;. Jordan Anne Deveraux explains that E.B. White discusses a few realities of death. From the novel, readers learn that death can be delayed but that no one can avoid it forever.

===Change===
For Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte&#x27;s web also acts as a signifier of change. The change Kinghorn refers to is that of both the human world and the farm/barn world. For both of these worlds, change is something that can&#x27;t be avoided. Along with the changing of the seasons throughout the book, the characters also go through their own changes. Jordan Anne Deveraux also explains that Wilbur and Fern each go through their changes to transition from childhood closer to adulthood throughout the novel. This is evidenced by Wilbur accepting death and Fern giving up her dolls. Wilbur grows throughout the book, allowing him to become the caretaker of Charlotte&#x27;s children just as she was a caretaker for him, as is explained by scholar Sue Misheff. But rather than accept the changes that are forced upon them, according to Sophie Mills, the characters aim to go beyond the limits of change. In a different way, Wilbur goes through a change when he switches locations. Amy Ratelle explains that when he moves from the Arables&#x27; farm to Homer Zuckerman&#x27;s farm, he goes from being a loved pet to a farm animal.

===Innocence===
Fern goes from being a child to being more of an adult. As she experiences this change, Kinghorn notes that it can also be considered a fall from innocence. Wilbur also starts out young and innocent at the beginning of the book. A comparison is drawn between the innocence and youth of Fern and Wilbur. Sophie Mills states that they can identify with one another. Both Wilbur and Fern are, at first, horrified by the realization that life must end; however, by the end of the book, they learn to accept that, eventually, everything must die. According to Matthew Scully, the book presents the difference in the worldview of adults versus the worldview of children. Children, such as Fern, believe killing another for food is wrong, while adults have been gradually conditioned to believe that it is natural.

==History==
The book was published three years after White began writing it. His editor, Ursula Nordstrom, said that one day in 1952, he arrived at her office and handed her a new manuscript, the only copy of the book then in existence, which she read soon after and enjoyed. The book was released on October 15, 1952.

In light of White&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Pig&quot;, published in 1948, which gives an account of his own failure to save a sick pig (bought for butchering), the book can be seen as his attempt &quot;to save his pig in retrospect&quot;. His overall motivation for the book has not been revealed, and he once wrote: &quot;I haven&#x27;t told why I wrote the book, but I haven&#x27;t told you why I sneeze, either. A book is a sneeze.&quot;

When White met the spider who originally inspired Charlotte, he called her Charlotte Epeira (after &quot;Epeira sclopetaria&quot;, the Grey Cross spider, now known as &quot;Larinioides sclopetarius&quot;), before discovering that the more modern name for that genus was &quot;Aranea&quot;. In the book, Charlotte gives her full name as &quot;Charlotte A. Cavatica&quot;, revealing her as a barn spider, an orb-weaver with the scientific name &quot;Araneus cavaticus&quot;.

The arachnid anatomical terms (mentioned in the beginning of chapter nine) and other information that White used, came mostly from &quot;American Spiders&quot; by Willis J. Gertsch and &quot;The Spider Book&quot; by John Henry Comstock, both of which combine a sense of poetry with scientific fact. White incorporated details from Comstock&#x27;s accounts of baby spiders, most notably the &quot;flight&quot; of the young spiders on silken parachutes. He sent Gertsch&#x27;s book to illustrator Garth Williams. Williams&#x27;s initial drawings depicted a spider with a woman&#x27;s face, and White suggested that he simply draw a realistic spider instead.

White originally opened the book with an introduction of Wilbur and the barnyard (which later became the third chapter) but decided to begin the book by introducing Fern and her family on the first page. White&#x27;s publishers were at one point concerned with the end and tried to get him to change it.

&quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; has become White&#x27;s most famous book, but he treasured his privacy and that of the farmyard and barn that helped inspire it, which have been kept off limits to the public according to his wishes.

==Reception==
The book was generally well-reviewed when it was released. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Eudora Welty wrote: &quot;As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.&quot;

Aside from its paperback sales, the book is 78th on the all-time bestselling hardback book list. According to publicity for the 2006 film adaptation (see below), it has sold more than 45 million copies and been translated into 23 languages. It was a Newbery Honor book for 1953, losing to &quot;Secret of the Andes&quot; by Ann Nolan Clark for the medal.

In 1970, White won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, a major prize in the field of children&#x27;s literature, for &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; along with his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1945).

Seth Lerer, in his book &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, finds that Charlotte represents female authorship and creativity, and compares her to other female characters in children&#x27;s literature such as Jo March in &quot;Little Women&quot; and Mary Lennox in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Nancy Larrick brings to attention the &quot;startling note of realism&quot; in the opening line, &quot;Where&#x27;s Papa going with that ax?&quot;

Illustrator Henry Cole expressed his deep childhood appreciation of the characters and story, and calls Garth Williams&#x27;s illustrations full of &quot;sensitivity, warmth, humor, and intelligence&quot;. Illustrator Diana Cain Bluthenthal states that Williams&#x27; illustrations inspired and influenced her.

An unabridged audio book read by White himself reappeared decades after it had originally been recorded. &quot;Newsweek&quot; writes that White reads the story &quot;without artifice and with a mellow charm&quot;, and that &quot;White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don&#x27;t listen (at least, not to the sad parts) while driving&quot;. Joe Berk, president of Pathway Sound, had recorded the book with White in his neighbor&#x27;s house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable experience) and released it in LP. From Michael Sims: &quot;The producer later said that it took him 17 takes to read the death scene of Charlotte. And finally, they would walk outside, and E.B. White would go, this is ridiculous, a grown man crying over the death of an imaginary insect. And then, he would go in and start crying again when he got to that moment.&quot; Bantam released &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; alongside &quot;Stuart Little&quot; on CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired the two books for rather a large amount.

In 2005, a teacher in California conceived of a project for her class in which they would send out hundreds of drawings of spiders (each representing Charlotte&#x27;s child, Aranea, going out into the world so that she can return and tell Wilbur of what she has seen) with accompanying letters; they ended up visiting a large number of parks, monuments, and museums, and were hosted by and/or prompted responses from celebrities and politicians such as John Travolta and then-First Lady Laura Bush.

In 2003, the book was listed at number 170 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s 200 &quot;best-loved novels&quot;. A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for third-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed it as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children.&quot; It was one of the &quot;Top 100 Chapter Books&quot; of all time in a 2012 poll by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In 2010, the New York Public Library reported that &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; was the sixth most borrowed book in its history.

Its awards and nominations include:
* John Newbery Honor Book (1953)
* Horn Book Fanfare (1952)
* Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal (1970) (awarded to White for his children&#x27;s books: &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; and &quot;Stuart Little&quot;)
* Massachusetts Children&#x27;s Book Award (1984)

<doc id="302319" wikidata="Q182263" url="?curid=302319" title="Empathy">
<text>Empathy is generally described as the ability to take on another person&#x27;s perspective, to understand, feel, and possibly share and respond to their experience. There are more (sometimes conflicting) definitions of empathy that include but are not limited to social, cognitive, and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others. Often times, empathy is considered to be a broad term, and broken down into more specific concepts and types that include cognitive empathy, emotional (or affective) empathy, empathy, and spiritual empathy.

Empathy is still a topic of research. The major areas of research include the development of empathy, the genetics and neuroscience of empathy, cross-species empathy, and the impairment of empathy. Some researchers have made efforts to quantify empathy through different methods, such as from questionnaires where participants can fill out and then be scored on their answers.

The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate and may be achieved unconsciously. Empathy is not all-or-nothing; rather, a person can be more or less empathic toward another and empirical research supports a variety of interventions that are able to improve empathy.

The English word &quot;empathy&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (, meaning &quot;physical affection or passion&quot;). That word derives from (, &quot;in, at&quot;) and (, &quot;passion&quot; or &quot;suffering&quot;). Theodor Lipps adapted the German aesthetic term (&quot;feeling into&quot;) to psychology in 1903, and Edward B. Titchener translated into English as &quot;empathy&quot; in 1909. In modern Greek may mean, depending on context, prejudice, malevolence, malice, or hatred.

== Definitions ==
Since its introduction into the English language, &quot;empathy&quot; has had a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) definitions among both researchers and laypeople. Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of phenomena, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them, experiencing emotions that match another person&#x27;s, discerning what another person is thinking or feeling, and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized derives from the way emotions are characterized. For example, if emotions are characterized by bodily feelings, then understanding the bodily feelings of another will be considered central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then understanding those beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy.

Paradigmatically, a person exhibits empathy when they communicate an accurate recognition of the significance of another person&#x27;s ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that seems accurate and tolerable to the recognized person. This is a nuanced perspective on empathy which assists in the understanding of complex human emotions and interactions. Acknowledging subjective experiences highlights the need for balance and understanding when engaging in empathy.

One&#x27;s ability to recognize the bodily feelings or emotions of another is related to one&#x27;s imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself. 
=== Distinctions between empathy and related concepts ===
Compassion and sympathy are terms associated with empathy. A person feels compassion when they notice others are in need, and this feeling motivates that person to help. Like empathy, compassion has a wide range of definitions and purported facets (which overlap with some definitions of empathy). Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an empathic concern for another person, and the wish to see them better off or happier.

Empathy is also related to pity and emotional contagion. One feels pity towards others who might be in trouble or in need of help. This feeling is described as &quot;feeling sorry&quot; for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a mob) imitatively &quot;catches&quot; the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.

&quot;Alexithymia&quot; describes a deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing one&#x27;s own emotions (unlike empathy which is about someone else&#x27;s emotions).

== Classification ==
Empathy has two major components:

# , also called &quot;emotional empathy&quot;, is the ability to respond with an appropriate emotion to another&#x27;s mental states. Our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion: being affected by another&#x27;s emotional or arousal state. Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:
#* Empathic concern: sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering.
#* Personal distress: feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another&#x27;s suffering. There is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a form of empathy or instead is something distinct from empathy. There may be a developmental aspect to this subdivision. Infants respond to the distress of others by getting distressed themselves; only when they are two years old do they start to respond in other-oriented ways: trying to help, comfort, and share.
#* Affective mentalizing: uses clues like body language, facial expressions, knowledge about the other&#x27;s beliefs &amp; situation, and context to understand more about what one is empathizing with.
# is the ability to understand another&#x27;s perspective or mental state. The terms &quot;empathic accuracy&quot;, &quot;social cognition&quot;, &quot;perspective-taking&quot;, &quot;theory of mind&quot;, and &quot;mentalizing&quot; are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent. Although measures of cognitive empathy include self-report questionnaires and behavioral measures, a 2019 meta-analysis found only a negligible association between self-report and behavioral measures, suggesting that people are generally not able to accurately assess their own cognitive empathy abilities. Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:
#* Perspective-taking: the tendency to spontaneously adopt others&#x27; psychological perspectives.
#* Fantasy: the tendency to identify with fictional characters.
#* Tactical (or strategic) empathy: the deliberate use of perspective-taking to achieve certain desired ends.
#* Emotion regulation: a damper on the emotional contagion process that allows you to empathize without being overwhelmed by the emotion you are empathizing with.

The scientific community has not coalesced around a precise definition of these constructs, but there is consensus about this distinction. Affective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one another; someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another&#x27;s perspective.

Additional constructs that have been proposed include &quot;behavioral empathy&quot; (which governs how one chooses to respond to feelings of empathy), &quot;social empathy&quot; (in which the empathetic person integrates their understanding of broader social dynamics into their empathetic modeling), and &quot;ecological empathy&quot; (which encompasses empathy directed towards the natural world).

In addition, Fritz Breithaupt emphasizes the importance of empathy &quot;suppression&quot; mechanisms in healthy empathy.

== Measurement ==
Efforts to measure empathy go back to at least the mid-twentieth century. Researchers approach the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters. Other experimenters required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject&#x27;s body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person&#x27;s empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced.

Bodily or &quot;somatic&quot; measures can be seen as behavioral measures at a micro level. They measure empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions. Such changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of &quot;emotional contagion&quot; or mirroring. These reactions, while they appear to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, reflect the results of emotional reactions based on cognitions associated with role-taking (&quot;if I were him I would feel...&quot;).

Picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers. Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a seven-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions.

In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy; scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form.

=== Self-report measures ===

Measures of empathy also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to reveal the affective, cognitive-affective, or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to reveal both cognitive and affective substrates. However, a 2019 meta analysis questions the validity of self-report measures of cognitive empathy, finding that such self-report measures have negligibly small correlations with corresponding behavioral measures. Balancing subjective self-perceptions along with observable behaviors can help to contribute to a more reliable assessment of empathy.

Such measures are also vulnerable to measuring not empathy but the difference between a person&#x27;s felt empathy and their standards for how much empathy is appropriate. For example, one researcher found that students scored themselves as less empathetic after taking her empathy class. After learning more about empathy, the students became more exacting in how they judged their own feelings and behavior, expected more from themselves, and so rated themselves more severely.

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the &quot;Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)&quot;.

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is among the oldest published measurement tools still in frequent use (first published in 1983) that provides a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four seven-item scales covering the subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy described above. More recent self-report tools include The Empathy Quotient (EQ) created by Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items. Another multi-dimensional scale is the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE, first published in 2011).

The Empathic Experience Scale is a 30-item questionnaire that measures empathy from a phenomenological perspective on intersubjectivity, which provides a common basis for the perceptual experience (vicarious experience dimension) and a basic cognitive awareness (intuitive understanding dimension) of others&#x27; emotional states.

It is difficult to make comparisons over time using such questionnaires because of how language changes. For example, one study used a single questionnaire to measure 13,737 college students between 1979 and 2009, and found that empathy scores fell substantially over that time. A critic noted these results could be because the wording of the questionnaire had become anachronistically quaint (it used idioms no longer in common use, like &quot;tender feelings&quot;, &quot;ill at ease&quot;, &quot;quite touched&quot;, or &quot;go to pieces&quot; that today&#x27;s students might not identify with).

== Development ==
=== Ontogenetic development ===
By the age of two, children normally begin to exhibit fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person&#x27;s emotional state. Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy; they understand that, as with their own actions, other people&#x27;s actions have goals. Toddlers sometimes comfort others or show concern for them. During their second year, they play games of falsehood or pretend in an effort to fool others. Such actions require that the child knows what others believe in order that the child can manipulate those beliefs.

According to researchers at the University of Chicago who used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), children between the ages of seven and twelve, when seeing others being injured, experience brain activity similar that which would occur if the child themself had been injured. Their findings are consistent with previous fMRI studies of pain empathy with adults, and previous findings that vicarious experiencing, particularly of others&#x27; distress, is hardwired and present early in life. The research found additional areas of the brain, associated with social and moral cognition, were activated when young people saw another person intentionally hurt by somebody, including regions involved in moral reasoning.

Although children are capable of showing some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most do not demonstrate a full theory of mind until around the age of four. Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one&#x27;s own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy. Children usually can pass false-belief tasks (a test for a theory of mind) around the age of four. It is theorised that people with autism find using a theory of mind to be very difficult, but there is quite a bit of controversy on this subject. (e.g. the Sally–Anne test).

Empathic maturity is a cognitive-structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing. It addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Adults who operate with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.

=== Individual differences ===

The Empathic Concern scale assesses other-oriented feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures self-oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease. Researchers have used behavioral and neuroimaging data to analyze extraversion and agreeableness. Both are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions that are important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).

=== Sex differences ===

On average, females score higher than males on measures of empathy, such as the Empathy Quotient (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Both males and females with autistic spectrum disorders usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ (see below for more detail on autism and empathy).

Other studies show no significant sex differences, and instead suggest that gender differences are the result of motivational differences, such as upholding stereotypes. Gender stereotypes about men and women can affect how they express emotions. The sex difference is small to moderate, somewhat inconsistent, and is often influenced by the person&#x27;s motivations or social environment. Bosson &quot;et al.&quot; say &quot;physiological measures of emotion and studies that track people in their daily lives find no consistent sex differences in the experience of emotion&quot;, which &quot;suggests that women may amplify certain emotional expressions, or men may suppress them&quot;.

However, a 2014 review from &quot;Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews&quot; reported that there is evidence that &quot;sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural byproducts driven by socialization.&quot; The review found sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age, and consistent and stable across lifespan. Females, on average, had higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy, regardless of gender, continue to be higher in empathy throughout development. Analysis of brain event-related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males. An investigation of N400 amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations, which positively correlated with self-reported empathy. Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fMRI literature. Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy. The researchers believe that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by environmental influences but rather by human evolution and inheritance. Throughout prehistory, women were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the &quot;Primary Caretaker Hypothesis&quot;, prehistoric men did not have such selective pressure as primary caretakers. This might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.

A review published in &quot;Neuropsychologia&quot; found that females tended to be better at recognizing facial affects, expression processing, and emotions in general. Males tended to be better at recognizing specific behaviors such as anger, aggression, and threatening cues. A 2014 meta-analysis, in &quot;Cognition and Emotion&quot;, found a small female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition.

=== Environmental influences ===
Some research theorizes that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, affect the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro-social relationships and helps mediate aggression.

Caroline Tisot studied how environmental factors like parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences affect the development of empathy in young children. The children studied were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children&#x27;s parents completed a questionnaire to assess parenting style and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale. The study found that certain parenting practices, as opposed to parenting style as a whole, contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was significantly positively related to empathy in children, especially boys. Maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy in children, especially girls.

Empathy may be disrupted due to brain trauma such as stroke. In most cases, empathy is impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain. Damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can profoundly impact a person&#x27;s capacity to experience empathy. People with an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy. More than half of those people with a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.

There is some evidence that empathy is a skill that one can improve in with training.

=== Evolution across species ===
Studies in animal behavior and neuroscience indicate that empathy is not restricted to humans (however the interpretation of such research depends in part on how expansive a definition of empathy researchers adopt).

Empathy-like behaviors have been observed in primates, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in bonobos, perhaps the most empathic primate.

One study demonstrated prosocial behavior elicited by empathy in rodents. Rodents demonstrate empathy for cagemates (but not strangers) in pain.

An influential study on the evolution of empathy by Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal discusses a neural perception-action mechanism and postulates a bottom-up model of empathy that ties together all levels, from state matching to perspective-taking.

University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety agrees that empathy is not exclusive to humans, but that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social attachment, and parental care. Neural circuits involved in empathy and caring include the brainstem, the amygdala, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex.

== Other animals and empathy between species ==

Researchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio-emotional development of the bonobo chimpanzee. They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events—events related to themselves (e.g. loss of a fight) as well as stressful events of others. They found that bonobos sought out body contact with one another as a coping mechanism. Bonobos sought out more body contact after watching an event distress other bonobos than after their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos sought out more physical contact than orphaned bonobos after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding in successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors. De Waal suggests the advantages provided to mothers who understand the needs of their children are the reason empathy evolved in the first place.

Empathic-like behavior has been observed in chimpanzees in different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in both natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers led by Teresa Romero observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees in two separate groups. Acts of consolation were observed in both groups. This behavior is also found in humans, particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

Dogs have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards humans. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger. When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes; however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking, and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging, or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could suggest that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, it could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hen&#x27;s heart rate increased, she sounded vocal alarms, she decreased her personal preening, and her body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if it were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick&#x27;s behavior correlated with the perceived threat.

Humans can empathize with other species. One study of a sample of organisms showed that the strength of human empathic perceptions (and compassionate reactions) toward an organism is negatively correlated with how long ago our species&#x27; had a common ancestor. In other words, the more phylogenetically close a species is to us, the more likely we are to feel empathy and compassion towards it.

==Genetics==
Measures of empathy show evidence of being genetically influenced. For example, carriers of the deletion variant of ADRA2B show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images. The gene 5-HTTLPR seems to influence sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b. Carriers of the double G variant of the OXTR gene have better social skills and higher self-esteem. A gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome 3 influences the human ability to read, understand, and respond to emotions in others.

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience offers insights into the neural basis of the mind&#x27;s ability to understand and process emotion. Studies of mirror neurons attempt to measure the neural basis for human mind-reading and emotion-sharing abilities and thereby to explain the basis of the empathy reaction. People who score high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems. Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another&#x27;s emotional state. The empathic person mirrors or mimics the emotional response they would expect to feel if they were in the other person&#x27;s place. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another&#x27;s emotional response. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.

A person empathizes by feeling what they believe to be the emotions of another, which makes empathy both affective and cognitive. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.

Meta-analysis of fMRI studies of empathy confirms that different brain areas are activated during affective-perceptual empathy than during cognitive-evaluative empathy. Affective empathy is correlated with increased activity in the insula while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid cingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A study with patients who experienced different types of brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy. Specifically, the inferior frontal gyrus appears to be responsible for emotional empathy, and the ventromedial prefrontal gyrus seems to mediate cognitive empathy.

fMRI has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy. Observing another person&#x27;s emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network that are involved in processing that same state in oneself, whether it is disgust, touch, or pain. As these emotional states are being observed, the brain is able activate a network of the brain that is involved in empathy. There are two separate systems of the brain involved with the feeling of empathy: a cognitive system and an emotional system. The cognitive system helps an individual understand another&#x27;s perspective while the emotional system enables our ability to empathize emotionally. The neuronal network that is activated controls the observers response to these emotional states thus prompting an empathetic response.

The study of the neural underpinnings of empathy received increased interest following a paper published by S.D. Preston and Frans de Waal after the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action and when they themselves perform it. Researchers suggest that paying attention to perceiving another individual&#x27;s state activates neural representations, and that this activation primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses (perception-action coupling), unless inhibited. This mechanism resembles the common coding theory between perception and action.

Another study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different regions of the brain associated with the performance of &quot;social&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot; tasks. These findings suggest that the cognition associated with reasoning about the &quot;state of another person&#x27;s mind&quot; and &quot;causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects&quot; are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same time.

Mirroring-behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings. Such sympathetic action may afford access to sympathetic feelings and, perhaps, trigger emotions of kindness and forgiveness.

== Impairment ==
A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. Psychopathy and narcissism are associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas bipolar disorder is associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy. People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may suffer from impairments in cognitive empathy as well as fluctuating affective empathy, although this topic is controversial. Schizophrenia, too, is associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.

Atypical empathic responses are associated with some personality disorders such as psychopathy, borderline, narcissistic, and schizoid personality disorders; conduct disorder; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; and depersonalization. Sex offenders who had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured abuse of the sort they later committed, felt less affective empathy for their victims.

=== Autism and controversy ===
The subject of whether autism affects empathy is a controversial and complex area of study. Several different factors are proposed to be at play, such as mirror neurons, alexithymia, and more. The double empathy problem theory proposes that prior studies on autism and empathy may have been misinterpreted and that autistic people show the same levels of empathy towards one another as non-autistic people do.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often correlated to problems with empathy and social communication skills. However, like ASD itself, these issues are often found to be on a spectrum. The suggestion that people with autism are likely to have issues with personal relationships and empathy is a complex issue that has been addressed in many studies. Various research has been exploring these concepts for more than twenty years.

Certain studies, like this one from 2004 found connections between ASD and empathy issues. Another study found that empathy problems may be associated to the comorbidity of alexithymia (a struggle to feel emotions) and ASD. However, a more recent study from 2022 found that there were, in fact, no significant differences between the brain sections (medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala) that are associated with empathy.

Another study (2023) focusing on ASD and empathy with regards to mirror neurons also reflected on the theory that mirror neurons “may be dysfunctional in ASD.” However, as the researchers state, this connection is not clear and although mirror neurons are correlated to ASD, there is no proven causational relationship between dysfunctional mirror neurons and ASD. The study from 2023 might be considered contradictory to an earlier (2006) study on mirror neurons that found that high-functioning autistic children showed reduced mirror neuron activity in the brain&#x27;s inferior frontal gyrus while imitating and observing emotional expressions in other children who were considered non-autistic.

The correlation between ASD and empathy is a focus for researchers and many relevant articles can be found in the &quot;Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.&quot;

=== Psychopathy ===
Psychopathy is a personality construct partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of remorse and empathy. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) and &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot; (ICD) list antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder, stating that these have been referred to as or include what is referred to as psychopathy.

Psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. The underlying for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than in those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. Some fMRI studies report that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives).

One study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths&#x27; empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their &quot;empathy switch&quot;. Others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths&#x27; experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy, as these entail suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences. Psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry&#x27;s standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.

Work conducted by Professor Jean Decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain, but more activity in the striatum and the insula when compared to control participants. In a second study, individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self perspective, but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other perspective—in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala—which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern.

Researchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy. People who score highly on psychopathy measures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation, showing that psychopathy and lack of affective empathy correspond strongly. found those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, such individuals do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion .

Neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study&#x27;s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: &quot;Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?&quot;

Despite studies suggesting psychopaths have deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor Simon Baron-Cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues, and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others (emotional contagion), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.

=== Other conditions ===
Atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction. Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior plays a role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react. While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions excessively, their ability to feel empathy is a topic of much dispute with contradictory findings. Some studies assert impairments in cognitive empathy in BPD patients yet no affective empathy impairments, while other studies have found impairments in both affective and cognitive empathy. Fluctuating empathy, fluctuating between normal range of empathy, reduced sense of empathy, and a lack of empathy has been noted to be present in BPD patients in multiple studies, although more research is needed to determine its prevalence, although it is believed to be at least not uncommon and may be a very common phenomenon. BPD is a very heterogenous disorder, with symptoms including empathy ranging wildly between patients.

One diagnostic criterion of narcissistic personality disorder is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.

Characteristics of schizoid personality disorder include emotional coldness, detachment, and impaired affect corresponding with an inability to be empathic and sensitive towards others.

A study conducted by Jean Decety and colleagues at the University of Chicago demonstrated that subjects with aggressive conduct disorder demonstrate atypical empathic responses when viewing others in pain. Subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as controls to the pain of others but, unlike controls, subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the amygdala and ventral striatum (areas that enable a general arousing effect of reward), yet impaired activation of the neural regions involved in self-regulation and metacognition (including moral reasoning), in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.

Schizophrenia is characterized by impaired affective empathy, as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the Empathy Quotient (EQ). These empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks.

Bipolar individuals have impaired cognitive empathy and theory of mind, but increased affective empathy.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1176/jnp.2009.21.1.59&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite cognitive flexibility being impaired, planning behavior is intact. Dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex could result in the impaired cognitive empathy, since impaired cognitive empathy has been related with neurocognitive task performance involving cognitive flexibility.

Dave Grossman, in his book &quot;On Killing&quot;, reports on how military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers, suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other people.

A deadening of empathic response to workmates, customers and the like is one of the three key components of occupational burnout, according to the conceptualization behind its primary diagnostic instrument, the Maslach Burnout Inventory.

The term Empathy Deficit Disorder (EDD) has gained popularity online, but it is not a diagnosis under the DSM-5. The term was coined in an article by Douglas LaBier. In the article, he acknowledges that he &quot;made it up, so you won&#x27;t find it listed in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; and that his conclusions are derived from personal experience alone. His conclusions have not been validated through clinical studies, nor have studies identified EDD as a separate disorder rather than a symptom associated with previously established diagnoses that do appear in the DSM-5.

== Effects ==
The capacity to empathize is a revered trait in society. Empathy is considered a motivating factor for unselfish, prosocial behavior, whereas a lack of empathy is related to antisocial behavior.

Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Such empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Two general methods have been identified: An individual may mentally simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits, and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings this provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then analyze the environment to discover a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.

An empathizer&#x27;s emotional background may affect or distort how they perceive the emotions in others. Societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy. The judgments that empathy provides about the emotional states of others are not certain ones. Empathy is a skill that gradually develops throughout life, and which improves the more contact we have with .

Empathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person in a situation when they have experienced a similar situation, and that they experience greater empathic understanding. Research regarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed.

The extent to which a person&#x27;s emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case when we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.

=== Benefits of empathizing ===
People who score more highly on empathy questionnaires also report having more positive relationships with other people. Supporting this, a 2017 study measuring dispositional empathy with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) found that individuals with higher empathic concern report having a greater number of close relationships. They report &quot;greater life satisfaction, more positive affect, less negative affect, and less depressive symptoms than people who had lower empathy scores&quot;.

Children who exhibit more empathy also have more resilience. Research by Allemand, Steiger, and Fend (2015) support this by showing many benefits that come with the early development of empathy in adolescence. The main findings of the research indicate that early development of empathy in adolescence will help “predict social competencies in adulthood.” In other words, their future ability to work well in groups, build relationships, and communicate effectively. Others include the development of social skills, cooperation, and positive relations in life, which further proves the benefit of Empathy.

Empathy can be an aesthetic pleasure, &quot;by widening the scope of that which we experience... by providing us with more than one perspective of a situation, thereby multiplying our experience... and... by intensifying that experience.&quot; People can use empathy to borrow joy from the joy of children discovering things or playing make-believe, or to satisfy our curiosity about other people&#x27;s lives.

=== Empathic inaccuracy and empathic bias ===
People can severely overestimate how much they understand others. When people empathize with another, they may oversimplify that other person in order to make them more legible. It may improve empathic accuracy for the empathizer to explicitly ask the person empathized with for confirmation of the empathic hypothesis. However, people may be reluctant to abandon their empathic hypotheses even when they are explicitly denied.

Because we oversimplify people in order to make them legible enough to empathize with, we can come to misapprehend how cohesive other people are. We may come to think of ourselves as lacking a strong, integral self in comparison. Fritz Breithaupt calls this the &quot;empathic endowment effect&quot;. Because the empathic person must temporarily dampen their own sense of self in order to empathize with the other, and because the other seems to have a magnified and extra-cohesive sense of self, the empathic person may suffer from this and may &quot;project onto others the self that they are lacking&quot; and envy &quot;that which they must give up in order to be able to feel empathy: a strong self&quot;.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. In one experiment, researchers gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both : with pain, and empathic pain. If they supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy.

=== Disadvantages of empathy ===
Psychologist Paul Bloom, author of &quot;Against Empathy&quot;, points out that empathic bias can result in tribalism and violent responses in the name of helping people of the same &quot;tribe&quot; or social group, for example when empathic bias is exploited by demagogues. He proposes &quot;rational compassion&quot; as an alternative; one example is using effective altruism to decide on charitable donations rationally, rather than by relying on emotional responses to images in the media.

Higher empathy tends to reduce the accuracy of deception detection, and emotion recognition training does not improve deception detection.

Empathy can also be exploited by sympathetic beggars. Bloom points to the example of street children in India, who can get many donations because they are adorable but this results in their enslavement by organized crime. Bloom says that though someone might feel better about themselves and find more meaning in life than they give to the person in front of them, in some cases they would do less harm and in many cases do more good in the world by giving to an effective charity through an impersonal website. Bloom believes improper use of empathy and social intelligence can lead to shortsighted actions and parochialism.

Bloom points out that parents who have too much short-term empathy might create long-term problems for their children, by neglecting discipline, helicopter parenting, or deciding not to get their children vaccinated because of the short-term discomfort. People experiencing too much empathy after a disaster may continue to send donations like canned goods or used clothing even after being asked to stop or to send cash instead, and this can make the situation worse by creating the need to dispose of useless donations and taking resources away from helpful activities. Bloom also finds empathy can encourage unethical behavior when it causes people to care more about attractive people than ugly people, or people of one&#x27;s own race vs. people of a different race. The attractiveness bias can also affect wildlife conservation efforts, increasing the amount of money devoted and laws passed to protect cute and photogenic animals, while taking attention away from species that are more ecologically important.

=== Empathy and power ===
People tend to empathize less when they have more social or political power. For example, people from lower-class backgrounds exhibit better empathic accuracy than those from upper-class backgrounds. In a variety of &quot;priming&quot; experiments, people who were asked to recall a situation in which they had power over someone else then demonstrated reduced ability to mirror others, to comprehend their viewpoints, or to learn from their perspectives.

===Empathy and violence===
Bloom says that although psychopaths have low empathy, the correlation between low empathy and violent behavior as documented in scientific studies is &quot;zero&quot;. Other measures are much more predictive of violent behavior, such as lack of self-control.

=== Compassion fatigue ===

Excessive empathy can lead to &quot;empathic distress fatigue&quot;, especially if it is associated with pathological altruism. The risks are fatigue, occupational burnout, guilt, shame, anxiety, and depression. Tania Singer says that health care workers and caregivers must be objective regarding the emotions of others. They should not over-invest their own emotions in the other, at the risk of draining away their own resourcefulness. Paul Bloom points out that high-empathy nurses tend to spend less time with their patients, to avoid feeling negative emotions associated with witnessing suffering.

=== Empathy backfire ===
Despite empathy being often portrayed as a positive attribute, whether or not the people who express empathy are viewed favorably depends on who they show empathy for. Such is the case in which a third party observes a subject showing empathy for someone of questionable character or generally viewed as unethical; that third party might not like or respect the subject for it. This is called &quot;empathy backfire&quot;.

=== Influence on helping behavior ===
Investigators into the social response to natural disasters researched the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims. Taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) may allow these helpers to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, and victim-blaming, and may lead to avoidance rather than helping.

Individuals who expressed concern for the vulnerable (i.e. affective empathy) were more willing to accept the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures that create distress.

People who understand how empathic feelings evoke altruistic motivation may adopt strategies for suppressing or avoiding such feelings. Such numbing, or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients, is a possible factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions. People can better cognitively control their actions the more they understand how altruistic behavior emerges, whether it is from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons.

Empathy-induced altruism may not always produce pro-social effects. For example, it could lead one to exert oneself on behalf of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.

Empathy-based socialization differs from inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling, and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs to foster altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective-taking and empathic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. Empathy-induced altruism can improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, racial attitudes, and actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless, and convicts. Such resulting altruism also increases cooperation in competitive situations.

Empathy is good at prompting prosocial behaviors that are informal, unplanned, and directed at someone who is immediately present, but is not as good at prompting more abstractly-considered, long-term prosocial behavior.

Empathy can not only be a precursor to one&#x27;s own helpful acts, but can also be a way of inviting help from others. If you mimic the posture, facial expressions, and vocal style of someone you are with, you can thereby encourage them to help you and to form a favorable opinion of you.

=== Conflict Resolution ===
Empathy plays a crucial role in resolving conflicts by shifting the focus to understanding the other person’s viewpoint, preventing miscommunication, and taking away biases. Being able to understand the other party’s side of the argument gives them a different idea of what is creating the conflict. This helps in communicating the problem in a way that will take away any biases and allow for collaboration that will help resolve the conflict. While empathy can play an effective role in conflict resolution, there are situations where it may not have a significant impact.

== Empathic anger and distress ==
=== Anger ===
Empathic anger is an emotion, a form of empathic distress. Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing.

Empathic anger affects desires to help and to punish. Two sub-categories of empathic anger are state empathic anger (current empathic anger) and trait empathic anger (tendency or predisposition to experience empathic anger).

The higher a person&#x27;s perspective-taking ability, the less angry they are in response to a provocation. Empathic concern does not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress is associated with increased anger.

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or guilt. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social; however, views differ as to whether they serve as motives for moral behavior.

Stoic philosophers believed that to condition your emotional disposition on the emotions or fortunes of someone else is foolish. Cicero said that someone who feels distress at another&#x27;s misfortune is committing as much of an error as an envious person who feels distress at another&#x27;s good fortune.

== Disciplinary approaches ==
=== Philosophy ===
==== Ethics ====

In the 2007 book &quot;The Ethics of Care and Empathy&quot;, philosopher Michael Slote introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. He claims that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response, and that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy, and in turn morality, are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic and moral obligation to family and friends and to those close to us in time and space. Our moral obligation to such people seems naturally stronger to us than that to strangers at a distance. Slote explains that this is due to the natural process of empathy. He asserts that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent. In a 2011 article, philosopher Michael Slote delves deeply into how empathy plays a role in moral judgment, suggesting that our ability to understand and determine right from wrong is influenced by empathy. He further stated that being able to empathize with others helps us stay away from behaviors that some deem to be unreasonable or heartless, which can happen because of a lack of empathy.

==== Phenomenology ====
In phenomenology, empathy describes the experience of something from the other&#x27;s viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This is based on the concept of agency. In the most basic sense, phenomenology is the experience of the other&#x27;s body as &quot;my body over there.&quot; In most other respects, however, it is an experience viewed through the person&#x27;s own eyes; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not &quot;my&quot; experience, even though &quot;I&quot; experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.

=== History ===
Some postmodernist historians such as Keith Jenkins have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant liberal discourse of modern society and can be connected to John Stuart Mill&#x27;s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the epistemological conditions of bygone ages we are unable to empathize with those who lived then.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Heinz Kohut introduced the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of unconscious material.

=== Business and management ===
Because empathy seems to have potential to improve customer relations, employee morale, and personnel management capability, it has been studied in a business context.

In the 2009 book &quot;Wired to Care&quot;, strategy consultant Dev Patnaik argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that without empathy people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions, and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. He says that companies can create a sense of empathy for customers, pointing to Nike, Harley-Davidson, and IBM as examples of &quot;Open Empathy Organizations&quot;. Such companies, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.

In the 2011 book &quot;The Empathy Factor&quot;, organizational consultant Marie Miyashiro similarly argues for bringing empathy to the workplace, and suggests Nonviolent Communication as an effective mechanism for achieving this.

In studies by the Management Research Group, empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model, and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness. The leadership consulting firm Development Dimensions International found in 2016 that 20% of U.S. employers offered empathy training to managers. A study by the Center for Creative Leadership found empathy to be positively correlated to job performance among employees as well.

Patricia Moore pioneered using empathic techniques to better understand customers. For example, she used makeup and prosthetics to simulate the experience of elderly people, and used the insights from this to inspire friendlier products for that customer segment. Design engineers at Ford Motor Company wore prosthetics to simulate pregnancy and old age, to help them design cars that would work better for such customers. Fidelity Investments trains its telephone customer service employees in a virtual reality app that puts them in a (dramatized) customer&#x27;s home so they can experience what it is like to be on the other side of their conversations.

=== Evolution of cooperation ===
Empathic perspective-taking plays important roles in sustaining cooperation in human societies, as studied by evolutionary game theory. In game theoretical models, indirect reciprocity refers to the mechanism of cooperation based on moral reputations that are assigned to individuals based on their perceived adherence a set of moral rules called social norms. It has been shown that if reputations and individuals disagree on the moral standing of others (for example, because they use different moral evaluation rules or make errors of judgement), then cooperation will not be sustained. However, when individuals have the capacity for empathic perspective-taking, altruistic behavior can once again evolve. Moreover, evolutionary models also revealed that empathic perspective-taking itself can evolve, promoting prosocial behavior in human populations.

== In educational contexts ==
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners. Research shows that empathy is important in developing classroom dynamics, fostering student engagement, and enhancing academic outcomes. In 2022, a systematic review of empathy’s effectiveness in teaching shows that empathetic teacher-student relationships can result in a positive learning environment. Also, a study at Stanford University found that when a teacher applies active listening and emotional awareness approaches, it can lead to a significant (50%) decrease in suspension rates. It also shows empathy’s ability to lessen discipline issues and create desirable academic outcomes.

Despite the positive outcomes, The Philosophy of Empathy emphasizes that empathy is deeply connected to morality, which helps us understand that developing empathy in teachers is challenging. Learning by teaching is one method used to teach empathy. Research also found that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers. Learning by teaching is one method used to teach empathy. Students transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on those classmates&#x27; mental processes. This develops the students&#x27; feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and meta-analyses corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.

Within medical education, a hidden curriculum appears to dampen or even reduce medical student empathy.

== In intercultural contexts ==
According to one theory, empathy is one of seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural communication. This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that people experience more difficulty empathizing with others who are different from them in characteristics such as status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, and age.

To build intercultural empathy in others, psychologists employ empathy training. Researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &quot;et al.&quot; state that people who develop intercultural empathy can interpret experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview. Intercultural empathy can also improve self-awareness and critical awareness of one&#x27;s own interaction style as conditioned by one&#x27;s cultural views and promote a view of self-as-process.

==In fiction==
Lynn Hunt argued in &quot;Inventing Human Rights: A History&quot; that the concept of human rights developed how it did and when it did in part as a result of the influence of mid-eighteenth-century European novelists, particularly those whose use of the epistolatory novel form gave readers a more vivid sense that they were gaining access to the candid details of a real life. &quot;The epistolatory novel did not just reflect important cultural and social changes of the time. Novel reading actually helped create new kinds of feelings including a recognition of shared psychological experiences, and these feelings then translated into new cultural and social movements including human rights.&quot;

The power of empathy has become a frequent ability in fiction, specifically in that of superhero media. &quot;Empaths&quot; have the ability to sense/feel the emotions and bodily sensations of others and, in some cases, influence or control them. Although sometimes a specific power held by specific characters such as the Marvel Comics character Empath, the power has also been frequently linked to that of telepathy such as in the case of Jean Grey.

The rebooted television series &quot;Charmed&quot; portrays the character Maggie Vera as a witch with the power of empathy. Her powers later expand to allow her to control the emotions of others as well as occasionally concentrate emotion into pure energy. In season four she learns to replicate people&#x27;s powers by empathically understanding them.

In the 2013 NBC television show reinterpretation of &quot;Hannibal&quot; we are introduced in the first episode to Will Graham. Graham is unique in that he seems to have exceptionally high levels of both cognitive and emotional empathy, combined with an eidetic memory and imagination. These abilities help him understand the motives of some of the most depraved killers. Hannibal Lecter calls his ability &quot;pure empathy&quot;. Graham can assume the viewpoint of virtually anyone he meets, even viewpoints that sicken him. When evaluating a crime scene, he uses his imagination and empathy to almost become the killer, feeling what they were feeling during a murder.

<doc id="302320" wikidata="Q728314" url="?curid=302320" title="Citroën C2">
<text>The Citroën C2 is a supermini that was produced by the French manufacturer Citroën, with production starting August 2003. It replaced the Citroën Saxo and was built at the Aulnay plant, on the outskirts of Paris. The Citroën C2 was discontinued in October 2009, and replaced by the Citroën DS3 in January 2010.

Along with the Citroën C3, the C2 successfully replaced the popular, but ageing Citroën Saxo. The two cars have relatively different designs however retain the same dashboard, allowing Citroën to grab different submarkets of the supermini class. The C2 was designed by Donato Coco. The C3 was originally designed as a larger &quot;family-friendly vehicle&quot;, with its five doors, whereas the C2 was to project a &quot;young driver&quot; image with two doors and flatter styling. 

Unlike the Saxo, with 2 of 5 stars from Euro NCAP, the C2 achieved 4 out of 5 stars.

==Marketing and advertising issues==
Unlike its sister models, the Citroën C1 and C3, the C2 was seen as a victim of poor advertising. According to many in the motoring press, it was the most neglected model in the Citroën lineup in terms of promotion. In comparison, the C1 and the C3, on which the C2 is based, were both well presented in the media. Despite that, the Citroën C2 was awarded the &quot;Best European Hatchback of 2003&quot; in September 2003.

==Versions==

The LX model was the &quot;no-frills&quot; version of the C2 and came with basic equipment, including black plastic bumpers and no fog lamps. 

The L model, produced from 2003 to 2005, came with black lower bumper and door handles, CD player, rear-seat modulation, and no fog lamps. The Design included body coloured bumpers and electric windows. 

The SX was the luxury spec. It featured &#x27;bumper colour coded paint&#x27; and air conditioning, the latter of which increases the 1.1 SX&#x27;s 0–100 km/h time by 4.5 seconds to 17.2 seconds.

The Furio, VTR and VTS are continuations of the sports models which made the C2&#x27;s predecessor, the Saxo, famous as an affordable &quot;pocket rocket&quot;. The Furio has the same sports body kit as the more expensive VTR and VTS models but lacks their alloy wheels. Earlier models of the Furio had 15&quot; Coyote alloys, but these were later replaced with wheel trims from the end of 2003 onwards.

The VTR also has a engine, whereas the VTS, the premium sports model, has a engine capable of accelerating from 0 to in 8.0 seconds. This was somewhat sluggish by contemporary hot hatch standards but was designed to be more insurance friendly. 

Other additions that helped the VTS model achieve a low insurance rating (in the United Kingdom) were security-based including deadlocks and a Thatcham Category 1 alarm system which includes perimeter and volumetric detection as well as an engine immobiliser.

The limited-edition model &quot;GT&quot;, introduced in September 2004, offered a sporty body kit, with bright red, blue, silver and black paintwork and unique white alloy wheels. All GTs have a numbered certificate to show their authenticity. Only 2,500 were made, exclusive to the United Kingdom.

In 2006, there were a number of small revisions to the C2. Externally the car looks identical save minor changes to alloy wheels (on the VTR), half colour coded door mirrors, clear side indicator lenses, and white indicator rear lenses. Internal changes saw a new stereo with vehicle computer integration and some cosmetic changes to the driver displays and centre console. 

The previous models ran two integrated electrical systems. The popular CAN BUS (Controller Area Network, by Bosch) and PSA&#x27;s proprietary VAN BUS (Vehicle Area Network). 

In 2006, PSA dumped the VAN BUS system for an all CAN-BUS system, giving it better functionality and compatibility with more component manufacturers. This required some of the electrical components to be replaced, explaining why the displays, radio/CD and some other electronic equipment were changed.

The VTR Sensodrive and VTS manual were the two petrol options available for the Australian C2.

===Safety===

===Facelift===
April 2007 saw Citroën Europe announcing a facelift for its C2 model, which had received a minor update in November 2006. The 2009 C2 featured a larger front bumper and restyled grille with a chrome surround. The trim specifications remain in line with the range of 2008. Levels remained unchanged.

==Technology==
The Citroën C2 brings with it two key new technologies, the Stop &amp; Start environmental system, and the SensoDrive five-speed automated manual.

*The Stop &amp; Start is a hybrid system, with the internal combustion engine being supplemented by a small electric motor. The &quot;Stop &amp; Start&quot; system automatically disengages the engine when you bring the vehicle to a complete stop, with pressure being applied to the brake pedal.

The engine quickly restarts when pressure on the brake pedal is relieved. The technology has been developed by Valeo and results in lower urban fuel consumption. The system, however, requires pressure on the brake pedal when stationary for the system to work, holding the vehicle on the handbrake (parking brake) alone will not be sufficient for the system to operate. The Stop &amp; Start system is mounted to the &quot;SensoDrive&quot; gearbox.

A Stop &amp; Start system was previously seen in the 1980s, with the Volkswagen Polo &quot;Formel E&quot; and the Volkswagen Golf MKIII &quot;Ecomatic&quot;, although this was different in operation; in the Volkswagen system the engine stopped automatically when placed in neutral. Selecting a gear by moving the stick to the left (for first or reverse) activated the starter motor.

* The SensoDrive five-speed automated manual transmission is an electronically-controlled manual gearbox, with the clutch and gear change functions electronically managed. As a result, the vehicle has no clutch pedal and the gear lever, which remains present, has no mechanical link with the gearbox. The &quot;SensoDrive&quot; gearbox is managed by a control unit, which controls two actuators.

One actuator changes gears while the other, which is equipped with a facing wear compensation system, opens and closes the clutch. The gearbox control unit also dialogues with the engine control unit. The &quot;SensoDrive&quot; gearbox has two shifting options of either the fully-automated mode or the paddle-shifted &quot;manual&quot; mode.

==Engines available==
*1.1 L TU1 (1124 cc) I4, 
*1.4 L TU3 (1360 cc) I4, 
*1.4 L ET3 SensoDrive Stop &amp; Start (1360 cc) I4,

==Chinese version (T21)==
From October 2006 to 2013, the Peugeot 206 was sold by PSA, for the Chinese market only as the Citroën C2. With a modified front and rear body, this is similar to the way the Citroën LN was derived from the Peugeot 104. 

The car has no common features with the C2 on other markets, due to the positioning of the model in the line up of Citroën China.

It has a length of , width of , height of , with a wheelbase of , and is powered by one of the two engine options: a 1.4 L () and a 1.6 L (). Weight ranges from to .

Late 2012, Citroën released a crossover-styled variant, called C2 Cross.

It was produced in China at the Wuhan Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile site until 2013. 

==Sales and production==
These figures are including the Chinese C2, which is not a proper C2 but rather a slightly redesigned Peugeot 206. Almost 80,000 of these Chinese Citroën C2 were produced.

== Classification in the French tax and insurance system ==
The petrol engine with 60 HP was classified as 3 CV. The engine with 73 HP as 4 CV and the one with 88 HP as 5 CV. The two most powerful petrol engines were then 6 CV. When it came to diesels, the smaller one was rated at 4 CV and the more powerful one was rated at 6 CV.

<text>Danny Thomas (born Amos Muzyad Yaqoob Kairouz; January 6, 1912 – February 6, 1991) was an American actor, singer, nightclub comedian, producer, and philanthropist. He created and starred in &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. In addition to guest roles on many of the comedy, talk, and musical variety programs of his time, his legacy includes a lifelong dedication to fundraising for charity. Thomas founded the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, a leading center in pediatrics with a focus on pediatric cancer. St. Jude has affiliate hospitals in eight other American cities as of early 2020.

Already a successful entertainer, Thomas began his film career in 1947, playing opposite child actress Margaret O&#x27;Brien in &quot;The Unfinished Dance&quot; (1947) and &quot;Big City&quot; (1948). He then starred in the long-running television sitcom &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; (later, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; from the fourth season onwards) from 1953 to 1964, in which he played the lead role of Danny Williams. He was the father of Marlo Thomas, Terre Thomas, and Tony Thomas.

== Early life ==

One of 10 children, Danny Thomas was born Amos Muzyad Yaqoob Kairouz () on January 6, 1912, in Deerfield, Michigan, to Charles Yaqoob Kairouz and his wife Margaret Taouk. His parents were Maronite Catholic immigrants from what is now Bsharri, Lebanon.

Thomas was raised in Toledo, Ohio, attending St. Francis de Sales Church, Woodward High School.

Bishop Samuel Stritch of Toledo confirmed Thomas in the Catholic Church in 1921. Stritch, a native of Tennessee, was a lifelong spiritual advisor for Thomas, and would later advise him to locate the St. Jude Hospital in Memphis.

In 1932, Thomas began performing on radio in Detroit at WMBC on &quot;The Happy Hour Club&quot;. Thomas first performed under his anglicized birth name, &quot;Amos Jacobs Kairouz&quot;.

In 1936, a week after his 24th birthday, Thomas married Rose Marie Cassaniti.

In 1940, after he moved to Chicago, Thomas did not want his friends and family to know he had gone back into working clubs where the salary was better, so he came up with the pseudonym &quot;Danny Thomas&quot; (after two of his brothers).

== Careers other than television ==
=== Radio ===
Thomas first reached mass audiences on network radio in the 1940s playing shifty brother-in-law Amos in &quot;The Bickersons&quot;, which began as sketches on the music-comedy show &quot;Drene Time&quot;, starring Don Ameche and Frances Langford. Thomas also portrayed himself as a scatterbrained Lothario on this show. His other network radio work included a stint as Jerry Dingle the postman on Fanny Brice&#x27;s &quot;The Baby Snooks Show&quot;. In the early 1950s he made several appearances on the popular NBC variety program &quot;The Big Show&quot; hosted by stage legend Tallulah Bankhead.

Thomas also had his own radio program, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. The 30-minute weekly variety show was on ABC from 1942 to 1943 and on CBS from 1947 to 1948.

=== Films ===
After his two late 1940s films with Margaret O&#x27;Brien, Thomas appeared with Betty Grable in the musical &quot;Call Me Mister&quot; (1951). He portrayed songwriter Gus Kahn opposite Doris Day in the 1951 film biography &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams.&quot; He then starred in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; opposite the popular contemporary vocalist Peggy Lee, a 1952 remake of the 1927 original.

=== Music ===
In 1952, Thomas recorded several Arabic folk songs with Toufic Barham for a Saint Jude Hospital Foundation fundraiser record. The songs later appeared on the re-issue album&quot; The Music of Arab-Americans: A Retrospective Collection&quot;.

== Television career ==
=== &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; (&quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;) ===
Thomas enjoyed a successful 11-year run (1953–1964) on &quot;Make Room for Daddy,&quot; later known as &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. Jean Hagen, Sherry Jackson, and Rusty Hamer were his first family. The Hagen character died offscreen in 1956 and was replaced by Marjorie Lord; Angela Cartwright also joined the cast at this time playing Danny&#x27;s stepdaughter. Sherry Jackson left the series in 1958, and Penney Parker replaced her in the 1959–1960 season. Parker was written out of the series with her marriage to the character Patrick Hannigan, played by comedian Pat Harrington, Jr.

On January 1, 1959, Thomas appeared with his other &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; child stars, Angela Cartwright and Rusty Hamer, in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.&quot;
The show was produced at Desilu Studios, where Lucille Ball was appearing alongside Desi Arnaz in &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; and it featured several guest stars who went on to star in their own shows, including Andy Griffith (&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot;), Joey Bishop, and Bill Bixby (&quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; and others). He also scored a major success at the London Palladium, in the years when many big American stars appeared there. In 1963, in an episode called &quot;Oh, the Clancys,&quot; the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem appeared as Marjorie Lord&#x27;s Irish cousins and sang &quot;Brennan on the Moor.&quot;
In 1970, the program was revived for a season under the title &quot;Make Room for Granddaddy&quot;.

Angela Cartwright (who spoke about her on- and off-camera relationship with her television stepfather, Danny Thomas, on a groundbreaking ABC TV show, &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;) had said: &quot;I thought Danny was hilarious and he was always cracking me up. He was loud and gregarious, nothing like my real dad who is far more reserved than that. So, it was fun to be able to make smart remarks and get away with it. I would never have talked to my real parents that way, but in the make-believe world of the Williams family I got away with that.&quot; Cartwright also added that by the time Thomas&#x27; show had ended, she wanted to join the cast of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;: &quot;I went on an interview for the part of Brigitta. I was still filming &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, but I knew the series was coming to an end. After several auditions, I was the first von Trapp cast. I asked Danny Thomas if he would let me out of my contract so I could be in the movie and he was very gracious to let me out of the last show of the season. He didn&#x27;t have to do that and I am very grateful he did.&quot;

=== The Wonderful World of Burlesque ===
In 1965 and 1966, Thomas presented &quot;The Wonderful World of Burlesque&quot;, featuring Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis, Don Adams, Carol Channing, Andy Griffith, Sheldon Leonard, and Shirley Jones.

=== The Danny Thomas Hour ===
&quot;The Danny Thomas Hour&quot; is an American anthology television series that was broadcast on NBC during the 1967–1968 television season.

=== Producer ===
Thomas became a successful television producer (with Sheldon Leonard and Aaron Spelling among his partners) of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot; and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;. Thomas also produced three series for Walter Brennan: &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;The Tycoon&quot;, and &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot; on ABC during the late 1950s and 1960s. Thomas often appeared in cameos on shows he produced, including his portrayal of the tuxedoed, droll alien Kolak, from the planet Twilo, in the &quot;Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; science-fiction spoof, &quot;It May Look Like a Walnut&quot;.
Thomas was responsible for Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s first &quot;big break&quot; in acting. In 1961, Carl Reiner cast her in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; after Thomas personally recommended Moore. Reiner had remembered her as &quot;the girl with three names&quot; whom he had turned down earlier, but rediscovered her after a lengthy search through photos and records.

=== Return to television ===
In the early 1970s, Thomas reunited most of his second &quot;Daddy&quot; cast (Marjorie Lord, Rusty Hamer, and Angela Cartwright) for a short-lived update of the show &quot;Make Room for Granddaddy&quot;. Premised around Danny and Kathy Williams caring for their grandson by daughter Terry, who was away with her husband who was serving in the Military, and stationed in Japan, the show lasted one season.

By the mid-1970s, Thomas&#x27; son Tony had become an accomplished television producer. Tony, along with Paul Junger Witt, formed Witt/Thomas Productions in 1975, and was responsible for his father&#x27;s next three (and ultimately final) starring vehicles. Thomas returned to series TV in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Practice&quot;, airing from January 1976 to January 1977. Subsequently, he co-starred in &quot;I&#x27;m a Big Girl Now&quot;, which aired on ABC from 1980 to 1981.

Thomas was guest of honor in &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; that aired on December 15, 1976, on NBC. He guest-starred in &quot;In Full Command&quot; (S05 E22), the March 18, 1978, series finale of the long-running detective drama &quot;Kojak&quot;, as a corrupt superior officer in the police department, in an episode directed by series star Telly Savalas. He also appeared in the TV movie &quot;Side by Side&quot; (1988), opposite Milton Berle and Sid Caesar.

The last series in which Thomas was a headlining star was &quot;One Big Family&quot;, which aired in syndication during the 1986–1987 season. The situation comedy&#x27;s premise was set around a semi-retired comedian whose grandchildren were orphaned after their parents were killed in a car accident.

=== Commercials ===
Thomas, like many actors prominent in television, endorsed commercial products, including Maxwell House coffee. According to Thomas, the money he earned from those commercials was used to establish St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital.

== Philanthropy ==
As a &quot;starving actor&quot;, Thomas had made a vow: If he found success, he would open a shrine dedicated to St. Jude Thaddeus, one of the patron saints of hopeless causes.

In the early 1950s, after he became a successful actor, his wife joined him, and they began traveling the United States to help raise funds to build St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. He fervently believed: &quot;No child should die in the dawn of life.&quot;

In 1962, with help from Dr. Lemuel Diggs and close friend Anthony Abraham, an auto magnate in Miami, Florida, Thomas founded the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Since its inception, St. Jude has treated children from all 50 states and around the world, continuing the mission of finding cures and saving children.

In 1996, Dr. Peter C. Doherty of St. Jude&#x27;s Immunology Department, was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for key discoveries on how the immune system works to kill virus-infected cells.

St. Jude&#x27;s has grown to include eight affiliate hospitals across the United States. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with annual expenses, as of 2018, of over US$1.4 billion funded by nearly US$1.5 billion in donations. Further, the World Health Organization has named St. Jude&#x27;s as its first &quot;Collaborating Center for Childhood Cancer&quot; to help increase survival rates on rare pediatric cancer from 20% to as much as 60% by 2030.

== Personal life ==

Danny Thomas was a struggling young comic when he met Rose Marie Mantell (born Rose Marie Cassaniti), who had a singing career with her own radio show in Detroit, Michigan, and was the daughter of Marie &quot;Mary&quot; Cassaniti, a drummer and percussionist for &quot;Marie&#x27;s Merry Music Makers&quot;. They were married on January 15, 1936, and had three children, Margaret Julia (&quot;Marlo&quot;), Theresa (&quot;Terre&quot;), and Charles Anthony (&quot;Tony&quot;) Thomas. The Thomas children followed their parents into entertainment in various capacities—Marlo as an actress and producer, Tony as a television producer, and Terre as an accomplished singer-songwriter.

Thomas was initiated to Freemasonry in Prudence Lodge No. 958, Chicago, passed, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason at Gothic Lodge No. 270 F&amp;AM.

A devout Catholic, Thomas was named a Knight Commander of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre by Pope Paul VI in recognition of his services to the church and the community. He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan presented Thomas with a Congressional Gold Medal honoring him for his work with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

Thomas was one of the original owners of the Miami Dolphins, along with Joe Robbie, but he sold his share soon after the purchase. In addition, he also played golf regularly since his youth.

Two PGA Tour tournaments bore his name: the Danny Thomas-Diplomat Classic in south Florida in 1969 and, along with co-founder Vernon Bell, the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic from 1970 to 1984. He was also the first non-Jewish member of the Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles.

In 1990, Danny Thomas was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

== Death ==

In 1991, Thomas died after a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, a hospital spokesman said. Two days previously he had celebrated St. Jude Hospital&#x27;s 29th anniversary and filmed a commercial, which aired posthumously. He is interred in a mausoleum on the grounds of the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, alongside his wife.

== Awards and honors ==
A park in Toledo, Ohio, bears Thomas&#x27; name and a monument.

A stretch of roadway in Memphis is locally known as Danny Thomas Boulevard. The road, built in the 1960s to partially reroute U.S. Highway 51 around downtown, runs from E.H. Crump Boulevard (U.S. 70/79/64) to North Parkway/A.W. Willis Avenue (Tennessee State Route 1), passing through St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital&#x27;s campus on a viaduct.

For Thomas&#x27; contribution to the television industry, in February 1960 he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard.

Thomas was a posthumous recipient of the 2004 Bob Hope Humanitarian Award.

In 1965, Danny Thomas was appointed as a Special Deputy Sheriff by Ben Clark, who was a long-standing Riverside County Sheriff and a recognized &quot;trail blazer&quot; in terms of professionalizing the law enforcement profession in California and the United States.

On February 16, 2012, the United States Postal Service issued a first-class forever stamp honoring Thomas as an entertainer and humanitarian. The Danny Thomas Forever Stamp shows an oil-on-panel painting depicting a smiling, tuxedo-clad Thomas in the foreground and St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in the background.

<doc id="302327" wikidata="Q1049570" url="?curid=302327" title="Castle Wolfenstein">
<text>Castle Wolfenstein is a 1981 action-adventure game developed by Silas Warner for the Apple II and published by Muse Software in 1981. It is one of the earliest games based on stealth mechanics. A port to Atari 8-bit computers was released in 1982, followed by Commodore 64 (1983) and MS-DOS (1984). The player takes the role of an Allied prisoner of war during World War II who is held captive in the fictional Castle Wolfenstein. After escaping from a cell, the player&#x27;s objective is to find the Nazis&#x27; secret war plans and escape from the castle. Nazi soldiers can be dealt with via impersonation, sneaking, or killing.

Warner was inspired by the 1961 film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; and the 1980 arcade video game &quot;Berzerk&quot;. The 60 room castle is procedurally generated.

&quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; was positively received by critics and became one of the best-selling games of the early 1980s. The game was praised for its graphics, and gameplay, but criticized for long waiting times when opening chests. It had a direct influence on modern stealth games. A sequel was released in 1984: &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. The rights to the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; name were purchased for the 1992 first person shooter &quot;Wolfenstein 3D.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; is a two-dimensional action-adventure game played from a top-down perspective using a keyboard, joystick, or paddles. It has also been described as a maze game. There are eight difficulty levels in the game that are determined by the player&#x27;s rank. The player takes the role of an Allied spy that has been captured by Nazis and imprisoned in a dungeon within &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; for interrogation by the SS Stormtroopers. While the spy is waiting for interrogation, a dying prisoner emerges from a hiding place and hands the player a fully loaded pistol with 10 rounds, and three grenades before passing away. The objective is to escape from the castle and if the player finds the battle plans before escaping, they will be promoted and the complexity of the subsequent run will be increased, while the castle&#x27;s layout changes and the game starts again.

The game takes place in a procedurally-generated castle of approximately 60 rooms that house standard Nazi guards and SS Stormtroopers identified by their bulletproof vests marked with the SS insignia. Standard guards can be eliminated with a pistol and have a chance to surrender if the player points a pistol at them even if they have no ammunition, and SS Stormtroopers with grenades because they usually wear body armor. Enemies can be looted once surrendered or after they&#x27;ve been eliminated and can possess ammunition, grenades, and keys which can be used on doors and chests. Doors and chests can be opened more quickly by shooting at them but will attract the guards in the room, and if the chest contains ammunition and grenades, they will explode resulting in immediate death. Chests may contain bulletproof vests, uniforms, and secret documents, or sauerkraut, sausages, and schnapps that do not affect the gameplay. Uniforms allow the player character to pass guards unnoticed, but they are ineffective against SS Stormtroopers. If the player dies from enemy gunfire, the game restarts with the castle&#x27;s layout preserved and the same chests and guards. If they are killed by their own grenade, the game restarts in a newly generated castle.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; was developed by Silas Warner at Muse Software and the game&#x27;s cover art was drawn by John Benson.

The game was initially conceptualized as a game set in the mid-1980s in what Warner describes as &quot;a guy running around rooms&quot; and did not know how to develop the game further. He was uninterested in using space as a setting due to his belief that there were so many of them on the market. The concept changed after Warner watched the 1961 British-American war film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; and was amazed by the Allied commandos who broke into a German fortress to destroy the German artillery battery. Within the same day, he played &quot;Berzerk&quot;, a multidirectional shooter arcade video game in which the player navigates through a maze with laser-shooting robots. He decided to use the same concept but with Nazi soldiers instead of robots. His idea was to take the basic common concept of an arcade shoot &#x27;em up, where players dodge enemies with the intent of killing them, and change the objective to escape the enemy guards and their castle with shooting guards simply a means to an end and not an end in itself.

Warner implemented procedural level generation to the game, which took 35 to 60 seconds to complete before the gameplay of the original Apple version started; as a result, the game produced a new set of 60 rooms, the arrangement of which was nearly always different. He designed the game&#x27;s architecture using three programs, each of which was on separate floppy disks and later integrated into a single floppy disk. The first one initialized the graphics and shuffled 64 interchangeable floor plans. The second disk governed the behavior of the castle&#x27;s guards, while the third disk handled the player character&#x27;s behavior. According to Warner, a lot of work went into synchronizing the programs, and he was satisfied with the result. For the soundtrack, he implemented his own voice for the German guards, using Apple II software called &quot;The Voice&quot; (also published by Muse Software). He used German phrases such as &quot;Achtung&quot;, &quot;Schweinhund&quot;, &quot;Halt&quot;, and five other German phrases.

Muse Software released &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; in September 1981 for the Apple II and the game was made on other platforms. A port to the Atari 8-bit computers was published six months after the Apple release, and a Commodore 64 version in 1983 and to MS-DOS in 1984. Following the game&#x27;s release, a software developed by Moxie, &quot;The Great Escape Utility&quot;, was marketed in 1983, promising bug fixes to speed up the opening of chests and the startup time of the game. It also allowed players to choose their starting location and gain an unlimited amount of items. The software is regarded as the first commercial trainer in video gaming.

== Reception ==

According to Harvey Bernstein of &quot;Antic&quot;, after its release, &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; &quot;quickly shot to the top of the charts&quot; and became &quot;one of the most popular games for any microcomputer&quot;. In the October 1982 issue of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, associate publisher and game merchandiser Dana Lombardy released an incomplete list of top-selling games as of 30 June 1982, where the game landed in 13th place with 20,000 copies sold. The game ultimately sold about 50,000 copies by 1983.

&quot;Creative Computing Video and Arcade Games&quot;″s Andrew Brill complained about the Apple version&#x27;s slow gameplay, which according to Brill is mainly due to the time taken to open chests that contain &quot;completely useless&quot; items, which Brill regarded as the game&#x27;s &quot;most frustrating feature&quot;, but added &quot;thrill of the escape&quot; is &quot;worth the wait&quot;. Richard Herring of &quot;Ahoy!&quot;, reviewing the game&#x27;s Commodore 64 version, also complained about &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;″s slow gameplay, especially the long time it took to open the chests. He also stated that each room must be loaded from the floppy disk, causing a lag when each room is entered. Herring also mentioned a bug, in which if the player character bumps into a wall, the screen &quot;goes into hysterics for a few seconds&quot;. Herring added that playing the game with a keyboard is &quot;inconvenient&quot; as the player does not have time to perform game actions quickly enough but concluded by stating &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; has &quot;simple but effective graphics&quot; and called the game &quot;addicting&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; recommended the game as among the best adventure games for the Atari 8-bit, stating that while entertaining it was &quot;too gory for young kids&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; criticized the Atari 8-bit version&#x27;s use of the Apple II original&#x27;s &quot;lousy sound and black-white-green-purple graphics&quot;. In a 1991 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; survey of strategy and war games, M. Evan Brooks called the game an &quot;arcade classic&quot;, and stated that despite the outdated graphics, it had remained in his &quot;fond memories&quot;. In 1996, the same magazine listed &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; as the 116th best game of all time.

== Legacy ==
In 1984, Muse Software released a sequel, &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, with similar graphics and gameplay. It adds some new features, such as the use of a knife, the ability to bribe guards, and a pass system in which guards periodically summon the player character and ask him or her to show the correct pass.

&quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; directly influenced the 1992 game &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; developed by id Software. John Romero stated the original idea was to create a 3D &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; but did not have the rights to the game during development. Many options for the game&#x27;s title were proposed and rejected and, eventually, id Software bought the rights to use &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; from Silas Warner. The original concept of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; changed significantly because the developers decided the core of the gameplay would be fast and simple so features such as the ability to drag and loot fallen enemy soldiers were withdrawn. Further development by other studios led to the emergence of one of the longest-living video series; as of 2021, there are 13 &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; games, the most recent of which, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, are spin-offs released in 2019.

Multiple media outlets considered &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; to be significant in the shaping of the stealth games genre. Though no more &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; games were released by Muse Entertainment after &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series and several other video games took elements and inspiration from the two original games. Casey Alkaisy, marketing manager at DICE, in his review of stealth games on &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, said the first foundations of the stealth genre were laid down in &quot;Pac-Man&quot; but its game mechanics only took shape with the advent of &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, after which other games using the same ideas began to appear. In its review of the series, &quot;Xbox Wire&quot; called &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; a &quot;proto-stealth game&quot; that contains &quot;innovations that would go on to become standards in the stealth genre&quot;. When speaking with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; co-creator John Romero credited &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; as the &quot;original stealth shooter&quot;. &quot;Castle Smurfenstein&quot;, a modified version of the game replacing assets and text with references to &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, is considered one of the first game mods.

Silas Warner died in 2004 after a long illness.

<text>The secretary of state for defence, also known as the defence secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with responsibility for the Ministry of Defence. As a senior minister, the incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The post of secretary of state for defence was created on 1 April 1964, replacing the positions of minister of defence, first lord of the admiralty, secretary of state for war, and secretary of state for air, while the individual offices of the British Armed Forces were abolished and their functions transferred to the Ministry of Defence. In 2019, Penny Mordaunt became the UK&#x27;s first female defence secretary.

The secretary of state is supported by the other ministers in the Defence Ministerial Team and the MOD permanent secretary. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for defence, and the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Defence Select Committee.

The current secretary of state for defence is John Healey, who was appointed on 5 July 2024 following the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

==Responsibilities==
In contrast to what is generally known as a defence minister in many other countries, the Defence Secretary&#x27;s remit includes:
*Strategic military and defensive operations. The postholder is a member of the National Security Council, and chair of the Defence Council, to which the monarch has given the power to command the Armed Forces.
*Oversight of Defence Intelligence 
*Relations with international partnerships, including NATO
*Defence policy (Trident nuclear weapons programme), resourcing and planning
*Communications on defence

==History==

===Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (1936–1940)===

The position of minister for co-ordination of defence was a British Cabinet-level position established in 1936 to oversee and co-ordinate the rearmament of Britain&#x27;s defences. It was established by the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, in response to criticism that Britain&#x27;s armed forces were understrength compared to those of Nazi Germany. When the Second World War broke out, the new prime minister Neville Chamberlain formed a small War Cabinet and it was expected that the minister would serve as a spokesperson for the three service ministers, the secretary of state for war, the first lord of the admiralty and the secretary of state for air; however, political considerations resulted in all three posts being included in the Cabinet, and this role proved increasingly redundant. In April 1940 the position was formally wound up and the functions transferred to other ministers.
===Minister of Defence (1940–1964)===
The post of minister of defence was responsible for co-ordination of defence and security from its creation in 1940 until its abolition in 1964. The post was a Cabinet level post and generally ranked above the three service ministers, some of whom, however, continued to also serve in Cabinet.

On his appointment as prime minister in May 1940, Winston Churchill created for himself the new post of minister of defence. The post was created in response to previous criticism that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of World War II. In 1946, the post became the only cabinet-level post representing the military, with the three service ministers – the secretary of state for war, the first lord of the admiralty, and the secretary of state for air, now formally subordinated to the minister of defence.
=== Secretary of State for Defence (1964–present) ===
The post was created in 1964 as successor to the posts of minister for coordination of defence and minister of defence. It replaced the positions of first lord of the admiralty, secretary of state for war and secretary of state for air, as the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry were merged into the Ministry of Defence (the secretary of state for war had already ceased to be a cabinet position in 1946, with the creation of the cabinet-level minister of defence).

<doc id="302338" wikidata="Q2659588" url="?curid=302338" title="Devanagari transliteration">
<text>Devanagari is an Indic script used for many Indo-Aryan languages of North India and Nepal, including Hindi, Marathi and Nepali, which was the script used to write Classical Sanskrit. There are several somewhat similar methods of transliteration from Devanagari to the Roman script (a process sometimes called romanisation), including the influential and lossless IAST notation. Romanised Devanagari is also called Romanagari.

==IAST==

The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a subset of the ISO 15919 standard, used for the transliteration of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pāḷi into Roman script with diacritics. IAST is a widely used standard. It uses diacritics to disambiguate phonetically similar but not identical Sanskrit glyphs. For example, dental and retroflex consonants are disambiguated with an underdot: dental द=d and retroflex ड=ḍ. An important feature of IAST is that it is losslessly reversible, i.e., IAST transliteration may be converted back to correct Devanāgarī or to other South Asian scripts without ambiguity. Many Unicode fonts fully support IAST display and printing.

==Hunterian system==

The Hunterian system is the &quot;national system of romanisation in India&quot; and the one officially adopted by the Government of India.

The Hunterian system was developed in the nineteenth century by William Wilson Hunter, then Surveyor General of India. When it was proposed, it immediately met with opposition from supporters of the earlier practiced non-systematic and often distorting &quot;Sir Roger Dowler method&quot; (an early corruption of Siraj ud-Daulah) of phonetic transcription, which climaxed in a dramatic showdown in an India Council meeting on 28 May 1872 where the new Hunterian method carried the day. The Hunterian method was inherently simpler and extensible to several Indic scripts because it systematised grapheme transliteration, and it came to prevail and gain government and academic acceptance. Opponents of the grapheme transliteration model continued to mount unsuccessful attempts at reversing government policy until the turn of the century, with one critic calling appealing to &quot;the Indian Government to give up the whole attempt at scientific (i.e. Hunterian) transliteration, and decide once and for all in favour of a return to the old phonetic spelling.&quot;

Over time, the Hunterian method extended in reach to cover several Indic scripts, including Burmese and Tibetan. Provisions for schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages were also made where applicable, e.g. the Hindi is transliterated as &quot;kānpur&quot; (and not &quot;kānapura&quot;) but the Sanskrit is transliterated as &quot;krama&quot; (and not &quot;kram&quot;). The system has undergone some evolution over time. For instance, long vowels were marked with an accent diacritic in the original version, but this was later replaced in the 1954 Government of India update with a macron. Thus, (&quot;life&quot;) was previously romanised as &quot;ján&quot; but began to be romanised as &quot;jān&quot;. The Hunterian system has faced criticism over the years for not producing phonetically accurate results and being &quot;unashamedly geared towards an English-language receiver audience.&quot; Specifically, the lack of differentiation between retroflex and dental consonants (e.g. and are both represented by &quot;d&quot;) has come in for repeated criticism and inspired several proposed modifications of Hunterian, including using a diacritic below retroflexes (e.g. making =&quot;d&quot; and =&quot;ḍ&quot;, which is more readable but requires diacritic printing) or capitalising them (e.g. making =&quot;d&quot; and =&quot;D&quot;, which requires no diacritic printing but is less readable because it mixes small and capital letters in words).

==Alternative transliteration methods==

===Schemes with diacritics===

====National Library at Kolkata romanisation====

The National Library at Kolkata romanisation, intended for the romanisation of all Indic scripts, is an extension of IAST. It differs from IAST in the use of the symbols ē and ō for and (e and o are used for the short vowels present in many Indian languages), the use of &#x27;ḷ&#x27; for the consonant (in Kannada) , and the absence of symbols for , and .

====ISO 15919====

A standard transliteration convention not just for Devanagari, but for all South-Asian languages was codified in the ISO 15919 standard of 2001, providing the basis for modern digital libraries that conform to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) norms. ISO 15919 defines the common Unicode basis for Roman transliteration of South-Asian texts in a wide variety of languages/scripts.

ISO 15919 transliterations are platform-independent texts so that they can be used identically on all modern operating systems and software packages, as long as they comply with ISO norms. This is a prerequisite for all modern platforms so that ISO 15919 has become the new standard for digital libraries and archives for transliterating all South Asian texts.

ISO 15919 uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic graphemes to the Latin script. The Devanagari-specific portion is nearly identical to the academic standard, IAST: &quot;International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration&quot;, and to ALA-LC, the United States Library of Congress standard.

Another standard, United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names (UNRSGN), was developed by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN) and covers many Brahmic scripts. There are some differences between ISO 15919 and UNRSGN.

===ASCII schemes===

====Harvard-Kyoto====
Compared to IAST, Harvard-Kyoto looks much simpler.
It does not contain any of the diacritic marks that IAST contains.
Instead of diacritics, Harvard-Kyoto uses capital letters.
The use of capital letters makes typing in Harvard-Kyoto much easier than in IAST but produces words with capital letters inside them.

==== ITRANS scheme ====

==== Velthuis ====
The disadvantage of the above ASCII schemes is case-sensitivity, implying that transliterated names may not be capitalised. This difficulty is avoided with the system developed in 1996 by Frans Velthuis for TeX, loosely based on IAST, in which case is irrelevant.

==== WX ====
WX notation is a transliteration scheme for representing Indian languages in ASCII. This scheme originated at IIT Kanpur for computational processing of Indian languages, and is widely used among the natural language processing (NLP) community in India. The notation (though unidentified) is used, for example, in a textbook on NLP from IIT Kanpur.[1] The salient features of this transliteration scheme are: Every consonant and every vowel has a single mapping into Roman. Hence it is a prefix code,[2] advantageous from a computation point of view. Typically the small case letters are used for un-aspirated consonants and short vowels while the capital case letters are used for aspirated consonants and long vowels. While the retroflexed voiceless and voiced consonants are mapped to &#x27;t, T, d and D&#x27;, the dentals are mapped to &#x27;w, W, x and X&#x27;. Hence the name of the scheme &quot;WX&quot;, referring to the idiosyncratic mapping. Ubuntu Linux provides a keyboard support for WX notation.

==== SLP1 ====
SLP1 (Sanskrit Library Phonetic) is a case-sensitive scheme initially used by Sanskrit Library which was developed by Peter Scharf and (the late) Malcolm Hyman, who first described it in appendix B of their book Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit.
The advantage of SLP1 over other encodings is that a single ASCII character is used for each Devanagari letter, a peculiarity that eases reverse transliteration.

==== Hinglish ====
Hinglish refers to the non-standardised Romanised Hindi used online, and especially on social media. In India, Romanised Hindi is the dominant form of expression online. In an analysis of YouTube comments, Palakodety et al., identified that 52% of comments were in Romanised Hindi, 46% in English, and 1% in Devanagari Hindi.

==== Others ====
Other less popular ASCII schemes include WX notation, Vedatype and the 7-bit ISO 15919. WX notation is a transliteration scheme for representing Indian languages in ASCII. It originated at IIT Kanpur for computational processing of Indian languages and is widely used among the natural language processing (NLP) community in India. This scheme is described in NLP Panini (Appendix B). It is similar to, but not as versatile as, SLP1, as far as the coverage of Vedic Sanskrit is concerned. Comparison of WX with other schemes is found in Huet (2009), App A.. Vedatype is another scheme used for encoding Vedic texts at Maharishi University of Management. An online transcoding utility across all these schemes is provided at the Sanskrit Library. ISO 15919 includes a so-called &quot;limited character set&quot; option to replace the diacritics by prefixes, so that it is ASCII-compatible. A pictorial explanation is here from Anthony Stone.

==Transliteration comparison==

The following is a comparison of the major transliteration methods used for Devanāgarī.

===Vowels===

===Consonants===

The Devanāgarī standalone consonant letters are followed by an implicit &quot;shwa&quot; (/Ə/). In all of the transliteration systems, that /Ə/ must be represented explicitly using an &#x27;a&#x27; or any equivalent of &quot;shwa&quot;.

===Irregular consonant clusters===

===Other consonants===

=== Comparison of IAST with ISO 15919===

The table below shows just the differences between ISO 15919 and IAST for Devanagari transliteration.

==Details==

===Treatment of inherent schwa ===
Devanāgarī consonants include an &quot;inherent a&quot; sound, called the schwa, that must be explicitly represented with an &quot;a&quot; character in the transliteration. Many words and names transliterated from Devanāgarī end with &quot;a&quot;, to indicate the pronunciation in the original Sanskrit. This schwa is obligatorily deleted in several modern Indo-Aryan languages, like Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi and others. This results in differing transliterations for Sanskrit and schwa-deleting languages that retain or eliminate the schwa as appropriate:
*Sanskrit: Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa, Śiva, Sāmaveda
*Hindi: Mahābhārat, Rāmāyaṇ, Śiv, Sāmved

Some words may keep the final a, generally because they would be difficult to say without it:
* Krishna, Vajra, Maurya

Because of this, some words ending in consonant clusters are altered in various modern Indic languages as such:
Mantra=mantar. Shabda=shabad. Sushumna=sushumana.

===Retroflex consonants===
Most Indian languages make a distinction between the retroflex and dental forms of the dental consonants. In formal transliteration schemes, the standard Roman letters are used to indicate the dental form, and the retroflex form is indicated by special marks, or the use of other letters. E.g., in IAST transliteration, the retroflex forms are ṇ, ṭ, ḍ and ṣ.

In most informal transcriptions the distinction between retroflex and dental consonants is not indicated. However, many capitalise retroflex consonants on QWERTY keyboard in informal messaging. That generally obviates the need for transliteration.

===Aspirated consonants===
Where the letter &quot;h&quot; appears after a plosive consonant in Devanāgarī transliteration, it always indicates aspiration. Thus &quot;ph&quot; is pronounced as the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pit&quot; (with a small puff of air released as it is said), never as the &quot;ph&quot; in &quot;photo&quot; (IPA /f/). (On the other hand, &quot;p&quot; is pronounced as the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spit&quot; with no release of air.) Similarly &quot;th&quot; is an aspirated &quot;t&quot;, neither the &quot;th&quot; of &quot;this&quot; (voiced, IPA /ð/) nor the &quot;th&quot; of &quot;thin&quot; (unvoiced, IPA /θ/).

The aspiration is generally indicated in both formal and informal transliteration systems.

==Computer use as a drive for romanisation==
As English is widely used a professional and higher-education language in India, availability of Devanagari keyboards is dwarfed by English keyboards. Similarly, software and user interfaces released and promoted in India are in English, as is much of the computer education available there. Due to low awareness of Devanagari keyboard layouts, many Indian users type Hindi in the Roman script.

Before Devanagari was added to Unicode, many workarounds were used to display Devanagari on the Internet, and many sites and services have continued using them despite widespread availability of Unicode fonts supporting Devanagari. Although there are several transliteration conventions on transliterating Hindi to Roman, most of these are reliant on diacritics. As most Indians are familiar with the Roman script through the English language (which traditionally does not use diacritics), these transliteration systems are much less widely known. Most such &quot;Romanagari&quot; is transliterated arbitrarily to imitate English spelling, and thus results in numerous inconsistencies.

It is also detrimental to search engines, which do not classify Hindi text in the Roman script as Hindi. The same text may also not be classified as English.

Regardless of the physical keyboard&#x27;s layout, it is possible to on most modern operating systems. There are many online services available that transliterate text written in Roman to Devanagari accurately, using Hindi dictionaries for reference, such as Google transliteration or Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool. This solution is similar to input method editors, which are traditionally used to input text in languages that use complex characters, most notably those that use logographies.

==History of Sanskrit transliteration==
Early Sanskrit texts were originally transmitted by memorisation and repetition. Post-Harappan India had no system for writing Indic languages until the creation (in the 4th-3rd centuries BCE) of the Kharoshti and Brahmi scripts. These writing systems, though adequate for Middle Indic languages, were not well-adapted to writing Sanskrit. However, later descendants of Brahmi were modified so that they could record Sanskrit in exacting phonetic detail. The earliest physical text in Sanskrit is a rock inscription by the Western Kshatrapa ruler Rudradaman, written c. 150 CE in Junagadh, Gujarat. Due to the remarkable proliferation of different varieties of Brahmi in the Middle Ages, there is today no single script used for writing Sanskrit; rather, Sanskrit scholars can write the language in a form of whatever script is used to write their local language. However, since the late Middle Ages, there has been a tendency to use Devanagari for writing Sanskrit texts for a widespread readership.

Western scholars in the 19th century adopted Devanagari for printed editions of Sanskrit texts. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the Rigveda by Max Müller was in Devanagari. Müller&#x27;s London typesetters competed with their Petersburg peers working on Böhtlingk&#x27;s and Roth&#x27;s dictionary in cutting all the required ligature types.

From its beginnings, Western Sanskrit philology also felt the need for a romanised spelling of the language. Franz Bopp in 1816 used a romanisation scheme, alongside Devanagari, differing from IAST in expressing vowel length by a circumflex (â, î, û), and aspiration by a &quot;spiritus asper&quot; (e.g. bʽ for IAST bh). The sibilants IAST ṣ and ś he expressed with spiritus asper and lenis, respectively (sʽ, sʼ). Monier-Williams in his 1899 dictionary used ć, ṡ and sh for IAST c, ś and ṣ, respectively.

From the late 19th century, Western interest in typesetting Devanagari decreased. Theodor Aufrecht published his 1877 edition of the Rigveda in romanised Sanskrit, and Arthur Macdonell&#x27;s 1910 &quot;Vedic grammar&quot; (and 1916 &quot;Vedic grammar for students&quot;) likewise do without Devanagari (while his introductory &quot;Sanskrit grammar for students&quot; retains Devanagari alongside romanised Sanskrit). Contemporary Western editions of Sanskrit texts appear mostly in IAST.

<text>YMCA Youth and Government (YAG), also known as Youth In Government, or Model Legislature and Court, is a program of the YMCA of the USA that allows middle and high school students to serve in model governments at the local, state, national, and international levels.

The YMCA Youth and Government program currently operates in 49 states and Washington, DC.

Each state may participate in the national programs, which include: the YMCA Youth Conference on National Affairs (CONA), YMCA National Judicial Competition, YMCA Youth Governors Conference (YGC), YMCA Youth Advocate Program, and YMCA Changemakers Summit.

==History==
The YMCA Youth and Government program was established in 1936 in New York by Clement A. Duran, then the Boys Work Secretary for the Albany YMCA. The program motto, “Democracy must be learned by each generation,” was taken from a quote by Earle T. Hawkins, the founder of the Maryland Youth and Government program.

In 2000, the American Bar Association became a supporter of the organization, creating a policy requesting lawyers to become involved in the program by stressing the importance of engaging and educating students about the United States legal process. About this issue, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Roy Romer said in 2006:
Most young people today simply do not have an adequate understanding of how our government and political system work, and they are thus not well prepared to participate as citizens.

As of 2022, the program operates in 49 states and the District of Columbia, serving 47,000 high school students around the country.

==Overview==
The organization&#x27;s mission is to &quot;help create the next generation of thoughtful, committed and active citizens&quot; by teaching them the &quot;principles of a democratic society.&quot; They also intend to create leaders through their roles in the models of local, state and national government. The premise is that &quot;leaders are developed by doing.&quot;

The model government programs include the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government, including press corps in certain states, which are guided by teachers, volunteers or Youth Government staff. Volunteers may include attorneys from the American Bar Association, legislators, business people and other organizations, such as the Alabama Civil Justice Foundation.

The Washington D.C. model follows the order of committee to city council then being signed by the elected Youth Mayor of the regional program to be passed on to the Mayor of D.C.

===Branches of government===

;Legislative 
The participants of the Model Legislative Assemblies are elected into or assume the roles of senators, governors, representatives, lawyers, lobbyists and the press. Bills are drafted, discussed in committee, and debated. Much of this work is conducted locally prior the model legislature, which often occurs at the state capitol in House and Senate chambers. At the state level, bills are brought before the House and Senate floors to be debated. A vote is taken to determine if it passes or not. Bills that pass the legislative process are presented to current governmental officials; In some cases bills that pass the Youth Government legislative process have been enacted into state law.

The programs are generally for high school students, but some states also have collegiate models. Middle school students may be pages. Certain states have a program specifically tailored for middle schoolers who want to learn how the United States government functions, and wish to continue onto the high school program. This section is similar to Youth &amp; Government, but on a smaller scale, and is called Junior Youth &amp; Government.

;Judicial 
Students specific to their role—such as attorney, witness, or judge—and try a case or present a case to an appellate court. Students who are Freshman or Sophomores normally prepare a case for the Court of Appeals. Students who are Juniors and Seniors normally prepare a case for the Supreme Court. All students also get to prepare a case for the Trial Court. Students normally get a chance to argue each side of their case throughout the weekend. Throughout the weekend each student also receives a chance to judge an Appeals Court or a Supreme Court case, there are normally five to seven judges during each of these trials. Students are able to judge as many cases as they would like throughout the weekend.

;Executive 
Executive branch positions may vary by state but are primarily mirrors of that state&#x27;s elected offices. For example, in Maine, the positions include governor, and governor&#x27;s cabinet, including: the Attorney General, the State Treasurer, the Commissioner of Economic Development, the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Human Services, and the Commissioner of Natural Resources.

===Other programs===
;Model United Nations programs
Many states have a Model United Nations program. For instance, the Northeast Region (NJ, DE, MD, and PA) have a joint Model UN Program that serves more than 2,000 students annually, one of the largest Model UN Programs in the country. Their program has four central values: (1) helping students find their voices, (2) promoting global understanding, (3) creating a sense of community and exchange of ideas, and (4) serving others through projects that reinforce topics (e.g., in 2016, students work with Develop Africa, a non-profit, to provide more than 17,000 pencils to students in Africa).

Additionally, the state of California&#x27;s MUN program brings together over 1,000 middle school students from the state to represent countries from around the world and debate issues of international importance. Their program consists of: the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, ECOSOC or the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the United Nations Security Council, the Office of the Secretary-General, the International Press Corps/Department of Global Communications, and United Nations Secretariat. Each Organ elects its leadership for the year, and the conference as whole elects its Secretary General for the following year.

;National conferences
Each state may participate in the national programs. Delegates are selected to attend the Conference on National Affairs or the National Judicial Competition. The elected governors from each state attend the Youth Governor&#x27;s Conference.

The National YMCA holds the Youth Conference on National Affairs (CONA) at the Blue Ridge Assembly in North Carolina, the YMCA Changemakers Summit, YMCA Youth Advocate Program, and the Youth Governors Conference in Washington, D.C., and the National Judicial Competition (NJC) at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul.

;State Affairs
The State Affairs Forum, or SAF as it is commonly known, is another program in Youth and Government. Students have the opportunity to come up with a solution to an issue their state is facing, i.e. security, campus carry, etc. Students may work in groups up to 3 and present their &#x27;proposal for action&#x27; in front of their committee room. The committee room is monitored by a chair and clerk team,

==State programs==
This section is a summary of state program participation. The legislative, judiciary and executive programs are generally available to high school students only. If a state has a model program for middle school students it is either the Model Legislative Assembly or Model United Nations.

Some states have Model United Nations programs for high school students and/or programs for college students.

===Alabama===
The Alabama YMCA Youth in Government program, in operation since 1949, has simulated the five branches of government.

The programs include a Youth Model Assembly of the state legislature, conducted strictly to the state&#x27;s processes in the State Capitol building, and beginning in 1996 a Collegiate Model Assembly. Each year, 500-600 youth participate in the program. Since 1998, an Alabama Youth Summit is conducted at the University of Alabama with participants from Youth in Government, Alabama Boys State and Alabama Girls State to propose, draft, debate, draft and present proposed legislation the governor&#x27;s office.&quot; A judicial mock trial competition is held annually in November.
The only state to do so, the Alabama Youth Legislature holds an electoral college in which delegates elect candidates for major offices.

Since its inception, the program has served tens of thousands of youth, some of whom received support and mentoring from legislators, business people and the Alabama Civil Justice Foundation.

===Arizona===
The Arizona state Youth and Government program conducts model legislative procedures at the State Capitol building. The sessions are conducted in the fall for high school students.

===California===
The California YMCA Youth &amp; Government (Y&amp;G) organization has sponsored statewide educational programs for more than 70,000 junior high and high school students since 1948. Its mission is to &quot;build values-based leadership and civic engagement in California&#x27;s youth to strengthen our democracy.&quot;

The state&#x27;s high school student programs include the Model Legislature and Court (with over 3500 participants), National Judicial Competition, Conference of National Affairs, and the Spring Conference. Middle school students (grades 6–8) may participate in the state&#x27;s Model United Nations program. The Model Legislature &amp; Court Intern Program is for college students. Individuals more than 21 years of age may participate in the program as a volunteer staff member or advisor. The organization also has an alumni association.

California YMCA Youth &amp; Government operates as an independently chartered YMCA. In 2012 Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed bill AB 233 into law which allows for voluntary contributions on the personal income tax for the California YMCA Youth and Government Fund.

===Colorado===
The Colorado YMCA Youth in Government had its first session in 1948. Each year, there is a General Assembly for high school students in the Colorado State Capitol in Denver that takes place over three days in November. Participants generally attend general training sessions prior to the General Assembly for their roles as legislators, lawyers, journalists or candidates. The program consists of a model bicameral legislature, a Supreme Court, and the press. Its programs cover each of the three branches of government. Individuals over the age of 21 may participate as advisors.

===Connecticut===
The Connecticut YMCA Youth and Government Program has been in operation since 1944. It introduces high school students to the operation of the Connecticut General Assembly via participation in a mock legislative session. The annual state conference is held at the State Capitol, which follows months of preparation developing and crafting bills. Another program is the Youth in Law program for exploration of the judicial branch of government.

===Delaware===
The Delaware YMCA Youth In Government Program was founded in 1969.

There is also a one-day Pre-Legislative training and Elections Conference held in late February or early March at Legislative Hall in Dover, DE.

The bills passed by during the Legislative Conference are presented to state legislators for consideration. Some of the youth government bills have been passed into law in Delaware.

Additionally, students from Delaware attend the Northeast Regional YMCA Model UN Program (NJ, PA, DE, and MD), which hosts more than 2,000 students annually (mun1.ymcace.org).

===Florida===
The Florida YMCA Youth In Government program, founded in 1957, includes a Senior Youth In Government program (YIG) for high school students and a Junior Youth In Government program (JYIG) for middle school students. Their program examines the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government, including simulation of media and lobbyist interactions. The Junior program is a mock legislature.

===Georgia===
The State YMCA of Georgia opened in 1919 with a sole focus of youth development in Hi-Y Clubs. The first Hi-Y Club was at Fort Valley High School (now Peach County High School). In 1929, the organization was officially registered as a Georgia nonprofit corporation. In that same year, the organization introduced Tri-Hi-Y programs-the first being at Douglas High School in southeast Georgia. The Georgia Youth In Government Program, which started in 1946, consists of a Youth Assembly (YA) and Senior Georgia United National Assembly (GUNA) for high school students and Junior Youth Assembly (JYA) and Junior GUNA for middle school students. Their program examines the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government, including simulation of media and lobbyist interactions. The Junior program is a mock legislature. At the close of 2020, the State YMCA of Georgia became an independent organization separate from the National YMCA. The new organization is the Georgia Center for Civic Engagement, www.georgiacivics.org. Their Youth In Government programs such as Youth Assembly and Model United Nations for both middle and high school students remain intact.

===Hawaii===
The Hawaii Youth In Government program conducts a Model Assembly, called the YMCA Hawaii State Youth Legislature for middle and high school students. Training and legislative bill creation occurs prior to a week-long session at the State Capitol.

===Idaho===
The Idaho YMCA Youth Government program conducts a Model Assembly Program and Judicial Branch Program, which is open to high school students. Students may participate through local program or regional convention, where bill creation, judicial research and competition and campaigning for the state session at the State Capitol. Students who attend the regional convention may be elected to attend the state convention for the legislative session or state Supreme Court sessions.

===Illinois===
Illinois YMCA&#x27;s Youth and Government program, founded by YMCA executive director Douglas Monahan in 1949, simulates legislation and judicial processes for high school students (freshman to seniors). Preliminary sessions occur in the fall where participants write bills or learn about and engage in judicial processes. In the spring, a 3-day conference is held at the State Capitol in Senate and House Chambers for the legislative assembly and a courtroom in the state Supreme Court building for the judicial branch.

Bills passed through the youth government legislative process are submitted to for review by the House and Senate.

===Indiana===

In 1994, Indiana YMCA Youth and Government (INYaG) was reinvigorated after a fifteen-year hiatus and continued under the leadership of the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis in 2001. In 2013, Indiana&#x27;s YMCAs transitioned the program to the Indiana State Alliance of YMCAs in order to capitalize on the Alliance&#x27;s statewide focus and its work in state-level policy formation. Throughout its transitions, INYaG has retained its mission to develop personal growth and encourage lifelong, responsible citizenship by providing experiential learning for young people and providing public forums to recognize the abilities and capabilities of youth. INYaG programs have sought to develop and promote an understanding of local, state, national, and international concerns; research, study and debate on public issues; exploration of careers in public service; interaction with adult and youth leaders involved in decision-making processes; an understanding of political systems and the forum they provide for the effective and peaceful resolution of issues and concerns; appreciation for the diversity of viewpoints on public issues and a concurrent respect for ideas, beliefs and the positions of others; and demonstration of citizenship responsibilities and leadership roles essential to the health of participatory democracy.

INYaG is a statewide hands-on program for students in grade 7 though 12. It consists of a Youth General Assembly, Executive Program, Judicial Program, and Media Program. Seventh graders and first-time eighth graders can participate in the Middle School Program. Through INYaG, Hoosier youth spend part of each year meeting in local delegations to discuss and debate issues that affect Indiana citizens, propose relevant legislation, write and debate bills, prepare for judicial proceedings, and campaign for governmental offices. Local activities culminate in an annual statewide model-government program.

INYaG also sends delegates who participated in the Model Government Conference to the YMCA Conference on National Affairs and the YMCA National Judicial Competition each summer.

The conference provides student participants with the experience of being a part of a functioning state government, from bill passage to policy advising. Participants are assigned to one of the following programs: Lt. Governor&#x27;s Cabinet, Senate, House of Representatives, Supreme Court or Press. Positions of aides, couriers, and liaisons are also available for student participation in this three-day program. The conference is in its 63rd year and was one of the original states to send a delegation to the Conference on National Affairs.

===Maryland===
In 1945 the Maryland YMCA Youth &amp; Government high school program had its first session. It conducts a Model Assembly program. After a statewide training sessions where they learn about the parliamentary process, students form delegations, research and debate issues, write bills and campaign among their peers. The culminating statewide event is a three-day mock assembly in Annapolis, where Delegates meet for a three-day legislative session in the State Capitol. Delegates use the Maryland State House and committee rooms to debate their bills.

Additionally, students from Maryland attend the Northeast Regional YMCA Model UN Program (NJ, PA, DE, and MD), which hosts more than 2,000 students annually (mun1.ymcace.org).

===Massachusetts===
The Massachusetts Youth and Government program consists of a legislative assembly program with legislative, judicial, lobbyists and the media functions. Sessions are conducted in advance of the annual statewide event to create bills, write press articles, do mock trial preparations and perform other tasks needed to prepare for the conference in March. The annual state conference is held at the Massachusetts State House in Boston, Massachusetts.

Every spring, Youth and Government holds its 3-day conference in the New Jersey Statehouse. Delegates write their own bills, which proceed from committees to a bicameral legislature through sessions of debate. Bills successful enough to pass through both houses have the chance to reach the Governor&#x27;s desk and Cabinet. An election is held each year for the following year&#x27;s Youth Governor of the program, who will be the figurehead of the conference and leader of the officer corps.

Each year, a conference wide service project is conducted. In the past this has been limited to a collection of items at conference, but in 2013, student leaders brought the vision of expanding the delegate experience outside of conference to life. On April 5 and 6, 2013, ninety-four NJ Youth and Government delegates volunteered in seven different charities across the state. The charities included the Community Food Bank of New Jersey, Elijah&#x27;s Promise, Trinity Church, Franklin Township Food Bank, Rise Community Center, Jon Bon Jovi Soul Kitchen, and Fisherman&#x27;s Mark. Volunteer activities ranged from pantry organization to cooking food to garden cleaning. Though not every school out of the 26 that came to conference were able to participate in the Day of Service, the program was able to further empower their delegates in Palmyra to plan their own Day of Service, which on April 20 at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Palmyra, showing that there is always the opportunity to give back.

Additionally, the Northeast Regional Model United Nations Program is hosted by New Jersey through cooperation with Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. More than 2,000 students from Middle School and High School attend this annual conference, engaging in committee simulations on a host of international topics.

The students simulate all phases and positions of the actual state government. These students are challenged with many of the issues our real legislators must face in their elected offices.

The Ohio YMCA Youth &amp; Government program was led by Ohio-West Virginia Area YMCA from 1952 until 1970 when the Ohio-West Virginia Area Council ceased to operate program in the 1970s as the Ohio-West Virginia Area YMCA and the State YMCA of Michigan became the Great Lakes Region YMCA. In 1972 the Great Lakes Region YMCA appointed an Executive of what was called the West Virginia-Ohio YMCA, operated by the Great Lakes Region to run the YMCA Youth &amp; Government and HI-Y programs throughout the states of West Virginia and Ohio. The Great Lakes Region continued to support these programs into the 1980s. In 1984 a new Ohio-West Virginia YMCA is chartered by the National YMCA. At the end of 2012 the Ohio-West Virginia YMCA made the decision to no longer be a YMCA and chose to return their charter to Y-USA, at this time the Ohio Alliance of YMCA&#x27;s began operating the Ohio YMCA Youth &amp; Government programs.

In 2015, under the leadership of director Charlie Myers, Ohio YMCA Youth &amp; Government held its first middle school conference. The next year, the decision was made to split the high school program into two conferences due to an explosion in membership from 2013 to 2016. In 2016 Ohio adopted the YMCA Youth and Government name, to follow the YMCA of the USA adopted name.

<text>The Masnavi, or Masnavi-ye-Ma&#x27;navi (, DMG: &quot;Mas̲navī-e maʻnavī&quot;), also written Mathnawi, or Mathnavi, is an extensive poem written in Persian by Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi, also known as Rumi. It is a series of six books of poetry that together amount to around 25,000 verses or 50,000 lines. The &quot;Masnavi&quot; is one of the most influential works of Sufism, ascribed to be like a &quot;Quran in Persian&quot;. Some Muslims regard the &quot;Masnavi&quot; as one of the most important works of Islamic literature, falling behind only the Quran. It has been viewed by many commentators as the greatest mystical poem in world literature. 
It is a spiritual text that teaches Sufis how to reach their goal of being truly in love with God.

== General description ==
The title &quot;Masnavi-ye-Ma&#x27;navi&quot; () means &quot;The Spiritual Couplets&quot;. The &quot;Masnavi&quot; is a poetic collection of anecdotes and stories derived from the Quran, hadith sources, and everyday tales. Stories are told to illustrate a point and each moral is discussed in detail. It incorporates a variety of Islamic wisdom, but primarily focuses on emphasizing inward personal Sufi interpretation. In contrast to Rumi&#x27;s &quot;Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi&quot;, the &quot;Masnavi&quot; is a relatively &quot;sober&quot; text. It explains the various dimensions of spiritual life and practice to Sufi disciples and anyone who wishes to ponder the meaning of life.

== Creation ==

The &quot;Masnavi&quot; was started by Rumi during the final years of his life. He began dictating the first book around the age of 54 around the year 1258 and continued composing verses until his death in 1273. The sixth and final book would remain incomplete.

It is documented that Rumi began dictating the verses of the &quot;Masnavi&quot; at the request of his favourite disciple, Husam al-Din Chalabi, who observed that many of Rumi&#x27;s followers dutifully read the works of Sana&#x27;i and &#x27;Attar. Thus, Rumi began creating a work in the didactic style of Sana&#x27;i and &#x27;Attar to complement his other poetry. These men are said to have met regularly in meetings where Rumi would deliver the verses and Chalabi would write them down and recite them back to him.

Each book consists of about 4,000 verses and contains its own prose introduction and prologue. The inconclusive ending of the sixth volume has given rise to suggestions that the work was not complete at the time of Rumi&#x27;s death, as well as to claims about existence of another volume.

== Themes and narrative devices ==

The six books of the &quot;Masnavi&quot; can be divided into three groups of two because each pair is linked by a common theme:
* Books 1 and 2: they &quot;are principally concerned with the &quot;nafs&quot;, the lower carnal self, and its self-deception and evil tendencies&quot;.
* Books 3 and 4: these books share the principal themes of Reason and Knowledge. These two themes are personified by Rumi in the Biblical and Quranic figure of the Prophet Moses.
* Books 5 and 6: these last two books are joined by the universal ideal that man must deny his physical earthly existence to understand God&#x27;s existence.

In addition to the recurring themes presented in each book, Rumi includes multiple points of view or voices inviting the reader to fall into &quot;imaginative enchantment&quot;. There are seven principal voices that Rumi uses in his writing:
# The Authorial Voice – conveys the authority of a Sufi teacher and generally appears in verses addressed to &quot;You, God,&quot; or &quot;you, of all humankind.&quot;
# The Story-telling Voice – may be interrupted by side stories that help clarify a statement, sometime taking hundreds of lines to make a point.
# The Analogical Voice – interruptions to the flow of narration in order to explain a statement by use of analogy.
# The Voice of Speech and Dialogue of Characters – many of the stories are told through dialogue between characters.
# The Moral Reflection – supported by quotations from the Quran and hadith
# The Spiritual Discourse – similar to analogical and model reflections.
# Hiatus – Rumi occasionally questions his own verses and writes that he cannot say more because the reader would not be capable of understanding.

The &quot;Masnavi&quot; has no framed plot and includes a variety of scenes, from popular stories and scenes of the local bazaar to fables and tales from Rumi&#x27;s time. It also includes quotations from the Qur&#x27;an and from hadith, accounts from the time of Mohammed.

Although there is no constant frame, style, or plot, Rumi generally follows a certain writing pattern that flows in the following order:

Problem/Theme → Complication → Resolution

<doc id="302358" wikidata="Q309328" url="?curid=302358" title="Potassium chlorate">
<text>Potassium chlorate is the inorganic compound with the molecular formula KClO3. In its pure form, it is a white solid. After sodium chlorate, it is the second most common chlorate in industrial use. It is a strong oxidizing agent and its most important application is in safety matches. In other applications it is mostly obsolete and has been replaced by safer alternatives in recent decades. It has been used
* in fireworks, propellants and explosives,
* to prepare oxygen, both in the lab and in chemical oxygen generators,
* as a disinfectant, for example in dentifrices and medical mouthwashes,
* in agriculture as an herbicide.

==Production==
On the industrial scale, potassium chlorate is produced by the salt metathesis reaction of sodium chlorate and potassium chloride:
The reaction is driven by the low solubility of potassium chlorate in water. The equilibrium of the reaction is shifted to the right hand side by the continuous precipitation of the product (Le Chatelier&#x27;s Principle). The precursor sodium chlorate is produced industrially in very large quantities by electrolysis of sodium chloride, common table salt.

The direct electrolysis of KCl in aqueous solution is also used sometimes, in which elemental chlorine formed at the anode reacts with KOH &quot;in situ&quot;. The low solubility of KClO3 in water causes the salt to conveniently isolate itself from the reaction mixture by simply precipitating out of solution.

Potassium chlorate can be produced in small amounts by disproportionation in a sodium hypochlorite solution followed by metathesis reaction with potassium chloride:
:

It can also be produced by passing chlorine gas into a hot solution of caustic potash:
:as seen in this video

According to X-ray crystallography, potassium chlorate is a dense salt-like structure consisting of chlorate and potassium ions in close association.
==Uses==

Potassium chlorate was one key ingredient in early firearms percussion caps (primers). It continues in that application, where not supplanted by potassium perchlorate.

Chlorate-based propellants are more efficient than traditional gunpowder and are less susceptible to damage by water. However, they can be extremely unstable in the presence of sulfur or phosphorus and are much more expensive. Chlorate propellants must be used only in equipment designed for them; failure to follow this precaution is a common source of accidents. Potassium chlorate, often in combination with silver fulminate, is used in trick noise-makers known as &quot;crackers&quot;, &quot;snappers&quot;, &quot;pop-its&quot;, &quot;caps&quot; or &quot;bang-snaps&quot;, a popular type of novelty firework.

Another application of potassium chlorate is as the oxidizer in a smoke composition such as that used in smoke grenades. Since 2005, a cartridge with potassium chlorate mixed with lactose and rosin is used for generating the white smoke signaling the election of new pope by a papal conclave.

High school and college laboratories often use potassium chlorate to generate oxygen gas. It is a far cheaper source than a pressurized or cryogenic oxygen tank. Potassium chlorate readily decomposes if heated while in contact with a catalyst, typically manganese(IV) dioxide (MnO2). Thus, it may be simply placed in a test tube and heated over a burner. If the test tube is equipped with a one-holed stopper and hose, warm oxygen can be drawn off. The reaction is as follows:

Heating it in the absence of a catalyst converts it into potassium perchlorate:

With further heating, potassium perchlorate decomposes to potassium chloride and oxygen:

The safe performance of this reaction requires very pure reagents and careful temperature control. Molten potassium chlorate is an extremely powerful oxidizer and spontaneously reacts with many common materials such as sugar. Explosions have resulted from liquid chlorates spattering into the latex or PVC tubes of oxygen generators and from contact between chlorates and hydrocarbon sealing greases. Impurities in potassium chlorate itself can also cause problems. When working with a new batch of potassium chlorate, it is advisable to take a small sample (~1 gram) and heat it strongly on an open glass plate. Contamination may cause this small quantity to explode, indicating that the chlorate should be discarded.

Potassium chlorate is used in chemical oxygen generators (also called chlorate candles or oxygen candles), employed as oxygen-supply systems of e.g. aircraft, space stations, and submarines, and has been responsible for at least one plane crash. A fire on the space station Mir was traced to oxygen generation candles that use a similar lithium perchlorate. The decomposition of potassium chlorate was also used to provide the oxygen supply for limelights.

Potassium chlorate is used also as a pesticide. In Finland it was sold under trade name Fegabit.

Potassium chlorate can react with sulfuric acid to form a highly reactive solution of chloric acid and potassium sulfate:

The solution so produced is sufficiently reactive that it spontaneously ignites if combustible material (sugar, paper, etc.) is present.
In schools, molten potassium chlorate is used in screaming jelly babies, Gummy bear, Haribo, and Trolli candy demonstration where the candy is dropped into the molten salt.

In chemical labs it is used to oxidize HCl and release small amounts of gaseous chlorine.

Militant groups in Afghanistan also use potassium chlorate extensively as a key component in the production of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). When significant effort was made to reduce the availability of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in Afghanistan, IED makers started using potassium chlorate as a cheap and effective alternative. In 2013, 60% of IEDs in Afghanistan used potassium chlorate, making it the most common ingredient used in IEDs.
Potassium chlorate was also the main ingredient in the car bomb used in 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people.

Potassium chlorate is used to force the blossoming stage of the longan tree, causing it to produce fruit in warmer climates.

==Safety==
Potassium chlorate should be handled with care. It reacts vigorously, and in some cases spontaneously ignites or explodes, when mixed with many combustible materials. It burns vigorously in combination with virtually any combustible material, even those normally only slightly flammable (including ordinary dust and lint). Mixtures of potassium chlorate and a fuel can ignite by contact with sulfuric acid, so it should be kept away from this reagent.
Sulfur should be avoided in pyrotechnic compositions containing potassium chlorate, as these mixtures are prone to spontaneous deflagration. Most sulfur contains trace quantities of sulfur-containing acids, and these can cause spontaneous ignition - &quot;Flowers of sulfur&quot; or &quot;sublimed sulfur&quot;, despite the overall high purity, contains significant amounts of sulfur acids. Also, mixtures of potassium chlorate with any compound with ignition promoting properties, such as antimony(III) sulfide, are very dangerous to prepare, as they are extremely shock sensitive.

<doc id="302363" wikidata="Q72813304" url="?curid=302363" title="Counties of Albania">
<text>Counties ( or ), also sometimes known as prefectures (), are the first-level administrative subdivisions of Albania, replacing the earlier districts. Since 2000, there have been 12 counties. Since 2015, they have been divided into 61 municipalities, 373 communes, and 2,972 villages.

==History==
Since its Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Albania has reorganized its domestic administrative divisions 21 times. The primary division until mid-2000 was into districts (), whose number, size, and importance varied over time. They were organized into groups comprising 12 counties beginning in 1991.

The current status of the counties is based on the 1998 constitution and was implemented on 31 July 2000. The former districts were abolished entirely and replaced with urban municipalities () and rural municipalities (), which further oversaw villages () in the countryside. This was revised in 2014, so that the 2015 local elections divided the counties into municipalities () at the regional level and administrative units () for local government.

<doc id="302364" wikidata="Q333312" url="?curid=302364" title="Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater">
<text>Thomas Jeremy King, Baron King of Bridgwater, (born 13 June 1933) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet from 1983 to 1992, and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bridgwater in Somerset from 1970 to 2001. He was made a life peer in 2001.

==Life and career==

===Education===
King was educated at two independent schools: at St Michael&#x27;s School, a former boys&#x27; preparatory school (later co-educational), in the village of Tawstock in North Devon, followed by Rugby School (Sheriff House), a boarding school for boys in Warwickshire, before attending Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

===Military service===
King was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry in 1952 and during his period of national service he was seconded to the King&#x27;s African Rifles.

===Political career===

King was elected to Parliament at the 1970 Bridgwater by-election, following the death of the sitting MP, Sir Gerald Wills.

King was brought into the Cabinet in 1983 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. After brief stints as the Environment Secretary and Transport Secretary, he went on to hold the posts of Employment Secretary and Northern Ireland Secretary at a time when these were high-profile roles with the potential for controversy.

In October 1988, John McCann, Finbar Cullen and Martina Shanahan, all from the Republic of Ireland, were convicted at Winchester Crown Court of conspiracy to murder King near his home in Wiltshire and sentenced to 25 years in prison. No evidence was produced in the trial that the defendants belonged to the IRA. The trio were freed after serving two and a half years after their convictions were quashed. The Court of Appeal ruled that their trial could have been prejudiced by comments made by King who said the defendants should not have the right to remain silent. The former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, criticised the Appeal Court ruling, stating: &quot;British justice has been betrayed by the Court of Appeal, in my opinion. Justice was done at Winchester Crown Court.&quot;

King went on to serve as Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War. He left the Cabinet following the 1992 general election, and returned to the backbenches where he served as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Select Committee from 1994 to 2001, during which time KGB agent Vasili Mitrokhin defected to reveal 87-year-old Melita Norwood as a Soviet spy.

King left the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, and was created a life peer as Baron King of Bridgwater, of Bridgwater in the County of Somerset on 9 July 2001. He now sits in the House of Lords. He serves as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party&#x27;s Policy Group on National and International Security, which was set up by David Cameron in 2006.

==In popular culture==
King was portrayed by Peter Blythe in the 2004 BBC production of &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;.

King was the subject of a song in the satirical ITV programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot; in which he was depicted as the Invisible Man during his term as Employment Secretary.

<text>Midnight Marauders is the third studio album by American hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on November 9, 1993, by Jive Records. Recording sessions for the album occurred at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios and Scorcerer Sound in New York City. Its production was mainly handled by Q-Tip, with contributions from Skeff Anselm, Large Professor and the group&#x27;s DJ, Ali Shaheed Muhammad. A culmination of the group&#x27;s two previous albums, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; and &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, it features an eclectic, gritty sound based on jazz, funk, soul and R&amp;B samples, in addition to socially conscious, positively-minded, and humorous lyrics.

&quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The first two singles, &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot; and &quot;Award Tour&quot;, charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, before the release of the final single, &quot;Oh My God&quot;. On January 14, 1994, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. It was certified platinum by the RIAA nearly a full year later, on January 11, 1995, with shipments of one million copies.

The album received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. In the following years, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; has acquired further acclamation from within the hip hop community for its production, chemistry and influence, with some regarding it as the group&#x27;s best work, and one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Several writers have credited it as a contributor to a &quot;second golden age&quot; of hip hop in the mid-1990s, as well as the pinnacle of the Native Tongues movement. In 2020, it was ranked at number 201 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Recording==
A Tribe Called Quest sought to further develop the bass-heavy sound of its previous album, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, with group member Q-Tip setting up his production equipment in the house basement of fellow member Phife Dawg&#x27;s grandmother. Phife Dawg explained, &quot;my grandmother gave him a key, the whole nine, he used to just go in and do his thing.&quot; Most of the album was planned in the basement, though Q-Tip also worked on outside projects there, including the beat for Nas&#x27;s single &quot;One Love&quot;, which appeared on his debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot; (1994). Rapper and producer Large Professor recalled the inviting, relaxed atmosphere in the basement: &quot;[Phife Dawg] would just be there chilling, watching a basketball game or something, playing a video game and just listening to the beats, like, &#x27;Yeah, yeah, I like that right there.&#x27; It was just so casual and cool  ... just kind of sitting there and chillin&#x27; out, going to get something to eat, going through sounds and picking the sounds out. Telling a few jokes, watching some television like that; it was really nice. It wasn&#x27;t forced in any way.&quot;

Phife Dawg recalled the pressure that the group faced to make a solid follow-up to &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;: &quot;Obviously, that&#x27;s a two-year wait, so there was a lot of pressure like, &#x27;Can they do it again?&#x27; Q-Tip is really hands on, Tip is a genius, so by the time he was finished sequencing the album, I was lookin&#x27; at him sayin, &#x27;Yo, b, we did it again.&#x27;&quot; The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;, originated from Q-Tip&#x27;s lyrics in the song &quot;Vibes and Stuff&quot; from &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, though it was later interpreted by group member Ali Shaheed Muhammad that &quot;A Tribe Called Quest are like sound thieves looting for your ears.&quot;

Recording sessions for &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; took place at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios and Scorcerer Sound in New York City, over a period of nine months, ending in September 1993. All songs were mixed at Battery Studios and mastered at The Hit Factory in New York City. Production was mainly handled by Q-Tip, with contributions from Skeff Anselm, Large Professor and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, who also contributed DJ scratching. Raphael Saadiq (credited as Raphael Wiggins) played bass guitar on the song &quot;Midnight&quot;.

The group hired Jive secretary Laurel Dann to be the album&#x27;s &quot;tour guide&quot;, having liked her voice, which is digitized throughout the album. With a sample of Cal Tjader&#x27;s &quot;Aquarius&quot; as a backdrop, Dann opens the album on the track &quot;Midnight Marauders Tour Guide&quot;, introducing herself as the woman on the album cover and describing the album&#x27;s sound. She resurfaces on interludes at the end of some songs, providing information and adding to the overall aesthetic of the album. Q-Tip explained the decision to use her voice: &quot;Everybody was used to hearing that kind of voice whether they were calling a phone company or they were on hold. There was always some type of monotone female voice that had a computerized vibe that was giving you information. So I thought how cool would it be if you called to pay your bill and then you would hear this female voice start rattling shit off like, &#x27;Keep bouncing?&#x27;&quot;

Despite Jarobi White leaving the group midway through recording &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, the group maintained a &quot;revolving door policy&quot; with him, in which he would continue to attend recording sessions and supply the group with humor that became part of their songwriting process. Clarifying his role, he stated, &quot;You come in [to the studio]. You might have had a bad day today. Some lady might have pushed you on the train  ... I walk in the studio and I&#x27;m bringing all my rambunctious silly stupid jokes and now we&#x27;re all laughing.&quot; Because of his efforts, White is referenced on &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;.

==Music==
===Production===
The production on &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; is a return to the eclectic sampling that the group was originally known for, featuring samples of mainly 1970s jazz, funk, soul and R&amp;B. The sound is noticeably grittier and funkier than &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, with John Bush of AllMusic noting that the group &quot;moved closer to their harder contemporaries&quot; and praising them for producing &quot;the most inviting grooves heard on any early-&#x27;90s rap record.&quot; The album has been described as &quot;hooky&quot; and was given critical praise for its frequent horn hooks. Q-Tip implemented his drum layering technique to great effect on the album, varying the drum frequencies on each song. Describing the album&#x27;s drum programming to &quot;Vibe&quot;, Q-Tip said:

Q-Tip also experimented with vocal sampling techniques on the album. For the song &quot;Lyrics to Go&quot;, he sampled a portion of &quot;Inside My Love&quot; by Minnie Riperton, in which Riperton&#x27;s whistle register is sustained throughout, giving &quot;Lyrics to Go&quot; a droning backdrop. The song &quot;Sucka Nigga&quot; contains a slowed-down sample of Rodney Cee&#x27;s voice, taken from &quot;M.C. Battle&quot; with Busy Bee, which was featured in the old school hip hop film &quot;Wild Style&quot; (1983).

While DJing at a party, Q-Tip played Jade&#x27;s hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot;; noting the positive crowd reaction when the song&#x27;s bassline began playing, he was inspired to sample the bassline for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Award Tour&quot;. For &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, engineer Bob Power removed all excess noise from the samples, however, Q-Tip instructed him to leave the noise in the samples on &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;, adding to the gritty nature of the album. In addition, Q-Tip has stated that the album has more &quot;sheen&quot; to it than &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, having been recorded on an SSL mixing console rather than the Neve console they previously used.

===Lyrics===
The lyricism on &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; is often regarded as the best on any A Tribe Called Quest album, and the group&#x27;s biggest improvement since their debut &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;. The group&#x27;s documentary director Michael Rapaport stated, &quot;They followed a classic and upped the ante. Put it like this: [&quot;The Low End Theory&quot;] would be the first run at the championship ring, but it takes a different mentality to stay focused and do it again.&quot; Subject matter on the album includes social issues, use of the word nigger and everyday life, as well as several sports references. Building on the lyrical interplay that was established on &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg are &quot;practically telepathic&quot; on some songs, providing a contrast in both delivery and style. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush described this contrast as &quot;focused yet funky&quot; and &quot;polished but raw.&quot;

All aspects of the group&#x27;s lyricism improved on the album, including cadence, flow, diction and use of metaphors. The song &quot;8 Million Stories&quot; finds Phife Dawg storytelling, as he details &quot;a laundry-list of mundane annoyances.&quot; On the single &quot;Oh My God&quot;, he refers to himself as a &quot;funky diabetic&quot; in a moment of self-deprecation. Throughout the album, the group blends their brand of intelligence, reflection and positivity with humorous anecdotes. James Bernard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the group for managing to &quot;hold our attention without resorting to gun references or expletives.&quot;

Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; noted that Q-Tip and Phife Dawg &quot;sounded slicker and more comfortable than they ever had before.&quot; Owing to that comfort and their chemistry, the two occasionally performed each others&#x27;s lyrics during the recording sessions. Describing the &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot; session to &quot;XXL&quot;, Phife Dawg said, &quot;On that record, [Q-Tip] wrote my lines and I wrote his—actually, we wrote our own lines, and when we recorded, we traded. That&#x27;s why the whole back and forth, you know what I mean?&quot;

==Cover artwork==

The album cover artwork depicts a woman painted in Afrocentric colors, continuing the artistic theme found on &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. According to &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s Book of Rap Lists&quot;, there are a reported 71 different hip hop luminaries and radio DJs who adorned &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;. Andrew Noz of &quot;Complex&quot; called it one of hip hop&#x27;s &quot;last grand displays of cultural unity as the Coastal fallout loomed imminent.&quot; The cover was issued in three different color schemes: red, black and green, with black being the rarest. The book goes into detail as to which artists were on which particular album cover using a number scheme to easily identify each artist. The complete list of artists is as follows: 3rd Bass, Afrika Bambaataa, AMG, Ant Banks, Beastie Boys, Awesome Two, Black Moon, Busta Rhymes, Casual, Chi-Ali, Chubb Rock, Chuck D, The Cold Crush Brothers, Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, Dallas Austin, Del the Funky Homosapien, Diamond D, De La Soul, Doctor Dré, Doug E.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Two of its singles, &quot;Award Tour&quot; and &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot;, charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 47 and 65, respectively. On January 14, 1994, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. It was certified platinum by the RIAA nearly a full year later, on January 11, 1995, with shipments of one million copies. It became the first of three A Tribe Called Quest albums to be certified platinum by the RIAA, doing so 21 days before &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; achieved the feat.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; was generally well received by music critics, with &quot;Vibe&quot; hailing it as &quot;a rap classic&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; calling it the group&#x27;s &quot;most complete work to date.&quot; James Bernard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that the album &quot;sounds as fresh&quot; as &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, praising its &quot;smooth-as-butter&quot; production and &quot;whimsical vibe.&quot; &quot;The Source&quot; Dream Hampton credited the group for doing &quot;what they&#x27;ve always done—ignore all of the current trends in hip-hop and deliver a solid collectable&quot;, adding that they &quot;rely solely on their street poetry, Zulu delivery and be-bop beats&quot; to attract consumers.

&quot;Spin&quot;″s Colson Whitehead praised Q-Tip and Phife Dawg for &quot;complementing each other&#x27;s styles perfectly&quot;, finding that their lyrical interplay &quot;evokes the spontaneity of an improv jam session&quot;, and also lauded the album&#x27;s &quot;smooth textures that bubble up from unseen, mellow depths.&quot; In his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau quipped that it was &quot;intelligent easy-listening rap&quot;, choosing the track &quot;Steve Biko (Stir It Up)&quot; as a highlight; he later commended the album, rating it higher than &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. In a negative review, Glenn Kenny of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that the &quot;lively wit&quot; of the group&#x27;s previous work had been &quot;replaced with tired boasts&quot;, also stating, &quot;The music still has its beguiling moments, but nothing approaches the revelatory jazz stylings and laid-back cool of past work.&quot;

===Retrospect===
John Bush of AllMusic praised the album for being &quot;impeccably produced&quot;, &quot;artistically adept&quot; and &quot;lyrically inventive.&quot; Bush also stated that it cemented the group&#x27;s status as &quot;alternative rap&#x27;s prime sound merchants&quot; and hailed them as &quot;authors of the most original style since the Bomb Squad first exploded on wax.&quot; Stereo Williams of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; credited the album&#x27;s &quot;jazzy boom bap&quot; with exerting a &quot;lasting impact on the group’s legacy—and on Black music of the next 30 years.&quot; In Oliver Wang&#x27;s book &quot;Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide&quot;, writer Joseph Patel noted how the album helped unify hip hop in the early 1990s:

Writing in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Mac Randall wrote that it &quot;certainly doesn&#x27;t skimp on the funk.&quot; For About.com&#x27;s 10 Essential Hip-Hop Albums, where the album was ranked seventh, writer Henry Adaso declared, &quot;No other album showcased this amalgamation of jazz, soul, and rap better.&quot; Steve Juon of RapReviews.com lauded its &quot;unparalleled level&quot; of &quot;lyrical brilliance by both Tip and Phife.&quot; It was ranked number 75 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the Top 100 Favorite Records of the 1990s, with Rollie Pemberton stating that the group &quot;produced a jazz-hop clinic that finds itself equal parts Pete Rock, Buckshot and Diamond D.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Legacy and influence==

&quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; helped establish a &quot;second golden age&quot; of hip hop, and has been regarded as the pinnacle of the Native Tongues movement. Hip-hop critics and writers have cited it as the group&#x27;s best album, despite it not being as acclaimed as &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. Lauding it as the group&#x27;s &quot;masterwork&quot;, writer Joseph Patel stated, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe they could top &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, but A Tribe Called Quest did so.&quot; Steve Juon of RapReviews.com called &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; &quot;the best album that Tribe ever made&quot; and an &quot;overlooked work of genius.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; added the album to its revised list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, ranking it at number 201.

Q-Tip later contributed to the sound of hardcore hip hop during the mid-1990s, producing artists such as Nas, Mobb Deep, Crooklyn Dodgers and Cypress Hill, yet retaining elements of the sound he created on &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot;, producer Mark Ronson said that the album &quot;changed the sound of East Coast hip-hop, which before was very noisy and aggressive. But &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; just had this sheen to it — it wasn&#x27;t too cleaned-up or sanitised, the snares still had that amazing &#x27;crack&#x27; to them, but it sounded like nothing you&#x27;d ever heard before. It changed everything.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Rollie Pemberton stated that &quot;a deep listen to this record unveils the sound that helped promote the current chilled vibe-oriented underground&quot;, citing the J Dilla-affiliated duo Frank n Dank, Madlib and 9th Wonder&#x27;s former group Little Brother as examples. Other underground artists influenced by the album include Terrace Martin, Jean Grae, Currensy, RJD2, Oddisee, Hiatus Kaiyote and Karriem Riggins. In a 20th anniversary review of the album for &quot;XXL&quot;, rapper Talib Kweli gave it a perfect &quot;XXL&quot; rating and stated, &quot;It established Tribe as a commercial, mainstream almost pop group, but it did it by being completely true to their rudiments, and it did it by finding the greatest jazz samples and making the most classic underground hip-hop they could make. They were so good at making underground hip-hop that it went pop.&quot;

The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, explaining that, &quot;It&#x27;s just a special album to me. I like where they were as far as beat making. I think it changed a lot in hip-hop on that record.&quot;

<doc id="302393" wikidata="Q282352" url="?curid=302393" title="Maxim gun">
<text>The Maxim gun is a recoil-operated machine gun invented in 1884 by Hiram Stevens Maxim. It was the first fully automatic machine gun in the world.

The Maxim gun has been called &quot;the weapon most associated with imperial conquest&quot; by historian Martin Gilbert, and was heavily used by colonial powers during the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. Afterwards, Maxim guns also saw extensive usage by different armies during the Russo-Japanese War, the First and Second World Wars, as well as in contemporary conflicts.

The Maxim gun was greatly influential in the development of machine guns, and it has multiple variants and derivatives.

== Design ==

The Maxim gun featured one of the earliest recoil-operated firing systems in history. Energy from recoil acting on the breech block is used to eject each spent cartridge and insert the next one. Maxim&#x27;s earliest designs used a 360-degree rotating cam to reverse the movement of the block, but this was later simplified to a toggle lock. This made it vastly more efficient and less labor-intensive than previous manually-operated rapid-firing guns, such as the manually-cranked Mitrailleuse of 1851, the Gatling gun of 1861, the Gardner gun of 1874, or the Nordenfelt gun of 1873.

The Maxim gun was water cooled, allowing it to sustain its rate of fire far longer than air-cooled guns. The extra weight and complexity this added, however, made it heavier and less flexible in use.

Trials demonstrated that the Maxim could fire 600 rounds per minute. Compared to modern machine guns, the Maxim was heavy, bulky, and awkward. A lone soldier could fire the weapon, but it was usually operated by a team of men, usually 4 to 6 in number. Apart from the gunner, other crew were needed to speed reload, spot targets, and carry and ready ammunition and water. Several men were needed to move or mount the heavy weapon.

== Production company ==
In 1884, Maxim began to develop his machine gun in Hatton Garden, London. In November of that year, he founded the Maxim Gun Company with financing from , son of steel entrepreneur Edward Vickers. A blue plaque on the factory where Maxim invented and produced the gun is located in Hatton Garden at the junction with Clerkenwell Road in London.

Albert Vickers became the company&#x27;s chairman, and it later joined hands with a Swedish competitor, Nordenfelt, to become Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company. &quot;The Post Office Directory of trades in London&quot; of 1895 lists its office at 32 Victoria Street SW (London) on page 1579.

Finally, the company was absorbed into the mother Vickers company, leading first to the Vickers-Maxim gun and then, after Vickers&#x27; redesign, the Vickers machine gun.

== History ==
=== Development (1883–1884) ===
Maxim&#x27;s first British patents relating to the development of the Maxim gun were granted in June and July 1883. The first prototype was demonstrated to invited guests in October 1884.

=== Use in colonial warfare (1886–1914) ===

A prototype of the Maxim gun was given by Hiram Maxim to the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in 1886–1890, under the leadership of Henry Morton Stanley. More a publicity stunt than a serious military contribution, in view of the main financier of the expedition, William Mackinnon, &quot;merely exhibiting&quot; the gun was likely to &quot;prove a great peace-preserver&quot;. The weapon was used on several occasions, especially during the expedition&#x27;s retreat from central Africa, not because of its devastating effects, but as an effective means to scare off attackers. One of the first uses of the Maxim gun by British Forces was in the 1887 Yoni Expedition. The same prototype used by Stanley was brought back to central Africa by Frederick Lugard, where it played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Uganda Protectorate.

The first unit in the world to receive the Maxim was the expeditionary force led by Hermann Wissmann which was sent in 1888 by the German Imperial government to its colonies in East Africa to suppress the Abushiri Revolt. Wissmann was issued one of the first Maxim guns which had reached Germany and used it successfully in his capture of Pangani.

The Singapore Volunteer Corps received a Maxim gun in 1889, but it was never used. This was a civilian volunteer defence unit on the British colony.

The Maxim gun was first used extensively in an African conflict during the First Matabele War in Rhodesia. During the Battle of the Shangani on 25 October 1893, 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 Matabele warriors with just five Maxim guns. It played an important role in the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; in the late 19th century. The extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics, when African opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain. As it was put by Hilaire Belloc, in the words of the figure &quot;Blood&quot; in his poem &quot;The Modern Traveller&quot;:

However, the destructive power of the Maxim gun in colonial warfare has often been embellished by popular myth. Modern historical accounts suggest that, while it was effective in pitched battles, as in the Matabele wars or the Battle of Omdurman, its significance owed much to its psychological impact.

A larger-calibre version of the Maxim, firing a one-pound shell, was built by Maxim-Nordenfeldt. This was known in the Second Boer War (in South Africa) as the Pom-Pom from its sound. The Boers&#x27; &quot;one-pounder&quot; Maxim-Nordenfeldt was a large-caliber, belt-fed, water-cooled &quot;auto cannon&quot; that fired explosive rounds (smokeless ammunition) at 450 rounds per minute.

The Maxim gun was also used in the Anglo-Aro War (in present-day Nigeria) of 1901–1902.

National and military authorities were reluctant to adopt the weapon, and Maxim&#x27;s company initially had some trouble convincing European governments of the weapon&#x27;s efficiency. Soldiers generally held a great mistrust of machine guns due to their tendency to jam. In the 1906 version of his book &quot;Small Wars&quot;, Charles Callwell says of machine guns: &quot;The older forms are not suitable as a rule... they jammed at Ulundi, they jammed at Dogali, they jammed at Abu Klea and Tofrek, in some cases with unfortunate results.&quot; However, the Maxim was far more reliable than its contemporaries. A more immediate problem was that, initially, its position was easily given away by the clouds of smoke that the gun produced (although the same was true of artillery pieces and units of troops that the machine gun was intended to replace or supplement, so this wasn&#x27;t viewed as a particular drawback by the early users). The advent of smokeless powder (developed by, among others, Hiram&#x27;s brother Hudson Maxim), helped to change this.

The weapon was adopted by the British Army under the guidance of Sir Garnet Wolseley, who had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in 1888. In October that year, he placed an order of 120 rifle-calibre Maxims using the same .577/450 ammunition as the Martini–Henry rifles. Wolseley had previously led military expeditions in Africa (the Ashanti war and the Gordon Relief Expedition in 1884–85) and had a reputation for being a strong subscriber to military innovation and reform, which he demonstrated in Africa. There he used machine guns, explored other unconventional ideas, and founded an Egyptian camel corps.

The gun&#x27;s design was also purchased and used by several other European countries.

In January 1899, just before the outbreak of the Philippine-American War, the Philippines had forty-two Maxim guns. An English observer who had seen one of them, described it as being &quot;of the most improved type.&quot;

=== Russo-Japanese War ===
In 1895, the Imperial Japanese Army purchased a number of Maxims and tested them during the 1895 invasion of Taiwan but later decided to standardize on the Hotchkiss machine gun. The Imperial Russian Army likewise purchased 58 Maxim machine guns in 1899 and contracted with Vickers in 1902 to manufacture the design in Russia, although manufacturing did not start until 1910. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Russian Army employed the Maxim in combat and placed a rush order for another 450 units from overseas suppliers, which were mostly delivered to front-line troops before the end of the war.

=== World War I (1914–1918) ===
By World War I, many armies had moved on to improved machine guns. The British Vickers machine gun was an improved and redesigned Maxim, introduced into the British Army in 1912 and remaining in service until 1968. Production took place at Erith in Kent, and some models were fitted to early biplanes also fabricated there. The German Army&#x27;s Maschinengewehr 08 and the Russian Pulemyot Maxim were both more or less direct copies of the Maxim.

It also saw use during the Russian Civil War, which followed the Revolution in 1917. A picture of the period depicts a Maxim gun mounted on a tachanka, a horse-drawn carriage, along with the gunner, firing backwards at a pursuing White Army regiment. Anarchists attribute this mobile setup to Nestor Makhno.

=== American use ===
The United States Army had shown interest in the Maxim machine gun since 1887. Model 1889 and Model 1900 Maxims were used for testing, which lasted for years but not continuously. The gun was finally adopted in 1904 as the Maxim Machine Gun, Caliber .30, Model of 1904 as the first rifle-caliber heavy machine gun for standard service in the U.S. Army. The design was characteristic for its visually distinctive cage-like muzzle recoil booster designed by Trevor Dawson and J. Ramsay of Vickers.

The first 50 guns and tripods were made by Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim in the U.K. chambered for .30-03. Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company was selected to produce it domestically, but challenges with schematics and specifications delayed its introduction. By the time Colt began production in 1908 (which was also the last year orders were placed for the guns), a total of 90 M1904s were made by Vickers. Colt made their machine guns for the new .30-06 caliber, and the ones made by Vickers were re-chambered for the new round. A total of 287 M1904 Maxims were manufactured. The U.S. procured other machine guns after M1904 production ended, including the M1909 Benét–Mercié, the Colt–Vickers M1915, and the Browning M1917.

M1904 Maxims were issued to infantry companies and cavalry. Each company had four guns with associated tripods, ammunition, and 20 mules to transport the heavy guns. The M1904 was deployed in operations in the Philippines, Hawaii, Mexico, and Central and South America, but never saw much combat use. During World War I, it remained in the U.S. for training.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
The Maxim, in the form of the PM M1910 chambered in 7.62×54mmR, has been used by both sides of the Russo-Ukrainian War of 2022. Many Maxim guns were retrofitted to suit the nature of modern warfare, including its installation on technicals and the mounting of red dot sights. At least one documented Maxim gun used by the Ukrainian Ground Forces in the Battle of Bakhmut still had its original iron wheels with no visible modifications. A Ukrainian soldier told &quot;BBC News&quot; in March 2023: &quot;It only works when there is a massive attack going on... then it really works. So we use it every week&quot;.

== Variants and derivatives ==
* Maxim five-barrel machine gun, fed from overhead inserted magazines and later belt-fed.
* Vickers machine gun: earlier Maxims had been chambered for earlier British service cartridges, but the Vickers was produced for export available in most of the different calibres and cartridges used by countries around the world, and including a large caliber (.50 inch) as used on Royal Navy warships. The machine gun was lighter and had been tested by the Army in 1909.
* Maschinengewehr 01, made by Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM)
* MG 08 derived from MG 01
** Its export version DWM 1909 commercial, featuring the naval tripod mount of the MG 08 instead of the sled
** German indigenous derivatives (e.g., MG 08/15)
* Type 24 heavy machine gun, Chinese variant of DWM 1909
* Maschinengewehr Modell 1911, Swiss variant of the DWM 1909 made by Waffenfabrik Bern
* Russian/Soviet Pulemyot Maxima PM1910 and lighter variants Maxim–Tokarev and PV-1 machine gun
* Finnish Maxim M09/21 and Maxim M/32-33
* American M1904
* Romanian-made 6.5 mm version, at least 8–12 were produced and were used by the Romanian Danube Flotilla during World War I
* MG 18 TuF Anti-tank &amp; Anti-aircraft gun

* 
* : By 1912 the army had 12 maxims; 50 more were ordered during the Balkan wars but it is not known if they arrived in time
* 
* (1918–1940, .303 and other versions)
* : Used in the Battle of Namasique against the forces of Honduran General Manuel Bonilla
* : Six 577/450 Maxim guns mounted on Field Carriages Mk I were purchased in 1896; they were converted to .303 after 1899. Two of these took part in the Dog Tax War. 29 .303 calliber guns were purchased from Vickers Sons &amp; Maxim in 1901 on Dundonald Galloping Carriages. In 1910 36 guns were ordered on Mk IV tripods with pack saddlery and stores but only arrived in 1913. When the tripods arrived the carriages were scrapped. However initially due to the delay in converting the guns to tripod mounting only one gun was issued to each of the 29 regiments. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles formed a Maxim Gun Battery with British-supplied guns during the Boer War. New Zealand Forces entered WW I with older Maxim machineguns and 36 new ones.

<text>The Commodore Plus/4 is a home computer released by Commodore International in 1984. It was part of the Commodore 264 series, which also included the Commodore 16 and Commodore 116 models. The Plus/4 was marketed as &quot;the productivity computer with software built in,&quot; featuring a four-application ROM-resident office suite that included a word processor, spreadsheet, database, and graphing software.

Internally, the Plus/4 shared the same basic architecture as the Commodore 16 and 116, allowing it to use software and peripherals designed for these models. However, it was incompatible with the Commodore 64&#x27;s extensive software library and some of its hardware. The Plus/4 was intended to expand the home computer market by targeting users interested in serious applications rather than gaming.

The Plus/4 featured a compact plastic casing with a fully-fledged keyboard, although the cursor and function keys were made of rubber. It had an advanced BASIC version 3.5, which made its software incompatible with the Commodore 64. Despite its potential, the Plus/4 was criticized for its lack of compatibility with the C64 and its deficiencies in sound and graphics compared to its predecessor.

Commodore produced approximately 827,000 units worldwide, with a significant number sold in Germany. The Plus/4 was discontinued in 1985, but systems remained available from liquidators for several years afterward.
== History ==
In the early 1980s, Commodore found itself engaged in a price war in the home computer market. Companies like Texas Instruments and Timex Corporation were releasing computers that undercut the price of Commodore&#x27;s PET line. Commodore&#x27;s MOS Technology division had designed a video chip but could not find any third-party buyers. The VIC-20 resulted from the confluence of these events and it was introduced in 1980 at a list price of $299.95. Later, spurred by the competition, Commodore was able to reduce the VIC&#x27;s street price to $99, and it became the first computer (of any kind) to sell over 1 million units. The Commodore 64, the first 64 KB computer to sell for under in the US, was another salvo in the price war but it was far more expensive to make than the VIC-20 because it used discrete chips for video, sound, and I/O. Still, the C64 went on to become a best-seller and was selling for $199 at the time of the Plus/4&#x27;s introduction. Even while C64 sales were rising, Commodore president Jack Tramiel wanted a new computer line that would use fewer chips and at the same time address some of the user complaints about the VIC and C64.

Rumors spread in late 1983 of a new computer in 1984 called the &quot;Commodore 444&quot; or &quot;Ted&quot;, with built-in word processing and spreadsheet software, and that it would be one of four new computers that would replace the VIC-20 and C64, which the company would discontinue. The company&#x27;s third salvo which, as it turned out, was fired just as most of Commodore&#x27;s competition was leaving the home computer market was the C116, C16, and 264, which became the Plus/4. There were also prototypes of a 232, basically a version of the Plus/4 without the software ROMs, and a V364, which had a numeric keypad and built-in voice synthesis. The latter two models never made it to production. All these computers used a 6502 compatible MOS 7501 or 8501 that was clocked approximately 75% faster than the CPUs used in the VIC-20 and C64, and a MOS Technology TED all-in-one video, sound, and I/O chip. The Plus/4&#x27;s design is thus philosophically closer to that of the VIC-20 than that of the C64.

The Plus/4 was introduced in June 1984 and priced at . The Plus/4 was the flagship computer of the line, featuring of RAM while the C16 and C116 had . The Plus/4 had built-in software, whereas the others did not. All of the machines were distinguished by their dark gray cases and light gray keys. This was a reversal of the color scheme on the C64 and VIC, which used lighter cases and darker-colored keys.

Commodore&#x27;s intent with the Plus/4 was not to replace the C64, but to expand the home computer market and sell the Plus/4 to users who were more interested in serious applications than in gaming. By 1984, however, in the US, most of these customers were beginning to switch to the new, low-cost IBM PC compatibles such as the Leading Edge Model D and Tandy 1000 series.

It was discontinued in 1985. Although, like the Commodore B128, Plus/4 systems remained available from liquidators for years after its discontinuation, the Plus/4 disappeared from Commodore&#x27;s major markets by 1988.

== Hardware ==
=== Graphics ===

The TED offered 121-color (15 colors × 8 luminance levels + black) video, a palette matched only by the Atari 8-bit computers and the Enterprise at the time, and 320×200 video resolution, similar to many computers intended to be capable of connecting to a television.

The TED chip had identical resolutions and video modes to the VIC-II (bitmap or character graphics which could be high-resolution or multicolor), but lacked hardware sprites. Its sound capability was a two-voice square wave generator.

The first eight colors of the TED&#x27;s palette are the same as the VIC-II, but colors 8-15 are different. It allowed each color except 0 (black) to be set to one of eight possible luminance levels, thus making 121 total colors possible.

The power-on default configuration places the screen memory at and the color memory at . Color memory is integrated into the TED and there is no separate color RAM like on the VIC-20 and C64. Bits 0-3 of each byte in color RAM hold the color value and 4-6 hold the luminance. Bit 7 is a flag that sets blinking text. Bitmap mode is similar to the C64, however in hi-res mode the color RAM is used to supply the luminance values for each block (bits 0-3 the luminance for color 0 and 4-7 the luminance for color 1) while it is not used at all in C64 hi-res graphics. In multicolor bitmap mode, the same setup is used, but while on the C64, color RAM holds the values for color 3, on the Plus/4 it instead holds the luminance values for colors 1–2. Color 3 is instead global and obtained from the register at .

The Plus/4&#x27;s TED has several advantages over C64&#x27;s VIC+SID. All TED registers that are available can be read and written. TED may realize the blinking cursor and the characters in the reverse-video mode. It may display 256 characters in the text mode. It may use graphics split by raster interrupt and show pictures at 320x288 resolution. This, with interlaced mode, makes it possible to show 320x496 images. In addition, the TED has 16 address lines, thus it can &quot;see&quot; the entire memory space of the computer unlike the VIC-II. The video buffers may thus be placed anywhere in memory and there are no mirrors of the character ROM to get in the way like on the C64.

=== Input and output ===

Commodore released a high-speed floppy disk drive for the Plus/4, the Commodore 1551, which offered much better performance than the C64/1541 combination because it used a parallel interface rather than a serial bus. The 1551 plugged into the cartridge port.

The Plus/4 had a built-in MOS Technology 6551 UART chip that could perform up to , unlike the C64, which emulated the 6551 chip in software. This allowed the Plus/4 to use high-speed modems without additional hardware or software tricks (the C64 required specially written software to operate at ), at a time when 300- or 1200-bit/s modems were more common and Commodore never released a 2400-bit/s modem so this feature went largely unnoticed. The Plus/4&#x27;s serial port is the standard Commodore user port used since the PET, featuring TTL voltage which is incompatible with RS-232. This requires a voltage converter to use modems or other serial devices from non-Commodore vendors.

The Plus/4 keyboard had a separately placed directional &quot;diamond&quot; of four cursor keys, presumably more intuitive to use than the VIC&#x27;s and C64&#x27;s two shifted cursor keys.

A reset button was added on the right side of the system, a feature lacking on the C64.

The Plus/4 also revived the built-in machine language monitor from the PET days, a feature missing on the VIC-20 and C64.

== Software ==

=== BASIC ===
The Plus/4&#x27;s memory map, which used bank switching far more extensively than the C64, gave it a 56% larger amount of user-accessible memory than the C64 for programming in BASIC, and its BASIC programming language was vastly improved, adding sound and graphics commands as well as looping commands that improved program structure.

The Plus/4 does not have the Restore key on the VIC and C64, but a similar function may be achieved by holding down Run/Stop and pressing the reset button. This will reboot the computer into the machine language monitor, but any BASIC programs in memory will be left intact.

The Plus/4 contains an Easter egg. Entering the command codice_1 or codice_2 puts up the names of three programmers and a hardware designer: Fred Bowen, John Cooper, Terry Ryan and Bil Herd, with Bowen&#x27;s name at the top in reverse-field and Ryan&#x27;s at the bottom blinking on and off.

While the C64 had the advertised of RAM installed, only about was available for BASIC programs. The Plus/4&#x27;s BASIC V3.5 made available, aided by its memory map that swapped the ROMs in and out of memory as needed, and that placed the memory mapped I/O registers, which all 6502-based computers have to use, at the top of memory (), while in the C64 they had been located at the much lower address . On the C64, a program was able to swap out the ROMs and the I/O registers manually and thus gain access to the full , but this was not compatible with BASIC on that machine; on the Plus/4, on the other hand, most of the ROM area was automatically switched out when not needed, rendering the RAM existing at the same addresses accessible for BASIC programs.

The BASIC program area on the Plus/4 begins at , but the BASIC ROM starts at so the automatic switching of the OS ROMs is not initiated unless a BASIC program grows big enough to reach , or 28K in size. Since RAM on the C16 never exceeds the line, banking does not occur on that machine. As on the C64, writing to the ROM areas will alter the RAM underneath.

The registers at contain the ROM configuration for the machine, which normally has the BASIC and kernal ROMs enabled. The ROM configuration is adjusted by writing to the registers (the value is irrelevant). enables or disables BASIC, the low function ROM, the low cartridge ROM, is unused, the kernal, the high function ROM, and the high cartridge ROM. The upper portion of the kernal ROM at is always enabled no matter what the memory configuration, as are the I/O registers.

Furthermore, the registers at if written to will bank out (or in) all ROMs currently enabled via the ROM configuration at excepting ; this is done by BASIC automatically to read program text above . Since disabling the ROMs will also remove the kernal interrupt handler, it will be necessary to first turn off interrupts via an SEI instruction.

BASIC 3.5 added all of BASIC 4.0&#x27;s disk commands as well as sound and graphics functions to support the TED, additional programming features, and statements to allow structured programming. While BASIC 2.0 was 8K in size and BASIC 4.0 12K, BASIC 3.5 ballooned to 20K in size, as big as the entire set of OS ROMs in the VIC-20 and C64.

=== Application software ===
The Plus/4, unlike the C64, was equipped with a ROM-resident application suite. It was, however, completely inadequate for the Plus/4&#x27;s originally intended market of business and professional users. In an otherwise largely favorable review of the computer, John J. Anderson of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; wrote &quot;I would guess that the applications were whipped up in a great hurry ... I would never use the software&quot;. &quot;The Transactor&quot; stated, &quot;The word processor is barely that, the data base defiles the name, and the spreadsheet has little spread&quot;. The magazine advised users to &quot;think of the software as an almost free bonus&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; called the built-in software &quot;just a tiny bit better than bad&quot;, noting that a Commodore 64 with Multiplan and other third-party software would be cheaper and much more powerful. The magazine stated that the computer &quot;should have been called not the Plus 4, but the Minus 60&quot;. &quot;INFO&quot; warned that users who wanted to use the computer &quot;for serious &#x27;productive&#x27; work, you are in deep trouble with the PLUS/4&quot; because of the poor software, and unlikelihood that better third-party replacements would be available. Better business software packages were available for equivalently-priced systems, including the C64. Since IBM compatibles were quickly dominating the small business market, the Plus/4 had no realistic chance of succeeding in its intended use.

Further dividing the market was that once the user had created data using many of the built-in software packages, the result could only be saved to a connected disk drive much of the software did not support tape. Thus, tape-based home users, the only users who might still have been interested in the Plus/4&#x27;s less-capable but built-in and instantly ready software, were shut out from the package.

== Peripherals ==

The keyboard on the Plus/4 was different from the keyboards of previous Commodore machines and also its sibling the C16; this was due to cost saving measures resulting from the need to retool for Plus/4 production, while the C16 could use the existing C64 tooling due to an identical case design.

Peripheral compatibility with the C64 was inconsistent. The Plus/4&#x27;s serial, user, and video ports were compatible with the C64, but the Datasette port was changed, rendering previous units incompatible without third-party adapters that only became available later. This also posed a problem for the many third-party C64 printer interfaces that allowed one to connect a standard Centronics parallel printer to the Commodore serial port. Since most of these interfaces connected to the Datasette port to get +5 volts for power, they were incompatible with the Plus/4 unless the user modified the interface and risked voiding the warranty. For a computer intended to be used for productivity applications, this was a heavy weakness. Additionally, with the Plus/4, Commodore abandoned the common Atari-style joystick ports used on the C64, replacing them with a proprietary mini-DIN port that was said to be less prone to emit RF interference.

The Plus/4 does not support analog devices via the joyports like the C64 mouse, making programs with a GUI such as GEOS less friendly to use. However, there is an unfinished project that allows the use of a standard IBM PC compatible serial mouse.

== Performance ==

While the Plus/4&#x27;s CPU could run about 75% faster than the C64&#x27;s, the computer was still designed with a shared memory architecture, in which screen data resided in main memory. This means that the video chip has to access the memory while it is displaying the picture, in effect slowing down the CPU to less than half its full speed in this screen area. Only during those periods when the video chip is displaying the screen border or putting out the horizontal and vertical retrace signals is the CPU able to run at full speed. This means that, on average, with standard 40x25 screen the Plus/4&#x27;s CPU runs only about 15% faster than that of the C64. However, as mentioned the Plus/4 can be 75% faster than a C64 when using screen blanking mode. The Plus/4&#x27;s PAL model may also be switched to NTSC mode by disabling the screen which sets the CPU frequency to 2.22 MHz (this is 115% faster than C64&#x27;s maximum speed). So a Plus/4 (PAL) is one of the fastest 6502 based computers for raw calculations. This is true for programs in machine code but BASIC 3.5 is slightly slower than BASIC 2.0 due to its greater size, and performance slows down further when programs cross over the line because the BASIC ROM has to be switched out to read BASIC program text. The NTSC model of Plus/4 is about 10% slower than the PAL model displaying a standard screen but slightly faster with screen blank.

== Reliability ==
The Plus/4 also suffered serious reliability problems due to the TED chip, which was one of the first ICs MOS developed using the newer, lower power HMOS process. MOS had considerable difficulty getting it to work reliably and TED chips and the 7501 CPU consequently had a high failure rate. Autofire-capable joysticks and improperly constructed 9-pin adapters have also been blamed for damaging TED chips. The C16 had fewer reliability problems than the Plus/4 due to a simpler design with fewer ICs and lower heat output, as well as more room inside the case for heat to disperse.

Like with the C64, the Plus/4 also used an unreliable power supply that was prone to overheating and damaging components in the machine.

This made upgrading to the Plus/4 from the VIC-20 or C64 more expensive, since the user in many cases would have to buy new peripherals in addition to the new computer. It also made the Plus/4 less attractive to new buyers, since VIC and C64 peripherals were more plentiful and less expensive than their Plus/4 counterparts. The street price for a complete C64 system was lower than that of a comparable system based on the Plus/4. Combined with the C64&#x27;s greater abilities and broader software base, most buyers opted for the older model.

== Reception ==
The press mocked the Plus/4. &quot;INFO&quot; showed a photo of the new (competitor) computer with the caption &quot;Is this a joke?&quot; and compared it to the Ford Edsel and to a dinosaur. &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; compared the Plus/4 to &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;. Many predicted that it would quickly fail; &quot;INFO&quot; gave away its review unit in a sweepstakes for readers, promising that the computer was &quot;Sure to become a collector&#x27;s item!&quot;. Even a defender of the machine acknowledged that the Plus/4 was expensive compared to the C64, and that the built-in applications&#x27; quality was poor.

Computer dealers disliked Commodore&#x27;s usual practice of introducing new computers incompatible with existing ones. Steve Leininger, the designer of the Tandy TRS-80 Model I, said in July 1984 that the new computer&#x27;s incompatibility with C64 software &quot;makes you wonder&quot;. He added &quot;It&#x27;s a little on the spooky side&quot;, unfavorably comparing the Plus/4 to the Apple IIc&#x27;s compatibility with the tens of thousands of Apple II software packages.

Another problem that kept the Plus/4 from selling was that even though the three machines (116, C16 and Plus/4) were all compatible with one another, developers tended to write programs for the lowest common denominator in a computer family. So as not to alienate buyers of the C116 and C16, which were intended to be the largest selling machines in this series, most software was designed to run in and the extra memory on the Plus/4 was not as widely supported as it could have been. Also, most development for these machines was in the less-lucrative European markets. Major software developers in North America continued to focus instead on the huge C64 market. Plus/4 software development in North America was mostly the domain of obscure companies who sold products via mail order, similar to other computers like the TRS-80 CoCo that did not have support from major developers.

== Adoption ==

In total, 1 million 264 series machines were sold in slightly more than a year on the market. Of these, 400,000 were Plus/4s with most of the remainder being C16s. Approximately 50,000 were C116s, with about 43,000 of those being sold in Germany, and the Plus/4 accounted for about 60%-70% of North American sales. Commodore&#x27;s ultimate decision to discontinue the 264 line was not due to lack of sales, but in order to free up production capacity for C64s for the 1985 Christmas season.

The Plus/4 was later used in Denmark, as part of a bundled product from the then-national telecommunications company (now TDC A/S) to help hearing-impaired people communicate over telephone lines. Outgoing calls were made from the Plus/4 via modem to a call center where a service assistant would read the written input from the user, call the other party and read the text aloud. Vice versa, incoming calls could be made from other users to the call center, who would dial the Plus/4 modem. A strobe light connected to the Plus/4 would notify the hearing impaired about the incoming call.

The Plus/4 enjoyed lasting popularity in Hungary due to CBM&#x27;s decision to saturate the Central European market with the failed product at a greatly reduced price. A number of unofficial ports of C64 games were produced by Hungarian users.

== Succession ==

Most of the developers of the Plus/4 also worked on the later Commodore 128 project, which was much more successful. Even as the Plus/4 and C16 began shipping, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; cited rumors that they were being &quot;&#x27;de-emphasized&#x27;&quot; in favor of the forthcoming 128 which, the magazine reported, would be both hardware and software compatible with the C64. Their shortcomings were the inspiration for the Commodore 128 series as, urged on by the computer press, the designers calculated that if they created a computer that was compatible with the C64 that ultimately management and marketing could not damage the C64 software base (much) in spite of how they were to take the product to market.

<doc id="302395" wikidata="Q6970077" url="?curid=302395" title="National (brand)">
<text>was a brand used by Panasonic Corporation (formerly Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.) to sell home appliances, personal appliances, and industrial appliances. 
Neither National Semiconductor nor National Car Rental are related to Panasonic or the &quot;National&quot; brand.

==History==
Before present-day Panasonic produced appliances under the name, the National brand was first used by Konosuke Matsushita&#x27;s electric firm to sell his battery-powered bicycle lamps, hoping that they would be a product used by all of Japan, hence the name &quot;National&quot;. It was arguably the first well-known brand of Japanese electronics.

National was formerly the premier brand on most Matsushita products, including audio and video and was combined in 1988 as National Panasonic after the worldwide success of the Panasonic name.

After 1980 in Europe, and 1988 in Australia and New Zealand, Matsushita ceased the usage of the &quot;National&quot; brand, and sold audiovisual products exclusively under the Panasonic and Technics brands. Matsushita never officially used the National name in the United States, due to the trademark being already in used by National Electronics. The brand made a brief appearance in 2003 on rice cookers, meat grinders and a handful of small kitchen appliances. In addition, National rice cookers were imported for sale in many Asian-American markets.

National was well known throughout Asia as a reputable manufacturer of domestic appliances such as rice cookers. In 2004, the &quot;National&quot; brand was gradually phased out in Asia, the penultimate market it was used in, with most products being rebranded under the Panasonic brand after the company decided to unify all their businesses under the Panasonic brand for greater recognition.

Due to its historical significance and recognition in Matsushita&#x27;s native Japan, non-audiovisual Matsushita products (mostly home appliances or white goods) were branded &quot;National&quot; until October 1, 2008. As of October 1, 2008, Matsushita changed its company name to Panasonic Corporation. Non-audiovisual products that were branded &quot;National&quot; in Japan are currently marketed under the &quot;Panasonic&quot; brand.

==Bicycle Manufacturing==
National bicycles were imported into the United States under the Panasonic label. The brand was known for producing high quality cycles at a relatively low price, as the result of a very high degree of factory automation and a resultingly low labor force with attendant savings in salaries and benefits. One of their models featured the unusual Shimano front freewheel system.

==Advertising campaigns==

* In 1960, National launched a &quot;tokusatsu&quot; series, co-produced by Toei, called &quot;National Kid&quot;, in a clear merchandising effort. The series wasn&#x27;t popular in its home market, but attained cult status in Brazil.
* In 1976, the Swedish band ABBA shot some ads promoting National. They were broadcast in Western Europe (Belgium, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, and West Germany), Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Philippines and Thailand.
* In 1978, J-pop duo Pink Lady appeared in several commercials promoting National&#x27;s air conditioner and Pepper portable transistor radio.
* In the 1980s a promotion was made in Japan for National TV, using the cat &quot;Chatran&quot; also known as &quot;Milo&quot; from Fuji TV&#x27;s 1986 theatrical feature film &quot;The Adventures of Milo and Otis&quot; (&quot;Koneko Monogatari&quot;). The commercial features some segments of the movie, then shows &quot;Chatran&quot;/&quot;Milo&quot; with a human companion.

<text>The Harvard Crimson is the student newspaper at Harvard University, an Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The newspaper was founded in 1873, and is run entirely by Harvard College undergraduate students.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; was one of many college newspapers founded shortly after the end of Civil War. The paper describes itself as &quot;the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously published daily college newspaper&quot;, although this description is contested by other college newspapers. &quot;The Crimson&quot; traces its origin to the first issue of &quot;The Magenta&quot;, published January 24, 1873, despite strong discouragement from the Dean. The faculty of the College had suspended the existence of several previous student newspapers, including the &quot;Collegian&quot;, whose motto &quot;Dulce et Periculum&quot; (&quot;sweet and dangerous&quot;) represented the precarious place of the student press at Harvard University in the late 19th century. &quot;The Magenta&quot;″s editors declined Dean Burney&#x27;s advice and moved forward with a biweekly paper, &quot;a thin layer of editorial content surrounded by an even thinner wrapper of advertising&quot;.

The paper changed its name to &quot;The Crimson&quot; in 1875 when Harvard changed its official color by a vote of the student body—the announcement came with a full-page editorial announcing &quot;magenta is not now, and... never has been, the right color of Harvard.&quot; This particular issue, May 21, 1875, also included several reports on athletic events, a concert review, and a call for local shopkeepers to stock the exact shade of crimson ribbon, to avoid &quot;startling variations in the colors worn by Harvard men at the races&quot;.

&quot;The Crimson&quot; included more substance in the 1880s, as the paper&#x27;s editors were more eager to engage in a quality of journalism like that of muckraking big-city newspapers; it was at this time that the paper moved first from a biweekly to a weekly, and then to a daily in 1885.

===20th century===
The paper flourished at the beginning of the 20th century with the commission of its own building in 1915, located at 14 Plympton Street in Cambridge, which remains the paper&#x27;s headquarters, and its purchase of &quot;Harvard Illustrated Magazine&quot; and the establishment of an editorial board in 1911. The &quot;Illustrated&quot;″s editors became &quot;Crimson&quot; photographers, and thereby established the photographic board. The newspaper&#x27;s president no longer authored editorials single-handedly, and the paper took stronger editorial positions.

During 1930s and 1940s, reduced financial resources and competition from a publication established by ex-editors represented serious challenges to the &quot;Crimson&quot;″s viability. In 1943, the banner on the paper read &quot;Harvard Service News&quot;, and the stories focused almost exclusively on Harvard&#x27;s contribution to World War II. Under the authority of so-called wartime administrative necessity, alumni discouraged the &quot;Service News&quot; from editorializing. The paper was administered during the war by a board of Harvard University administrators, alumni, and students.

In 1934, &quot;The Crimson&quot; defended a proposal by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s press secretary, Ernst F. Sedgwick Hanfstaengl, to donate to Harvard a prize scholarship to enable a Harvard student to attend a Nazi university. The Harvard Corporation voted unanimously to refuse the offer: &quot;We are unwilling to accept a gift from one who has been so closely identified with the leadership of a political party which has inflicted damage on the universities of Germany through measures which have struck at principles we believe to be fundamental to universities throughout the world.&quot; &quot;The Crimson&quot; defended it, &quot;That political theories should prevent a Harvard student from enjoying an opportunity for research in one of the world&#x27;s greatest cultural centers is most unfortunate and scarcely in line with the liberal traditions of which Harvard is pardonably proud.&quot;

The paper returned to its traditional civilian version in 1946, and it grew larger, more financially secure, more diversified, and began more extensive coverage of the world outside the campus during the early Cold War era.

While financially independent and independent of editorial control by the Harvard University administration, the newspaper remained under the university&#x27;s administrative control with its student staff subject to university rules and discipline. Radcliffe women on staff were forced to follow curfews to which Harvard men were not subject, and that interfered greatly with the late hours required in producing a newspaper. Throughout the 1950s, &quot;The Crimson&quot; and various university officials exchanged letters debating these restrictions. &quot;Crimson&quot; editors pushed for later curfews for their female writers, who grew increasingly involved in the newspaper&#x27;s daily operations. Under president Phillip Cronin (&#x27;53), women became staff members rather than Radcliffe correspondents.

&quot;Crimson&quot; writers were involved in national issues, especially when anti-communist investigative committees came to Harvard. Future Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Anthony Lukas&#x27; stories, including an interview with HUAC witness Wendell H. Furry, were sometimes picked up by the Associated Press. Not even a staff writer yet, Lukas had arrived at the university with Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s home number in his pocket. His father was an opponent of McCarthy&#x27;s and a member of the American Jewish Committee, the group that produced &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine.

In 1966, The Harvard Crimson, Inc. was incorporated as a nonprofit Massachusetts corporation. The incorporation was involuntarily revoked, then revived, in 1986.
The paper&#x27;s key leadership include a president, managing editor, and business manager.

In 1991, student reporters for &quot;The Crimson,&quot; including Josh Gerstein, who decades would later break the news of the Supreme Court&#x27;s plan to overturn Roe v. Wade, were the first to break the news that Harvard had selected former Neil Leon Rudenstine, then Princeton University&#x27;s provost, to succeed Derek Bok as the university&#x27;s president. The reporters, who had learned of a secret meeting in New York City, got their confirmation when they approached a surprised Rudenstine on his plane ride back to Boston. The story appeared in an extra bearing the dateline &quot;Somewhere Over New England&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, there was a great deal of focus on making the staff of the paper more inclusive and diverse. Over time, a financial aid program was instituted to try to address the problem of a lack of socioeconomic diversity. Today, some 90 editors participate in the financial aid program every semester.

===21st century===
&quot;Crimson&quot; editors repeated their scoop of Harvard&#x27;s presidency in 2001, beating out national media outlets to report that Lawrence Summers would succeed Rudenstine, and again in 2007, being the first to report Drew Gilpin Faust&#x27;s ascension to the presidency.

On January 12, 2004, &quot;The Crimson&quot; printed its first color edition after obtaining and installing four new Goss Community color presses. The date also marked the unveiling of a major redesign of the paper itself.

In 2004, &quot;The Crimson&quot; filed a lawsuit against Harvard University to force the Harvard University Police Department to release more complete records to the public. The case was heard before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2005. In January 2006, the court decided the case against &quot;The Crimson&quot; and in favor of the university.

In November 2005, &quot;The Crimson&quot; had its records subpoenaed by ConnectU in relation to its lawsuit against Facebook. &quot;The Crimson&quot; challenged the subpoena, stating that it would not comply with ConnectU&#x27;s demands for documents.

On April 23, 2006, &quot;The Crimson&quot; was the first to allege that portions of Harvard student Kaavya Viswanathan&#x27;s highly publicized debut young adult novel &quot;How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life&quot; had been plagiarized from two bestselling books by novelist Megan McCafferty. Further allegations were later made that Viswanathan&#x27;s novel had drawn inappropriately from other novels as well.

In 2019, &quot;The Crimson&quot; came under fire from some Harvard student groups after an article on a campus protest calling for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The article included the fact that ICE did not respond to a request for comment, leading to backlash from Harvard student groups who said that reaching out to ICE endangered Harvard students. The &quot;Crimson&quot; stood by its reporting and received support from journalistic ethics experts.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;The Crimson&quot; abruptly switched to an internet-only format in March 2020. Paper editions were later restored during the fall 2021 semester. In July 2022, the paper announced that it was changing from daily to weekly issues that fall as part of a shift to digital-first journalism.

On April 29, 2022, the paper editorialized support for the BDS movement. In a May 1, 2022 editorial, the editors wrote, &quot;We are proud to finally lend our support to both Palestinian liberation and BDS — and we call on everyone to do the same.&quot; The paper&#x27;s editorial board admitted that where it previously held a &quot;skeptical&quot; stance on the matter, it has now shifted to fully supporting the BDS campaign, insisting that, &quot;The weight of this moment — of Israel&#x27;s human rights and international law violations and of Palestine&#x27;s cry for freedom — demands this step&quot;.

In 2024, &quot;The Crimson&quot; scooped national outlets to the news that Claudine Gay would be resigning her post after a tumultuous semester in office.

In May 2024, the newspaper announced it has raised $15 million through a capital campaign launched in 2020. The goal was to get $6 million for innovation, $6 million for its financial aid program and $3 million for building renovations, which had not seen a major renovation in 35 years. The funds will be stored in an organizational trust managed by &quot;Crimson&quot; alumni.

==Building==

&quot;The Crimson&quot; commissioned its headquarters building at 14 Plympton Street in the Harvard Square area in 1915. It was designed by Jardine, Hill &amp; Murdock, and has been called &quot;stolid, institutional and boring. All the things the &quot;Crimson&quot; isn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Organization==
Any student who volunteers and completes a series of requirements known as the &quot;comp&quot; is elected an editor of the newspaper. As such, all staff members of &quot;The Crimson&quot;, including writers, business staff, photographers, and graphic designers, carry the title of editor. If an editor makes news, they are referred to in the paper&#x27;s news article as a &quot;&quot;Crimson&quot; editor&quot;, which, though important for transparency, also leads to characterizations such as &quot;former President John F. Kennedy &#x27;40, who was also a &quot;Crimson&quot; editor, ended the Cuban Missile Crisis.&quot; Editorial and financial decisions rest in a board of executives, collectively called a &quot;guard&quot;, who are chosen for one-year terms each November by the outgoing guard. This process is referred to as the &quot;turkey shoot&quot; or the &quot;shoot&quot;. The unsigned opinions of &quot;&quot;The Crimson&quot; Editorial Board&quot; are decided at triweekly meetings that are open to any &quot;Crimson&quot; Editorial editor (except those editors who plan to write or edit a news story on the same topic in the future).

&quot;The Crimson&quot; is one of the only college newspapers in the U.S. that owns its own printing presses. At the beginning of 2004 &quot;The Crimson&quot; began publishing with a full-color front and back page, in conjunction with the launch of a major redesign. &quot;The Crimson&quot; no longer prints in-house but used to print over fifteen other publications on its presses.

&quot;The Crimson&quot; has a rivalry with the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, which it refers to in print as a &quot;semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.&quot; The two organizations occupy buildings within less than one block of each other; interaction between their staff has included pranks, vandalism, and romance.

Currently, &quot;The Crimson&quot; publishes two weekly sections in addition to its regular weekly paper: an Arts section on Tuesdays and a magazine called &quot;Fifteen Minutes&quot; on Thursdays. Issues of &quot;Fifteen Minutes&quot; come periodically in the form of glossies.

&quot;The Crimson&quot; is a nonprofit organization that is independent of the university. All decisions on the content and day-to-day operations of the newspaper are made by undergraduates. The student leaders of the newspaper employ several non-student staff, many of whom have stayed on for many years and have come to be thought of as family members by the students who run the paper.

&quot;The Crimson&quot; is composed of 10 boards: Arts, Business, News, Sports, Editorial, Blog, Design, Magazine, Multimedia, and Technology.

==Notable former editors==

Former editors include two U.S. presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, and many journalists, government officials, and academics.

<text>Aco Records or ACO Records was a British record label active from 1922 through 1927.

Aco was a budget label, producing 10 inch and 12 inch double sided gramophone records. Aco was a subsidiary of the Aeolian Company Ltd. of London, which in turn was an affiliate of the United States based Vocalion Records. The material was mostly popular dance tunes and songs of the day, together with some light Classics and operatic selections. Aco seems to have made no recordings themselves, instead taking masters from both British and US Aeolian, as well as leasing masters from U.S.-based Gennett Records. Sometimes these re-releases on Aco had the recording artists listed on the label under various pseudonyms. The discs were manufactured, alongside Aeolian Vocalion discs, at the factory of the Universal Music Company at Hayes.

The brand was discontinued in 1927 and replaced by the Broadcast and Broadcast Twelve Records brands.

Artists on the label included the Broadway Band, Merrie&#x27;s Dance Quintette, The Lyricals and the St. Hilda Prize Band.

<text>Samuel Antek (May 1, 1909 – January 27, 1958) was a violinist in the NBC Symphony Orchestra under conductor Arturo Toscanini. He joined at the orchestra&#x27;s inception in 1937 and played with it until its dissolution in 1954.

Antek was also a conductor and served as music director for the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra from
1947 to 1958. In 1948, he conducted the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. After leaving the NBC Symphony, he served as assistant conductor with the Chicago Symphony under Fritz Reiner. Antek&#x27;s untimely death led Reiner to appoint Walter Hendl, then music director of the Dallas Symphony, to this position.

Antek wrote a series of essays about Toscanini, describing the famed Italian conductor from the point of view of an orchestral musician. They were collected in a book entitled &quot;This Was Toscanini&quot;, accompanied by renowned photographs of Toscanini by Robert Hupka; it was published posthumously by the Vanguard Press in 1963. An earlier piece about Toscanini by Antek, &quot;Playing with the Maestro&quot;, appeared in Saturday Review magazine in the early 1950s.

Antek died of a heart attack in 1958 at the age of 48, one year after Toscanini&#x27;s own death.

<text>Robert Hupka (August 26, 1919 – July 3, 2001) was a recording engineer for RCA Victor and later for Columbia Records and, until his retirement, a cameraman for CBS Television in New York. He was born in Vienna, and emigrated to the U.S. at the onset of World War II to escape the Nazi persecution which took his parents&#x27; lives. His grandfather was the composer Ignaz Brüll, who was a friend of Brahms.

Hupka took thousands of famous candid photographs of conductor Arturo Toscanini while Toscanini was leading the NBC Symphony Orchestra in rehearsals. Many of these photos were published in the book &quot;This Was Toscanini,&quot; (1963) accompanying an uncompleted essay by Samuel Antek, a violinist in the NBC Symphony. Later, those and several more photos were used as cover art for RCA LP and CD reissues of Toscanini&#x27;s recordings.
Three of these photos were used as set pieces in the television show, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; the photos can be seen on the wall in Felix Unger&#x27;s bedroom.
In the late 1980s, Hupka worked with engineers at NBC International on the audio/video synchronization of the ten Toscanini telecasts, which were finally issued by RCA in the early 1990s.

Hupka was also the author of &quot;Michelangelo: Pieta&quot;, a collection of a hundred photographs, from various angles and with different lighting, of Michelangelo&#x27;s Pieta, taken in 1964 when this sculpture was exhibited at the New York World&#x27;s Fair.

<doc id="302422" wikidata="Q315601" url="?curid=302422" title="Hiram Maxim">
<text>Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim (5 February 1840 – 24 November 1916) was an American-born British inventor best known as the creator of the first automatic machine gun, the Maxim gun. Maxim held patents on numerous mechanical devices such as hair-curling irons, a mousetrap, and steam pumps. Maxim laid claim to inventing the lightbulb.

Maxim experimented with powered flight; his large aircraft designs were never successful. Circa 1904 he designed a highly successful amusement ride called the &quot;Captive Flying Machine&quot; to fund his research while generating public interest in flight.

Maxim moved from the United States to the United Kingdom at the age of 41, and remained an American citizen until he became a naturalised British citizen in 1899, and received a knighthood in 1901.

==Birth and early life==
Maxim was born in Sangerville, Maine on 5 February 1840, into a family of French Huguenot origin. He became an apprentice coachbuilder at the age of 14 and ten years later, took up a job at the machine works of his uncle, Levi Stephens, at Fitchburg, Massachusetts. He subsequently worked as an instrument-maker and as a draughtsman.
(His early jobs in these areas led him to be often disappointed with workers when he ran his own companies later on in life.) Hiram called himself a Protestant.

==Inventions==
Maxim, a longtime sufferer of bronchitis, patented and manufactured a pocket menthol inhaler and a larger &quot;Pipe of Peace&quot;, a steam inhaler using pine vapour, that he claimed could relieve asthma, tinnitus, hay fever and catarrh. After being criticised for applying his talents to quackery, he protested that &quot;it will be seen that it is a very creditable thing to invent a killing machine, and nothing less than a disgrace to invent an apparatus to prevent human suffering&quot;.He also invented a curling iron, an apparatus for demagnetising watches, magno-electric machines, devices to prevent the rolling of ships, eyelet and riveting machines, aircraft artillery, an aerial torpedo gun, coffee substitutes, and various oil, steam, and gas engines.

A large furniture factory had repeatedly burned down, and Maxim was consulted on how to prevent a recurrence. As a result, Maxim invented the first automatic fire sprinkler. It would douse the areas that were on fire, and it would report the fire to the fire station. Maxim was unable to sell the idea elsewhere, but when the patent expired the idea was used.

Maxim developed and installed the first electric lights in a New York City building (the Equitable Life Building (New York City) at 120 Broadway) in the late 1870s. In 1878 he cofounded United States Electric Lighting Company together with Edward Weston to commercialize his designs.

However, he was involved in several lengthy patent disputes with Thomas Edison over his claims to the lightbulb. One of these actions regarded the incandescent bulb, for which Maxim claimed that Edison was credited by means of his better understanding of patenting law. Maxim claimed that an employee of his had falsely patented the invention under his own name, and that Edison proved the employee&#x27;s claim to be false, knowing that patent law would mean the invention would become public property, allowing Edison to manufacture the lightbulb without crediting Maxim as the true inventor.

===Maxim gun===
Maxim was reported to have said: &quot;In 1882 I was in Vienna, where I met an American whom I had known in the States. He said: &#x27;Hang your chemistry and electricity! If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will enable these Europeans to cut each others&#x27; throats with greater facility.&#x27;&quot;

As a child, Maxim had been knocked over by a rifle&#x27;s recoil, and this inspired him to use that recoil force to automatically operate a gun. Between 1883 and 1885 Maxim patented gas, recoil and blowback methods of operation. After moving to England, he settled in a large house formerly owned by Lord Thurlow in West Norwood where he developed his design for an automatic weapon, using an action that would close the breech and compress a spring, by storing the recoil energy released by a shot to prepare the gun for its next shot. He thoughtfully ran announcements in the local press warning that he would be experimenting with the gun in his garden and that neighbours should keep their windows open to avoid the danger of broken glass.

Maxim founded an arms company with financial backing from Edward Vickers to produce his machine gun in Crayford, Kent, which later merged with Nordenfelt. Subsequently, part of the Barrow Shipbuilding Company purchase by Vickers Corporation in 1897, formed &#x27;Vickers, Son &amp; Maxim&#x27;. Their improved development of the Maxim gun design, the Vickers machine gun, after Maxim&#x27;s resignation from the board in 1911 on his 71st birthday, was the standard British machine gun for many years. With arms sales led by Basil Zaharoff, variants of the Maxim gun were bought and used extensively by both sides during World War I.

In his later years Maxim became profoundly deaf, as his hearing had been damaged by years of exposure to the noise of his guns.

===Flying machines===

Maxim&#x27;s father had earlier conceived of a helicopter powered by two counter-rotating rotors, but was unable to find a powerful enough engine to build it. Hiram first sketched out plans for a helicopter in 1872, but when he built his first &quot;flying machine&quot; he chose to use wings. Before starting design work, he carried out a series of experiments on aerofoil sections and propeller design, at first using a wind tunnel and later building a whirling arm test rig. Construction started in 1889 of a craft with a wingspan that weighed 3.5 tons, powered by two lightweight naptha-fired steam engines driving two laminated pine propellers.

Conceived of as a test rig, the machine ran on an length of rail track which Maxim laid down for the purpose at his home, Baldwyn&#x27;s Park Mansion, Baldwyn&#x27;s Park in Bexley. The initial intention was to prevent the machine from lifting off by using heavy cast-iron wheels, but after initial trials, Maxim concluded that this would not suffice, and so the machine was fitted with four wheeled outriggers which were restrained by wooden rails outside the central track. In trials in 1894, the machine lifted and was prevented from rising by the outriggers. During its test run, all the outriggers were engaged, showing that it had developed enough lift to take off, but in so doing, it pulled up the track; the tethered &quot;flight&quot; was aborted in time to prevent disaster. Maxim subsequently abandoned work on it but put his experience to work on fairground rides. He subsequently noted that a feasible flying machine would need better power-to-weight engines, such as a petrol combustion engine.

====Captive Flying Machines====
To both fund his research into flight and to bring attention to the notion of flight, Maxim designed and built an amusement ride for the Earl&#x27;s Court exhibition of 1904. The ride was based on a test-rig he had devised for his research, and consisted of a large spinning frame from which cars hung captive. As the machine spun, the cars would be swung outward through the air, simulating flight. The ride was similar to the later Circle Swing ride, made popular in the US by renowned roller-coaster designer Harry Traver.

Maxim originally intended to use primitive aerofoils and wings to allow riders to control their flight, but this was outlawed as unsafe. As a result, Maxim quickly lost interest in the project, declaring the adapted ride as &quot;Simply a glorified merry-go-round&quot;. Nevertheless, his company built several more rides of various sizes at The Crystal Palace and various seaside resorts including Southport, New Brighton, and Blackpool, all of which opened in 1904. Originally, Maxim had intended to build only two, but a lengthy breakdown on the original Earl&#x27;s Court ride forced him to build more to make the venture profitable. He had plans for further variations of the ride but his disillusionment with the amusement business meant that they were never realised.

Although he expressed regrets about the whole project, the rides were held in high regard within the amusement industry and the Blackpool ride still operates to this day as part of what is now the Pleasure Beach amusement park. Along with the same park&#x27;s similarly historic river caves, it is the oldest operating amusement ride in Europe. The Flying Machines has the distinction of being virtually unchanged from Maxim&#x27;s original design. The Blackpool ride&#x27;s name is now usually abbreviated to the &quot;Flying Machine&quot; or &quot;Flying Machines&quot;, although the full name, &quot;Sir Hiram Maxim&#x27;s Captive Flying Machines&quot;, is given at the ride entrance.

In 2001, Disney California Adventure Park opened, featuring the Golden Zephyr, a modern-day recreation of the Traver version of the ride. The ride itself is much smaller than the Blackpool version, with cars swinging out at a much smaller angle. Nevertheless, engineers from Disney visited Blackpool to inspect the Maxim ride (the only example of either version still standing) to help design their ride.

==Grahame-White, Blériot, and Maxim Company==
In 1911, Maxim headed the newly formed Grahame-White, Blériot, and Maxim Company, founded with the two aviators and two hundred thousand pounds of capital.
He had hoped to produce military aircraft capable of scouting or dropping a bomb, but his failing health and financial difficulties with his other enterprises restricted his ability to develop this enterprise before his death.

== Philosophy ==
In addition to his engineering endeavors, Maxim, a lifelong atheist &quot;compiled and edited&quot; a book he called &quot;Li Hung Chang&#x27;s Scrapbook&quot;.
This book was addressed to Li Hung Chang (also spelled Li Hongzhang and Li Hung-chang) and endeavored to address a belief that &quot;The Chinese were generally puzzled as to how it was possible for people who are able to build locomotives and steamships to have a religion based on a belief in devils, ghosts, impossible miracles, and all the other absurdities and impossibilities peculiar to the religion taught by the missionaries.&quot;

Maxim held European missionaries in China in low esteem, for reasons described in the scrapbook. He stated &quot;...it was my aim, in compiling for His Excellency a scrap-book with explanatory notes, to put the Chinaman right in this respect. I wished to show that we were not all fools.&quot; His scrapbook comprised some 400 pages with 42 illustrations, presenting his views on The Nature of Christianity; Christianity in China; and his conclusions on subjects including Miracles, Spirituality, Faith; and the influence of the Bible on the civilization of Europe and America. He concluded his scrapbook with an appeal to the Missionaries and his thoughts on the reason for the failure of what he described as &quot;Missionary Propaganda&quot; in China.

==Honours==
Maxim was a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour; a Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineer; Member of the London Chamber of Commerce; Fellow of the Royal Institution; Member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; Member of the British Empire League; and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

==Emigration and knighthood==
In 1881, Maxim arrived in Britain to reorganise the London offices of the United States Electric Lighting Company. His visits back to the United States became increasingly infrequent and, on 16 September 1899, Maxim became a naturalised British citizen. In the following year, Queen Victoria bestowed a knighthood on him. However Victoria died on 22 January 1901, shortly before Maxim&#x27;s investiture, and so the honour was conferred by Maxim&#x27;s &quot;friend and new king, Edward VII&quot; at Marlborough House on 9 February 1901.

==Death==
Maxim died at his home in Streatham, London on 24 November 1916 at the age of 76. He is buried in south London&#x27;s West Norwood Cemetery with his wife and his grandson, Lieutenant Colonel Maxim Joubert.

==Family==
His brother, Hudson Maxim, was also a military inventor, specializing in explosives. They worked quite closely together until later in life, when there was a disagreement on a patent for smokeless powder. The patent, Hiram claimed, had been issued under the name &#x27;H. Maxim,&#x27; and that because of this, his brother was able to stake a claim as the powder being his own. Hudson was a skilled and knowledgeable man, and sold arms in the US, while Hiram worked mainly in Europe. Hudson had success in the States, which caused jealousy from Hiram (he lamented having a &quot;double&quot; of himself running around in the States). The jealousy and disagreements caused a rift between the brothers that would last the rest of their lives.

Hiram Maxim married his first wife, the English-born Jane Budden, on 11 May 1867 in Boston, Massachusetts. Their children were: Hiram Percy Maxim; Florence Maxim, who married George Albert Cutter, and Adelaide Maxim, who married Eldon Joubert, Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s piano tuner. In 1875, the family moved to Fanwood, New Jersey, with Hiram joining the family on weekends.

His son Hiram Percy Maxim followed in his father&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s footsteps and became a mechanical engineer and weapons designer as well, but he is perhaps best known for his early amateur radio experiments and for founding the American Radio Relay League. His invention of the &quot;Maxim Silencer&quot; for noise suppression came too late to save his father&#x27;s hearing. Hiram Percy later wrote a biography of his father titled &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot;, containing about 60 anecdotes of Hiram Percy&#x27;s experiences with his father throughout his early life (until about age 12). Most of these short stories are entertaining; they give a reader an insider&#x27;s (and a child&#x27;s) view of the man&#x27;s personal and family life. &quot;So Goes My Love,&quot; a film loosely based on these memoirs and starring Don Ameche and Myrna Loy, was released in 1946.

Hiram Maxim married his secretary and mistress, Sarah, daughter of Charles Haynes of Boston, in 1881. It is not clear if he was legally divorced from his first wife at this time. The marriage was registered again in Westminster, London in 1890.

A woman called Helen Leighton brought a case against Maxim, claiming that he had married her in 1878 and that &quot;he was knowingly committing bigamy&quot; against his current wife, Jane Budden. She claimed further that Maxim had fathered a child named Romaine by her. The case was eventually dropped, being settled for under $1,000 (the original amount asked for was $25,000), and Maxim put behind him the near public humiliation the case caused. In October 1898, Helen Leighton again brought charges against Maxim for bigamy and abandonment in Poughkeepsie, New York. Later in life, he left 4,000 pounds sterling to a Romaine Dennison, perhaps the child Leighton claimed he had fathered.

<text>Tynwald (), or more formally, the High Court of Tynwald () or Tynwald Court, is the legislature of the Isle of Man. It consists of two chambers, known as the branches of Tynwald: the directly elected House of Keys and the indirectly chosen Legislative Council. When the two chambers sit together, they become &quot;Tynwald Court&quot;.

The chambers sit jointly, on Tynwald Day at St John&#x27;s for largely ceremonial purposes, and usually once a month in the Legislative Buildings in Douglas. Otherwise, the two chambers sit separately, with the House of Keys originating most legislation, and the Legislative Council acting as a revising chamber.

==Etymology==
The name Tynwald, like the Icelandic and Norwegian &quot;Tingvoll&quot;, is derived from the Old Norse word meaning the meeting place of the assembly, the field (vǫllr→wald, cf. the Old English cognate weald) of the &quot;thing&quot;.

==Tynwald Day==
Tynwald meets annually on Tynwald Day (usually on 5 July) at an open-air ceremony at Tynwald Hill at St John&#x27;s. The Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man presides, unless the monarch as Lord of Mann, or a member of the Royal Family representing them, is present. Here, all laws are promulgated in both Manx and English and petitions are received.

===Promulgation===
If an Act of Tynwald is not promulgated at St John&#x27;s within 18 months of passage, it becomes null and void.

==Joint sittings==
When Tynwald Court sits in Douglas (historically once a month from October to July), the President of Tynwald, who is elected by the other members, presides. In the joint session:
* Members of each house formally sign bills
* Notices of royal assent from the Lord of Mann are received
* Questions may be put to ministers
* Special resolutions authorising taxes are made
* Delegated legislation made by government departments may be approved or annulled
* Petitions may be presented
* Other important public business is conducted

===Voting===
When Tynwald votes at a joint sitting, each branch normally votes separately. If a majority of each branch approves, the motion is carried. If the Council vote ties, then the President of Tynwald casts the deciding vote in line with the majority vote of the Keys. However, if the Keys approves a motion but the Council disapproves, then the question can be put again at a different sitting. In this case, the vote is determined by a majority of all the members of Tynwald. If this occurs, the Keys, with its larger size, is likely to prevail.

However, in some cases Tynwald votes as one body even when there is no disagreement between the branches: e.g. when electing the Chief Minister or on a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers.

==Passage of legislation==
Normally, both branches of Tynwald must pass a bill before it goes to the sovereign or his representative the Lieutenant Governor, representing the King-in-Council, for royal assent. If the Council rejects a bill or amends it against the Keys&#x27; wishes, however, the Keys has the power to repass the same bill; in this case the Council&#x27;s approval is not required, and the bill is presented to the Lieutenant Governor for royal assent.

On some matters, the Royal Assent to Legislation (Isle of Man) Order 1981 requires the Lieutenant Governor to consult with and follow the advice of the Secretary of State for Justice of the United Kingdom.

==History of Tynwald==
Tynwald claims to be over 1,000 years old, and thus the &quot;oldest continuous parliament&quot; in the world (Iceland&#x27;s Althing claims world’s oldest parliament, though with noncontinuous operation). In 1979, the Manx people celebrated the millennium of their parliament. The year was picked arbitrarily by officials; there is no evidence indicating that such an assembly was held in 979, or that any such event resembled the modern-day court. The first record of the place-name occurs in the 13th–14th century &quot;Chronicles of Mann&quot;, and the first description of the role and composition of an assembly held on site occurs in the early 15th century.

===Medieval period===
Tynwald originally comprised only the 24 Members of the House of Keys, commonly referred to as &quot;the Keys&quot;. There were four members for each of the six sheadings of the island. The earliest surviving record of the Keys dates from 1417. The Keys were not originally an elected body, and membership was for life. When a vacancy arose the remaining members selected the replacement member. In general, membership of the Keys passed down through the leading families on the island.

In the 16th century the Keys met irregularly. They were akin to a jury which was summoned from time to time by the Lord of Mann or by the deemsters when they required advice as to the law. In 1600 the Keys became a permanent body.

Until 1577, the Keys merely declared and interpreted the ancient common law when queries arose. This developed into the power to create new laws, a function that Tynwald adopted around 1610.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In October 1651, during the English Civil War, the island fell to the Parliamentary forces, who took over the administration of the government. During this period, Tynwald met only sporadically.

Following the restoration of the monarchy, control of the island was returned to the Lords of Mann. The Keys saw a reduction in their power at this point, as Tynwald was reconstituted as &quot;the Lord [of Mann], the Governor, the principal officers and the deemsters (who constitute the Lord&#x27;s Council), and the Commons represented by their Keys.&quot;

Administration of the government was vested in a Governor, and the Lords of Mann became absentee landlords. The Keys were unhappy with the changes, and agreed to very few new laws.

In 1737, Tynwald obtained further powers in addition to its monopoly on law-making: the agreement of Tynwald would be required for all taxation, in imitation of the constitutional practice of Great Britain. This was a short-lived arrangement, as in 1765 the Lord of Mann sold his rights over the island to the British Crown.

===Post-revestment===
Following the revestment of the Lordship of Mann into the British Crown in 1765, the British government assumed all powers to impose and collect taxes. Tynwald was left with no money to spend, and little power, although it was still able to bring about social change by the repeal in 1771 of restrictive labour legislation.

As a result, the Keys asked the British government to dissolve Tynwald and to assent to legislation for a new elected parliament, which they hoped would have a stronger voice to challenge the new government of the island, based in distant Whitehall. To this end, the Keys organised a petition of 800 signatures, which was presented to the British government.

A Royal Commission was appointed in 1791, but it was not until 1866 that Tynwald finally passed legislation that would see some of its members elected for the first time. However, before 1866 Tynwald&#x27;s primary function had been that of the island&#x27;s court of appeal. The House of Keys Election Act 1866 transferred this judicial power to a separate court.

=== Women in Tynwald ===
Women have been able to stand for election to the House of Keys since the 1919 introduction of universal adult suffrage based on residency. The first woman elected was Marion Shimmin of the Manx Labour Party at a by-election in 1933.

==Royal Commission on the Isle of Man==
In 1791 a &quot;Royal Commission on the Isle of Man&quot; was formed to examine the governance and finances of the island.

The Commissioners reported back to Whitehall in 1792, stating that &quot;The laws and ordinances that were enacted during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries appear by the Manks Statute Book to have been prescribed by such different powers, or combination of powers, that as precedents of the exercise of legislative authority they can have but little weight.&quot; The Commission noted that only subsequent to this period was the practice of the Council and 24 Keys meeting together to enact legislation established as &quot;the more regular mode of legislating&quot;.

The Royal Commission also noted that the earliest insular Manx laws on record dated from 1417 (the first Act on record being a restriction of the powers of the church to offer sanctuary). This was after the arrival of the Stanley family as Lords of Mann. It also noted that the comprehensive Manx Statute Book dated from the year 1422 onwards. These were not necessarily the earliest laws passed, but any prior to this date were not recorded as Acts of Tynwald. Comparison can be made with other parliaments in the British Isles of a similar period: the oldest recorded in England was from 1229, in Scotland 1424, and in Ireland 1216 – although again there were prior laws that are now merely part of the unwritten common law of each country.

The opening statement of the Statute Book was &quot; Ordinances, Statutes, and Customs, presented, reputed, and used for Laws in the Land of Mann, that were ratified, approved, and confirmed, as well by the Honourable Sir John Stanley, Knight, King and Lord of the same Land, and others his Predecessors, as by all Barons, Deemsters, Officers, Tenants, Inhabitants, and Commons of the same Land where the Lord&#x27;s Right is declared in the following Words&quot;. Furthermore, the Commissioners&#x27; report noted that prior to the revestment, no &quot;minutes or journals&quot; of the proceedings of the Council or the House of Keys had been kept.

==Proposed changes==
In 2007, the island&#x27;s system of government was reviewed with plans to transform the Legislative Council into a directly elected chamber, likely stemming from debate around the reform of the House of Lords, which was a promise of the Blair Government, and resulted in the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999 and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. As of September 2023, no such legislation has passed through the Tynwald or Parliament of the United Kingdom, however between 2017 and 2018 the Tynwald considered a series of recommendations from Lord Lisvane regarding legislative reform, most of which were rejected.

According to the House of Keys Hansard for 6 December 2023, it was stated that the question of removing the Bishop&#x27;s vote, and possibly seat, in LegCo and Tynwald has been debated ten times in the recent past. This proposal for change was defeated in the Keys on 6 December 2023.

==Millennium Way==
The Millennium Way long distance footpath was opened in 1979 to commemorate the millennium year of Tynwald.

<text>William John Janklow (September 13, 1939January 12, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician and member of the Republican Party who holds the record for the longest tenure as the governor of South Dakota: sixteen years in office. Janklow had the third-longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,851 days.

Janklow served as the 25th Attorney General of South Dakota from 1975 to 1979 before serving as the state&#x27;s 27th Governor from 1979 to 1987 and then the 30th Governor from 1995 to 2003. Janklow was then elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for a little more than a year. He resigned in 2004 after being convicted of manslaughter for his culpability in a fatal automobile crash.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Janklow was born in Chicago, Illinois. When Janklow was 10 years old his father died of a heart attack while working as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials in Germany. His mother moved the family back to the United States, and in 1954 when Janklow was 15, they settled in her home town of Flandreau, South Dakota.

In 1955, Janklow&#x27;s repeated acts of juvenile delinquency landed him in court. A judge gave him two options—reform school or the military. Janklow dropped out of high school and joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1956. He attended basic training at Camp Pendleton, California. He was then trained as a personnel clerk and assigned to the 3rd Marine Division at Camp Kinser, Okinawa. He was part of the Marine contingent that participated in the U.S. response to the 1958 Quemoy-Matsu international crisis. Janklow was shot in the leg while he was part of a detachment that was delivering cannons to Taiwanese troops, and received an honorable discharge as a private first class in 1959. In 1999, the government of Taiwan presented Janklow the 823 Badge of Honor, an award created to commemorate the Quemoy-Matsu conflict, which began on August 23, 1958.

After leaving the Marines, Janklow began attendance at the University of South Dakota. When administrators discovered he lacked a high school diploma, Janklow convinced them to let him remain at the university if he maintained good grades. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration.

==Legal career==
Janklow went on to earn a J.D. at the University of South Dakota School of Law in 1966. He then worked as Legal Services lawyer for six years on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, advancing to direct the program there. In 1973, he was appointed chief prosecutor and chief of litigation in the South Dakota Attorney General&#x27;s Office, where he &quot;quickly earned a reputation as a top trial lawyer&quot;.

===Attorney General of South Dakota===
In 1974, Janklow was the successful Republican nominee for attorney general, and he served from 1975 to 1979. Among the highlights of his term were two cases he argued before the United States Supreme Court, &quot;South Dakota v. Opperman&quot; and &quot;Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip&quot;. In &quot;Opperman&quot;, Janklow argued successfully (5 Justices to 4) that a warrantless search of a vehicle that had been impounded for a parking violation was permissible. (The South Dakota Supreme Court later suppressed the search on state constitutional grounds.) In &quot;Rosebud&quot;, Janklow successfully argued (6 Justices to 3) the legality of federal statutes which had reduced the size of the Rosebud Indian Reservation without regard to the provisions of existing treaties between the tribe and the federal government.

==First period as Governor of South Dakota==

Janklow was first elected governor in 1978. He was reelected in 1982 with nearly 71 percent of the vote, the highest percentage won by a gubernatorial candidate in the state&#x27;s history. The legislature had repealed the personal property tax the year before he took office, but did not provide a replacement revenue source. Since the personal property tax funded local governments, the legislature mandated that the state government replace the revenue. Once in office, Janklow worked with the legislature to make up the lost tax income by enacting a contractor&#x27;s excise tax and reforming the franchise tax on banks. An improved economy also helped in the state&#x27;s effort to make up the lost revenue.

In 1979 Janklow signed into law a bill reinstating capital punishment in South Dakota. Another initiative that year was to abolish the state&#x27;s Department of Environmental Protection, allegedly because of its role in efforts by the Sioux to block resource development in the Black Hills. Janklow supported passage of legislation to remove South Dakota&#x27;s limit on interest rates. This attracted banks: for instance, Citibank opened a credit card center in Sioux Falls. Several states had similar laws, overturning previous policies against high rates. Under the federal banking rules a state had to formally invite a bank into their state, and South Dakota invited Citibank before other states.

=== &quot;Reeves v. Stake&quot; ===

In 1980, Janklow argued &quot;Reeves, Inc. v. Stake&quot; before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case had been initiated while he was attorney general, and Janklow argued it because he was the attorney in South Dakota&#x27;s government who was most familiar with the details. In arguing &quot;Reeves&quot;, Janklow became the first sitting governor to argue before the Supreme Court on behalf of his state. Janklow was successful (5 to 4) in his argument that the state-owned cement plant could legally discriminate against out-of-state buyers in its pricing, which created the &quot;market participant exception&quot; to the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Dormant Commerce Clause.

=== Railroad revitalization ===
When the Milwaukee Railroad went into bankruptcy, Janklow called a special session of the legislature on the issue. The state purchased the main line of the defunct railroad. The state leased its property to the Burlington Northern, thereby preserving critical railway shipping of commodities for much of the state. Janklow increased accessibility for the disabled to public and private facilities in state. 

===U.S. Senate challenge===
Barred by state law from running again in 1986, Janklow challenged the incumbent U.S. Senator James Abdnor in the Republican primary. Janklow lost, with Abdnor winning by a 55 percent to 45 percent margin. The primary battle was considered to weaken Abdnor, contributing to the latter&#x27;s loss in the general election to Democrat Tom Daschle, then South Dakota&#x27;s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 

==Second period as Governor of South Dakota==
Janklow returned to politics in 1994, when he defeated incumbent Walter Dale Miller in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He was handily elected that year and was reelected in 1998. In his second two terms, he cut property taxes for homeowners and farmers by 30 percent, but was able to make up the revenue loss caused by the voters&#x27; repealing the inheritance tax. Janklow is the longest-serving governor in South Dakota history. He was at the time the only person in the state&#x27;s history to serve eight full years as governor, which he did twice. Since then, his record has been equaled by Mike Rounds, who served two full terms as governor from 2003 to 2011, and Dennis Daugaard, who served from 2011 to 2019.

===Pardons===
The Associated Press, in conjunction with the Sioux Falls newspaper &quot;Argus Leader&quot;, filed a request to obtain information on pardons granted by Janklow between 1995 and 2002 per state law that requires the release of records classified as public by the legislature when requested by an entity. Reporters found that the pardons did not follow the statutory process, which requires pardons to be reviewed by an independent commission. Among Janklow&#x27;s pardons was one for his son-in-law for convictions for drunk driving and marijuana possession.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2002, Janklow ran for the Republican nomination for South Dakota&#x27;s only House seat. He defeated the Democratic candidate, Stephanie Herseth, an attorney, by a vote of 180,023 (53%) to 153,656 (46%).

===Vehicular manslaughter===

On August 16, 2003, Janklow was involved in a fatal traffic collision while driving his car, when he failed to stop at an intersection near Trent, South Dakota. Janklow ran through a stop sign, and collided with motorcyclist Randy Scott. Scott, a 55-year-old Minnesotan, was thrown from his motorcycle and killed instantly. Janklow&#x27;s vehicle traveled 300 feet beyond the point of impact and hit a sign in a field. He suffered a broken hand and bleeding on the brain. In the ensuing investigation, officials determined Janklow was driving at least 70 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone and that he ran a stop sign at the intersection where the crash occurred.

Janklow was arraigned on August 29, and said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t be sorrier&quot; for the crash. His trial began on December 1. In his defense, his lawyer said that he suffered a bout of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and was &quot;confused&quot; and &quot;mixed up&quot;. Janklow testified that he had taken an insulin shot the morning of the crash and had not eaten anything throughout the day. Medical witnesses said this could result in low blood sugar, which might cause disorientation.

Robert O&#x27;Shea, an accident reconstruction expert, testified that he estimated the Congressman&#x27;s speed to be 63 or 64 miles per hour at the time of impact, judging from details from the electronic data recorder of the Cadillac and &quot;his own analysis&quot;. The State Highway Patrol investigator had said in testimony that he estimated Janklow&#x27;s speed as &quot;at least 70 mph&quot;. From his analysis, O&#x27;Shea said Scott&#x27;s motorcycle&#x27;s speed may have been as much as 65 mph; this was in contrast to the Highway Patrol&#x27;s estimate of 59.

Most of Janklow&#x27;s previous driving record was suppressed at the trial, but the superintendent of the state highway patrol reported publicly that Janklow had 16 traffic stops during his last term as governor for which he was not ticketed, out of both &quot;respect for his authority&quot; and a &quot;fear of retribution&quot;. From 1990 to 1994, Janklow had 12 speeding tickets, with fines totaling $1000. Two troopers were allowed to testify that they had stopped Janklow for speed in excess of 80 miles per hour while driving on rural roads, but had opted to issue him written warnings rather than traffic citations.

On December 8, 2003, Janklow was convicted by a Moody County jury of second-degree manslaughter, a felony, as well as the misdemeanors of speeding, running a stop sign, and reckless driving. A month later, he resigned his seat in Congress effective January 20, 2004. On January 22, Janklow was sentenced to spend 100 days in jail. After 30 days, he was able to leave the jail for several hours each day in order to perform community service. He was released on May 17, 2004.

Scott&#x27;s family sued Janklow for damages, but the court ruled that because Janklow was on official business at the time, he was protected from any monetary claims by the Federal Tort Claims Act, which ascribes liability to the government as opposed to the individual who is acting in a governmental capacity. In July 2006, Scott&#x27;s family filed a $25 million wrongful death suit against the U.S. government. The lawsuit was settled for $1 million on May 14, 2008.

==Controversies==
===Jancita Eagle Deer===
In 1974, a month before the election for state attorney general for which Janklow was a candidate, Jancita Eagle Deer filed a petition through her attorney Larry Leventhal and tribal advocate Dennis Banks to disbar Janklow to keep him from practicing in tribal court. According to Banks, in early 1967, Eagle Deer, then a 15-year-old Lakota schoolgirl at the Rosebud Boarding School on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, reported to her school principal that Janklow, her legal guardian and for whom she was working as a babysitter, had raped her on January 13.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), then responsible for law enforcement on the reservation, allegedly sent the police investigation case file of the rape (for which it had custody) to its Aberdeen, South Dakota office to keep it away from the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Court.

Judge Mario Gonzalez of the Rosebud Indian Reservation tribal court granted Eagle Deer&#x27;s petition to disbar Janklow from practicing law on the Rosebud Reservation. At the request of Eagle Deer&#x27;s attorneys, the tribal court &quot;issued a misdemeanor arrest warrant for Janklow based on sworn testimony on Eagle Deer&#x27;s behalf (since it was generally believed at the time that tribal courts had jurisdiction over non-Indians)&quot;, but no arrest was made. Janklow denied all allegations connected with the rape case, and no criminal charges were filed.

In 1975, Janklow was investigated by the FBI before being nominated as a candidate for appointment to the board of the Legal Services Corporation. The White House Counsel under President Gerald Ford forwarded its recommendation to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying its investigation of the rape case concluded there was insufficient evidence. Ford&#x27;s appointment of Janklow, to LSC&#x27;s board as its first president was later confirmed by the Senate.

In April 1975, Jancita Eagle Deer was killed at night in a hit-and-run collision in southern Nebraska. After her death, Jancita&#x27;s step-mother, Delphine Eagle Deer, sister of Leonard Crow Dog, advocated on the young woman&#x27;s behalf. Delphine Eagle Deer was murdered in a still-unsolved case about nine months later in 1976.

===Libel suits===
In the 1980s, Janklow filed libel suits against the author Peter Matthiessen and Viking Press for a statement included in the book &quot;In the Spirit of Crazy Horse&quot; (1983), and another suit against &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine for its coverage of the alleged rape. The publications had included statements of Dennis Banks, founder and leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM). In each case, the courts upheld the freedom of speech principle for the authors and publishers under the First Amendment. 

Matthiessen included a statement by Banks about the rape accusation, as well as allegations that during the same period, Janklow had been arrested on the Rosebud reservation for driving drunk and shooting pet dogs. Janklow, by then serving as governor, sued both the author and publisher Viking Press for libel, which delayed publication of the paperback version of the book until 1992. Janklow&#x27;s complaint, referring to the statement by Banks about rape, &quot;cited a 1975 letter from Philip Buchen, head of the Office of Counsel to the President of the United States, to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, saying that three Federal investigations found the allegations against him &#x27;simply unfounded.&#x27; The Senate committee was considering Mr. Janklow&#x27;s nomination as a director of the Legal Services Corporation...&quot;

Janklow&#x27;s suits were dismissed based on First Amendment protection of free speech. He filed a libel suit against &quot;Newsweek&quot; based on an article in the weekly&#x27;s February 21, 1983, issue that included the disputed passage by Dennis Banks. &quot;Janklow v. Newsweek Inc.&quot; (1986), was brought before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit &quot;en banc&quot; appealing the decision of the Hon. John B. Jones, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota, that &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine had not defamed Janklow. The lower court&#x27;s decision was affirmed by the appeals court, with BOWMAN, Circuit Judge, joined by ROSS and FAGG, Circuit Judges, dissenting.

==Post-political career==
After January 5, 2006 (effective February 2006), when the South Dakota Supreme Court granted his petition for early reinstatement of his license to practice law, Janklow worked as an attorney. In spring 2006, the Mayo Clinic retained him to lobby against the DM&amp;E Railroad expansion. He also represented landowners who were seeking reimbursement from the railroad for the taking of their property.

==Death and legacy==
On November 4, 2011, Janklow announced during a press conference that he had terminal brain cancer. He died at a hospice care facility in Sioux Falls on January 12, 2012, aged 72. Governor Dennis Daugaard ordered that flags across the state be flown at half staff. Janklow was buried at Sturgis, South Dakota&#x27;s Black Hills National Cemetery, Section I, Site 127.

<text>Chappelle and Stinnette Records, sometimes known as C&amp;S Records was a small independent United States record label founded in New York City around 1921.

According to the label, Chappelle and Stinnette Records were manufactured &quot;by C.&amp; S. Phonograph Record Co.&quot;, which in turn was run by the husband and wife team of Thomas E. Chappelle and Juanita Stinnette Chappelle, noted African American entertainers of the time. Chappelle and Stinnette is notable as the third record company to be owned and operated by African Americans. (After Broome Records and Black Swan Records.) All but one of the 9 known C&amp;S records feature one or both of the Chappelles singing. Clarence Williams also recorded one disc for the label.

The audio fidelity of C&amp;S records is about average for the era. It is unknown whether C&amp;S recorded their own sides or if they leased recording studio use from some other company, probably in New York City. The Chappelle and Stinnette disc records are quite rare. All of the releases on this label were blues, and all were likely recorded in 1921 or early 1922.

<doc id="302440" wikidata="Q570379" url="?curid=302440" title="Greater yellowlegs">
<text>The greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca) is a large shorebird in the family Scolopacidae. It breeds in central Canada and southern Alaska and winters in southern North America, Central America, the West Indies and South America.

==Taxonomy==
The greater yellowlegs was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax melanoleuca&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;stone snipe&quot; seen feeding in autumn in Chateau Bay, Labrador, that had been described in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The greater yellowlegs is now placed in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot; that was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin word given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet &quot;melanoleuca&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;yellow&quot; with &quot;leucos&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The greater yellowlegs is similar in appearance to the smaller lesser yellowlegs. Its closest relative, however, is the greenshank, which together with the spotted redshank form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic leg and foot colours found in the shanks, demonstrating that this character is paraphyletic. They are also the largest shanks apart from the willet, which is altogether more robustly built. The greater yellowlegs and the greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage.

Adults have long yellow legs and a long, thin, dark bill which has a slight upward curve and is longer than the head. The body is grey-brown on top and white underneath; the neck and breast are streaked with dark brown. The rump is white. It ranges in length from and in weight from . Wingspan is 23.6 in (60 cm).

The call is harsher, louder, and clearer than that of the lesser yellowlegs. They have a three-syllable whistle when flight-calling, with a lower pitched third syllable.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is bogs and marshes in the boreal forest region of Canada and Alaska. They migrate to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, the Caribbean, and south to South America. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
They nest on the ground, usually in well-hidden locations near water. The three to four eggs average in length and in breadth and weigh about . The incubation period is 23 days. The young leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching and then leave the vicinity of the nest within two days.

===Food and feeding===

These birds forage in shallow water, sometimes using their bills to stir up the water. They mainly eat insects and small fish, as well as crustaceans, marine worms, frogs, seeds and berries.

<text>A regular &quot;hexagram&quot;, [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).

A hexagram (Greek) or sexagram (Latin) is a six-pointed geometric star figure with the Schläfli symbol {6/2}, 2{3}, or . The term is used to refer to a compound figure of two equilateral triangles. The intersection is a regular hexagon.

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional simplices. In three dimensions, the analogous compound is the stellated octahedron, and in four dimensions the compound of two 5-cells is obtained.

It has been historically used in various religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs. The symbol was used as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches and Jewish synagogues. In the medieval period, a Muslim mystical symbol known as the Seal of Solomon was depicted as either a hexagram or pentagram.

==Group theory==
In mathematics, the root system for the simple Lie group G2 is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.
== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a regular hexagon, can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle&#x27;s circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==

A regular hexagram can be constructed by orthographically projecting any cube onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex. The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram. For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions formula_1 onto the plane formula_2. The midpoints are formula_3, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries. These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
As a derivative of two overlapping triangles, the hexagram may have developed from different peoples with no direct correlation to one another.

The mandala symbol called yantra, found on ancient South Indian Hindu temples, is a geometric toolset that incorporates hexagrams into its framework. It symbolizes the nara-narayana, or perfect meditative state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in &quot;moksha,&quot; or &quot;nirvana&quot; (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the astrological chart at the time of David&#x27;s birth or anointment as king. The hexagram is also known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Star&quot; in astrological circles.

In antique papyri, pentagrams, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on amulets bearing the Jewish names of God, and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the Greek Magical Papyri (Wessely, l.c. pp. 31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Religious usage==
===Indian religions ===

Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The reasons behind this symbol&#x27;s common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called &quot;Om&quot; and the &quot;Hrim&quot; in Sanskrit, and symbolize man&#x27;s position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes Shakti, the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes Shiva, or Agni Tattva, representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as &#x27;Shanmukha&#x27;—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti&#x27;s progeny Kartikeya. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.
In Buddhism, some old versions of the Bardo Thodol, also known as The &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, contain a hexagram with a swastika inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the &quot;origin of phenomenon&quot; (&quot;chos-kyi &#x27;byung-gnas&quot;). It is especially connected with Vajrayogini, and forms the center part of her mandala. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The &quot;Shatkona&quot; is a symbol used in Hindu yantra that represents the union of both the masculine and feminine form. More specifically it is supposed to represent Purusha (the supreme being), and Prakriti (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as Shiva – Shakti.

&quot;Anahata&quot; or heart chakra is the fourth primary chakra, according to Hindu Yogic, Shakta and Buddhist Tantric traditions. In Sanskrit, &quot;anahata&quot; means &quot;unhurt, unstruck, and unbeaten&quot;. &quot;Anahata Nad&quot; refers to the Vedic concept of &quot;unstruck sound&quot; (the sound of the celestial realm). Anahata is associated with balance, calmness, and serenity.

===Judaism===
The Seal of Solomon or Ring of Solomon is the legendary signet ring attributed to king Solomon in medieval mystical traditions. In mystic Jewish and Islamic lore, the ring is variously described as having given Solomon the power to command the supernatural, including shedim and jinn, and also the ability to speak with animals. Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon, it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman, or a symbol or character in medieval magic and Renaissance magic, occultism, and alchemy. The seal is the predecessor to the Star of David, another Jewish symbol.
The &quot;Magen David&quot; is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or &quot;Star of David.&quot; Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.

===Christianity===
The first and the most important Armenian Cathedral of Etchmiadzin (303 AD, built by the founder of Christianity in Armenia) is decorated with many types of ornamented hexagrams and so is the tomb of an Armenian prince of the Hasan-Jalalyan dynasty of Khachen (1214 AD) in the Gandzasar Church of Artsakh.

The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity, it is sometimes called the star of creation. A very early example, noted by Nikolaus Pevsner, can be found in Winchester Cathedral, England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.

====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
The Star of David is also used less prominently by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the Tribes of Israel and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

===Islam===
The symbol is known in Arabic as &quot;Khātem Sulaymān&quot; (Seal of Solomon; ) or &quot;Najmat Dāwūd&quot; (Star of David; ). The &quot;Seal of Solomon&quot; may also be represented by a five-pointed star or pentagram.

In the Qur&#x27;an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, &quot;Suliman&quot; or &quot;Sulayman&quot;) were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman Hanafi Anatolian beyliks of the Karamanids and Jandarids used the star on their flag. The symbol is also used on the Hayreddin Barbarossa flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in mosques and on other Arabic and Islamic artifacts.

==Usage in heraldry==
In heraldry and vexillology, a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a &quot;star.&quot; In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a &quot;mullet of six points,&quot; where &quot;mullet&quot; is a French term for a spur rowel which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In Albanian heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since classical antiquity and it is commonly referred to as &quot;sixagram&quot;. The coat of arms of the House of Kastrioti depicts the hexagram on a pile argent over the double headed eagle.

==Usage in Theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the Theosophical Society (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the Swastika, the Ankh, the Aum, and the Ouroboros. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon, which was its original name, being in regular use until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the pentagram, was and is used in practices of the occult and ceremonial magic and is attributed to the 7 &quot;old&quot; planets outlined in astrology.

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a talisman and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of occult magic. In the book The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2, the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon. Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.

Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Combining the symbols of fire and water creates a hexagram (six-pointed star). The same follows when combining the symbols of air and earth. Both hexagrams combined are called a double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.

In Rosicrucian and Hermetic Magic, the seven Traditional planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the Sephiroth and on the Tree of Life. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of Binah, within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of Daath.

In alchemy, the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water.

The hexagram is used as a sign for quintessence, the fifth element.

==Usage in Freemasonry==

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many Masonic temples as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of King Solomon&#x27;s temple, from which Freemasons are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* The Indian sage and seer Sri Aurobindo used it—e.g. on the cover of his books—as a symbol of the aspiration of humanity calling to the Divine to descend into life (the triangle with the point at the top), and the descent of the Divine into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and all individuals in response to that calling (the triangle with the point at the bottom). (This was explained by the Mother, his spiritual partner in Her 14-volume Agenda and elsewhere by Sri Aurobindo in his writings.)
* The seal of the city of Portland, Oregon features a small six point star above the head of Lady Commerce. The star represents the &quot;crown achievement of Portland&#x27;s historical leadership.&quot;

<doc id="302444" wikidata="Q1051297" url="?curid=302444" title="Subaru Corporation">
<text>, formerly , is a Japanese multinational corporation and conglomerate primarily involved in both terrestrial and aerospace transportation manufacturing. It is best known for its line of Subaru automobiles. Founded in 1953, the company was named Fuji Heavy Industries until 2017. The company&#x27;s aerospace division is a defense contractor to the Japanese government, manufacturing Boeing and Lockheed Martin helicopters and airplanes under license. This same division is a global development and manufacturing partner to both companies.

==History==
Fuji Heavy Industries traces its roots to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, a leading supplier of airplanes to the Japanese government during World War II. At the end of World War II, Nakajima was broken up by the Allied Occupation government under &quot;keiretsu&quot; legislation, and by 1950 part of the separated operation was already known as Fuji Heavy Industries.

FHI was incorporated on July 15, 1953, when five Japanese companies, known as Fuji Kogyo, Fuji Jidosha Kogyo, Omiya Fuji Kogyo, Utsunomiya Sharyo, and Tokyo Fuji Sangyo, joined to form one of Japan&#x27;s largest manufacturers of transportation equipment.

By late 1980s, the company was a major supplier of military, aerospace and railroad equipment in Japan, but 80% of its sales came from automobiles. Sales in 1989 fell 15% to US$4.3 billion. In 1990, the company faced a loss of over US$500 million. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., the main bank of the company, asked Nissan Motor, which owned 4.2% of the company, to step in. Nissan sent Isamu Kawai, the president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., to take charge of FHI. In 1991, FHI started contract-manufacturing Nissan Pulsar (Nissan Sunny in Europe) sedans and hatchbacks.

Currently, the Subaru Corporation makes Subaru brand cars, and its aerospace division makes utility and attack helicopters for the Japanese Self Defense Force, trainers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and the center wings of Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 jets. In the past, FHI made parts for the Hawker Beechcraft and Eclipse Aviation business jets.

In 2003, the company adopted the logo of its Subaru automobile division as its worldwide corporate symbol.

On October 5, 2005 Toyota purchased 8.7% of FHI shares from General Motors, which had owned 20.1% since 1999. GM later divested its remaining 11.4% stake on the open market to sever all ties with FHI. FHI previously stated there might have been 27 million shares (3.4%) acquired before the start of trading by an unknown party on October 6, 2005, and speculation suggested a bank or perhaps another automaker was involved. After the purchase, Toyota announced a contract with Subaru on March 13, 2006, to use the underutilized Subaru manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana, as well as plans to hire up to 1,000 workers and set aside an assembly line for the Camry, beginning in the second quarter of 2007.

In June 2014, the company entered into a contract with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, as one of five major Japanese companies contracted, to build parts for Boeing&#x27;s 777X aircraft.

In May 2016, Fuji Heavy Industries announced that it would change its name to Subaru Corporation, with the change effective on April 1, 2017.

==Divisions==
Subaru has two main divisions:
* The automobile division, Subaru.
* The aerospace division is a contractor for the Japan Defense Agency and markets and sells both commercial and defense-related aircraft, helicopters and target drones. It will also be responsible for providing maintenance for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft. This division previously built the FA-200 Aero Subaru and is currently participating in the Airbus A380, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Hawker 4000 and Eclipse 500 programs, and supplies parts for the Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 767.

==Former divisions==
* Subaru discontinued the production of buses and railroad cars in 2003.
* The eco technology division manufactured and sold garbage trucks, robot sweepers, and wind turbines.
* Discontinued in 2017, the Subaru Industrial Power Products division manufactured and sold commercial engines, pumps and generators which were formerly under the Subaru-Robin and Robin brands. Subaru&#x27;s industrial products division, began manufacturing &quot;Star&quot; engines for Polaris Industries snowmobiles in 1968 but engine manufacturing operations ended in 1998 when Polaris Industries started to build their own Liberty two-stroke engines. Subaru remains an invested partner with, and supplier of pistons to, Polaris. Subaru has provided more than 2 million engines used in Polaris snowmobiles, ATVs, watercraft and utility vehicles.

<text>Stylistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the study and interpretation of texts of all types, but particularly literary texts, and spoken language with regard to their linguistic and tonal style, where style is the particular variety of language used by different individuals in different situations and settings. For example, the vernacular, or everyday language, may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to grammar, pronunciation or accent, and lexicon or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and résumé and while speaking during a job interview.

As a discipline, stylistics links literary criticism to linguistics. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics. Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from advertising copy to news, non-fiction, and popular culture, as well as to political and religious discourse. Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics, multimodal stylistics and mediated stylistics has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as &#x27;a point on a cline rather than as an absolute&#x27;.

Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of genre, the study of folk art, in the study of spoken dialects and registers, and can be applied to areas such as discourse analysis as well as literary criticism.

Plain language has different features.
Common stylistic features are using dialogue, regional accents and individual idioms (or idiolects). Stylistically, also sentence length prevalence and language register use.

==Early twentieth century==
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of classical rhetoric, though modern stylistics has its roots in Russian Formalism and the related Prague School of the early twentieth century.

In 1909, Charles Bally proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement Saussurean linguistics. For Bally, Saussure&#x27;s linguistics by itself couldn&#x27;t fully describe the language of personal expression. Bally&#x27;s programme fits well with the aims of the Prague School.

Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of &quot;foregrounding&quot;, where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of &quot; deviation&quot; (from the norms of everyday language) or &quot;parallelism&quot;. According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn&#x27;t constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.

==Late twentieth century==
Roman Jakobson had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American New Criticism in his &quot;Closing Statement&quot; at a conference on stylistics at Indiana University in 1958. Published as &quot;Linguistics and Poetics&quot; in 1960, Jakobson&#x27;s lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics. The &quot;poetic function&quot; was one of six general functions of language he described in the lecture.

Michael Halliday is an important figure in the development of British stylistics. His 1971 study &quot;Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding&#x27;s The Inheritors&quot; is a key essay. One of Halliday&#x27;s contributions has been the use of the term register to explain the connections between language and its context. For Halliday register is distinct from dialect. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user, choices which depend on three variables: &quot;field&quot; (&quot;what the participants... are actually engaged in doing&quot;, for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic), &quot;tenor&quot; (who is taking part in the exchange) and &quot;mode&quot; (the use to which the language is being put).

Fowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of vocabulary (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist David Crystal points out that Halliday&#x27;s &#x27;tenor&#x27; stands as a roughly equivalent term for &#x27;style&#x27;, which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday&#x27;s third category, &quot;mode&quot;, is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist William Downes makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).

==Literary stylistics==
In &quot;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language&quot;, Crystal observes that, in practice, most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and &#x27;valued&#x27; language within literature, i.e. &#x27;literary stylistics&#x27;. He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of literary language, for instance, its &#x27;deviant&#x27; and abnormal features, rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses. For example, the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the stylistician than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal. 1987, 71).

===Poetry===
As well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional – the most obvious of which is poetry. In &quot;Practical Stylistics&quot;, HG Widdowson examines the traditional form of the epitaph, as found on headstones in a cemetery. For example:&lt;br&gt;
:His memory is dear today
:As in the hour he passed away.
:(Ernest C. Draper &#x27;Ern&#x27;. Died 4.1.38)
:(Widdowson. 1992, 6)

Widdowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as &#x27;crude verbal carvings&#x27; and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson, 3). Nevertheless, Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member. However, what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic phraseology but in where it appears. The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed. Widdowson suggests that, unlike words set in stone in a graveyard, poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with inter-textual implications (Widdowson. 1992, 4).

Two problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by PM Wetherill in &quot;Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods&quot;. The first is that there may be an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).

===Implicature===
In &#x27;Poetic Effects&#x27; from &quot;Literary Pragmatics&quot;, the linguist Adrian Pilkington analyses the idea of &#x27;implicature&#x27;, as instigated in the previous work of Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson. Implicature may be divided into two categories: &#x27;strong&#x27; and &#x27;weak&#x27; implicature, yet between the two extremes there are a variety of other alternatives. The strongest implicature is what is emphatically implied by the speaker or writer, while weaker implicatures are the wider possibilities of meaning that the hearer or reader may conclude.

Pilkington&#x27;s &#x27;poetic effects&#x27;, as he terms the concept, are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply &#x27;read in&#x27; by the hearer or reader. Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or reader&#x27;s conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective. As Pilkington says: &#x27;there is no clear cut-off point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearer&#x27;s responsibility.&#x27; (Pilkington. 1991, 53) In addition, the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkington&#x27;s poetic effects in understanding a poem&#x27;s meaning.

===Tense===
Widdowson points out that in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1798), the mystery of the Mariner&#x27;s abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense. (Widdowson. 1992, 40) For instance, the Mariner &#x27;holds&#x27; the wedding-guest with his &#x27;skinny hand&#x27; in the present tense, but releases it in the past tense (&#x27;...his hands dropt he.&#x27;); only to hold him again, this time with his &#x27;glittering eye&#x27;, in the present (Widdowson. 1992, 41).

===The point of poetry===
Widdowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised, it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations, such as &#x27;nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes&#x27;, and so on (Widdowson. 1992, 9). But to say:&lt;br&gt;
:Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
:So do our minutes hasten to their end ...
:William Shakespeare, &#x27;60&#x27;.
Or, indeed:&lt;br&gt;
:Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
:Nor hours, days months, which are the rags of time ...
:John Donne, &#x27;The Sun Rising&#x27;, &quot;Poems&quot; (1633)
This language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson. 1992, 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like &#x27;love&#x27;, &#x27;heart&#x27; and &#x27;soul&#x27; to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (Widdowson. 1992, 76).

<text>Peter Miguel Camejo Guanche (December 31, 1939 – September 13, 2008) was a Venezuelan American author, activist, politician and Sailing Olympian. In the 2004 United States presidential election, he was selected by independent candidate Ralph Nader as his vice-presidential running mate on a ticket which had the endorsement of the Reform Party.

Camejo was a three-time Green Party gubernatorial candidate in California, most recently in 2006, when he received 2.3 percent of the vote. Camejo also ran in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election finishing fourth in a field of 135 candidates (2.8%), and in 2002, finishing third with 5.3%. In the 1976 presidential election he ran for the Socialist Workers Party, receiving 90,310 votes.

==Early life==
Camejo was a first-generation American of Venezuelan descent. At the time of his birth, his mother was residing in the Queens borough of New York City. Although Camejo spent most of his early childhood in Venezuela, he was a &quot;natural born citizen&quot; of the United States and therefore constitutionally eligible for the U.S. Presidency later in life.

His parents, Elvia Guanche and Dr. Daniel Camejo Octavio, divorced when their son was seven. Camejo then resided with his mother in the United States and returned to Venezuela during summer holidays to visit family. In later youth Camejo showed talent as a yachtsman, competing in 1960 for Venezuela at the Rome Olympics with his father in the Star class, where they took 21st place.

Camejo entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, involving himself in soccer and, increasingly, left-wing politics. Later he studied history at the University of California, Berkeley, where he won election to student council. His participation in a protest of the Vietnam War in 1967 led to his suspension from the university for &quot;using an unauthorized microphone.&quot; Then-governor Ronald Reagan deemed Camejo one of California&#x27;s ten most dangerous citizens due to his presence at anti-war protests. He also participated in one of the Selma civil rights marches.

==Politics==
Initially, Camejo was a member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a Trotskyist party. As a branch organizer, he sought to reorient the SWP towards the student movement.
Camejo&#x27;s first political campaign on behalf of the SWP came in 1967 when as a 27-year old he ran for mayor Berkeley, California. He was the SWP&#x27;s nominee for President in 1976 and won 90,986 votes, or 0.1%.

While a member of the Socialist Workers Party, Camejo wrote &quot;Racism, Revolution, Reaction, 1861-1877. The Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction,&quot; published by the party&#x27;s publishing house, Pathfinder Press. He also met with J. Posadas.

The SWP&#x27;s policy was to turn its members into &quot;proletarians&quot; by having them take jobs in factories and advocate for a worker-based class struggle. By 1980, Camejo came to disagree with this policy in favor of democratic socialism, and the SWP expelled him. He led the third dissident group of the SWP and formed North Star Network in 1983.

In 1992 Camejo committed $20,000 of his own money toward establishing the Progressive Alliance of Alameda County, an organizational effort that did not sustain itself.

Camejo was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a watermelon—green on the outside but red on the inside.

However, in January 2004 Camejo initiated the Avocado Declaration which compares Greens, to avocados. &quot;An avocado is Green on the outside and Green on the inside.&quot;

Just over a month after the 2004 election, Camejo was elected as one of California&#x27;s delegates to the National Committee of the Green Party and established the GDI, &quot;Greens for Democracy and Independence,&quot; a cadre group within the larger Green Party of California that ran candidates for local Green County Councils. At the 2005 Green Party National Convention, Camejo stated that he would not be a candidate for President in 2008.

Camejo wrote a number of articles concerning the divisions evident in the Green Party in the aftermath of the turbulent 2004 national convention, continuing the themes of the Avocado Declaration in opposing attempts to &quot;cozy up&quot; to the newly formed Progressive Democrats of America.

In August 2008 he attended the convention of the Peace and Freedom Party in order to personally endorse Nader&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==

Camejo ran for Governor of California three times, against incumbent governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2002 and 2006, and in the 2003 recall election in which Schwarzenegger replaced Davis as governor.

===2002 gubernatorial election===
In 2002, Camejo ran uncontested in the California Green Party gubernatorial primary. In the general election, he ran as part of the first full slate of Green candidates for all seven of California&#x27;s partisan constitutional offices. Camejo lost the election to Governor Gray Davis, but he polled 393,036 votes, for 5.3% of the vote, the largest vote total for a third-party in the California governor&#x27;s race since 1946, when Henry R. Schmidt of the Prohibition Party polled 7.1%. Because the San Francisco Green Party endorsed him, Camejo earned more votes in San Francisco than Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon, a rarity in third-party politics.

===2003 gubernatorial recall election===
In 2003, he was the endorsed Green Party candidate for governor (although several other Greens appeared on the ballot) in an unprecedented California recall election against Gray Davis, in which he polled 242,247 votes for 2.8%, coming in fourth in a field of 135 certified candidates. In a strange preview of the divisions about to erupt on the left in the following year, Camejo first cooperated with, and then competed with, fellow recall candidate Arianna Huffington.

===2006 gubernatorial election===
In 2006, Camejo made his third bid for Governor of California against incumbent Arnold Schwarzenegger and Democratic Party nominee Phil Angelides. Camejo received 193,553 votes, or 2.3% of the popular vote.

Peter Daniels criticized Camejo for &quot;lending his support to the right-wing effort to depose California governor Gray Davis&quot; by recall in 2004. However, the Green Party state convention easily voted to endorse Camejo as a recall replacement candidate.

==2004 vice-presidential campaign==
Camejo was submitted as a candidate in the Green Party of California&#x27;s March 2, 2004, Presidential Preference Primary. Before the primary, he made it known that he was not planning to run for president and that any delegates pledged to him would not be committed to vote for him after the first round. The former gubernatorial candidate received 33,753 votes (75.9%) of the Green Party membership&#x27;s support in California, and 72.7% of the votes in all Green Party primary elections.

In June 2004, Camejo campaigned for the vice-presidential spot beside two-time Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader as independents (i.e. Nader never actually joined the Green Party), running against whoever the Green Party nominee might be. They received the endorsement of the Reform Party, which gave them ballot access in several states they would not otherwise have. With votes for Nader added in, the Nader/Camejo ticket had what appeared to be an insurmountable 83% of Green voters behind their candidacies going into the Green Party National Convention in Milwaukee. However many delegates were alienated by non-Green Party member Ralph Nader&#x27;s wanting the party&#x27;s hard-won ballot lines, and by Camejo&#x27;s maneuver serving as a proxy for Nader in California. After an extremely contentious proceeding the convention nominated Green Party members David Cobb and Pat LaMarche for the Green Party ticket instead. Rejected by the Greens, Nader and Camejo continued their campaign as independent candidates.

Both Nader and Camejo asserted that one of the main reason they ran in the 2004 election was because there were no other national candidates demanding an immediate withdrawal of American troops from what they believe is an immoral and unconstitutionally pursued War in Iraq (though minor party national candidates Green David Cobb, Libertarian Michael Badnarik, Constitution Party candidate Michael Peroutka, Socialist Party USA candidate Walt Brown and Socialist Workers Party candidate Róger Calero all strongly opposed the war). The Nader/Camejo were the only candidates who had a regular voice in the mainstream media arguing for withdrawal, since Ralph Nader was regularly invited to appear on mainstream news, and none of the other candidates received mainstream media coverage.

The Nader/Camejo ticket came in a very distant third in the election, polling approximately 460,000 votes, or 0.4% of the vote. Camejo&#x27;s supporters claimed this result vindicated the Nader/Camejo team seeking the Green Party&#x27;s endorsement (of them as non-Green Party candidates) since Cobb/LaMarche received less than one third that many votes with a total of 119,859 votes (0.1%). This was a drop of 95% compared to the Green Party&#x27;s 2000 national ticket of Nader and his running mate Winona LaDuke. Camejo supporter&#x27;s claimed that the difference between these outcomes was made up by Nader/Camejo having four-to-one support compared to Cobb/LaMarche within the Green Party. Camejo&#x27;s experiences on the 2004 campaign are chronicled in Jurgen Vsych&#x27;s book, &quot;What Was Ralph Nader Thinking?&quot;

The Nader/Camejo Campaign cooperated loosely with an effort by the Green Party Cobb/LaMarche and Libertarian Party Badnarik/Campagna campaigns to do hand recounts across the country in states where vulnerable electronic voting machines had been used and anomalous results were questioned. Nader/Camejo undertook a challenge to the results in New Hampshire.

==Writings==
Camejo is the author of &quot;The SRI Advantage: Why Socially Responsible Investing Has Outperformed Financially.&quot;

At the time of his death, Camejo was engaged in writing &quot;North Star: A Memoir,&quot; published in May 2010 by Haymarket Books.

==Conflict within the Green Party==
In the run-up to the June 6, 2006, primary elections in California, Camejo helped create a cadre group within the larger Green Party of California, the Green IDEA (later known as IDEA PAC), a California political action committee espousing &quot;Independence, Democracy, Empowerment, and Accountability,&quot; to support candidates for county councils, the locally elected leadership bodies of the Green Party of California. The IDEA PAC was not raising or spending money as of 2010.

==Personal life==
Camejo died of lymphoma on September 13, 2008, at his home in Folsom, California. He was survived by his wife, Morella Camejo; stepdaughter Alexandra Baquero, stepson Victor Baquero, and brothers Antonio and Daniel Camejo and Danny Ratner. He last worked as the Chief Executive Officer of Progressive Asset Management, a financial investment firm that encourages socially responsible projects.

<doc id="302449" wikidata="Q1516957" url="?curid=302449" title="House of Keys">
<text>The House of Keys () is the directly elected lower house of Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man, the other branch being the Legislative Council.

== History ==

The oldest known reference to the name is in a document of 1417, written in Latin by an English scholar, which refers to (the &#x27;Keys of Mann&#x27;) and (the &#x27;Keys of Law&#x27;). There is a dispute, however, over the origin of the name. The word &quot;keys&quot; is thought by some to be an English corruption of a form of the Norse verb (&#x27;to choose&#x27;). However, a more likely explanation is that it is a mishearing of the Manx-language term for &#x27;four and twenty&#x27;: , the House having always had 24 members. The Manx-language name of the House remains (&#x27;The Four and Twenty&#x27;).

== Governance ==
Members are known as &quot;Members of the House of Keys&quot; (MHKs). Citizens over the age of 16 may vote, while one must be at least 18 years old and a resident of the island for three years to be elected an MHK. There are 12 constituencies, mainly based on the sheadings and on local government units. (A few local government units are split between two constituencies.) Each sends two members to the House of Keys, elected by plurality voting (each elector can vote for up to two candidates). The term of the House of Keys is normally fixed at five years, but provisions exist for dissolution before the expiration of the term.

The Speaker of the House of Keys (SHK) is an MHK elected by the Keys as the presiding officer. The Speaker votes in the House of Keys, but, unlike other members, may abstain; however, when the vote is tied the Speaker must cast the deciding vote. The Speaker also acts as Deputy President of Tynwald Court.

The House of Keys elects 8 of the 11 members of the Legislative Council. Legislation does not usually originate in the council. (There are exceptions: for example the Equality Bill was introduced in the Legislative Council in late 2016.) Thus, the Keys have much more power than the council, which performs the function of a revising chamber.

The House of Keys meets about once each month together with the Legislative Council in a joint session called &quot;Tynwald Court&quot;. During the COVID pandemic, these meetings were more frequent. The President of Tynwald, elected by both branches, presides over Tynwald Court and over the Legislative Council. Once each year, however, on Tynwald Day, the Isle of Man&#x27;s national day, the Lieutenant Governor (or a member of the Royal Family) presides.

== Meeting place ==
The House of Keys usually meets in their chamber in the Legislative Buildings in Douglas. Seating is allocated in alphabetical order by constituency name (in English) and organised into two rows. Members who received the highest number of votes in their constituency sit in the front row. On 14 March 2017 the Keys met in the Old House of Keys in Castletown, for the first time since 1874, to commemorate the sesquicentenary of the first elected House of Keys. During the COVID pandemic, these meetings were sometimes held remotely (or partly remotely).

<text>Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly.
More than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure, the greater the risk. As of 2013, about 125 million people worldwide have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Asbestos exposure and the onset of cancer are generally separated by about 40 years. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer.
Prevention focuses on reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States.
In 2015, about 60,800 people had mesothelioma, and 32,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in Japan. It occurs in about 3,000 people per year in the United States. It occurs more often in males than females. Rates of disease have increased since the 1950s. Diagnosis typically occurs after the age of 65 and most deaths occur around 70 years old. The disease was rare before the commercial use of asbestos.
==Signs and symptoms==

===Lungs===
Symptoms or signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 20 to 50 years (or more) after exposure to asbestos. Shortness of breath, cough, and pain in the chest due to an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) are often symptoms of pleural mesothelioma.

Mesothelioma that affects the pleura can cause these signs and symptoms:
* Chest wall pain
* Pleural effusion, or fluid surrounding the lung
* Shortness of breath – which could be due to a collapsed lung or the pleural effusion
* Fatigue or anemia
* Wheezing, hoarseness, or a cough
* Blood in the sputum (fluid) coughed up (hemoptysis)

In severe cases, the person may have many tumor masses. The individual may develop a pneumothorax, or collapse of the lung. The disease may metastasize, or spread to other parts of the body.

===Abdomen===
The most common symptoms of peritoneal mesothelioma are abdominal swelling and
pain due to ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity). Other features may include weight loss, fever, night sweats, poor appetite, vomiting, constipation, and umbilical hernia. If the cancer has spread beyond the mesothelium to other parts of the body, symptoms may include pain, trouble swallowing, or swelling of the neck or face. These symptoms may be caused by mesothelioma or by other, less serious conditions.

Tumors that affect the abdominal cavity often do not cause symptoms until they are at a late stage. Symptoms include:
* Abdominal pain
* Ascites, or an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen
* A mass in the abdomen
* Problems with bowel function
* Weight loss

===Heart===
Pericardial mesothelioma is not well characterized, but observed cases have included cardiac symptoms, specifically constrictive pericarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac tamponade. They have also included nonspecific symptoms, including substernal chest pain, orthopnea (shortness of breath when lying flat), and cough. These symptoms are caused by the tumor encasing or infiltrating the heart.

===End-stage===
In severe cases of the disease, the following signs and symptoms may be present:
* Blood clots in the veins, which may cause thrombophlebitis
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation, a disorder causing severe bleeding in many body organs
* Jaundice, or yellowing of the eyes and skin
* Low blood sugar
* Pleural effusion
* Pulmonary embolism, or blood clots in the arteries of the lungs
* Severe ascites
If a mesothelioma forms metastases, these most commonly involve the liver, adrenal gland, kidney, or other lung.

==Causes==
Working with asbestos is the most common risk factor for mesothelioma. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. Tentative evidence also raises concern about carbon nanotubes.

===Asbestos===
The incidence of mesothelioma has been found to be higher in populations living near naturally occurring asbestos. People can be exposed to naturally occurring asbestos in areas where mining or road construction is occurring, or when the asbestos-containing rock is naturally weathered. Another common route of exposure is through asbestos-containing soil, which is used to whitewash, plaster, and roof houses in Greece. In central Cappadocia, Turkey, mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths in three small villages—Tuzköy, Karain, and Sarıhıdır. Initially, this was attributed to erionite. Environmental exposure to asbestos has caused mesothelioma in places other than Turkey, including Corsica, Greece, Cyprus, China, and California. In the northern Greek mountain town of Metsovo, this exposure had resulted in mesothelioma incidence around 300 times more than expected in asbestos-free populations, and was associated with very frequent pleural calcification known as Metsovo lung.

The documented presence of asbestos fibers in water supplies and food products has fostered concerns about the possible impact of long-term and, as yet, unknown exposure of the general population to these fibers.

Exposure to talc is also a risk factor for mesothelioma; exposure can affect those who live near talc mines, work in talc mines, or work in talc mills.

In the United States, asbestos is considered the major cause of malignant mesothelioma and has been considered &quot;indisputably&quot; associated with the development of mesothelioma. Indeed, the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma is so strong that many consider mesothelioma a &quot;signal&quot; or &quot;sentinel&quot; tumor. A history of asbestos exposure exists in most cases.

Pericardial mesothelioma may not be associated with asbestos exposure.

Asbestos was known in antiquity, but it was not mined and widely used commercially until the late 19th century. Its use greatly increased during World War II. Since the early 1940s, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos dust. Initially, the risks associated with asbestos exposure were not publicly known. However, an increased risk of developing mesothelioma was later found among naval personnel (e.g., Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard), shipyard workers, people who work in asbestos mines and mills, producers of asbestos products, workers in the heating and construction industries, and other tradespeople. Today, the official position of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is that protections and &quot;permissible exposure limits&quot; required by U.S. regulations, while adequate to prevent most asbestos-related non-malignant disease, are &quot;not&quot; adequate to prevent or protect against asbestos-related cancers such as mesothelioma. Likewise, the British Government&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) states formally that any threshold for exposure to asbestos must be at a very low level and it is widely agreed that if any such threshold does exist at all, then it cannot currently be quantified. For practical purposes, therefore, HSE assumes that no such &quot;safe&quot; threshold exists. Others have noted as well that there is no evidence of a threshold level below which there is no risk of mesothelioma. There appears to be a linear, dose–response relationship, with increasing dose producing increasing risk of disease. Nevertheless, mesothelioma may be related to brief, low level, or indirect exposures to asbestos. The dose necessary for effect appears to be lower for asbestos-induced mesothelioma than for pulmonary asbestosis or lung cancer. Again, there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos as it relates to increased risk of mesothelioma.

The time from first exposure to onset of the disease, is between 25 and 70 years. It is virtually never less than fifteen years and peaks at 30–40 years. The duration of exposure to asbestos causing mesothelioma can be short. For example, cases of mesothelioma have been documented with only 1–3 months of exposure.

====Occupational====

Exposure to asbestos fibers has been recognized as an occupational health hazard since the early 20th century. Numerous epidemiological studies have associated occupational exposure to asbestos with the development of pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung and larynx, gastrointestinal tumors, and diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum. Asbestos has been widely used in many industrial products, including cement, brake linings, gaskets, roof shingles, flooring products, textiles, and insulation.

Commercial asbestos mining at Wittenoom, Western Australia, took place from 1937 to 1966. The first case of mesothelioma in the town occurred in 1960. The second case was in 1969, and new cases began to appear more frequently thereafter. The lag time between initial exposure to asbestos and the development of mesothelioma varied from 12 years 9 months up to 58 years. A cohort study of miners employed at the mine reported that 85 deaths attributable to mesothelioma had occurred by 1985. By 1994, 539 reported deaths due to mesothelioma had been reported in Western Australia.

Occupational exposure to asbestos in the United States mainly occurs when people are maintaining buildings that already have asbestos. Approximately 1.3 million US workers are exposed to asbestos annually; in 2002, an estimated 44,000 miners were potentially exposed to asbestos.

====Paraoccupational secondary exposure====

Family members and others living with asbestos workers have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma, and possibly other asbestos-related diseases. This risk may be the result of exposure to asbestos dust brought home on the clothing and hair of asbestos workers via washing a worker&#x27;s clothes or coming into contact with asbestos-contaminated work clothing. To reduce the chance of exposing family members to asbestos fibres, asbestos workers are usually required to shower and change their clothing before leaving the workplace.

====Asbestos in buildings====

Many building materials used in both public and domestic premises prior to the banning of asbestos may contain asbestos. Those performing renovation works or DIY activities may expose themselves to asbestos dust. In the UK, use of chrysotile asbestos was banned at the end of 1999. Brown and blue asbestos were banned in the UK around 1985. Buildings built or renovated prior to these dates may contain asbestos materials.

Therefore, it is a legal requirement that all who may come across asbestos in their day-to-day work have been provided with the relevant asbestos training.

===Genetic disposition===

In a recent research carried on white American population in 2012, it was found that people with a germline mutation in their BAP1 gene are at higher risk of developing mesothelioma and uveal melanoma.

===Erionite===
Erionite is a zeolite mineral with similar properties to asbestos and is known to cause mesothelioma. Detailed epidemiological investigation has shown that erionite causes mesothelioma mostly in families with a genetic predisposition. Erionite is found in deposits in the Western United States, where it is used in gravel for road surfacing, and in Turkey, where it is used to construct homes. In Turkey, the United States, and Mexico, erionite has been associated with mesothelioma and has thus been designated a &quot;known human carcinogen&quot; by the US National Toxicology Program.

===Other===
In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation of the chest or abdomen, intrapleural thorium dioxide (thorotrast) as a contrast medium, and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as erionite or talc. Some studies suggest that simian virus 40 (SV40) may act as a cofactor in the development of mesothelioma. This has been confirmed in animal studies, but studies in humans are inconclusive.

==Pathophysiology==
===Systemic===
The mesothelium consists of a single layer of flattened to cuboidal cells forming the epithelial lining of the serous cavities of the body including the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural cavities. Deposition of asbestos fibers in the parenchyma of the lung may result in the penetration of the visceral pleura from where the fiber can then be carried to the pleural surface, thus leading to the development of malignant mesothelial plaques. The processes leading to the development of peritoneal mesothelioma remain unresolved, although it has been proposed that asbestos fibers from the lung are transported to the abdomen and associated organs via the lymphatic system. Additionally, asbestos fibers may be deposited in the gut after ingestion of sputum contaminated with asbestos fibers.

Pleural contamination with asbestos or other mineral fibers has been shown to cause cancer. Long thin asbestos fibers (blue asbestos, amphibole fibers) are more potent carcinogens than &quot;feathery fibers&quot; (chrysotile or white asbestos fibers). However, there is now evidence that smaller particles may be more dangerous than the larger fibers. They remain suspended in the air where they can be inhaled, and may penetrate more easily and deeper into the lungs. &quot;We probably will find out a lot more about the health aspects of asbestos from [the World Trade Center attack], unfortunately,&quot; said Dr. Alan Fein, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.

Mesothelioma development in rats has been demonstrated following intra-pleural inoculation of phosphorylated chrysotile fibers. It has been suggested that in humans, transport of fibers to the pleura is critical to the pathogenesis of mesothelioma. This is supported by the observed recruitment of significant numbers of macrophages and other cells of the immune system to localized lesions of accumulated asbestos fibers in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of rats. These lesions continued to attract and accumulate macrophages as the disease progressed, and cellular changes within the lesion culminated in a morphologically malignant tumor.

Experimental evidence suggests that asbestos acts as a complete carcinogen with the development of mesothelioma occurring in sequential stages of initiation and promotion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation of normal mesothelial cells by asbestos fibers remain unclear despite the demonstration of its oncogenic capabilities (see next-but-one paragraph). However, complete in vitro transformation of normal human mesothelial cells to a malignant phenotype following exposure to asbestos fibers has not yet been achieved. In general, asbestos fibers are thought to act through direct physical interactions with the cells of the mesothelium in conjunction with indirect effects following interaction with inflammatory cells such as macrophages.

===Intracellular===
Analysis of the interactions between asbestos fibers and DNA has shown that phagocytosed fibers make contact with chromosomes, often adhering to the chromatin fibers or becoming entangled within the chromosome. This contact between the asbestos fiber and the chromosomes or structural proteins of the spindle apparatus can induce complex abnormalities. The most common abnormality is monosomy of chromosome 22. Other frequent abnormalities include structural rearrangement of 1p, 3p, 9p, and 6q chromosome arms.

Common gene abnormalities in mesothelioma cell lines include deletion of the tumor suppressor genes:
* Neurofibromatosis type 2 at 22q12
* P16INK4A
* P14ARF

Asbestos has also been shown to mediate the entry of foreign DNA into target cells. Incorporation of this foreign DNA may lead to mutations and oncogenesis by several possible mechanisms:
* Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
* Activation of oncogenes In tumor cells, these genes are often mutated, or expressed at high levels.
* Activation of proto-oncogenes due to incorporation of foreign DNA containing a promoter region
* Activation of DNA repair enzymes, which may be prone to error
* Activation of telomerase
* Prevention of apoptosis
Several genes are commonly mutated in mesothelioma, and may be prognostic factors. These include primarily BAP1, NF2, and TP53; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and C-Met, receptor tyrosine kinases can also be altered and overexpressed in many mesotheliomas. Some association has been found with EGFR and epithelioid histology but no clear association has been found between EGFR overexpression and overall survival; BAP1 alterations are also predominantly in the epithelioid histology. Aneuploidy, ranging from haploidy to tetraploidy, and CpG island hypermethylation have also been shown to be frequent and associated with survival. Expression of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a negative prognostic factor. Expression of PDGFRB is a positive prognostic factor. In general, mesothelioma is characterized by loss of function in tumor suppressor genes, rather than by an overexpression or gain of function in oncogenes.

As an environmentally triggered malignancy, mesothelioma tumors have been found to be polyclonal in origin, by performing an X-inactivation based assay on epitheloid and biphasic tumors obtained from female patients. These results suggest that an environmental factor, most likely asbestos exposure, may damage and transform a group of cells in the tissue, resulting in a population of tumor cells that are, albeit only slightly, genetically different.

===Immune system===
Asbestos fibers have been shown to alter the function and secretory properties of macrophages, ultimately creating conditions which favour the development of mesothelioma. Following asbestos phagocytosis, macrophages generate increased amounts of hydroxyl radicals, which are normal by-products of cellular anaerobic metabolism. However, these free radicals are also known clastogenic (chromosome-breaking)
and membrane-active agents thought to promote asbestos carcinogenicity. These oxidants can participate in the oncogenic process by directly and indirectly interacting with DNA, modifying membrane-associated cellular events, including oncogene activation and perturbation of cellular antioxidant defences.

Asbestos also may possess immunosuppressive properties. For example, chrysotile fibres have been shown to depress the in vitro proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, suppress natural killer cell lysis, and significantly reduce lymphokine-activated killer cell viability and recovery. Furthermore, genetic alterations in asbestos-activated macrophages may result in the release of potent mesothelial cell mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) which in turn, may induce the chronic stimulation and proliferation of mesothelial cells after injury by asbestos fibres.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of mesothelioma can be suspected with imaging but is confirmed with biopsy. It must be clinically and histologically differentiated from other pleural and pulmonary malignancies, including reactive pleural disease, primary lung carcinoma, pleural metastases of other cancers, and other primary pleural cancers.

Primary pericardial mesothelioma is often diagnosed after it has metastasized to lymph nodes or the lungs.
===Imaging===
Diagnosing mesothelioma is often difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other conditions. Diagnosis begins with a review of the patient&#x27;s medical history. A history of exposure to asbestos may increase clinical suspicion for mesothelioma. A physical examination is performed, followed by chest X-ray and often lung function tests. The X-ray may reveal pleural thickening commonly seen after asbestos exposure and increases suspicion of mesothelioma. A CT (or CAT) scan or an MRI is usually performed. If a large amount of fluid is present, abnormal cells may be detected by cytopathology if this fluid is aspirated with a syringe. For pleural fluid, this is done by thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy (chest tube); for ascites, with paracentesis or ascitic drain; and for pericardial effusion with pericardiocentesis. While absence of malignant cells on cytology does not completely exclude mesothelioma, it makes it much more unlikely, especially if an alternative diagnosis can be made (e.g., tuberculosis, heart failure). However, with primary pericardial mesothelioma, pericardial fluid may not contain malignant cells and a tissue biopsy is more useful in diagnosis. Using conventional cytology diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is difficult, but immunohistochemistry has greatly enhanced the accuracy of cytology.

===Biopsy===
Generally, a biopsy is needed to confirm a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a thoracoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, lighted tube called a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the cardiothoracic surgeon might directly open the chest (thoracotomy). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a laparoscopy. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, an open surgical procedure may be necessary.

===Immunochemistry===
Immunohistochemical studies play an important role for the pathologist in differentiating malignant mesothelioma from neoplastic mimics, such as breast or lung cancer that has metastasized to the pleura. There are numerous tests and panels available, but no single test is perfect for distinguishing mesothelioma from carcinoma or even benign versus malignant. The positive markers indicate that mesothelioma is present; if other markers are positive it may indicate another type of cancer, such as breast or lung adenocarcinoma. Calretinin is a particularly important marker in distinguishing mesothelioma from metastatic breast or lung cancer.

===Subtypes===
There are three main histological subtypes of malignant mesothelioma: epithelioid, sarcomatous, and biphasic. Epithelioid and biphasic mesothelioma make up approximately 75-95% of mesotheliomas and have been well characterized histologically, whereas sarcomatous mesothelioma has not been studied extensively. Most mesotheliomas express high levels of cytokeratin 5 regardless of subtype.

Epithelioid mesothelioma is characterized by high levels of calretinin.

Sarcomatous mesothelioma does not express high levels of calretinin.

Other morphological subtypes have been described:
* Desmoplastic
* Clear cell
* Deciduoid
* Adenomatoid
* Glandular
* Mucohyaline
* Cartilaginous and osseous metaplasia
* Lymphohistiocytic

===Differential diagnosis===
* Metastatic adenocarcinoma
* Pleural sarcoma
* Synovial sarcoma
* Thymoma
* Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma
* Metastatic osteosarcoma

===Staging===
Staging of mesothelioma is based on the recommendation by the International Mesothelioma Interest Group. TNM classification of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis is performed. Mesothelioma is staged Ia–IV (one-A to four) based on the TNM status.

==Prevention==
Mesothelioma can be prevented in most cases by preventing exposure to asbestos. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health maintains a recommended exposure limit of 0.1 asbestos fiber per cubic centimeter.

==Screening==
There is no universally agreed protocol for screening people who have been exposed to asbestos. Screening tests might diagnose mesothelioma earlier than conventional methods thus improving the survival prospects for patients. The serum osteopontin level might be useful in screening asbestos-exposed people for mesothelioma. The level of soluble mesothelin-related protein is elevated in the serum of about 75% of patients at diagnosis and it has been suggested that it may be useful for screening. Doctors have begun testing the Mesomark assay, which measures levels of soluble mesothelin-related proteins (SMRPs) released by mesothelioma cells.

==Treatment==
Mesothelioma is generally resistant to radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Long-term survival and cures are exceedingly rare. Treatment of malignant mesothelioma at earlier stages has a better prognosis. Clinical behavior of the malignancy is affected by several factors including the continuous mesothelial surface of the pleural cavity which favors local metastasis via exfoliated cells, invasion to underlying tissue and other organs within the pleural cavity, and the extremely long latency period between asbestos exposure and development of the disease. The histological subtype and the patient&#x27;s age and health status also help predict prognosis. The epithelioid histology responds better to treatment and has a survival advantage over sarcomatoid histology.

The effectiveness of radiotherapy compared to chemotherapy or surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma is not known.

===Surgery===
Surgery, by itself, has proved disappointing. In one large series, the median survival with surgery (including extrapleural pneumonectomy) was only 11.7 months. However, research indicates varied success when used in combination with radiation, chemotherapy (Duke, 2008), or both. A pleurectomy/decortication is the most common surgery, in which the lining of the chest is removed. Less common is an extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), in which the lung, lining of the inside of the chest, the hemi-diaphragm, and the pericardium are removed. In localized pericardial mesothelioma, pericardectomy can be curative; when the tumor has metastasized, pericardectomy is a palliative care option. It is often not possible to remove the entire tumor.

===Radiation===
For patients with localized disease, and who can tolerate a radical surgery, radiation can be given post-operatively as a consolidative treatment. The entire hemithorax is treated with radiation therapy, often given simultaneously with chemotherapy. Delivering radiation and chemotherapy after a radical surgery has led to extended life expectancy in selected patient populations. It can also induce severe side-effects, including fatal pneumonitis. As part of a curative approach to mesothelioma, radiotherapy is commonly applied to the sites of chest drain insertion, in order to prevent growth of the tumor along the track in the chest wall.

Although mesothelioma is generally resistant to curative treatment with radiotherapy alone, palliative treatment regimens are sometimes used to relieve symptoms arising from tumor growth, such as obstruction of a major blood vessel. Radiation therapy, when given alone with curative intent, has never been shown to improve survival from mesothelioma. The necessary radiation dose to treat mesothelioma that has not been surgically removed would be beyond human tolerance. Radiotherapy is of some use in pericardial mesothelioma.

===Chemotherapy===

Chemotherapy is the only treatment for mesothelioma that has been proven to improve survival in randomised and controlled trials. The landmark study published in 2003 by Vogelzang and colleagues compared cisplatin chemotherapy alone with a combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed (brand name Alimta) chemotherapy in patients who had not received chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma previously and were not candidates for more aggressive &quot;curative&quot; surgery. This trial was the first to report a survival advantage from chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma, showing a statistically significant improvement in median survival from 10 months in the patients treated with cisplatin alone to 13.3 months in the group of patients treated with cisplatin in the combination with pemetrexed and who also received supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. Vitamin supplementation was given to most patients in the trial and pemetrexed related side effects were significantly less in patients receiving pemetrexed when they also received daily oral folate 500mcg and intramuscular vitamin B12 1000mcg every 9 weeks compared with patients receiving pemetrexed without vitamin supplementation. The objective response rate increased from 20% in the cisplatin group to 46% in the combination pemetrexed group. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhoea were more common in the combination pemetrexed group but only affected a minority of patients and overall the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated when patients received vitamin supplementation; both quality of life and lung function tests improved in the combination pemetrexed group. In February 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pemetrexed for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, there are still unanswered questions about the optimal use of chemotherapy, including when to start treatment, and the optimal number of cycles to give. Cisplatin and pemetrexed together give patients a median survival of 12.1 months.

Cisplatin in combination with raltitrexed has shown an improvement in survival similar to that reported for pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin, but raltitrexed is no longer commercially available for this indication. For patients unable to tolerate pemetrexed, cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine or vinorelbine is an alternative, or vinorelbine on its own, although a survival benefit has not been shown for these drugs. For patients in whom cisplatin cannot be used, carboplatin can be substituted but non-randomised data have shown lower response rates and high rates of haematological toxicity for carboplatin-based combinations, albeit with similar survival figures to patients receiving cisplatin. Cisplatin in combination with premetrexed disodium, folic acid, and vitamin B12 may also improve survival for people who are responding to chemotherapy.

In January 2009, the United States FDA approved using conventional therapies such as surgery in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy on stage I or II Mesothelioma after research conducted by a nationwide study by Duke University concluded an almost 50 point increase in remission rates.

In pericardial mesothelioma, chemotherapy—typically adriamycin or cisplatin—is primarily used to shrink the tumor and is not curative.

===Immunotherapy===
Treatment regimens involving immunotherapy have yielded variable results. For example, intrapleural inoculation of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in an attempt to boost the immune response, was found to be of no benefit to the patient (while it may benefit patients with bladder cancer). Mesothelioma cells proved susceptible to in vitro lysis by LAK cells following activation by interleukin-2 (IL-2), but patients undergoing this particular therapy experienced major side effects. Indeed, this trial was suspended in view of the unacceptably high levels of IL-2 toxicity and the severity of side effects such as fever and cachexia. Nonetheless, other trials involving interferon alpha have proved more encouraging with 20% of patients experiencing a greater than 50% reduction in tumor mass combined with minimal side effects.

In October 2020, the FDA approved the combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) with ipilimumab (Yervoy) for the first-line treatment of adults with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) that cannot be removed by surgery. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are both monoclonal antibodies that, when combined, decrease tumor growth by enhancing T-cell function. The combination therapy was evaluated through a randomized, open-label trial in which participants who received nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab survived a median of 18.1 months while participants who underwent chemotherapy survived a median of 14.1 months.

===Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy===
Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy is used in conjunction with surgery, including in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The surgeon removes as much of the tumor as possible followed by the direct administration of a chemotherapy agent, heated to between 40 and 48 °C, in the abdomen. The fluid is perfused for 60 to 120 minutes and then drained. High concentrations of selected drugs are then administered into the pleural cavity. Heating the chemotherapy treatment increases the penetration of the drugs into tissues. Also, heating itself damages the malignant cells more than the normal cells.

===Multimodality therapy===

Multimodal therapy, which includes a combined approach of surgery, radiation, or photodynamic therapy, and chemotherapy, is not suggested for routine practice for treating malignant pleural mesothelioma. The effectiveness and safety of multimodal therapy is not clear (not enough research has been performed) and one clinical trial has suggested a possible increased risk of adverse effects.

Large series of examining multimodality treatment have only demonstrated modest improvement in survival (median survival 14.5 months and only 29.6% surviving 2 years). Reducing the bulk of the tumor with cytoreductive surgery is key to extending survival. Two surgeries have been developed: extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. The indications for performing these operations are unique. The choice of operation namely depends on the size of the patient&#x27;s tumor. This is an important consideration because tumor volume has been identified as a prognostic factor in mesothelioma. Pleurectomy/decortication spares the underlying lung and is performed in patients with early stage disease when the intention is to remove all gross visible tumor (macroscopic complete resection), not simply palliation. Extrapleural pneumonectomy is a more extensive operation that involves resection of the parietal and visceral pleurae, underlying lung, ipsilateral (same side) diaphragm, and ipsilateral pericardium. This operation is indicated for a subset of patients with more advanced tumors, who can tolerate a pneumonectomy.

==Prognosis==
Mesothelioma usually has a poor prognosis. Typical survival despite surgery is between 12 and 21 months depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis with about 7.5% of people surviving for 5 years.

Women, young people, people with low-stage cancers, and people with epithelioid cancers have better prognoses. Negative prognostic factors include sarcomatoid or biphasic histology, high platelet counts (above 400,000), age over 50 years, white blood cell counts above 15.5, low glucose levels in the pleural fluid, low albumin levels, and high fibrinogen levels. Several markers are under investigation as prognostic factors, including nuclear grade, and serum c-reactive protein. Long-term survival is rare.

Pericardial mesothelioma has a 10-month median survival time.

In peritoneal mesothelioma, high expression of WT-1 protein indicates a worse prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
Although reported incidence rates have increased in the past 20 years, mesothelioma is still a relatively rare cancer. The incidence rate varies from one country to another, from a low rate of less than 1 per 1,000,000 in Tunisia and Morocco, to the highest rate in Britain, Australia, and Belgium: 30 per 1,000,000 per year. For comparison, populations with high levels of smoking can have a lung cancer incidence of over 1,000 per 1,000,000. Incidence of malignant mesothelioma currently ranges from about 7 to 40 per 1,000,000 in industrialized Western nations, depending on the amount of asbestos exposure of the populations during the past several decades. Worldwide incidence is estimated at 1–6 per 1,000,000.

Incidence of mesothelioma lags behind that of asbestosis due to the longer time it takes to develop; due to the cessation of asbestos use in developed countries, mesothelioma incidence is expected to decrease. Incidence is expected to continue increasing in developing countries due to continuing use of asbestos. Mesothelioma occurs more often in men than in women and risk increases with age, but this disease can appear in either men or women at any age. Approximately one fifth to one third of all mesotheliomas are peritoneal. Less than 5% of mesotheliomas are pericardial. The prevalence of pericardial mesothelioma is less than 0.002%; it is more common in men than women. It typically occurs in a person&#x27;s 50s-70s.

Between 1940 and 1979, approximately 27.5 million people were occupationally exposed to asbestos in the United States. Between 1973 and 1984, the incidence of pleural mesothelioma among Caucasian males increased 300%. From 1980 to the late 1990s, the death rate from mesothelioma in the USA increased from 2,000 per year to 3,000, with men four times more likely to acquire it than women. More than 80% of mesotheliomas are caused by asbestos exposure.

The incidence of peritoneal mesothelioma is 0.5–3.0 per million per year in men, and 0.2–2.0 per million per year in women.

===UK===
Mesothelioma accounts for less than 1% of all cancers diagnosed in the UK, (around 2,600 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the seventeenth most common cause of cancer death (around 2,400 people died in 2012).

==History==
Connections between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma were first identified in the 1960s, with significant evidence emerging from South Africa.
In the United States, asbestos manufacture stopped in 2002. Asbestos exposure thus shifted from workers in asbestos textile mills, friction product manufacturing, cement pipe fabrication, and insulation manufacture and installation to maintenance workers in asbestos-containing buildings.

==Society and culture==

===Notable cases===
Mesothelioma, though rare, has had a number of notable patients:
* Malcolm McLaren, musician and manager of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols, was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in October 2009 and died on 8 April 2010 in Switzerland.
* Steve McQueen, American actor, was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma on December 22, 1979. He was not offered surgery or chemotherapy because doctors felt the cancer was too advanced. McQueen subsequently sought alternative treatments at clinics in Mexico. He died of a heart attack on November 7, 1980, in Juárez, Mexico, following cancer surgery. He may have been exposed to asbestos while serving with the U.S. Marines as a young adult—asbestos was then commonly used to insulate ships&#x27; piping—or from its use as an insulating material in automobile racing suits (McQueen was an avid racing driver and fan).
* Mickie Most, record producer, died of peritoneal mesothelioma in May 2003; however, it has been questioned whether this was due to asbestos exposure.
* Warren Zevon, American musician, was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma in 2002, and died on September 7, 2003. It is believed that this was caused through childhood exposure to asbestos insulation in the attic of his father&#x27;s shop.
* David Martin, Australian sailor and politician, died on 10 August 1990 of pleural mesothelioma. It is believed that this was caused by his exposure to asbestos on military ships during his career in the Royal Australian Navy.
* Paul Kraus, diagnosed in 1997, is considered the longest currently living (as of 2017) mesothelioma survivor in the world.
* F. W. De Klerk, South African retired politician, was diagnosed with mesothelioma on March 19, 2021, and died in November 2021.
* Paul Gleason, American actor, died on May 27, 2006, just a few months after diagnosis.
* Merlin Olsen, American football player, announcer, and actor, died March 11, 2010.
* Rogier van Otterloo, Dutch composer and conductor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma and died January 29, 1988.

Although life expectancy with this disease is typically limited, there are notable survivors. In July 1982, Stephen Jay Gould, a well-regarded paleontologist, was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma. After his diagnosis, Gould wrote &quot;The Median Isn&#x27;t the Message&quot;, in which he argued that statistics such as median survival are useful abstractions, not destiny. Gould lived for another 20 years, eventually succumbing to cancer not linked to his mesothelioma.

===Legal issues===

Some people who were exposed to asbestos have collected damages for an asbestos-related disease, including mesothelioma. Compensation via asbestos funds or class action lawsuits is an important issue in law practices regarding mesothelioma.

The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers were in 1929. Since then, many lawsuits have been filed against asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the links between asbestos, asbestosis, and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this as early as 1898). The liability resulting from the sheer number of lawsuits and people affected has reached billions of dollars. The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, reaching up to the United States Supreme Court, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases. However, to date, the US Congress has not stepped in and there are no federal laws governing asbestos compensation.
In 2013, the &quot;Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency (FACT) Act of 2013&quot; passed the US House of representatives and was sent to the US Senate, where it was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. As the Senate did not vote on it before the end of the 113th Congress, it died in committee. It was revived in the 114th Congress, where it has not yet been brought before the House for a vote.

====History====
The first lawsuit against asbestos manufacturers was brought in 1929. The parties settled that lawsuit, and as part of the agreement, the attorneys agreed not to pursue further cases. In 1960, an article published by Wagner et al. was seminal in establishing mesothelioma as a disease arising from exposure to asbestos. The article referred to over 30 case studies of people who had had mesothelioma in South Africa. Some exposures were transient and some were mine workers. Before the use of advanced microscopy techniques, malignant mesothelioma was often diagnosed as a variant form of lung cancer. In 1962, McNulty reported the first diagnosed case of malignant mesothelioma in an Australian asbestos worker. The worker had worked in the mill at the asbestos mine in Wittenoom from 1948 to 1950.

In the town of Wittenoom, asbestos-containing mine waste was used to cover schoolyards and playgrounds. In 1965, an article in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine established that people who lived in the neighbourhoods of asbestos factories and mines, but did not work in them, had contracted mesothelioma.

Despite proof that the dust associated with asbestos mining and milling causes asbestos-related disease, mining began at Wittenoom in 1943 and continued until 1966. In 1974, the first public warnings of the dangers of blue asbestos were published in a cover story called &quot;Is this Killer in Your Home?&quot; in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot; magazine. In 1978, the Western Australian Government decided to phase out the town of Wittenoom, following the publication of a Health Dept. booklet, &quot;The Health Hazard at Wittenoom&quot;, containing the results of air sampling and an appraisal of worldwide medical information.

By 1979, the first writs for negligence related to Wittenoom were issued against CSR and its subsidiary ABA, and the Asbestos Diseases Society was formed to represent the Wittenoom victims.

In Leeds, England the Armley asbestos disaster involved several court cases against Turner &amp; Newall where local residents who contracted mesothelioma demanded compensation because of the asbestos pollution from the company&#x27;s factory. One notable case was that of June Hancock, who contracted the disease in 1993 and died in 1997.

==Research==

The WT-1 protein is overexpressed in mesothelioma and is being researched as a potential target for drugs.

There are two high-confidence miRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of asbestos exposure and malignant mesothelioma. Validation studies are needed to assess their relevance.

Some growth factors have been identified and as a result, targeted therapies have emerged to help slow the growth of oncogenic abnormalities. For example, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is directed at the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR).

<text>The lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) is a medium-sized shorebird. It breeds in the boreal forest region of North America.

==Taxonomy==
The lesser yellowlegs was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax flavipes&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;yellow shanks&quot; seen in the province of New York in autumn that had been described in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The lesser yellowlegs is now placed in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot; that was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin word given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet &quot;flavipes&quot; combines the Latin &quot;flavus&quot; meaning &quot;yellow&quot; with &quot;pes&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The lesser yellowlegs is a medium-large shorebird, in overall length and with a wingspan of and a weight of . The sexes are similar both in plumage and in overall size. In breeding plumage, the upperparts are mottled with gray-brown, black and white. The underparts are white with irregular brown streaking on the breast and neck. In non-breeding plumage, the upperparts are more uniform gray-brown. The legs are yellow. Compared to the greater yellowlegs, the bill is shorter (visually about the same length as the head), slim, straight, and uniformly dark. The breast is streaked and the flanks are finely marked with short bars.

This species is similar in appearance to the larger greater yellowlegs, although it is more closely related to the much larger willet; the fine, clear, and dense pattern of the neck shown in breeding plumage indicates these species&#x27; actual relationships.

The call of this bird is softer than that of the greater yellowlegs.

==Distribution and habitat==
They migrate to the Gulf coast of the United States, the Caribbean, and south to South America.
This species is a regular vagrant to western Europe; in Great Britain about five birds arrive each year, mostly between August and October, with the occasional individual overwintering. Their breeding habitat is clearings near ponds in the boreal forest region from Alaska to Quebec.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===

The nest is a depression on dry mossy ground and is usually well hidden. The clutch is normally four eggs. These are buff or gray-brown and are covered in spots of various shades of brown. On average they measure . They are incubated for 22-23 days by both sexes. Both parents brood and care for the precocial young which leave the nest a few hours after hatching. They can feed themselves on departure from the nest. They fly at 23 to 31 days.

===Food and feeding===
Lesser yellowlegs forage in shallow water, sometimes using their bill to stir up the water. They mainly eat insects (such as flies, beetles, water boatmen, and mayflies), small fish, crustaceans, aquatic worms, molluscs (such as snails), spiders, and seeds.

<text>Coboconk, often shortened to Coby, is a community in the city of Kawartha Lakes, in the south-central portion of the Canadian province of Ontario. The village lies at the junction of Highway 35 and former Highway 48, on the northern tip of Balsam Lake, the highest point on the Trent–Severn Waterway. Coboconk has a prominent role in the logging, limestone, and tourism industries of the Kawartha Lakes region over the past 150 years.

== History ==

Coboconk was first settled in 1851 with the building of a saw mill on the Krosh-qua-bo-Konk River (later anglicized to the Gull River) by John Bateman, and like many villages in central Ontario, it served the lumber trade of the area, which was clearing the forests of pine, hemlock and spruce, and sending the logs downstream for processing.

In 1859 the village name was anglicized by the establishment of a post office. The name is a translation of the two Indigenous names for the village, which came from the name of the river: &quot;Ko-ash-kob-o-cong&quot;, translating to &quot;the part of the river where a portage of a few rods needs to be made&quot; and &quot;Quash-qua-be-conk&quot;, translating to &quot;where the gulls nest.&quot;

In October, 1859, a bylaw was passed by the United Council in Bobcaygeon, permitting the construction of &quot;The Cameron Road&quot; from Fenelon Falls, then known as Cameron&#x27;s Falls after the initial settler of the area, through Rosedale, then called Rosa Dale, after the wife of Mr. Cameron, and into Coboconk. The forced road cut through lots fronting Balsam Lake, and was little more than a dirt trail for many years. When the Department of Northern Development was absorbed into the Department of Highways on April 1, 1937,
&quot;The Cameron Road&quot; was designated as part of Highway 35.

In November 1872, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway reached Coboconk and a station was built. The station was named &quot;Shedden&quot; after the president of the railway, causing the town to be renamed to that on June 1, 1873. The name would hold until December 1, 1880, when local residents had the town renamed Coboconk. The line served the village for some time into the mid-twentieth century. The advent of local mail delivery coupled with the building of highways in the 1950s (Ontario Highway 35 and Ontario Highway 115) into the area eventually led to the demise of the line. The tracks were lifted in 1965, and the station moved to its present location in the Laidlaw Heritage Village, overlooking Legion Park in 1995. It is not the original station, however, and was built after the old station burnt down due to a lightning strike on August 4, 1908.

Coboconk was home to several grist and lumber mills, as well as brick kilns for several brick makers, including the Toronto Brick Company and the Canada Lime Company, which continued to operate into the mid-twentieth century, and a large limestone quarry. While most of the mills have been torn down, the kilns remain in place on Queen street, and are visible as one enters the village from the south on Highway 35.
When the Rosedale lock (Now lock 35 of the Trent-Severn Waterway) was completed in 1873, Coboconk became the furthest point one could travel from Lake Ontario. It remained as such for over three decades during a period when the construction of the Trent ceased due to political and financial turmoil. With the opening of the Kirkfield Lift Locks in 1907, travel beyond Coboconk became possible.

On May 16, 1877, the central island of the village was destroyed by major fire which started in the local Key Hotel.

On January 1, 2001, being located within Bexley and Somerville townships, Coboconk was incorporated into the newly formed city of Kawartha Lakes.

Coboconk is located on the border of the geographic townships of Bexley and Somerville, at the junction of Highway 35 and Kawartha Lakes Road 48 (Formerly Highway 48).
The village lies within the Gull River valley on the ridge between the Paleozoic Limestone region of South-Central Ontario and the Precambrian Granite Canadian Shield. A limestone cuesta crosses the southern portion of the village.
Coboconk lies between the northern tip of Balsam Lake, and the southernmost point of the Gull River drainage system. A dam divides the two watersheds, as well as controlling the water levels of Balsam and Mitchell Lakes, the highest point on the Trent–Severn Waterway. Four Mile Lake is located nearby.

== Demographics ==
Because Coboconk has never been an incorporated place, no census data exists for the village itself. Prior to the amalgamation of Victoria County into Kawartha Lakes, data was available for each township and village. The village of Coboconk lies half within the boundaries of former Somerville Township, and half within the former Bexley Township, and as such, the demographics of those two townships is the only data available.

== Services ==

Coboconk, as one of the larger unincorporated villages of the former Victoria County, contains most of the essential services required by the population. Though it does not contain a hospital (The nearest being equidistant in either Lindsay or Minden), it does have a fire hall with a single pumper; a public school named Ridgewood P.S.; a medical centre; a post office; several churches; a mixed use library and a community centre.

== Attractions ==

Balsam Lake Provincial Park (448 ha) and Indian Point Provincial Park (947 ha) are both minutes west of Coboconk. The former is a summer campground,
while the latter is a natural environment conservation area.
Coboconk is one of several places (including Tweed, Ontario and Creemore, Ontario) which lay claim to be &quot;the home of Canada&#x27;s smallest jail&quot;, a claim which it promoted on the welcoming sign on the south side of the village. At 4.57 m by 8.84 m (26.68 m2), it is certainly amongst the smallest jails in North America. However, the absolute distinction belongs to the jail house in Rodney, Ontario, which measures just 4.5 m by 5.4 m (24.3 m2).
The Coby Jail has limestone walls mined from the local quarry. These along with the iron bars remain unchanged since the construction of the jail in 1884. Inside the jail were two cells, in addition to the wardens office. The sole constable of the jail, Joseph Wakelin, was appointed in 1899 and retired in 1922.

Local legend tells of a man named Lee who was locked up one night by the constable, who then returned home. Upon the constable&#x27;s return, Lee was found sitting beside the jail, with no physical damage to the door or lock.
This legend, however, can be attributed to the builder of the jail, Albert Ryckman, who left several bricks in place without mortar with the foresight that should he be caught after a night at the local pub, known as the Pattie House, he could simply escape unnoticed. It is said that he made use of this escape route several times over the years.

The jail sat vacant for 50 years before being purchased by the Coboconk New Horizons Club in 1974. It is now a designated heritage site and museum, named Ye Olde Jailhouse.

Balsam Lake is claimed to be the highest freshwater lake in the world from which one can sail to the ocean. Parks Canada recognized this feature by placing a historical landmark at the Coboconk docks. A celebration was held on the 2010 summer solstice, June 19, to unveil the marker.

== Coverage in the media ==
The village was featured in the news when Bob Edmonds, a resident, had his winning lottery ticket stolen by the local convenience store clerk. The ensuing scandal began a series of changes within the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation to improve the security of claiming prizes.

Coboconk was also associated with the 2005 murder of Alicia Ross, when some of her remains were recovered following her killer&#x27;s confession.

Coboconk appears in Canadian fiction in the murder-mystery novel &quot;Old City Hall&quot; by Robert Rotenberg, as well as in a 1926 novel.

<text>Conqueror Records was a United States–based record label, active from 1928 through 1942. The label was sold exclusively through Sears, Roebuck and Company.

==History==

Conqueror was originally owned by the Plaza Music Company, then became part of the American Record Corporation family of labels. Most of the issues are of standard dance tunes and popular songs of the era, although there are jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong and Glenn Miller.

The audio fidelity of Conquerors is average for the era, pressed into somewhat below average shellac. The record sleeves state that the proper playing speed for Conqueror Records is 80 rpm.

<doc id="302464" wikidata="Q2994119" url="?curid=302464" title="Legislative council">
<text>A legislative council is the legislature, or one of the legislative chambers, of a nation, colony, or subnational division such as a province or state. It was commonly used to label unicameral or upper house legislative bodies in the British (former) colonies. However, it has also been used as designation in other (non-Commonwealth) nations. A member of a legislative council is commonly referred to as an MLC.

In the United States, a legislative council has a different connotation, and means a council within a legislature which supervises nonpartisan support staff.

==History==
In the British Empire, the authority under which legislative councils have been constituted has varied: some under the royal prerogative, others by acts of parliament, and some by commission and royal instructions. 

==List of legislative councils==
In India, the Vidhan Parishad is another name for the Legislative Council in those states with bicameral legislatures.


==United States==
In American English, the term &quot;legislative council&quot; has acquired a slightly different meaning since the 1930s. It refers to a joint committee with members from both houses of the state legislature, which supervises a staff of attorneys, accountants, and researchers charged with providing strictly nonpartisan support services to the legislature or to particular committees. The concept of the legislative council was first developed in Kansas and was implemented by the Kansas Legislature in 1933. Eventually, a majority of U.S. states adopted legislative councils, but under a variety of names. Between 1933 and 1959, at least 32 states had legislative councils.

Kansas still uses a legislative council, although it was converted into the Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council in 1971. Legislative councils operating under that name exist in the states of Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. Several states use the term &quot;commission&quot; for the same thing, including New Jersey and Nevada.

A few states, like California, have a &quot;legislative counsel&quot;, not &quot;council&quot;, who is appointed by a vote of the entire legislature and is thus responsible to the body as a whole rather than a &quot;council&quot; within it.

<doc id="302469" wikidata="Q695709" url="?curid=302469" title="Vajra">
<text>The Vajra (, ) is a legendary and ritualistic tool, symbolizing the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force). In Hinduism, it has also been associated with weapons.

The use of the bell and vajra as symbolic and ritual tools is found in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The vajra is a round, symmetrical metal scepter with two ribbed spherical heads. The ribs may meet in a ball-shaped top, or they may be separate and end in sharp points. The vajra is considered inseparable from the bell, and both are sold in dharma stores only in matching sets. The bell is also metal with a ribbed spherical head. The bell also depicts the face of Dhatvisvari, a female buddha and the consort of Akshobhya.

The vajra has also been associated as the weapon of Indra, the Vedic king of the devas and heaven. It is used symbolically by the dharmic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, often to represent firmness of spirit and spiritual power.

According to Hinduism, the vajra is considered one of the most powerful weapons in the universe.

== Etymology ==
According to Asko Parpola, the Sanskrit () and its Avestan cognate are possibly ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*weg&#x27;-&quot; which means &quot;to be(come) powerful&quot;. The related Proto-West-Uralic &quot;*vaśara&quot; (&quot;axe, mace&quot;, (later) &quot;hammer&quot;; whence &quot;Ukonvasara&quot;, &quot;Ukko&#x27;s hammer&quot;) is an early loanword from the Proto-Indo-Aryan &quot;*vaj’ra-&quot; but not from Proto-Iranian, state Parpola and Carpelan, because its palatalized sibilant is not consistent with the depalatalization which occurred in Proto-Iranian. The Sanskrit Vajra is a cognate of گرز (&quot;Gorz&quot;), which is the Persian word for &quot;club&quot;.

==Hinduism==
===Rigveda===
Traditionally, the earliest mention of the vajra is in the Rigveda, part of the four Vedas, though inscription wise, the earliest mention is being part of the name of a Javanese king. It is described as the weapon of Indra, the chief among the devas. Indra is described as using the vajra to kill sinners and ignorant persons. The Rigveda states that the weapon was made for Indra by Tvaṣṭṛ, the maker of divine instruments. The associated story describes Indra using the vajra, which he held in his hand, to slay the asura Vritra, who took the form of a serpent. In the context of Rigvedic weaponry, the word vájra appears to have been used for the sling as a weapon, but also for extremely effective sling projectiles specially crafted from lead corresponding to cast lead projectiles as they were in widespread use in the cultural areas of the Middle East and the ancient world, especially in classical antiquity.

On account of his skill in wielding the vajra, some epithets used for Indra in the Rigveda were &quot;Vajrabhrit&quot; (bearing the vajra), &quot;Vajrivat&quot; or &quot;Vajrin&quot; (armed with the vajra), &quot;Vajradaksina&quot; (holding the vajra in his right hand), and &quot;Vajrabahu&quot; or &quot;Vajrahasta&quot; (holding the vajra in his hand). The association of the Vajra with Indra continued with some modifications in the later Puranic literature, and in Buddhist works. Buddhaghoṣa, a major figure of Theravada Buddhism in the 5th century, identified the Bodhisattva Vajrapani with Indra.

===Puranas===
Many later puranas describe the vajra, with the story modified from the Rigvedic original. One major addition involves the role of the Sage Dadhichi. According to one account, Indra, the king of the devas, was once driven out of Devaloka by an asura named Vritra. The asura was the recipient of a boon whereby he could not be killed by any weapon that was known till the date of his receiving the boon, and additionally, that no weapon made of wood or metal could harm him. Indra, who had lost all hope of recovering his kingdom is said to have approached Shiva, who could not help him. Indra, along with Shiva and Brahma, went to seek the aid of Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that only the weapon made from the bones of Dadhichi would defeat Vritra. Indra and the other devas, therefore, approached the sage, whom Indra had once beheaded, and asked him for his aid in defeating Vritra. Dadhichi acceded to the devas&#x27; request, but said that he wished that he had time to go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers before he gave up his life for them. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisha Forest, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without a further loss of time. Dadhichi is then said to have given up his life by the art of yoga after which the devas fashioned the vajrayudha from his spine. This weapon was then used to defeat the asura, allowing Indra to reclaim his place as the king of Devaloka.

Another version of the story exists where Dadhichi was asked to safeguard the weapons of the devas as they were unable to match the arcane arts being employed by the asura to obtain them. Dadhichi is said to have kept at the task for a very long time and finally tiring of the job, he is said to have dissolved the weapons in sacred water which he drank. The deva returned a long time later and asked him to return their weapons so that they might defeat the asura, headed by Vritra, once and for all. Dadhichi however told them of what he had done and informed them that their weapons were now a part of his bones. However, Dadhichi, realising that his bones were the only way by which the deva could defeat the asura willingly gave his life in a pit of mystical flames he summoned with the power of his austerities. Brahma is then said to have fashioned a large number of weapons from Dadhichi&#x27;s bones, including the vajrayudha, which was fashioned from his spine. The deva are then said to have defeated the asura using the weapons thus created.

There have also been instances where the war god Skanda (Kartikeya) is described as holding a vajra.

===Ramayana===
According to the Ramayana, as a child, Hanuman grew to enormous proportions, and attempted to swallow the sun, regarding it to be a ripe fruit. He also attempted to devour Rahu, who had been divinely assigned the function of swallowing the sun. Furious, Rahu pleaded his case to Indra, who immediately appeared to the scene upon his elephant mount, Airavata. When Hanuman attempted to seize his mount, Indra retaliated by striking the former&#x27;s chin with the vajra, who descended upon the earth. The child&#x27;s spiritual father and god of the wind, Vayu, caught him before he crashed upon the ground, and withdrew to a cave. In retaliation, he called upon all of the air that permeated creation, causing the suffocation of all life in the universe. Brahma, the god of creation, summoned a number of deities to the cave to placate Vayu. Indra imbued the limbs of Hanuman with the power of his celestial thunderbolt.

==Vajrayana Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the vajra () is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major schools of Buddhism. Vajrayana is translated as &quot;Thunderbolt Way&quot; or &quot;Diamond Way&quot; and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or &quot;bodhi&quot;. It also implies indestructibility, just as diamonds are harder than other gemstones.

=== Symbolism ===
In the tantric traditions of Buddhism, the vajra is a symbol for the nature of reality, or &quot;sunyata&quot;, indicating endless creativity, potency, and skillful activity. The vajra and bell are used in many rites by a lama or any Vajrayana practitioner of sadhana. The vajra is a male polysemic symbol that represents many things for the tantrika. The vajra is representative of upaya (skilful means) whereas its companion tool, the bell which is a female symbol, denotes prajna (wisdom). Some deities are shown holding each the vajra and bell in separate hands, symbolizing the union of the forces of compassion and wisdom, respectively.

===Vajra===
An instrument symbolizing vajra is extensively used in the rituals of the tantra. It consists of a spherical central section, with two symmetrical sets of five prongs, which arc out from lotus blooms on either side of the sphere and come to a point at two points equidistant from the centre, thus giving it the appearance of a &quot;diamond sceptre&quot;, which is how the term is sometimes translated.

The vajra is made up of several parts. In the center is a sphere which represents Sunyata, the primordial nature of the universe, the underlying unity of all things. Emerging from the sphere are two eight petaled lotus flowers. One represents the phenomenal world (or in Buddhist terms Samsara), the other represents the noumenal world (Nirvana). This is one of the fundamental dichotomies which are perceived by the unenlightened.

Arranged equally around the mouth of the lotus are two, four, or eight creatures which are called makara. These are mythological half-fish, half-crocodile creatures made up of two or more animals, often representing the union of opposites, (or a harmonisation of qualities that transcend our usual experience). From the mouths of the makara come tongues which come together in a point.

The five-pronged vajra (with four makara, plus a central prong) is the most commonly seen vajra. There is an elaborate system of correspondences between the five elements of the noumenal side of the vajra, and the phenomenal side. One important correspondence is between the five &quot;poisons&quot; with the five wisdoms. The five poisons are the mental states that obscure the original purity of a being&#x27;s mind, while the five wisdoms are the five most important aspects of the enlightened mind. Each of the five wisdoms is also associated with a Buddha figure. (see also Five Wisdom Buddhas)

===Accompanying bell===
The vajra is almost always paired with a ritual bell called a ghanta. The Tibetan term for the ritual bell used in Buddhist religious practices is &quot;tribu&quot;. Priests and devotees ring bells during the rituals. Together these ritual implements represent the inseparability of wisdom and compassion in the enlightened mindstream.

The bell is the most commonly used of all musical instruments in tantric Buddhist ritual. The sound made by the bells is regarded as very auspicious and is believed to drive out evil spirits from where the ritual is being performed. When the bell is being used with the vajra its use is varied depending on the ritual or the mantras being chanted. During meditation ringing the bell represents the sound of Buddha teaching the dharma and symbolizes the attainment of wisdom and the understanding of emptiness. During the chanting of the mantras the Bell and Vajra are used together in a variety of different ritualistic ways to represent the union of the male and female principles.

The hollow of the bell represents the void from which all phenomena arise, including the sound of the bell, and the clapper represents form. Together they symbolize wisdom (emptiness) and compassion (form or appearance). The sound, like all phenomena, arises, radiates forth and then dissolves back into emptiness.

=== Iconography and religious terminology ===
Various figures in Tantric iconography are represented holding or wielding the vajra. Three of the most famous of these are Vajrasattva, Vajrapani, and Padmasambhava. Vajrasattva (lit. vajra-being) holds the vajra, in his right hand, to his heart. The figure of the Wrathful Vajrapani (lit. vajra in the hand) brandishes the vajra, in his right hand, above his head. Padmasambhava holds the vajra above his right knee in his right hand.

The term is employed extensively in tantric literature: the term for the spiritual teacher is the &quot;vajracharya&quot;; one of the five dhyani buddhas is &quot;vajrasattva&quot;, and so on. The practice of prefixing terms, names, places, and so on by vajra represents the conscious attempt to recognize the transcendental aspect of all phenomena; it became part of the process of &quot;sacramentalizing&quot; the activities of the spiritual practitioner and encouraged him to engage all his psychophysical energies in the spiritual life.

== In popular culture ==
* Hindu nun Sister Nivedita designed a proposed flag for independent India with the vajra in yellow on red background.
* Bose Institute, a science research institute set up by Bengali scientist Jagadish Bose, uses the double vajra as its logo.
* Hindu nationalist groups Bengal Volunteers and Rashtrawadi Swaraj Mancha from Bengal use the vajra as their emblem.
* Param Vir Chakra, India&#x27;s highest wartime military decoration, has a motif of Vajra, the weapon of Indra created by the bones donated by sage Dadhichi, as tribute to his sacrifice.

<text>Sangerhausen was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Quedlinburg, Mansfelder Land, Merseburg-Querfurt, and the districts Kyffhäuserkreis and Nordhausen in Thuringia. Sangerhausen was merged on July 1, 2007, with Mansfelder Land into the new district Mansfeld-Südharz as part of a reform.

== History ==
The district was created on October 1, 1816, after Sachsen-Weißenfels became part of Prussia in 1815. In 1945 the &quot;Amt Allstedt&quot; was added to the district, in 1952 some municipalities were removed from the district, which decreased the area from 773 to 689 km2. In the communal reform of 1994 the district remained unchanged.

== Geography ==

The highest elevation of the district is the Großer Auerberg near Stolberg with 579 m above sea level, the lowest elevation with 119.8 m is near Curtsgehofenmühle southwest of Allstedt.

<text>Oxford Records was a record label active in the United States of America from roughly 1906 until 1916. The label was produced for Sears by several labels, including Columbia and Albany Indestructible Cylinders for cylinders and Leeds &amp; Catlin, Zon-O-Phone, and Columbia for discs. No recording activity was undertaken by Sears. All discs were single-sided.

==History==

In 1906, Sears introduced the Oxford disc to replace the earlier Harvard brand. These discs in the 11000 and 16000 series, were produced by Leeds &amp; Catlin. The 1908 Sears catalog introduced 7-inch discs listed at 21 cents that were pressed by Columbia and numbered in the 7000 series. In 1909 10-inch discs from Zonophone, retailing at 30 cents, were introduced. Fall 1911 saw Sears return to Columbia for pressings. These later discs are the most commonly found. The brand was phased out in 1916 for the new Silvertone brand, although records with the Oxford label were still being shipped in late 1917. Recordings appearing on the Oxford label could be recorded anywhere from 1901 to 1916. The take number is important to dating the recording, particularly for Columbia pressings. Cal Stewart&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Old But I&#x27;m Awfully Tough&quot; (Oxford 22) first appeared on Columbia in 1901, but the issued take number of was probably recorded much later.

==Repertoire==
Oxford discs contain the same material as released by the producing company. For the most part the titles released were popular items that were deemed likely to sell over a long period of time. A few sides from Columbia&#x27;s ethnic matrix series were also released. Artists are usually generic (i.e. &quot;band&quot;, &quot;banjo solo&quot; &quot;baritone&quot;) for the earlier pressings. These were the studio ensembles of the recording company and musicians commonly used by all record companies of the time such as Vess Ossman and Arthur Collins. Later Columbia pressings often gave artist credit when such artist was not under exclusive contract to Columbia at the time.

<text>The Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM), Bangalore, India, a constituent unit of the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), Ministry of Culture, Government of India, was established in memory of Sir M. Visvesvaraya. The building was constructed in Cubbon Park, and was inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on July 14, 1962. The museum displays industrial products, scientific models and engines.

==History==
Honoring Sir M. Visvesvaraya, the All India Manufacturers Organization and Mysore State Board decided to create a science and technology museum in Bangalore. The foundation stone was laid by Shri B. D. Jatti, Chief Minister of Mysore, on 15 September 1958. The Visvesvaraya Industrial Museum Society (VIMS) came to be registered as the nodal agency in order to pool resources from various industrial houses. It was inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on July 14, 1962.

The first exhibition, &quot;&#x27;Electricity&#x27;,&quot; was opened to the public on July 27, 1965.

In the year 1970, VITM launched the Mobile/Moving Science Exhibition (MSE) with 24 participatory exhibits mounted on a bus. The MSE Bus travels throughout Southern India.

In 1978, many science museums, including VITM, parted from CSIR and were brought under a newly formed society registered on 4 April 1978 as National Council of Science Museums (NCSM). In 1979 an extension was added to the building, increasing the total area of the museum to .

NCSM set up four additional science centers at Gulbarga (Karnataka) in 1984, Tirunelveli (Tamil Nadu) in 1987, Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh)in 1993 and at Kozhikode, Kerala in 1997, which are functioning under the direct administrative control of VITM. Thus, VITM has become the southern zone headquarters of NCSM.

The museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, and is open on all days (except Deepavali and Ganesha Chathurthi) from 09:30 to 18:00.

==Exhibition galleries==
* &quot;Engine Hall&quot; exhibits engines of various cars, machines used in industry, a jet aircraft engine, and other mechanical devices. 
* Through engaging exhibitions, the How Things Work gallery aims to illustrate how machines operate. The pulley system, gears, various motion-transfer mechanisms, levers, inclined planes, and screws that reduce effort are all included as exhibits. The use of these straightforward devices in everyday life is covered in a separate section.
* The &quot;Fun Science gallery&quot; that displays exhibits on the science of sound, optics, fluids, math and perception.
* The &quot;Electro Technic Gallery&quot; contains interactive electrical exhibits which work on the basic principles of electricity, electronics and communication. A renovated version of the Electro Technic gallery was opened to public on 8 April 2010. This gallery exhibits the classical experiments like Oersted&#x27;s experiment, Barlow&#x27;s wheel, and Faraday&#x27;s ring. A demonstration on electrostatics, which includes a Tesla coil and a Van de Graaff generator is on display.
* &quot;The Space – Emerging Technology in the Service of Mankind&quot; gallery showcases the achievements of the Indian Space Program. It was inaugurated on 19 June 1999. The Gallery was renovated with guidance of Indian Space Research Organization and reopened as &quot;Space Technology&quot; on 28 November 2017 by A. S. Kiran Kumar and Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan. It is the first Science Gallery in India dedicated to Space and Space Technology.
* The &quot;Biotechnological Revolution&quot; hall has exhibits on the basics of biotechnology and its applications, including human genome sequencing. It opened on 4 January 2003. This exhibition has been renovated with new interactive exhibits and displays. This new-look exhibition was opened to public as &#x27;Biotechnology&#x27; Gallery on 15 February 2021.
* The &quot;BEL Hall of Electronics&quot; was inaugurated on 29 June 2004 in collaboration with Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL). This gallery has exhibits on the basic principles of electronics and information technology.
* The &#x27;Science for Kids&#x27; gallery was inaugurated on 19 April 2019. There are exhibits on Our Senses, about animals, colours, light, sound etc. apart from interactive toys. There is an exhibit where kids can take photos of themselves with life-size animal models. &#x27;Mirror maze&#x27; is another attraction in this gallery.
* The &quot;Dinosaur Alive&quot; exhibit has a moving replica of a Spinosaurus. This pneumatically-operated dinosaur can move its head, hands and tail and roll its eyes at the visitors.
* The &quot;Science on a Sphere&quot; facility was opened on 28 July 2014, in celebration of the golden jubilee of VITM.
* The &quot;Wright Brothers&quot; exhibit, also added in 2014, includes a 1:1 scale model of the Wright Brothers’ Flyer, fabricated in-house, and a flight simulator.
In addition to these exhibits, the museum includes a science show hall, a 3D theatre, a 250-seat auditorium, a telemedicine facility, an 11&#x27; Celestron telescope with GPS, and a cafeteria.

VITM has developed travelling exhibitions including &quot;The World of Astronomical Observatories&quot;, &quot;The Life and Work of Sir C. V. Raman&quot;, &quot;Nanotechnology&quot;, and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Life and Work of Sir M Visvesvaraya&quot;. VITM also hosts, on a regular basis, travelling exhibitions that are developed by other units of NCSM such as &quot;Science of Sports&quot;, &quot;Giants from the Backyard&quot;, &quot;Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Disaster - Preparing for the Worst&quot;, and &quot;Radiations Around Us&quot;.

<doc id="302487" wikidata="Q11158147" url="?curid=302487" title="Polypore">
<text>Polypores are a group of fungi that form large fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside (with some exceptions). They are a morphological group of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]]-like gilled mushrooms and hydnoid fungi, and not all polypores are closely related to each other. Polypores are also called bracket fungi or shelf fungi, and they characteristically produce woody, shelf- or bracket-shaped or occasionally circular fruiting bodies that are called conks. Over one thousand polypore species have been described to science, but a large part of the diversity is still unknown even in relatively well-studied temperate areas.

Conks lie in a close planar grouping of separate or interconnected horizontal rows. Brackets can range from only a single row of a few caps, to dozens of rows of caps that can weigh several hundred pounds. They are mainly found on trees (living and dead) and coarse woody debris, and may resemble mushrooms. Some form annual fruiting bodies while others are perennial and grow larger year after year. Bracket fungi are typically tough and sturdy and produce their spores, called basidiospores, within the pores that typically make up the undersurface.

Most polypores inhabit tree trunks or branches consuming the wood, but some soil-inhabiting species form mycorrhiza with trees. Polypores and the related corticioid fungi are the most important agents of wood decay, playing a very significant role in nutrient cycling and aiding carbon dioxide absorption by forest ecosystems. Several polypore species are serious pathogens of plantation trees and are major causes of timber spoilage.

As polypores are much more diverse in old natural forests with abundant dead wood than in younger managed forests or plantations, a number of species have declined drastically and are under threat of extinction due to logging and deforestation. Polypores are used in traditional medicine, and they are actively studied for their medicinal value and various industrial applications.

==Taxonomy==


Because bracket fungi are defined by their growth form rather than phylogeny, the group contains members of multiple clades. Although the term &#x27;bracket fungi&#x27; classically was reserved for polypores, molecular studies have revealed some odd relationships. The beefsteak fungus, a well-known bracket fungus, is actually a member of the agarics. Other examples of bracket fungi include chicken of the woods (or sulphur shelf), birch bracket, dryad&#x27;s saddle, artist&#x27;s conk, and turkey tail. The name polypores is often used for a group that includes many of the hard or leathery fungi, which often lack a stipe, growing straight out of wood. &quot;Polypore&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;poly&quot;, meaning &quot;much&quot; or &quot;many&quot;, and &quot;poros&quot;, meaning &quot;pore&quot;.

The group includes many different shapes and forms that are common in the tropical forests, including the hard &#x27;cup fungi&#x27; and the &#x27;shell&#x27;, &#x27;plate&#x27; and &#x27;bracket&#x27; fungus commonly found growing off logs and still standing dead trees.

=== Classification ===
For most of 20th century polypores were treated as a family, the Polyporaceae. Reconstructions of family trees of fungi show that the poroid fruiting body has evolved numerous times in the past. Modern DNA-based evolutionary classification places polypores to at least 12 orders. The orders containing most polypore species are the Polyporales (genera such as &quot;Fomes&quot;, &quot;Polyporus&quot; and &quot;Trametes&quot;) and Hymenochaetales (e.g. &quot;Oxyporus&quot;, &quot;Phellinus&quot; and &quot;Trichaptum&quot;). Economically perhaps the most significant polypores &quot;Heterobasidion&quot; spp., pests of conifer plantations, belong to the Russulales. Other polypore orders are the Agaricales, Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales, Boletales, Cantharellales, Gloeophyllales, Sebacinales, Thelephorales and Trechisporales.

The Polyporales in the modern sense are not only polypores but also other fruiting body types such as crust fungi, hydnoid fungi and agaricoid mushrooms. The term polypore describing a morphological group should not be confused with the taxonomic groups Polyporales or Polyporaceae of the modern literature.

Currently polypores are divided into about 170 genera. That number is bound to rise significantly through better understanding of evolutionary relationships between species and through mapping of uncovered diversity in the tropics. All in all classification of polypores is in flux.

==Description==
The fungal individual that develops the fruit bodies that are identified as polypores resides in soil or wood as mycelium. Polypores are often restricted to either deciduous (angiosperm) or conifer (gymnosperm) host trees. Some species depend on a single tree genus (e.g. &quot;Piptoporus betulinus&quot; on birch, &quot;Perenniporia corticola&quot; on dipterocarps).

Forms of polypore fruit bodies range from mushroom-shaped to thin effused patches (crusts) that develop on dead wood. Perennial fruit bodies of some species growing on living trees can grow over 80 years old (e.g. &quot;Phellinus igniarius&quot;). Most species of polypores develop new, short-lived fruit bodies annually or several times every year. Abundant fruit takes place during the autumn or rainy season.

Structure of the fruit bodies is simple. Effused or resupinate fruit bodies typically consist of two layers - a tube layer of vertically arranged tubes that open downwards, and supporting layer called subiculum that supports and attached the tubes to substrate. In fruit bodies with a cap (pileate fruit bodies) the tissue between upper surface and the pore layer is called context. A few polypores (e.g. &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot; and &quot;Inocutis rhaedes&quot;) also have a core between context and substrate. A minority of polypores also have a stalk (stipe) that attach to the cap either laterally or centrally depending on the species.

Polypore tubes are a honeycomb-like structure, where the individual tubes have fused together. Their sides are covered with a spore-forming surface, the hymenium. The tubes offer shelter for developing spores and help to increase the area of the spore-producing surface. Pore size and shape vary a lot between species, but little within a species – some &quot;Hexagonia&quot; spp. have 5 mm wide pores whereas pores of &quot;Antrodiella&quot; spp. are invisible to naked eye with 15 pores per mm. Generally the larger the pores, the larger the spores. A few polypores produce asexual spores (chlamydospores or conidia) in the upper surface of their cap (e.g. &quot;Echinopora aculeifera&quot;, &quot;Oligoporus ptychogaster&quot;) or without the presence of a sexual fruit body (e.g. &quot;Inonotus rickii&quot;, &quot;Heterobasidion&quot; spp.).

=== Delimitation (morphology) ===
Most polypores have a poroid hymenium, but not all species. A few, for instance &quot;Elmerina holophaea&quot; and &quot;Lenzites betulina&quot;, form gills like agarics but are still considered polypores, since in all other respects they are similar to closely related polypores, forming tough fruiting bodies on the wood. A couple of species where the tubes have not fused together in a honey-comb manner are variably classified as polypores or not (e.g. &quot;Porotheleum fimbriatum&quot;). There&#x27;s no clear distinction between polypores and hydnoid fungi - some polypores with irregularly poroid lower surface have been considered both polypores and hydnoid fungi (e.g. &quot;Echinodontium tinctorium&quot;, &quot;Irpex lacteus&quot;).

Bolete mushrooms are a separate morphological group not included in polypores even though they have tubes. Fleshy fruiting bodies with a stalk and microscopic characters separate boletes from polypores.

==Ecology==

Bracket fungi often grow in semi-circular shapes, looking like trees or wood. They can be parasitic, saprotrophic, or both. One of the more common genera, &quot;Ganoderma&quot;, can grow large thick shelves that may contribute to the death of the tree, and then feed off the wood for years after. Their hardiness means they are very resilient and can live for quite a long time, with many species even developing beautiful multi-coloured circles of colour that are actually annual growth rings.
Polypores are among the most efficient decomposers of lignin and cellulose, the main components of wood. Due to this ability they dominate communities of wood-rotting organisms in land ecosystems along with corticioid fungi. Through decomposing tree trunks they recycle a major part of nutrients in forests.

Only basidiomycetes are known to initiate lignin degradation (i.e. cause white rot). A 2012 study linked the end of formation of large-scale coal deposits in the end of the Carboniferous period 300 million years ago to the evolution of lignin-degrading basidiomycetes. More efficient degradation of wood by fungi meant less plant material (and hence less coal) accumulating in the soil.

On the other hand, most brown-rot fungi are polypores. These species have lost their lignin degradation ability but are very efficient in degrading cellulose. Brown-rot fungi are prevalent on conifer hosts and open, sun-exposed habitats. The fungal community in any single trunk may include both white-rot and brown-rot species, complementing each other&#x27;s wood degradation strategies.

Polypores and other decomposer fungi are the first step in food chains that feed on decomposed plant material. A rich fauna of insects, mites and other invertebrates feed on polypore mycelium and fruiting bodies, further providing food for birds and other larger animals. Woodpeckers and other hole nesting birds typically carve their nests in softer wood decomposed by polypores.

===Threats===
Almost all polypores are dependent on trees for their survival. Deforestation and intensive forest management cause declines in polypore abundance and diversity. For many species the changes can be too much, and they start a slow slide towards extinction. Since most polypore species are relatively widespread, this process is typically slow. Regional extinctions can happen relatively quickly and have been documented (for instance &quot;Antrodia crassa&quot; in North Europe).

Polypores can decline for many reasons. They can be dependent on a single host or a very special habitat. For instance &quot;Echinodontium ballouii&quot; has been found only in Atlantic white cedar swamps in the Northeastern USA. Species can be dependent on very old tree individuals like &quot;Bridgeoporus nobilissimus&quot; of the Northwestern USA. Both of these species also have a rather restricted range, making them more vulnerable to extinction.

In addition to the host tree individual, the characteristics of the surrounding habitat also matter. Some species prefer closed-canopy forest with a moist, even microclimate that could be disturbed for instance by logging (e.g. &quot;Skeletocutis jelicii&quot;). Others suffer from lack of open forest-fire habitat in areas where fire suppression is done (e.g. &quot;Gloeophyllum carbonarium&quot; in Nordic countries where forest fires are part of the natural forest dynamics).

For most declining species the main problem is lack of dead wood in the forest. When suitable tree trunks are too sparse in the landscape, not all species are able to spread to new trunks after old ones have been consumed, causing the population to decline and eventually vanish. Thus, species that are abundant in old-growth forests with abundant dead wood can be totally absent from managed forests. For instance &quot;Amylocystis lapponica&quot; and &quot;Fomitopsis rosea&quot; are dominant species in North European old-growth spruce forests from Poland to Norway, but absent in managed forests.

Climate change may cause a problem for polypores that are already dependent on a few fragments of old-growth forests and may be unable to migrate with changing vegetation.

===Indicator value===
Polypores have been used as indicator species of healthy natural forests or old-growth forests in Europe. They are good indicators of invertebrate diversity on dead wood and include many endangered species. Polypores make good indicators because they are relatively easy to find – many species produce conspicuous and long-lasting fruiting bodies – and because they can be identified in the field.

The first indicator list of polypores widely used in forest inventories and conservation work was developed in northern Sweden in 1992 (&quot;Steget före&quot; method). &quot;Steget före&quot; list included six polypores in three value classes. In Finland, a list of 30 species for spruce-dominated forests was published in 1993 and widely adopted. Later a similar list for pine-dominated forests was published. Longer lists of indicator species have since been published in Sweden.

Many indicator species are red-listed, but not necessarily all. National red lists of fungi typically include many polypores and are used as indicator lists of conservation value in many European countries.

==Uses==
Some species of bracket fungi are edible, such as chicken of the woods; the lingzhi mushroom is another, which is used in Chinese medicine. They can also be used as a wick in an oil/fat lamp.

The tinder fungus (&quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;) has been used as tinder since at least the time of Ötzi the Iceman. It has also been used to make a material similar to leather.

&quot;Ganoderma applanatum&quot;, the artist&#x27;s conk, is used as a substrate for drawings. Fresh specimens develop dark brown lines when drawn upon with a stylus. The lines become permanent when the specimen is dried.

===Medicinal uses===

Most polypores are edible or at least non-toxic, however one genus of polypores has members that are poisonous. Polypores from the genus &quot;Hapalopilus&quot; have caused poisoning in several people with effects including kidney dysfunction and deregulation of central nervous system functions. Some polypores have been used in ritual and for utilitarian purposes for ages; the famous Ötzi the Iceman was found carrying two different polypore species: &quot;Piptoporus betulinus&quot;, notable for its long usage in European folk medicines, and &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;, which was likely used for starting fires.

Medicinal mushroom polypores in use today are &quot;Ganoderma lucidum coll.&quot; (reishi or lingzhi), &quot;Trametes versicolor&quot; (turkey tail) and &quot;Ganoderma applanatum&quot; (Japanese Kofuki-saru-no-koshikake). Beyond their traditional use in herbal medicine, contemporary research has suggested many applications of polypores for the treatment of illnesses related to the immune system and cancer recovery.

Several species have been studied for their ability to produce compounds with anti-pathogenic activity.

<doc id="302489" wikidata="Q778991" url="?curid=302489" title="In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas">
<text>In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas is a French role-playing game, created by Croc. In Nomine Satanis (&quot;In Satan&#x27;s Name&quot;) was the Demonic player&#x27;s guide and Magna Veritas (&quot;The Great Truth&quot;) was the Angelic player&#x27;s guide.

&quot;In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas&quot; (often abbreviated as INS/MV) was first designed by the French company Siroz, available in its fourth edition. The French edition of the game was stopped in 2006, with the publication of the sourcebook &quot;On Ferme !&quot; (meaning &quot;We close!&quot;). The game relates the events told in the Bible in a somewhat parodical fashion, and explains the existence of other religions and magic with a sense of humor. The backdrop for the game is the modern world, but one where angels and demons incarnate themselves in human bodies in order to fight for good or evil.

The game is somewhat akin to a superhero game, with player characters (PCs) having supernatural powers (fueled by power points) and abilities usually far beyond those of a human. A typical adventure includes a lot of inquiry, detective work and roleplay, sprinkled with a few conflicts followed by a big, final showdown. PCs are supposed to keep secret the existence of supernatural entities, so, in their human guises, have a somewhat &quot;normal&quot; existence. This is often downplayed, however, as many players don&#x27;t wish to roleplay their character&#x27;s human guise of (for example) an accountant.

== Custom system ==
The system is based on a &quot;666-sided&quot; dice, the designers&#x27; name for three six-sided dice interpreted as follows: the first and second dice read as the tens and units, are used to determine success or failure, while the third die determines the degree of success. Modifiers are applied to the dice depending on the difficulty of the task at hand. A result of 111 counts as a critical success for angels, while 666 is a critical failure; the results are the opposite for demons.

Each character has an angelic or demonic superior, from which he gains some abilities and a general outlook, and which he can try to summon for help. They are also subject to a hierarchy to which they must report to, and which controls the characters&#x27; improvement.

==Other versions==
Apart from English, the 2nd Edition of the game has also been translated as &quot;In Nomine: Magna Veritas&quot; in German [&quot;Truant Verlag&quot; (1993)], Spanish [&quot;Joc Internacional&quot;, (1994)] &amp; Polish. The Polish version, called &quot;In Nomine Magnae Veritatis&quot; was quickly removed from shops.

=== &quot;Stella Inquisitorius&quot; ===
Croc also created a space opera sequel to this game, &quot;Stella Inquisitorus&quot; (1993), that takes place in the year 6993.

=== &quot;In Nomine&quot; (&quot;Steve Jackson Games&quot;) ===
The 1997 American game &quot;In Nomine&quot; is based on INS/MV, but the original is considered &quot;much more tongue-in-cheek than the American game&quot;. This was also adapted to GURPS in 2000 as GURPS In Nomine.

==The 5th edition (2015)==
In 2015, a successful crowdfunding campaign provided the budget (in reality, more than 700% of the asked-for budget) for an upcoming new French edition, called &quot;INS/MV : Génération Perdue&quot; (transl. &quot;INS/MV: Lost Generation&quot;).

<text>In Nomine is a title given to a large number of pieces of English polyphonic, predominantly instrumental music, first composed during the 16th century.

==History==
This &quot;most conspicuous single form in the early development of English consort music&quot; originated in the early 16th century from a six-voice mass composed before 1530 by John Taverner on the plainchant &quot;Gloria Tibi Trinitas&quot;. In the &quot;Benedictus&quot; section of this mass, the Latin phrase &quot;in nomine Domini&quot; was sung in a reduced, four-part counterpoint, with the plainchant melody in the meane part. At an early point, this attractive passage became popular as a short instrumental piece, though there is no evidence that Taverner himself was responsible for any of these arrangements. Over the next 150 years, English composers worked this melody into &quot;In Nomine&quot; pieces of ever greater stylistic range.

&quot;In Nomine&quot;s are typically consort pieces for four or five instruments, especially consorts of viols. One instrument plays the theme through as a cantus firmus with each note lasting one or even two measures; usually this is the second part from the top. The other parts play more complex lines, often in imitative counterpoint. Usually they take up several new motifs in turn, using each one as a point of imitation. However, there are &quot;In Nomine&quot;s composed for solo or duo keyboard instruments and even one for the lute: a fantasy titled &quot;Farewell&quot; by John Dowland.

Examples of the genre include compositions by Christopher Tye (the most prolific composer of &quot;In Nomine&quot;s, with 24 surviving settings), Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, John Bull, Orlando Gibbons, Thomas Tomkins, William Lawes, and Henry Purcell, among many others. They can vary in mood from melancholy to serene, exultant, or even playful or hectic (as in Tye&#x27;s In Nomine &quot;Crye&quot;, in which the viols seem to imitate the call of a street hawker).

Composition of &quot;In Nomine&quot;s lapsed in the eighteenth century but was revived in the twentieth century, an early notable example being Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot;, which quotes a keyboard &quot;In nomine&quot; by John Bull. Later examples are found in works by Peter Maxwell Davies and Roger Smalley. Starting in 1999, the Freiburg new-music organization ensemble recherche began commissioning an ongoing series of short &quot;In Nomine&quot; compositions for the festival Wittener Tage für neue Kammermusik. The series is dedicated to , director of the festival since 1989, and is collectively titled the &quot;Witten In Nomine Broken Consort Book&quot;. Some of the notable composers who have contributed pieces to this series to date include Brian Ferneyhough, Georg Friedrich Haas, Toshio Hosokawa, György Kurtág, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, Gérard Pesson, Robert H.P. Platz, Rolf Riehm, Wolfgang Rihm, Salvatore Sciarrino, Hans Zender, and Walter Zimmermann. In 1995, for the 300th anniversary of the death of Purcell, Gavin Bryars composed In Nomine (after Purcell) for the viol consort Fretwork. Graham Waterhouse composed &quot;In Nomine for cello solo&quot; in 2013.

<doc id="302491" wikidata="Q1322943" url="?curid=302491" title="The Majestic (film)">
<text>The Majestic is a 2001 American romantic drama film directed and produced by Frank Darabont, written by Michael Sloane, and starring Jim Carrey in the leading role. The film also features Bob Balaban, Brent Briscoe, Jeffrey DeMunn, Amanda Detmer, Allen Garfield, Hal Holbrook, Laurie Holden, Martin Landau, Ron Rifkin, David Ogden Stiers, and James Whitmore. The film depicts a 1950s Hollywood screenwriter suspected of being a communist. After suffering amnesia as the result of a road accident, he is taken in by the residents of a small town, who mistake him for a local resident who went MIA while serving in the military during World War II.

Carrey&#x27;s performance was a significant departure from his previous work, which until then had mostly been comedy films. The film premiered on December 11, 2001, and was released in the United States on December 21, 2001. It received lukewarm reviews from critics and grossed $37 million worldwide against a budget of $72 million, losing an estimated $35 million.

==Plot==
In 1951, in the heyday of McCarthyism, Peter Appleton is an up-and-coming young screenwriter in Hollywood. He learns from his Hollywood agent Leo Kubelsky and his own attorney Kevin Bannerman that he has been accused of being a communist, because he attended an antiwar meeting in his college years, a meeting he claims he only attended to impress a girl.

In an instant, Peter&#x27;s new film &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; is pushed back for a few months, the credit is given to someone else, his movie star girlfriend Sandra Sinclair leaves him, and his contract with the studio is dropped. Peter gets drunk and goes for a drive up the California coast, where he accidentally drives his car off a bridge to avoid an opossum.

He regains consciousness on an ocean beach, experiencing amnesia. Peter is found by Stan Keller who helps him to the nearby town of Lawson, California. The local doctor Doc Stanton tends to his wounds as Sheriff Cecil Coleman is called in to help with the case. Harry Trimble arrives and believes Peter to be his son Luke who went missing in action (MIA) during World War II, sometime after D-Day. Sheriff Coleman tells Doc to &quot;break it to her gently&quot;. Due to his amnesia, Peter accepts being treated as Luke by the town led by Mayor Ernie Cole. Peter warms to the town including getting to know Harry and Doc&#x27;s daughter Adele who, years earlier, had become engaged to Luke the night before he went to war.

Peter adjusts to his new life and helps to renovate The Majestic, a movie theater that had become derelict due to hard times. Bob Leffert, a veteran of the war who knew Luke, does not believe Peter is Luke, and fears Peter may be setting the town up for heartbreak, given they had lost sixty other young men during the war. Despite this, Peter helps to restore the theater, invigorate the town, and encourages Mayor Cole to display a memorial, commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the town did not previously have the heart to display.

Meanwhile, Peter&#x27;s disappearance leads House Un-American Activities Committee member Elvin Clyde to believe Peter is a communist and he sends two federal agents named Ellerby and Saunders to California to search for him. They follow a lead about his car showing up on a beach.

When The Majestic shows his first movie &quot;Sand Pirates of the Sahara&quot;, and discovers his screenwriting credit on the film&#x27;s poster, Peter is jolted out of his amnesia. Harry suffers from a fatal heart attack before the reel change. After examining him, Doc reports that Harry&#x27;s time is short. Peter cannot bring himself to acknowledge the truth, thus allowing Harry to die believing Peter is Luke.

After the funeral, Peter admits the truth to Adele, who had already suspected it. Before he can tell anyone else in town, federal agents Ellery and Saunders, Leo, and some police officers arrive. When Sheriff Coleman asks if they need any help with anything, the federal agents reveal Peter&#x27;s true identity to the whole town and issue him a summons to appear before a congressional committee in Los Angeles. During their meeting, Leo advises Peter to agree to reveal a list of other named &quot;communists&quot; in order to clear his own name.

Later that night, the Majestic&#x27;s usher Emmett admits that he knew Peter wasn&#x27;t Luke after hearing Peter play a roadhouse boogie at the town festival, since Luke was more inclined to classical music, but kept quiet because he realized the town needed Luke in order to guide it out of its post-war grief.

The next day, Peter goes to the cemetery to return the Medal of Honor to its case in front of Luke&#x27;s memorial. There he finds Adele. They argue over his decision to tell the committee what it wants to hear. She wants him to fight, as she believes Luke would have done. He stalks away without having returned the medal. At the train station, Doc gives Peter a package from her. Opening it on the train, he finds a copy of the Constitution, as well as a letter that Luke had written, in which he expresses his readiness to die for a real cause.

Peter changes his mind at the hearing in Los Angeles, which is heard by all of Lawson. He confronts Congressman Doyle in front of the committee. Peter gives an impassioned speech about American ideals, which sways the crowd, especially when he holds up Luke&#x27;s Medal of Honor, and this compels the lawmakers to let him go free. As Peter discusses the result with his attorney Kevin, he learns that the girl for whom he went to antiwar meeting in college was the very same person who had named him to the committee.

Peter attempts to return to his Hollywood screenwriting career, but finds he cannot deal with the ridiculousness of the studio executives&#x27; ideas, and leaves Hollywood.

After sending Adele a telegram, Peter returns to Lawson, fearing he will not be welcomed. Instead, he receives a hero&#x27;s welcome from the town&#x27;s citizens, who have come to respect him as an individual. Peter then resumes ownership and management of The Majestic, marries Adele, and they have a son together.

==Production==
The original script by Michael Sloane had the working title of &quot;The Bijou&quot;, and was the title when Jim Carrey signed on in August 2000.

The town of Ferndale, California provided many of the interior and exterior locations for &quot;The Majestic.&quot; The namesake theater was built as a false-front in the Ferndale municipal parking lot, and many Main Street buildings were modified by the film company.

Train scenes were recorded on the California Western Railroad in Fort Bragg, California. The lighthouse used was Point Cabrillo Light.

The film is Frank Darabont&#x27;s sole theatrical film that isn&#x27;t a film adaptation of one of Stephen King&#x27;s works.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Majestic&quot; earned $27 million at the box office in the United States and another $9 million outside the United States, which brings the worldwide total to $37 million. The film&#x27;s failure at the box office was partly due to competition with &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 24, 2002, and failed to reach the Top 10.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Majestic&quot; received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 42% based on 144 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Ponderous and overlong, &quot;The Majestic&quot; drowns in forced sentimentality and resembles a mish mash of other, better films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 27 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Kenneth Turan of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that it was a &quot;derivative, self satisfied fable that couldn&#x27;t be more treacly and simple-minded if it tried&quot;.

One exception to this was Roger Ebert, who awarded the film three and a half stars and praised the film and its ideals: &quot;It flies the flag in honor of our World War II heroes, and evokes nostalgia for small-town movie palaces and the people who run them... Frank Darabont has deliberately tried to make the kind of movie Capra made, about decent small-town folks standing up for traditional American values. In an age of Rambo patriotism, it is good to be reminded of Capra patriotism - to remember that America is not just about fighting and winning, but about defending our freedoms.&quot; Ebert also praised Jim Carrey&#x27;s performance stating that he &quot;has never been better or more likable&quot;.

In 2008 interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Darabont said,&quot;The Majestic&quot; is a movie I&#x27;m very proud of and I really love. It achieved exactly what I set out to make. And I find it very moving. But in your very magazine, somebody who praised the hell out of &quot;Shawshank&quot; said, &quot;Frank Darabont needs to apologise for making &quot;The Majestic&quot;.&quot; And I thought, &quot;Really? What did I do? I need to apologise? Kiss my ass!&quot;

<doc id="302493" wikidata="Q161268" url="?curid=302493" title="1,1,1-Trichloroethane">
<text>The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as methyl chloroform and chlorothene, is a chloroalkane with the chemical formula CH3CCl3. It is an isomer of 1,1,2-trichloroethane. A colourless and sweet-smelling liquid, it was once produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent. It is regulated by the Montreal Protocol as an ozone-depleting substance and as such use has declined since 1996. Trichloroethane should not be confused with the similar-sounding trichloroethene which is also commonly used as a solvent.

==Production==
1,1,1-Trichloroethane was first reported by Henri Victor Regnault in 1840. Industrially, it is usually produced in a two-step process from vinyl chloride. In the first step, vinyl chloride reacts with hydrogen chloride at 20-50 °C to produce 1,1-dichloroethane:
:CH=CHCl + HCl → CHCHCl
This reaction is catalyzed by a variety of Lewis acids, mainly aluminium chloride, iron(III) chloride, or zinc chloride. The 1,1-dichloroethane is then converted to 1,1,1-trichloroethane by reaction with chlorine under ultraviolet irradiation:
:CHCHCl + Cl → CHCCl + HCl
This reaction proceeds at 80-90% yield, and the hydrogen chloride byproduct can be recycled to the first step in the process. The major side-product is the related compound 1,1,2-trichloroethane, from which the 1,1,1-trichloroethane can be separated by distillation.

A somewhat smaller amount of 1,1,1-trichloroethane is produced from the reaction of 1,1-dichloroethene and hydrogen chloride in the presence of an iron(III) chloride catalyst:
:CH=CCl + HCl → CHCCl

1,1,1-Trichloroethane is sold with stabilizers because it is unstable with respect to dehydrochlorination and attacks some metals. Stabilizers comprise up to 8% of the formulation, including acid scavengers (epoxides, amines) and complexants.

==Uses==
1,1,1-Trichloroethane is an excellent solvent for many organic compounds and also one of the least toxic of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. It is generally considered non-polar, but owing to the good polarizability of the chlorine atoms, it is a superior solvent for organic compounds that do not dissolve well in hydrocarbons such as hexane. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, it was widely used for cleaning metal parts and circuit boards, as a photoresist solvent in the electronics industry, as an aerosol propellant, as a cutting fluid additive, and as a solvent for inks, paints, adhesives, and other coatings. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was used to dry-clean leather and suede. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is also used as an insecticidal fumigant.

It was also the standard cleaner for photographic film (movie/slide/negatives, etc.). Other commonly available solvents damage emulsion and base (acetone will severely damage triacetate base on most films), and thus are not suitable for this application. The standard replacement, Forane 141 is much less effective, and tends to leave a residue. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was used as a thinner in correction fluid products such as liquid paper. Many of its applications previously used carbon tetrachloride (which was banned in US consumer products in 1970). In turn, 1,1,1-trichloroethane itself is now being replaced by other solvents in the laboratory.

===Anaesthetic research===
1,1,1-Trichloroethane was one of the volatile organochlorides that have been tried as alternatives to chloroform in anaesthesia.
In the 1880s, it was found to be a safe and strong substitute for chloroform but its production was too expensive and difficult for the era.

In 1880, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was suggested as an anaesthetic. It was first referred to as &quot;methyl-chloroform&quot; in the same year. At the time, the narcotic effects of chloral hydrate were owed to a hypothetical metabolic pathway to chloroform in &quot;alkaline blood&quot;. Trichloroethane was studied for its structural similarity to chloral and potential anaesthetic effects. However, trichloroethane did not exhibit any conversion to chloroform in laboratory experiments. The 1,1,2-trichloroethane isomer, which lacked a trichloromethyl group, exhibited anaesthetic effects even stronger than the 1,1,1 isomer.

==Safety==
Although not as toxic as many similar compounds, inhaled or ingested 1,1,1-trichloroethane does act as a central nervous system depressant and can cause effects similar to those of ethanol intoxication, including dizziness, confusion, and, in sufficiently high concentrations, unconsciousness and death. Fatal poisonings and illnesses linked to intentional inhalation of trichloroethane have been reported. 

Prolonged skin contact with the liquid can result in the removal of fats from the skin, resulting in skin irritation.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer places 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Group 2A as a probable carcinogen.

==Atmospheric concentration==
1,1,1-Trichloroethane is a fairly potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential of 169 relative to carbon dioxide. This is nonetheless less than a tenth that of carbon tetrachloride — which it replaced as a solvent — due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 5 years.

The Montreal Protocol targeted 1,1,1-trichloroethane as a compound responsible for ozone depletion and banned its use beginning in 1996. Since then, its manufacture and use have been phased out throughout most of the world, and its atmospheric concentration has declined substantially.

<doc id="302494" wikidata="Q292162" url="?curid=302494" title="Hannah Callowhill Penn">
<text>Hannah Margaret Penn ( Callowhill; 11 February 1671 – 20 December 1726) was an Anglo-American governor. The second wife of Pennsylvania founder William Penn, she effectively administered the Province of Pennsylvania for six years after her husband suffered a series of strokes, and then for another eight years after her husband&#x27;s death. She served as acting proprietor from 1712 until her death in 1726.

==Early life==
Hannah Margaret Callowhill was born in Bristol, England, the daughter of Thomas Callowhill, a merchant there, and Anna (or Hannah) Hollister. 

==Province of Pennsylvania==

A Quaker, she married William Penn on March 5, 1696, when she was 25 and he was 52 at Quakers Friars in Bristol. She was pregnant with their first of eight children when the couple embarked from England for their three-month voyage to what was then British America in 1699. She lived in great style, both in Philadelphia and at Pennsbury Manor, a beautiful estate located in Bucks County, on the Delaware River.

When William Penn died at age 73 on July 30, 1718, his will gave Hannah Penn full control of the Province of Pennsylvania and his fortune. 

William Penn&#x27;s oldest son by his first marriage, William Penn Jr., sought to dismiss his father&#x27;s will in order to obtain control of the colony. His suit was unsuccessful, and Hannah Penn remained in charge of the colony until she died from a stroke in her son&#x27;s house in London at age 55.

Her deputy in Pennsylvania from 1718 until 1727 was William Keith.

She is buried in the same grave as William in the Quaker burial ground at Jordans in Buckinghamshire. in England. 

==Children==
She had nine children with William Penn:

* Unnamed daughter (born and died 1697)
* John Penn (&quot;the American&quot;) (28 January 1700 – 25 October 1746), never married
* Thomas Penn (20 March 1702 – 21 March 1775), married Lady Juliana Fermore, fourth daughter of Thomas, first Earl of Pomfret
* Hannah Penn (1703–1706) 
* Margaret Penn (7 November 1704–February 1751), married Thomas Freame (1701/02-1746) nephew of John Freame, founder of Barclays Bank
* Richard Penn Sr. (17 January 1706 – 4 February 1771) 
* Dennis Penn (26 February 1707 – 1723) 
* Hannah Margarita Penn (1708–March 1708)
* Louis Penn

==Legacy==
Hannah Penn is one of the few individuals and the first woman granted the status of Honorary Citizen of the United States, awarded her by Presidential Proclamation by an Act of Congress (PL. 98-516) by Ronald Reagan on November 28, 1984.

When William Penn was laying out the city of Philadelphia in the early 1680s, he named Callowhill Street in his wife&#x27;s honor. In the 21st century, the neighborhood directly north of Chinatown, which Callowhill Street passes through, became known as Callowhill. Similarly, a street in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, is also named in her honor. A middle school in York, Pennsylvania, is named in her honor.

Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Corbett, named March 12, 2013 &quot;Hannah Callowhill Penn Day.&quot;

Governor Corbett and Mrs. Susan Corbett commissioned a posthumous portrait of Hannah Penn by Pennsylvania portrait artist Ellen Cooper. The portrait was unveiled at a ceremony at the Pennsylvania capitol during Women&#x27;s History Month, March 19, 2014. After being publicly displayed in the governor&#x27;s reception room for several months, on January 15, 2015, the portrait was hung in the Pennsylvania governor&#x27;s office among portraits of other early leaders of Pennsylvania. However, as of March 2015 the portrait is in storage; Governor Tom Wolf asked for it to be moved into the governor&#x27;s reception room, but he said because of safety concerns it was returned to the Historical and Museum Commission. According to Penn Live, &quot;It is likely that it will be sent, for a time, to Pennsbury Manor, the estate from which the Penns first governed the new colony. Then, it is headed to the state museum for an exhibit on Iconic Stories of Pennsylvania.&quot;

On March 19, 2014, the Pennsylvania Commission for Women awarded the first Hannah Penn Leadership Awards to honor Pennsylvania women who have been outstanding mentors and role models through their leadership, service and commitment to empowering women and girls in the commonwealth.

<doc id="302495" wikidata="Q16927561" url="?curid=302495" title="Vim Records">
<text>Vim Records was a short-lived American record label that was active during the early 1900s. Vim discs include issues of ragtime banjo music recorded by Vess L. Ossman.

==History==
The Vim Company was founded in 1896 in Chicago, Illinois, and it was active in labeling records in the first decade of the 20th century. Vim was primarily a sporting goods store but also sold bicycles and electrical goods. &quot;Record Research&quot; newsletter categorizes the firm as a &quot;Department Store Label&quot;, meaning the owners entered an agreement with an already established record company, and &quot;... they proceeded to have their own records pressed with the name of the department store prominently printed on the label.&quot;

Vim Records were single-sided lateral cut disc records. Vim was recorded and manufactured by the International Talking Machine Company and Leeds &amp; Catlin.

The company offices were moved between 1901 and 1903. Known address are:
* 56-60 Fifth Avenue, Chicago, Illinois
* 68 E. Lake Street, Chicago, Illinois (1903); after street renumbering this was 10 Lake Street
* 39 S. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois; Company Headquarters

A branch office was opened in late 1903 at 704 West Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa. In 1906 the branch was moved to 808 West Walnut Street, and in 1907 it was moved to 204 7th Street. This location remained open until late 1908 when the firm of Harger &amp; Blish, an established firm from Dubuque, Iowa, were appointed the jobbers in Des Moines.

The last listing for the firm producing records in Chicago was in the &quot;Edison Phonograph Monthly&quot; January 1910 issue.

The owner and president of the company was Leon Atwell Olmsted, a native of New York who moved to Chicago in the 1890s. After opening his first store in 1896, he eventually expanded to seven stores in Chicago and another seventeen throughout the nation. It was reported that he died in a fire at his home in Minocqua, Wisconsin, at the age of 63, but it was soon learned that he died of exhaustion after fighting the blaze. At the time of his death in 1936 the stores were being managed by his son Leslie B. Olmsted.

==Record numbers==
The record numbers on Vim labels can be broken down into multiple series. The following companies are known to have produced records for Vim.

* Leeds &amp; Catlin: V-prefixed records are from Sun and associated labels
* International Record Company (IRC): X-prefixed records are from Excelsior and associated labels

All unprefixed record numbers in the chart below appear to have been produced by IRC. Every artist and recording name matches up with the IRC catalog numbers.

==Record labels==
The word &quot;Vim&quot; in stylized cursive text appears on all of the record labels along with a double lined border, the company name, &quot;Chicago, Ill.&quot;, and the words, &quot;For Any Disc Talking Machine&quot;. The background color for all labels is beige, but in some photos the coloring appears to be white, light yellow, or mint green. Aging and years of handling have caused some labels to become dark beige in appearance.

Some labels have the recording details (record number, artist, etc.) printed in black ink while others are in red ink. It is unknown if there is any significance to the printing color of the recording details.

==Recordings==
All recordings in this chart must be verified by seeing the information on a Vim Record label or in a Vim Company catalog. A Leeds &amp; Catlin or International Record Company catalog that do not specifically state &quot;Vim Record&quot; are not sources for adding new records to this chart.

Unconfirmed information in any row must have an asterisk symbol (*) placed beside the information. This may happen because the label is not readable or the information was not printed on the label. The International Record Company recording catalog is useful for obtaining Vim Records information, but unless actually seen on a Vim label, all such information should be marked with an asterisk symbol.

All information in the chart must be placed in order by the &quot;Record Number.&quot;

==Other labels==
There are at least two other record labels that use/used the acronym &quot;VIM.&quot;
* Variety In Music (VIM), in New York City, approximately 1959–1964 
* Very Important Music (V.I.M.), in Thessaloniki, Greece, established in 2007

<doc id="302506" wikidata="Q14333188" url="?curid=302506" title="Jelly fungus">
<text>Jelly fungi are a paraphyletic group of several heterobasidiomycete fungal orders from different classes of the subphylum Agaricomycotina: Tremellales, Dacrymycetales, Auriculariales and Sebacinales. These fungi are so named because their foliose, irregularly branched fruiting body is, or appears to be, the consistency of jelly. Actually, many are somewhat rubbery and gelatinous. When dried, jelly fungi become hard and shriveled; when exposed to water, they return to their original form.

Many species of jelly fungi can be eaten raw; poisonous jelly fungi are rare [needs source] and may not even exist. However, many species have an unpalatable texture or taste. They may or may not be sought in mushroom hunting due to their taste, which is described as similar to that of soil. However, some species, &quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; for example, are not only edible but prized for use in soup and vegetable dishes.

==Notable jelly fungi==
*&quot;Ascocoryne sarcoides&quot; – jelly drops, purple jellydisc (often mistaken for basidiomycota but is not)
*&quot;Auricularia heimuer&quot; – wood ear, black fungus
*&quot;Auricularia auricula-judae&quot; – wood ear, Judas&#x27; ear, black fungus, jelly ear
*&quot;Auricularia nigricans&quot; – cloud ear
*&quot;Calocera cornea&quot;
*&quot;Calocera viscosa&quot; – yellow tuning fork, yellow stagshorn fungus
*&quot;Dacrymyces palmatus&quot; – orange jelly
*&quot;Dacryopinax spathularia&quot;
*&quot;Exidia glandulosa&quot; – black jelly roll, witches&#x27; butter
*&quot;Exidia recisa&quot; - amber jelly roll, willow brain
*&quot;Guepiniopsis alpina&quot; – golden jelly cone
*&quot;Phlogiotis helvelloides&quot; – apricot jelly
*&quot;Myxarium nucleatum&quot; – crystal brain, granular jelly roll
*&quot;Pseudohydnum gelatinosum&quot; – jelly tooth, jelly tongue
*&quot;Tremella foliacea&quot; – jelly leaf
*&quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; – snow fungus
*&quot;Tremella mesenterica&quot; – witches&#x27; butter, yellow brain fungus
*&quot;Tremellodendron&quot; and &quot;Sebacina&quot; spp. – jellied false corals

<text>Proto-Esperanto () is the modern term for any of the stages in the evolution of L. L. Zamenhof&#x27;s language project, prior to the publication of in 1887.

==The Neo-Jewish language of ca. 1879==
The precursors to the Esperanto alphabet can be found in Zamenhof&#x27;s proposal for the use of Latin script in his Litvish-based unified Yiddish project (, &quot;Neo-Jewish language&quot;).
The consonant letters are equivalent to those of modern Esperanto, apart from lacking a letter for . The diacritic, however, is an acute: &quot;ć, h́, ś, ź&quot; (the last for Esperanto &quot;ĵ&quot; ). The vowel letters are the same apart from there being no &quot;ŭ&quot;. Their values are similar to Esperanto in the Litvish reading, with the addition of &quot;oŭ&quot;, though Poylish reading is divergent. There was in addition a letter &quot;ě&quot; for the schwa, which only appeared before the consonants &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot; and was replaced by &quot;e&quot; in some circumstances. The circumflex is used, but indicates that a letter is not pronounced: e.g. is pronounced . The following is a sample, with Litvish and Poylish readings: 

Neo-Jewish: 
Litvish reading: 
Poylish reading: 

==The of 1878==
As a child, Zamenhof had the idea to introduce an international auxiliary language for communication between different nationalities. He originally wanted to revive some form of simplified Latin or Greek, but as he grew older he came to believe that it would be better to create a new language for his purpose. During his teenage years he worked on a language project until he thought it was ready for public demonstration. On December 17, 1878 (about one year before the first publication of Volapük), Zamenhof celebrated his 19th birthday and the birth of the language with some friends, who liked the project. Zamenhof himself called his language (Universal Language).

&quot;W&quot; is used for &quot;v&quot;. Otherwise, all modern Esperanto letters are attested apart from those with diacritics (&quot;ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ&quot;). Known verb forms are present &quot;-á&quot;, imperative &quot;-ó&quot;, infinitive &quot;-are&quot;. Nouns were marked by &quot;-e&quot; in the singular and &quot;-es&quot; in the plural; the article was singular &quot;la&quot; and plural &quot;las&quot;. It appears that there was no accusative case, and that stress was as in modern Esperanto, except when marked, as in &quot;-á&quot; and &quot;-ó&quot;.

Only four lines of the stage of the language from 1878 remain, from an early song that Zamenhof composed:

In modern Esperanto, this would be,
 remains an idiom in modern Esperanto, an allusion to this song.

==The of 1881==
While at university, Zamenhof handed his work over to his father, Mordechai, for safe-keeping until he had completed his medical studies. His father, not understanding the ideas of his son and perhaps anticipating problems from the Tsarist police, burned the work. Zamenhof did not discover this until he returned from university in 1881, at which point he restarted his project. A sample from this second phase of the language is this extract of a letter from 1881:
Modern: 
:(My dearest friend, never (lit. &#x27;when&#x27;) would my innocent pen become a tyrant for you. From a hundred of your letters I can conclude that announcements of this kind must wound your brotherly heart; I [can] already see you thus...)

By this time the letter &quot;v&quot; had replaced &quot;w&quot; for the [v] sound; verbal inflection for person and number had been dropped; the nominal plural was &quot;-oj&quot; in place of &quot;-es&quot; (as well as adjectival &quot;-a&quot; and adverbial &quot;-e&quot;); and the noun cases were down to the current two (though a genitive &quot;-es&quot; survives today in the correlatives). The accusative case suffix was &quot;-l&quot;, but in many cases was only used on pronouns: 
: () &#x27;The princess needed to receive this rose and this nightingale&#x27;.

In addition to the stronger Slavic flavor of the orthography compared to the modern language (&quot;ć, dź, h́, ś, ź&quot; for &quot;ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ&quot; ), the present and past imperfective verb forms still had final stress:
: present tense &quot;-è&quot;, imperfect &quot;-à&quot;, preterite &quot;-u&quot;, future &quot;-uj&quot;, conditional &quot;-as&quot;, jussive &quot;-ò&quot; and infinitive &quot;-i&quot;.

The pronouns ended in a nominal &quot;o&quot; (or adjectival &quot;a&quot; for possessives: &quot;mo&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;ma&quot; &quot;my&quot;), but there were other differences as well, including a conflation of &#x27;he&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;: 
In addition, there was indefinite &quot;o&quot; &#x27;one&#x27;.

The correlatives were similarly close, though it is not clear if there was a distinction between indefinite and relative forms (modern &quot;i-&quot; and &quot;ki-&quot;; these may have corresponded to &quot;kv-&quot; and &quot;k-&quot;) and no possessive forms are known:
The last row was evidently pronounced as &quot;fj-&quot;. 

Esperanto at this stage had a consonantal ablaut in verbs, with a voiceless consonant for an attempt at something, and a voiced consonant for success. For example, to listen (for), to hear; to look for, to find; to argue (a point), to prove. Traces of this remain in a few pairs of words such as &#x27;to weigh (an item)&#x27; and &#x27;to weigh (have weight)&#x27; (cf. their derivatives &#x27;scales&#x27; &amp; &#x27;a weight&#x27;).

==Transition to the modern Esperanto of 1887==
Zamenhof refined his ideas for the language for the next several years. Most of his refinements came through translation of literature and poetry in other languages. The final stress in the verb conjugations was rejected in favour of always stressing the second-last vowel, and the old plural &quot;-s&quot; on nouns became a marker of finite tenses on verbs, with an imperfect &quot;-es&quot; remaining until just before publication. The Slavic-style acute diacritics became circumflexes to avoid overt appearances of nationalism, and the new bases of the letters &quot;ĵ, ĝ&quot; (for former &quot;ź, dź)&quot; helped preserve the appearance of Romance and Germanic vocabulary.

In 1887 Zamenhof finalized his tinkering with the publication of the (&quot;First Book&quot;), which contained the Esperanto language as we know it today. In a letter to Nikolai Borovko he later wrote,
==Later proposals by Zamenhof==
By 1894, multiple proposals to change Esperanto had appeared.
Zamenhof was pressured to incorporate them into Esperanto, and in response reluctantly presented a reformed Esperanto in 1893. A vote was put to the members of the Esperanto League, including all subscribers to &quot;La Esperantisto&quot;, and the proposal was voted down 60% opposed to 5% in favor, with a further 35% wanting different reforms.

<text>Heather Laurie Holden (born December 17, 1969) is an American-Canadian actress, producer, model, and human rights activist. She is best known for her portrayals as Marita Covarrubias in &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1996–2002), Andrea Harrison in AMC&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2010–2013, 2020–2022), and Amanda Dumfries in &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007). 

Holden is also known for her roles as Adele Stanton in &quot;The Majestic&quot; (2001), Cybil Bennett in &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (2006), Olivia Murray in &quot;The Shield&quot; (2008), Renee in &quot;The Americans&quot; (20172018), and the Crimson Countess in &quot;Vought News Network: Seven on 7 with Cameron Coleman&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Boys&quot; (2022).

Born in Los Angeles and raised in Toronto, Holden holds dual citizenship in the United States and Canada.

Holden received her first film role when she was a young child. While her stepfather was directing &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, she visited him on the set. A child actress hired to play Rock Hudson&#x27;s daughter never arrived, so Laurie filled in for her. As a teenager, she won the &quot;Look of the Year&quot; modeling contest in Toronto and was given a minor role as a babysitter in Anderson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Separate Vacations&quot; (1986).

After graduating from the Bishop Strachan School, Holden attended McGill University, where she studied economics and political science. She transferred to University of California, Los Angeles and received a degree in theater and film in 1993.

<text>Charles Luckyth Roberts (August 7, 1887 – February 5, 1968), better known as Luckey Roberts, was an American composer and stride pianist who worked in the jazz, ragtime, and blues styles. Roberts performed as musician, band/orchestra conductor, and dancer. He taught music and dance. He also owned a restaurant and bar in New York City and in Washington, D.C.
Luckey Roberts noted compositions include &quot;Junk Man Rag&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Pork and Beans&quot; (1913), and &quot;Railroad Blues&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Childhood with Traveling Vaudeville Acts===

Luckey Roberts was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, and was playing piano and acting professionally with traveling Vaudeville and Negro minstrel shows in his childhood. His father, William Roberts, an unaccredited self-taught veterinarian, was overwhelmed by the responsibility of single-parenthood when his mother, Elizabeth Williams Roberts, tragical died just three weeks after his birth. His father engaged the Ringolds, a show-business family, to raise him. With the Ringolds influence, he became a lifelong Quaker, teetotaler (Teetotalism), and abstained from using tobacco. His first stage performance was as a toddler with a troupe performing Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin. His vaudeville career began at age 5.

By the age of 7, he had taught himself to play piano, but only in the key of F-sharp, which is based on the black keys. As a child, he was paid to sing and dance with &quot;Gus Sulky (sometimes spelled Gus Selke) and his Pickaninnies&quot; in theater work as a picaninny. His father was involved in his childhood, ensuring his health and happiness. One biographer reports: &quot;One night his father saw him perform for the first time dressed only in a raffia shirt. Enraged, Roberts Sr. stopped the show. The packed house roared, thinking the scene was part of the show.&quot;

Reconciliation was made, and Roberts&#x27; father financed a visit to Lonnie Hicks (Hoofers Club), a leading ragtime pianist, who Roberts later credited with mentoring his early career in music. Roberts also performed with Mayme Remington&#x27;s &quot;Black Buster Brownies Ethiopian Prodigies&quot;. For about a 10-year period, Roberts toured Europe three times in addition to many USA performances which showcased his childhood talents of singing, dancing, tumbling, and juggling. Mayme Remington&#x27;s troupe paid him $1.25 weekly plus room and board and tutoring (from the team &quot;Prevost, Rice &amp; Prevost&quot;), and sent his father $5 weekly for five years. Roberts accompanied the drum corps at Philadelphia&#x27;s First Regiment Armoury one summer.

Roberts performed at Billy William&#x27;s restaurant, in Baltimore, Maryland, in the summer of 1905. Roberts took fighting lessons from Joe Gans, a former lightweight champion boxer. During this time he and pianist Eubie Blake, a lifelong friend, at Joe Gans&#x27;s saloon, collaborated on ideas for piano composition. During another vacation from annual vaudeville touring, he performed at the Green Dragon saloon in Philadelphia.

===1910 and the origins of Stride ===

Roberts settled in New York City about 1910. He became one of the leading pianists in Harlem and started publishing some of his original rags, assisted by Artie Matthews although he regularly won cutting contests he was still learning how to annotate music: 
On December 28, 1911, he married his lifelong partner Lena Sanford Roberts, a musical comedy actress, who he met while they were traveling with J. Leubrie Hill in the &quot;My Friend from Dixie&quot; company. Lena frequently performed as a soloist in Roberts&#x27;s bands in the Harlem Renaissance and throughout his career.

In 1911, Roberts composed &quot;The Junk Man Rag&quot;, but since he could not yet notate music, he elicited ragtime pianist Artie Matthews&#x27;s help to create publishable sheet music. In 1913, &quot;The Junk Man Rag,&quot; a one-step, with lyrics Chris Smith and Ferd Mierisch, for &quot;Turkey Trot Opera&quot; written by Will Marion Cook. &quot;The Junk Man Rag&quot; was subsequently published both as an instrumental (piano) solo and as a song (with lyrics by Chris Smith (composer) (1879–1949) and Ferd E. Mierisch (fl. 1911–1914), by Jos. W. Stern &amp; Co., 102-104 W. 38th St., N.Y., 1913 Roberts sheet music was often annotated as being &#x27;simplified&#x27; since the complex ornamentation and decoration that he and the other ragtime performers embellished into their pieces were not easily scored or played by others. Fortunately, there are existing recordings and piano rolls of Roberts and contemporaries performing &quot;The Junk Man Rag&quot;:

A complete analysis of Roberts work would therefore necessarily entail an in-depth analysis of the published scores, a study of any existing piano rolls (which don&#x27;t always capture the dynamics) and recordings (which at the time had difficulty capturing rapid embellishments), as well as a consideration of interviews and contemporary commentary which give insight into the performance improvisation and reading the room whether for stage performance, a cutting competition, or private dance entertainment.

Roberts next big hit was &quot;Pork and Beans&quot;, annotated as a One-Step or Two-Step and recognized as a Fox Trot, and an early example of Stride (music) style. Some notable recordings of &quot;Pork and Beans&quot; exist at the Library of Congress and on YouTube:
From 1911 to 1919, among other work, Roberts served as the music director with producers Homer Tutt and Salem Tutt Whitney in their &quot;Southern Smart Set Company&quot;, an off-broadway troupe, that produced the &quot;Smart Set&quot; musical comedy 
 Together they formed the Roberts &amp; Tutts Publishing Company, 110 West 130th St. New York City, and some of Robert&#x27;s compositions were published as sheet music from Smart Set Company musical comedies. Tutt Brothers hired Roberts to write some musical comedies:
These successes led to a series of very popular compositions by Roberts for solo piano and song (vocalist and piano):
In 1913, through the encouragement of Lester Walton, Roberts teamed up with lyricist Alex Rogers to produce Broadway musicals, many of which resulted in subsequent publication of popular sheet music. Roberts successful partnership with Rogers lasted until 1930 when Rogers died.

For many years, Roberts held side jobs: doubled as a pool hustler, taught music and dance, and taught boxing and swimming at the YMCA.

===World War I (1914 - 1918)===

During World War I, he served with the 369th Infantry Regiment (United States) &quot;Hellfighters&quot; platoon and band. Roberts toured France and the UK with James Reese Europe during World War I.

Notable war-themed works:
Through these associations he became an occasional performer for the Vernon and Irene Castle dance team.

===1920s===

When Roberts returned to New York where he wrote music for various shows and recorded piano rolls.

With James P. Johnson, Roberts developed the stride piano style of playing about 1919. Roberts&#x27; reach on the keyboard was unusually large (he could reach a fourteenth), leading to a rumor that he had the webbing between his fingers surgically cut, which those who knew him and saw him play live denounce as false; Roberts simply had naturally large hands with wide finger spread.

Roberts was the orchestra director of Shuffle Inn (165 West 131st Street, New York), named after hit musical revue &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, a venue that opened in November 1921 and was managed by Jack Goldberg.
 In 1923, the Shuffle Inn moved to basement next door to the Lafayette Theatre and was renamed Connie&#x27;s Inn.

Roberts 1920s hit &quot;Railroad Blues&quot;, a fox trot, was published and recorded for solo piano, as a song with vocalist and piano, and as an orchestration. In &quot;Railroad Blues&quot;, Roberts mimics the sounds of a train using his stride (music) techniques:
His other 1920s notable solo works with various lyricists include:
In the 1920s Roberts toured with, &quot;Luckey Roberts and His 12 Browns&quot; on Vaudeville.

===Roberts and Rogers Collaboration (1913-1930)===

In 1920, Roberts and Alex Rogers started the publishing company, Rogers &amp; Roberts at 386 Cumberland Street in Brooklyn, at first releasing songs from their musical comedy &quot;Baby Blues.&quot; Throughout the 1920s, Roberts composed music and co-wrote Broadway musicals, generally credited with contributing to 23 musicals, as well as radio comedy shows. Many of their successful numbers were performed by famous show celebrities include They wrote successful numbers for such famous show folk as Molly Williams, Nora Bayes, Bert Williams, Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, and Marie Cahill.

====Radio Comedy====

Alex Rogers and Roberts wrote all the material for the radio comedy show Two Black Crows, featuring Moran and Mack, broadcast every Sunday night at 9 p.m. over station WABC for several months. They collaborated to write the sketch. Roberts played piano solos and Alex Rogers played a character in the skit. A few recordings are available online as audio files at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Library:
====Broadway and Off-Broadway Musicals====

====Hit Singles====

Among the hit singles with music by Roberts and lyrics by Rogers were:
====Comedy Phonographic (Monologue, Sketch, Song)====

The Library of Congress National Jukebox archive and the University of California San Diego&#x27;s Discography of American Historical Recordings Collection include a number of routines written by Rogers and Roberts. These are often performed by Rogers with Roberts accompanying on piano. Eddie Hunter, a comedian and the star of Broadway show &quot;How Come&quot; recorded and sold several commercially.

====Contributions to the Ziegfeld Follies====

Having been introduced to Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. by Will Marion Cook, Roberts composed numbers for Bert Williams, then the star of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;.

Roberts created and performed
&quot;Midnight Frolic Glide&quot;, the finale of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.&#x27;s two-season (1916–1917) &quot;Follies&quot;, that clicked on the New Amsterdam Roof. A recording (Victor 35645-A, recorded July 2, 1917, Conway&#x27;s Band, Patrick Conway, Conductor) includes &quot;Midnight Frolic - Medley Fox Trot&quot; likely this piece, although generally the entire show music is credited to David Stamper.

The records are scarce for determining exactly which comedy routines written by Roberts and Rogers were performed in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; by comedians like Bert Williams and Eddie Cantor, but their comedy sketches featuring Eddie Hunter are representative. For example, Bert Williams performed &quot;Elder Eatmore&#x27;s Sermon&quot;.

Around August 1927, Florenz Ziegfeld hired Rogers and Roberts to select and work with a chorus of 40 performers for &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

===Entertainer for Social Registered Aristocracy===

In 1924, Luckey accepted an elite social-function gig at the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, a resort for New York Society &quot;snowbirds&quot;. He moved his band seasonally to Palm Beach to accept the many requests for private entertainment for their various social functions. At the time, he 
charged about $1,700 for a single engagement, and his musicians were among the highest paid in the profession. It was noted in that the foxtrot and the Charleston were commonly danced at these parties. Elmer Snowden, a banjo player in Robert&#x27;s group, recalled playing for millionaires as late as 1935 to 1939. Although Society was hit hard by the Great Depression, Roberts, admired for his generosity, was resilient and reported to have anonymously given away Christmas baskets during the hardest years.

Roberts performed in Palm Beach and New York City Society Dinner Parties. Roberts frequently helped New York Society ladies with charity entertainment both by performing at charity events and by instructing society ladies in dance for their own benefit performances.
More than 100 guests was a dinner-dance enjoyed Roberts playing in the dining salon and then on the top deck of the floating hotel, Amphitrite, at a party given by Mrs. James Deering in honor of Princess Rospigliosi. In addition to playing the piano and leading his band, Roberts would sometimes dance for guests, with mentions of such at parties of Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt 2d particularly noted in newspapers.

Throughout his life, Roberts earned money through side occupations of dancing, playing pool, and giving instruction in music, dance, boxing, and swimming. The records of these engagements are scarce; however, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; featured articles about his tutelage of the New York Society in dance, particularly to learn the &quot;Charleston&quot;. New York Society ladies, while at their summer homes in Palm Beach, were putting on a special charity event version of the Ziegfeld Follies, with Society Ladies performing alongside a few Ziegfeld girls in dance routines. Roberts was employed to teach dance to these members of the Social Registered Aristocracy.

Among his students were Mr. and Mrs. Joshua S. Cosden, Mrs. Louis G. Kaufman, Mrs. William K. Dick (Madeleine Force, the former widow Mrs. John Jacob Astor), Mrs. Theodore Frelinghuysen, Mr. and Mrs. Edward F. Hutton, Countess Salm, Mr. and Mrs. J. J. O&#x27;Brien, Florenz Ziegfeld, Billie Burke, wife of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., Harold Vanderbilt, Mrs. A. J. Drexel Jr. and Major and Mrs. Barclay Warburton, Mrs. Frederick Frelinghuysen, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Breese, Mrs. Ernest Gagne, Rodman Wanamaker, Paris Singer, Mrs. Edward Shearson, Mrs. Gurne Munn, and Marilyn Miller.

Roberts and returned to New York after the season, and resumed teaching society there alongside Paul Bass. Grace Robinson, of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote:

&quot;If the dulcet strains of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; which afford the very best Charlestoning, float out of exclusive $40,000-a-year Fifth ave. apartments as you rattle by in a bus, you may know that Lucky Roberts and Paul Bass are still earning gin and baby shoes.&quot;

Roberts relayed that Mrs. Louis G. Kaufman was his most proficient pupil, and was learning the 30 original Charleston steps and their 1000 variations, including &quot;the camel walk&quot;, &quot;the Charleston kick&quot;, &quot;the scissors step&quot;, and &quot;falling off the log and tap&quot;.

Roberts suggested that Palm Beach lessons were easier because the Palm Beachites practiced in bathing suits after their morning dip, a costume that &quot;afforded freedom of movement&quot;. Roberts explained when the number called on dancers to &quot;droop their knees&quot; that the ladies &quot;knocked their kneebones together almost as well as Paul or I could do it.&quot; Roberts is quoted: 
&quot;&quot;It takes a lot of patience to teach these here society folks,&quot; admits Lucky. &quot;But once they get the swing of it, there&#x27;s no stopping them.&quot;&quot;

===World War II (1939–1945)===

Thirty years after composing the syncopated tune &quot;Ripple of the Nile&quot; (1912), which proved too difficult for most players of the day and was not copyrighted or published, Roberts drastically slowed the tempo around 1940 to teach it to a student. Realizing that it sounded good as a ballad, he collaborated with Kim Gannon to add lyrics and published it under a new title, &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot;.

Glenn Miller and his orchestra performed the number first on New York&#x27;s station WABC, and it rapidly became among top ten on &quot;Hit Parade&quot;. &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot; was recorded by the Glenn Miller Orchestra with vocal support by Ray Eberle and the Modernaires, and was the best selling record in the United States for ten weeks in 1942. &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot; was the number one American song hit of World War II and sold over one million recordings by Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller.

Its fast rise from No. 9 in March 1942 to No. 1 by May 1942 was celebrated by &quot;Variety (magazine)&quot;, which hailed it as &quot;No. 1 all over the nation&quot;; &quot;Billboard (magazine)&quot;, which gave it a
leading position for several weeks; and &quot;New York Enquirer&quot;, which listed it as no. 1 in sheet music sales of the eastern states and the West Coast, and no. 2 in the Middle West. &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot; became &quot;the&quot; song of wartime America.

Through cards and letters, the armed forces voted Glenn Miller&#x27;s recording of &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot; as No. 1 Hit
of America, prompting an April 11, 1942 thank you from Glenn Miller. Mary Martin sang it on-air radio for Hollywood to the armed forces of the nation on April 18, 1942; soon after many celebrities performed and recorded it, including Horace Heidt, Tommy Tucker (bandleader), Joe Reichman and his orchestra, Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol.

===1940s–1960s===

Roberts remained an active composer and performer his entire life. Notable compositions from his later years: 
Reportedly with the income he earned from the sales of &quot;Moonlight Cocktail&quot; and another semi-popular song &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, Roberts opened Luckey&#x27;s Rendezvous [Rendezvous Inn, Rendezvous Club], (773 St. Nicholas Avenue) which quickly became an active as a venue for many styles of music, employing opera singers as waiters who also performed, jazz musicians, and a feature point of the evening entertainment being a solo piano performance by Roberts himself. He sold the venue in 1954. It&#x27;s been said that Roberts had big hands, and an even bigger heart. Rumor was that he gave away so many free drinks that the business eventually failed.

Robert composed a classical, a three-movement Spanish Suite (1939), reworking earlier work &quot;Spanish Fandango&quot; as a movement. &quot;Spanish Suite&quot; was performed with symphonic orchestra in his Carnegie Hall concert, August 1939. Eleanore Roosevelt (Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt) was among his patrons.

July 1, 1940, Roberts was severely injured in an automobile accident: his jaw, his right hand, and both feet were broken.

Roberts composed &quot;miniature syncopated rhapsody&quot; for piano and orchestra called &quot;Whistlin&#x27; Pete&quot; (1941). Despite recent injuries and strokes, Roberts performed a full concert of his own compositions at the New York City Town Hall on May 28, 1941.

On 18 January and 8 February 1946, Roberts performed as pianist with an all-star traditional jazz group for the first two shows in
the radio series &quot;This Is Jazz&quot;; and the following he recorded &quot;Railroad Blues&quot; and his five durable compositions: &quot;Ripples of the Nile,&quot; &quot;Pork and Beans,&quot; &quot;Shy and Sly,&quot; &quot;Music Box Rag,&quot; and &quot;Junk Man Rag&quot; for Blesh&#x27;s Circle label.

His wife Lena Sanford Roberts passed away in 1958.
In 1958, Roberts suffered a stroke shortly before recording an album, Harlem Piano Solos. Later, a second stroke impaired his control of his left hand.

An astute businessman, Roberts became a millionaire twice through real estate dealings. He reportedly owned a bar in New York City and a restaurant in Washington, D. C. He was very generous throughout his life, and had paid for a medical library at Harlem Hospital.

Very late in life, Roberts wrote two more musicals:

He passed away before they could be realized.

On February 5, 1968, Roberts died in New York City. He is buried at the Frederick Douglass Memorial Gardens in Bay Terrace on Staten Island, New York.

<text>Nel Ust Wyclef Jean (; born October 17, 1969) is a Haitian rapper and record producer. At the age of nine, he emigrated with his family to the Northeastern United States. In 1990, he formed the New Jersey–based hip hop trio Fugees with fellow musicians Lauryn Hill and Pras Michel; Jean served as its lead producer and guitarist. The group released the albums &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Score&quot; (1996), the latter becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Following their success, Jean released his debut solo album, &quot;Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival&quot; (1997), which yielded the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten single &quot;Gone till November&quot;.

Jean guest appeared on Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;No, No, No&quot;, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Afterwards, he co-wrote the 1999 singles &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; for Whitney Houston, and &quot;Maria Maria&quot; for Santana. His second solo album, &quot;The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book&quot; (2000), was supported by the top 40 single &quot;911&quot; (featuring Mary J. Blige) and received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His third album, &quot;Masquerade&quot; (2002), peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He guest performed on Shakira&#x27;s 2006 single, &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The following year, his single &quot;Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)&quot; (featuring Akon, Lil Wayne and Niia), peaked within the chart&#x27;s top 15 and preceded his sixth studio album, &quot;Carnival Vol. II: Memoirs of an Immigrant&quot; (2007). It moderately entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and marked his final to be released by a major label.

In 2007, Jean was appointed Ambassador-at-Large of the Republic of Haiti by President René Préval. In 2010, he filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election. However, Haiti&#x27;s Provisional Electoral Council ruled him ineligible to stand for office, as he had not met the constitutional requirement to have been a resident in Haiti for five years prior to the election. Jean&#x27;s highly publicized efforts to raise relief funds after the 2010 Haitian earthquake were channeled through his charitable organization, Yéle Haiti. The charity, which conducted education and welfare activities in Haiti between 2005 and 2010, effectively closed in 2012. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that much of the earnings raised by the organization in the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon were retained by Jean.

He is the recipient of three Grammy Awards, the BET Humanitarian Award, and a Vanguard Award from the NAACP Image Awards, in addition to being nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his musical work. In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Jean with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Officer. Jean has also been inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Jean is one of the artists who have reached the most radio charts on &quot;Billboard&quot;.

==Early life==
Named after the biblical scholar John Wycliffe, Wyclef Jean was born in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti on October 17, 1969. At nine years old, he emigrated with his family to Brooklyn, New York City, and ultimately settled in East Orange and Newark, New Jersey. Jean began to make music as a child, and as a teen, his mother, having recognized his musical talent, bought him a guitar. He has cited reggae artist Bigga Haitian as one of his early influences, as well as neighborhood heroes MC Tiger Paw Raw and producer Lobster v. Crab. He has stated that he played music to earn respect.

Jean graduated from Newark&#x27;s Vailsburg High School and enrolled for one semester at Five Towns College in New York. In 2009 he enrolled in the Berklee College of Music to pursue his diploma. Jean has been a resident of Saddle River, South Orange, and North Caldwell, New Jersey.

==Music career==
===Fugees (1988–1997)===
Jean and other musicians formed a group in the 1980s under the name Tranzlator Crew. Jean and band member Lauryn Hill pursued a romantic relationship beginning in 1992, and ending in 1997, the year of the band&#x27;s breakup. Jean later revealed that Hill&#x27;s dishonesty about the parentage of her child, Zion David, caused the rift that split the group up. After they signed with Ruffhouse Records and Columbia Records in 1993, they renamed their group the Fugees – an abbreviation of &quot;refugees&quot;, and also a sometimes derogatory reference to Haitian immigrants. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blunted on Reality,&quot; was released in 1994. It achieved limited commercial success, peaking at number 62 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album peaked at number 122 on the UK Albums Chart in 1997, and it was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP). &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot; spawned three singles: &quot;Boof Baf&quot;, &quot;Nappy Heads&quot; and &quot;Vocab&quot;. &quot;Nappy Heads&quot; was the Fugees&#x27; first single to be ranked on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, charting at number 49.

In 1996, the Fugees released their second album, titled &quot;The Score.&quot; The album achieved significant commercial success in the U.S., topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was later certified as six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed well in several overseas nations, topping the Austrian, Canadian, French, German and Swiss albums charts, while also peaking at number two in Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Four commercially successful singles were released from &quot;The Score&quot;; &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;, the first single from the album, peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA and by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). The other three singles – &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot; and &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; – did not appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as they were not released for commercial sale, making them ineligible to appear on the chart, although they all received sufficient airplay to appear on the Hot 100 Airplay and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay charts. &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, a cover of the Roberta Flack song &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;, performed strongly in other territories, topping the singles charts in Australia, Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom, among several others.

&quot;Ready or Not&quot; peaked at number one in the UK and at number three in Sweden. &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; – a cover of the Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers song of the same name – topped the singles chart in New Zealand. The Fugees collaborated with singer Bounty Killer on the single &quot;Hip-Hopera&quot; and recorded the single &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; in 1997: although they have not released any studio albums since &quot;The Score&quot;, a compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released in 2003, and spawned the single &quot;Take It Easy&quot;.

===1997–2004===
==== Start of solo career ====
Jean announced plans to begin a solo career with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Wyclef Jean Presents the Carnival Featuring the Refugee All-Stars&quot; (generally called &quot;The Carnival&quot;). The album&#x27;s guests included Fugees members Lauryn Hill and Pras, along with Jean&#x27;s siblings&#x27; group Melky Sedeck; the I Threes (back-up vocals for Bob Marley); The Neville Brothers and Celia Cruz. The album was a hit, as were two singles: &quot;We Trying to Stay Alive&quot; (adapted from the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;) and &quot;Gone till November&quot; (recorded with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra).

Released in 2000, Jean&#x27;s second solo album &quot;The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book&quot; was recorded with guests including Youssou N&#x27;Dour; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Kenny Rogers; The Rock; and Mary J. Blige. With Blige, he released &quot;911&quot; as a single. He was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Act at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards.

Following the 9/11 attacks, Jean participated in the benefit concert &quot;&quot;, contributing a cover of the Bob Marley song &quot;Redemption Song&quot;. His third album, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, was released in 2002. His fourth album, &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Son&quot;, was released in November 2003 as the follow-up to his first solo album, &quot;The Carnival&quot;. In 2004, he released his fifth album, &quot;Sak Pasé Presents: Welcome to Haïti (Creole 101)&quot; (released in the U.S. by Koch Records). Most of its songs are in his native language of Haitian Creole like &quot;Fanm Kreyòl&quot; with the French Caribbean Admiral T. Jean also figured on the album &quot;Mozaik Kreyòl&quot; of this one in the song &quot;Secret Lover&quot;. He then covered Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s song &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004) and wrote the song &quot;Million Voices&quot; for the film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; (2004).

====Songwriting and producing====
Jean co-wrote &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; for Whitney Houston&#x27;s album of the same name. He produced and wrote songs for the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme&#x27;s 2003 documentary &quot;The Agronomist&quot;, about the Haitian activist and radio personality Jean Dominique. With Jerry &#x27;Wonder&#x27; Duplessis, Jean also composed the score of the documentary &quot;Ghosts of Cité Soleil&quot;, He helped produce the film and appears briefly onscreen speaking by telephone in 2004 to a &quot;chimere&quot; gang-leader and aspiring rapper, Winston &quot;2Pac&quot; Jean.

=== &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; and &quot;The Carnival Vol. II&quot; (2004–2009) ===

During a period between 2004 and 2006, fueled by a reunion performance in the documentary &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2005), it appeared that the Fugees would record a new album. However, Pras claimed to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;To put it nicely, it&#x27;s dead.&quot; Pras said the root of this animosity was the third member of the group, Lauryn Hill, and was quoted in &quot;Billboard&quot; as saying; &quot;Me and Clef, we on the same page, but Lauryn Hill is in her zone, and I&#x27;m fed up with that shit. Here she is, blessed with a gift, with the opportunity to rock and give and she&#x27;s running on some bullshit? I&#x27;m a fan of Lauryn&#x27;s but I can&#x27;t respect that.&quot;

In 2006, Jean was featured in Shakira&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;. The song went on to reach number one in over 55 countries. Jean and Shakira went on to perform the song at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2007 Grammy Awards. He joined Shakira on various dates of her Oral Fixation Tour in the U.S. Also in 2007, Jean scored the Angelina Jolie documentary &quot;A Place in Time&quot;.

In August 2007, Jean released a new song called &quot;Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)&quot; featuring Lil Wayne, Niia and Akon, which references the song &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; by the Wu-Tang Clan. One month later he released an album that he recorded in Atlanta, Georgia, with the help of T.I., who also collaborated with Jean on the songs &quot;You Know What it is&quot; and &quot;My Swag&quot; on the latter&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;T.I. vs. T.I.P&quot;. In 2008, an upbeat single &quot;Let Me Touch Your Button&quot; featuring will.i.am was released in the UK in conjunction with Jean&#x27;s involvement with UK MOTOROKRSTAR. Jean released a song with Serj Tankian called &quot;Riot&quot;.

In 2009, Jean was featured on the song &quot;Spanish Fly&quot; with Ludacris and Bachata group Aventura included on Aventura&#x27;s album &quot;The Last&quot;, released in June. On June 17, 2009, Jean announced via Twitter that his new album would be called &quot;wyclefjean&quot; and was to be released sometime in February 2010. The first single from &quot;wyclefjean&quot; was to be titled &quot;Seventeen&quot; and feature Lil Wayne. In August 2009, Jean unveiled his video &quot;Haitian Slumdog Millionaire&quot; featuring Haitian artist Imposs. Making a guest appearance in the video was New York City entrepreneur and philanthropist Ali Naqvi.

=== &quot;Divine Sorrow&quot; and World Cup Song (2009–2016) ===
In November 2009, a track titled &quot;Suicide Love&quot; featuring rapper Eve leaked online prior to the release of his EP. Wyclef Jean&#x27;s EP named &quot;From the Hut, to the Projects, to the Mansion&quot; was released on November 10, 2009. It includes seventeen tracks, featuring Eve, Cyndi Lauper, Timbaland, and Lil&#x27; Kim. In this album, Wyclef uses the alias Toussaint St. Jean, his alter ego, when he raps.

Jean&#x27;s self-entitled studio album was due to be released in 2011, but has yet to surface. &quot;Hold On&quot;, the lead single from the project, features dancehall artist Mavado. In May 2014, a Jean video, &quot;April Showers&quot;, was banned from YouTube after Cathy Scott, author of &quot;The Killing of Tupac Shakur&quot;, lodged a copyright infringement complaint claiming an image in the video was similar to an autopsy photo released in her book. YouTube temporally banned the video. TMZ, which broke the story, reported that Scott and the video&#x27;s director, Hezues R&#x27;, had settled the matter and agreed that Hezues R&#x27; would include a screen credit to the book at the end of the video.

Jean worked with Avicii on a single titled &quot;Divine Sorrow&quot; from his upcoming EP &quot;J&#x27;Ouvert&quot;. He collaborated again with Avicii in 2015 on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot; on the album &quot;Stories&quot;, which also featured Matisyahu. This marks the third collaboration with Avicii and Jean, following &quot;Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)&quot; and &quot;Divine Sorrow&quot;.

Jean appeared as a featured vocalist in The Knocks&#x27; single &quot;Kiss The Sky&quot;, which was released in January 2016. This song was part of their debut album, entitled &quot;55&quot;, released in March 2016. Jean was also featured on the Young Thug song &quot;Kanye West&quot;, from the rapper&#x27;s mixtape &quot;Jeffery&quot;, released in August 2016.

Wyclef wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Purpose: An Immigrant&#x27;s Story&quot; with the help of journalist Anthony Bozza, published in September 2012.

=== &quot;Carnival III&quot; and &quot;Wyclef Goes Back to School&quot; (since 2016) ===
On May 17, 2016, Wyclef released his first song in two years, which gave hints to a new album release. A month later on June 17, he released a new song called Hendrix, and later released a short film featuring Michael K. Williams. He then did many interviews teasing that his new J&#x27;ouvert Extended Play would drop in November. Although, this release was pushed back into February. To promote his EP, he did a concert at Terminal 5. On October 14, 2016, Wyclef released an election song called &quot;If I Was President 2016&quot; that would be featured on his J&#x27;ouvert EP. On November 1, 2016, he released a song that he had collaborated on with Young Thug. The song was called &quot;I Swear&quot;, which is also featured on his EP. Wyclef had also collaborated on Young Thug&#x27;s Jeffery Mixtape, and was featured on Thug&#x27;s song &quot;Kanye West&quot;. Young Thug also had a song named &quot;Wyclef Jean&quot; that was named after him because he was such a big influence.

In January 2017, Wyclef announced that his &quot;J&#x27;ouvert&quot; EP would be released on February 3, 2017. On February 2, 2017, Wyclef released his new single &quot;Ne Me Quitte Pas&quot;, which was featured on his &quot;J&#x27;ouvert&quot; Deluxe EP. The EP was released and charted at 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and 50 on the Canadian Hot Albums. Four more singles were released from the album, &quot;Life Matters&quot;, &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;Holding onto the Edge&quot; and &quot;Little Things&quot;. On June 9, Wyclef announced on his Instagram that &quot;Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee&quot; would become available to pre-order on June 22, 2017.

In November 2017, Wyclef released his, &quot;Wyclef Jean Inspired By&quot; mixtape. The mixtape features reworks of some of today&#x27;s most popular records like &quot;Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s&quot; &quot;DNA.&quot; The project also offers up social commentary in the track, &quot;Chain Gang Free &quot;Meek Mill&quot;&quot;, features an original song called, &quot;Camels and Ferraris&quot;, and also pays tribute to the late &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; on, &quot;Inspired By Whitney&quot;.

In December 2017, Wyclef along with Naughty Boy appeared on the final of the fourteenth series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, guest performing &quot;Dimelo&quot; with contestants Rak-Su. Rak-Su won and the performance was released as the winner&#x27;s single.

On December 25, 2017, Wyclef announced The Carnival Tour via social media. The tour had two legs with a total of 56 shows. It started on February 9, 2018, and ended on October 26, 2018.

On March 8, 2019, Wyclef released his ninth studio album, &quot;Wyclef Goes Back to School Volume 1&quot;.

==Yéle Haiti==

In 2001, Jean established Yéle Haiti, a charitable organization known legally as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and incorporated in Illinois. Following 2004&#x27;s Hurricane Jeanne, the organization provided scholarships to 3,600 children in Gonaïves, Haiti. It continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years.

After the 2010 Haitian earthquake, Yéle became prominent in raising funds for disaster relief. According to Jean, Yéle raised over $1 million in 24 hours over Twitter. Jean took part in an MTV donation drive and other publicized fundraising, such as the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon, which he organized with actor and producer George Clooney. Yéle donated funds to orphanages, street cleaning crews, hospitals and medical clinics and organized food service to provide hot meals to refugees and victims of the catastrophe.

By February 2010, questions were reported about the history and management of Yéle. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the charity had failed to file tax returns for several years. The former executive director, Sanjay Rawal, questioned Yéle&#x27;s ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls.

By August 2012, chief executive Derek Q. Johnson was the last remaining officer of the charity. He resigned and announced that Yéle was closed, saying in a statement, &quot;As the foundation&#x27;s sole remaining employee, my decision implies the closure of the organization as a whole.&quot; New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman investigated Yéle and attempted to reach a settlement over allegations of mismanagement. Schneiderman said that the charity had made improper payments to Jean, members of his family, and personal acquaintances. In 2010, after the earthquake in Haiti, Yéle spent more than $9 million – with half of it going to travel expenses by Jean and his entourage, consultants&#x27; fees, and real estate fees. The charity has been the subject of lawsuits in Haiti for unpaid debts.

==Politics==
Jean has supported politicians in Haiti. In 2011 he told &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; that he was &quot;a big fan of Sarah Palin&quot;, former vice-presidential candidate of the Republican Party. It was reported erroneously that Jean would be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa.

===2010 Haitian presidential campaign===
On August 5, 2010, Wyclef confirmed rumors that he was running for president of Haiti during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer. The journalist questioned the rapper&#x27;s citizenship qualifications, asking about his passport. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; magazine reported at the time that Jean would retire as chairman of Yéle Haiti. On August 5, Jean formally filed papers as a candidate for the 2010 Haitian presidential election. Wyclef intended to run as a candidate for the Viv Ansanm (Live Together) political party.

On August 20, 2010, his bid for candidacy was rejected by Haiti&#x27;s Provisional Electoral Council. He was turned down because he did not meet the constitutional residency requirement of having lived in Haiti for five years before the November 28 election. Jean said, &quot;I respectfully accept the committee&#x27;s final decision, and I urge my supporters to do the same&quot;.

==Appearances in television and film==

<text>Pierre Mertens (9 October 1939 – 19 January 2025) was a Belgian writer and lawyer who specialised in international law, director of the Centre de sociologie de la littérature at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and literary critic with the newspaper &quot;Le Soir&quot;.

==Life and career==
Influenced by Franz Kafka, Mertens started to publish novels and short stories in 1969 and received the Prix Médicis in 1987 for &quot;Les éblouissements&quot;. He nevertheless continued his activities as a lawyer, participating in many battles for human rights. In 1989, he entered the Académie royale de langue et littérature de Belgique, and was also named &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; by France.

Mertens reflected much on the social function of the writer. For him, private life, fiction, and history were inseparable. Thus he granted a central place to the memory in the creation of his works. To him the novelist finds his inspiration in their personal and the historical past. Mertens was particularly marked by the activities of his parents, his father a journalist and music lover and his mother a biologist and pianist. He was also much affected by the German occupation, the execution of the Rosenbergs and the tragedy of the miners of Marcinelle in 1956. Later as a scholar of international law he denounced the genocide in Biafra, torture in Ireland, and the prisons of Pinochet.

Another important inspiration was music. In his novels, one finds the influence of music, such as the leitmotifs which cross them (the figure of the tiger, for example). He was also the author of a booklet on opera, &quot;La passion de Gilles&quot; (1982).

His travels and his extensive education gave him an international perspective. In &quot;Les Bons offices&quot; (1974) and &quot;Terre d&#x27;asile&quot; (1978) Belgian history is presented from a foreign perspective. Mertens often saw his country as a synthesis of Europe and its problems.

He caused controversy in his homeland with his book &quot;Une paix royale&quot;, published in 1995, which tells a fictionalised story of Belgium&#x27;s royal family, mixing fiction and reality. He was tried and forced to remove a couple of pages from the subsequent editions.

Mertens died on 19 January 2025, at the age of 85.
