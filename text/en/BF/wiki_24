<text>were a Japanese alternative rock band formed in 1989. With a career spanning 35 years they are best known for providing the soundtrack for the anime series &quot;FLCL&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1989–1994)===

In 1989 Kenji Ueda, bassist for Kenzi &amp; The Trips, left the band with former Kenzi&#x27;s drummer Shinichiro Sato and invited The Coin Locker Babies vocalist Sawao Yamanaka to form a new band. Yoshiaki Manabe, the guitarist of the hair metal band Persia, joined them. The Pillows were formed on 16 September 1989. The story as to where the band&#x27;s name came about is that allegedly Sawao Yamanaka was hanging out at Yoshiaki Manabe&#x27;s place and an English post-punk compilation record entitled &quot;Pillows &amp; Prayers&quot; hanging on Manabe&#x27;s wall inspired him.

Ueda and Yamanaka were the main songwriters and The Pillows released their first EPs, &quot;Pantomime&quot; and &quot;90&#x27;s My Life&quot; in 1990 under Captain Records.

In 1991 they contracted with major label Pony Canyon and released their debut single, &quot;Ame ni Utaeba&quot;, in May and their first full-length record &quot;Moon Gold&quot; in June.

In 1992 The Pillows visited England to record their second full-length album, &quot;White Incarnation&quot;, and filmed the promotional video for their second single, &quot;Kanojo wa Shisuta&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;White Incarnation&quot;, Ueda left The Pillows due to disagreements with other members and musical differences.

After a year with no activity or leadership, Sawao Yamanaka took over Ueda&#x27;s leadership role and recruited Tatsuya Kashima as a replacement on bass, restarting the band. Out of respect for Ueda, Kashima was labeled as a guest musician on releases on which he performed and Ueda&#x27;s bassist post has never been officially replaced. The extremely rare &quot;The Pillows Presents Special CD&quot;, released only to The Pillows fanclub, contained their first recordings with Kashima.

In 1994 The Pillows changed to King Records and the band wildly experimented between varying genres. In July The Pillows released their first album as a trio, Kool Spice, and one month later the single &quot;Daydream Wonder&quot; was released.

===Breakthrough and &quot;FLCL&quot; (1995–2000)===

In March 1995 The Pillows released their fourth album, &quot;Living Field&quot;. Their subsequent single, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, was used in the romance movie &quot;Love Letter&quot;.

In the following year, after the release of their fifth single &quot;Tiny Boat&quot;, The Pillows would release a series of singles such as &quot;Strange Chameleon&quot;, &quot;Swanky Street&quot;, and &quot;Trip Dancer&quot; that were featured on their breakthrough and acclaimed album &quot;Please Mr. Lostman&quot;.

In March of the same year, due to the success of &quot;Please Mr. Lostman&quot; The Pillows released one of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Kanojo wa Kyou&quot; as a single. Later that year, two new singles were released, &quot;One Life&quot; in June and &quot;Hybrid Rainbow&quot; in November, which became one of The Pillows&#x27; most recognizable songs, being largely featured on concert set lists.

In January 1998, The Pillows released their twelfth single &quot;Another Morning&quot; and their first concert DVD &quot;Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown&#x27;s Happy Zoo&quot;. The last three singles were featured on their sixth album &quot;Little Busters&quot;, which came out in February and became one of their most well known and commercial records. Two more singles followed, &quot;Instant Music&quot; and &quot;No Self Control&quot; would both be used on their 1999 album &quot;Runners High&quot;.

The year of 1999 started with the release of &quot;Runners High&quot; and to celebrate their 10th anniversary, The Pillows released their first video clips compilation DVD, &quot;We Have a Theme Song&quot;, followed by two new singles (&quot;Carnival&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot;), both featured on the second studio album release of that year, &quot;Happy Bivouac&quot;. This record pays tribute to the Pixies in songs such as &quot;Back Seat Dog&quot; and &quot;Kim Deal&quot; and it is the first album to feature support bassist Jun Suzuki as a replacement for Kashima.

In the same year, The Pillows were approached by the anime studio Gainax, which licensed The Pillows&#x27; three previous albums for the soundtrack of the original video animation &quot;FLCL&quot;. The Pillows also composed two new songs for the show, &quot;Ride on Shooting Star&quot; and &quot;I Think I Can&quot;, which were later included on their greatest hits compilation album &quot;Fool on the Planet&quot;.

Due to their participation in &quot;FLCL&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack, The Pillows enjoyed a popularity increase, making their western fan base grow. This allowed them to release their &quot;Ride on Shooting Star&quot; single in the United States in 2000 and later tour that country.

===Early 2000s, 15th anniversary and US debut (2001–2006)===

After their participation on FLCL&#x27;s soundtrack, The Pillows released their first greatest-hits compilation album &quot;Fool on the Planet&quot; in 2001 and also a live DVD called &quot;Busters on the Planet&quot; and a new album, &quot;Smile&quot;.

In 2002, the FLCL anime became available in the United States, giving the band more notoriety outside of their native country. In October of the same year &quot;Thank You, My Twilight&quot;, The Pillows&#x27; tenth studio album, was released alongside a double-CD collection of B-sides entitled &quot;Another Morning, Another Pillows&quot;, following the promotional single &quot;White Summer and Green Bicycle, Red Hair with Black Guitar&quot;.

In 2003, The Pillows released their second video clips DVD &quot;Dead Stock Paradise&quot;, one single, &quot;Terminal Heaven&#x27;s Rock&quot; and one more studio album, &quot;Penalty Life&quot;, which was later released in the US by Geneon in 2005.

To commemorate the band&#x27;s 15th anniversary, The Pillows re-released their &quot;90&#x27;s My Life&quot; EP with additional tracks and released a string of new material, including a new EP with re-recorded tracks previously published between 1990 and 1996, &quot;Turn Back&quot;, one document DVD, &quot;Walkin&#x27; on The Spiral&quot;, one new studio album, &quot;Good Dreams&quot;, a new single, &quot;Sono Mirai wa Ima&quot; and finally a tribute album, &quot;Synchronized Rockers&quot;, including covers of The Pillows played by artists such as Mr. Children, Straightener and Noodles.
In January 2005 The Pillows released the live DVD &quot;916&quot; which features footage of their 15th anniversary concert of 2004.

In March 2005, The Pillows played their first show in the United States at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, followed by concerts in New York City and San Francisco. In September, the band released a live DVD entitled &quot;Delicious Bump Tour in USA&quot;, featuring footage of their first tour in America with fellow band Noodles and also a new single, &quot;Non Fiction&quot;. 
In November they released their second single of the year, &quot;The Third Eye&quot;. Both singles were used on their subsequent 2006 album, &quot;My Foot&quot;.

In February 2006 to help promote the &quot;My Foot&quot; tour, one track of the album, &quot;Gazelle City&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single. The album was released in the United States in July 2006 by Geneon, with a growing international fan-base and growing domestic sales of their albums and singles over the past four years.

In June, The Pillows returned to North America during their tour in support of the album &quot;My Foot&quot;, with several more dates in the U.S. and a show in Mexico City.

===Move to Avex Trax, 20th and 25th anniversaries (2007–2014)===
In 2007, The Pillows released their 25th single, &quot;Scarecrow&quot; which was used in the anime series Moonlight Mile, being included on their next album, &quot;Wake Up! Wake Up! Wake Up!&quot;. This album marks their first release on the Avex Trax label.

In August, the band released one more single, &quot;Ladybird Girl&quot;, which is being used as the theme song for the Japanese version of the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Ben 10&quot;.

In November, the band released a five-disc singles collection, &quot;Lostman Go to Yesterday&quot;, featuring all the band&#x27;s singles released under the King Records label and 21 music videos on a DVD in the same collection. On the same day they also released their fifth live DVD, &quot;Lostman Go to America&quot; featuring footage of their 2006 American tour in support for the album &quot;My Foot&quot;.
In January 2008, the band released a live DVD, &quot;Wake up! Stand up! and Go!&quot;, featuring footage of their Wake Up! Tour of 2007 and a single, &quot;Tokyo Bambi&quot;.
On May a new single came out, &quot;New Animal&quot;, and along with their previous two singles, it is featured on their fifteenth studio album, &quot;Pied Piper&quot;.

The band returned to the US starting with Los Angeles, followed by other appearances at SXSW, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Anime Boston, where the band played for a crowd of more than 5,000 people.

Still in 2008, legendary English rock band Oasis extended an offer for The Pillows to play as the opening act at their concert in Japan, but frontman Sawao Yamanaka refused their offer. In a January interview for &quot;Japanzine&quot;, Yamanaka joked that he &quot;turned down the offer in order to have a fun story to tell&quot;.

In 2009, in order to celebrate their upcoming 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a series of releases called &quot;Late Bloomer Series&quot;. It includes two DVDs: &quot;Pied Piper Go to Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Blue Song With Blue Poppies&quot;, two best-of compilation albums, &quot;Rock Stock &amp; Too Smoking the Pillows&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Pillows&quot;, a single &quot;Ameagari ni mita Maboroshi&quot; (featured on their 16th studio album &quot;OOPArts (Out of Place Artifacts)&quot;) and later the DVD of their anniversary concert, &quot;Lostman Go to Budokan&quot;, released in the following year.

On 16 September, The Pillows gave their first concert in the legendary Nippon Budokan arena commemorating their 20th anniversary. The footage of the concert was later released in 2010 as their ninth live DVD, &quot;Lostman Go to Budokan&quot;.

In 2010, The Pillows recorded Rodeo Star Mate, their 30th single and opening theme song for the series, &quot;Stitch – Itazura Alien no Daibouken&quot;.

In June, The Pillows released their 10th live DVD, &quot;Parts of OOParts&quot; including footage of their 2010 OOParts tour. Then in December, the single, &quot;Movement&quot;, was released.

In January 2011 The Pillows released their 17th studio album &quot;Horn Again&quot; with previously released singles included. In February The Pillows released their first single of the year, &quot;Tabasco Disco&quot;, which was only available for purchase to concert audiences.

In June of the same year, The Pillows recorded &quot;Comic Sonic&quot; as the ending theme for the anime adaptation of the manga &quot;Sket Dance&quot;.

In September The Pillows and fellow band Noodles toured America for the second time together in the NAP Tour. They performed in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Austin, Texas.

In October they released a live DVD, Born Again, containing footage of their 2011 Horn Again Tour, and in December they released the single, &quot;Energia (エネルギヤ)&quot;.

On 18 January 2012 The Pillows released their album, &quot;Trial&quot; and, on the same day, a live DVD entitled &quot;We Are Friends&quot;, which included footage of their 2011 NAP Tour in America with Noodles. In June, following their Trial tour, the band released the DVD &quot;Real Trial&quot; containing the last live performance of the tour at Zepp Tokyo.

In a similar fashion to the &quot;Late Bloomer Series&quot; celebrating the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a string of releases over 2013 and 2014 in honor of their 25th anniversary. Entitled &quot;Never Ending Story&quot;, this series of releases comprised a new tribute album (&quot;Rock and Sympathy&quot;), DVDs and Blu-ray&#x27;s (&quot;Revival of Motion Pictures&quot; and “Do You Remember The 2nd Movement?”), a box set (&quot;Our Black Flag&quot;), three new singles (&quot;Future&quot;, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and &quot;About a Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Band&quot;) and finally, The Pillows&#x27; 19th studio album &quot;Moondust&quot;. The band also performed three shows in 2014 representing each era (&quot;movement&quot;) of their sound with Kenji Ueda being invited to play bass at a single show where The Pillows performed songs from his time with the band.

On 4 October 2014 the band concluded the &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; campaign with the &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Today&quot; show at Tokyo Dome City Hall and, on the same date, released &quot;Bootleg the Pillows 1992–1993&quot;, a compilation featuring various previously unreleased recordings. Their 25th anniversary concert DVD/ Blu-ray was released on January 1st, 2015.

===New FLCL seasons and 30th Anniversary (2015–2019)===
Following the end of the &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; campaign, The Pillows began the &quot;Moondust Light for You&quot; tour at the beginning of 2015 in support of the &quot;Moondust&quot; album. The last concert of the tour was later released as a DVD/Blu-ray on 26 August 2015.

In May 2015, the band announced that longtime bassist Jun Suzuki had been fired from the band due to &quot;bad conduct&quot; that had been going on for some time. In this announcement, Yamanaka also discussed the possibility of continuing on without a &quot;fixed&quot; bass player. In place of Suzuki, who went on to form the band SABAH, The Pillows played with various different bassists for their remaining 2015 live shows. These included several appearances with original Pillows member Kenji Ueda and former &quot;support member&quot; Tatsuya Kashima, as well as Tomoyuki Miyakawa (of HiGE), and Yoshinori Arie (of Vola and the Oriental Machine). By 2016, the band had named Arie as their official replacement for Suzuki.

in 2016, The Pillows released a new B-sides compilation entitled &quot;Across the Metropolis&quot; as well as their 20th studio album. Entitled &quot;Stroll and Roll&quot;, the album includes a new version of &quot;Radio Telegraphy&quot;—originally recorded as a collaboration with Ryosuke Sasaki of A Flood of Circle—and &quot;One Flew Under the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, a live venue/mail order exclusive single. The album was released on 6 April, and features bass tracks performed by Kenji Ueda, Tatsuya Kashima, Yoshinori Arie, Tomoyuki Miyakawa, and Yamanaka&#x27;s bandmate in The Predators, Jiro (of Glay). Additionally, The Pillows announced that &quot;Stroll and Roll&quot; would not be released on Avex Trax, as the band had signed to Yamanaka&#x27;s Delicious Label with distribution by The Pillows&#x27; previous label King Records. The &quot;Across the Metropolis&quot; compilation was the band&#x27;s last release with Avex Trax. The Pillows embarked on a 27-date tour in support of &quot;Stroll and Roll&quot; spanning from 6 May to 22 July, with the last show at Zepp Tokyo being recorded for &quot;Stroll and Roll Band&quot;, a live DVD/Blu-ray released on 23 November.

On 3 July 2016, it was announced that The Pillows would be providing the soundtrack for the anime series &quot;FLCL&quot; over two new seasons that eventually aired in 2018. 

A new Pillows song entitled &quot;Be Wild&quot; was featured in a commercial for wrestler Eri Tosaka, who won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s freestyle 48 kg event at the 2016 Summer Olympics (Tosaka herself is a Pillows fan, utilizing their song &quot;Funny Bunny&quot; as her fight song).

On November 2016, The Pillows released a digital single entitled &quot;Be Your King&quot; and on March 2017 they released a new studio album named &quot;Nook in The Brain&quot;. On March 2017 a limited single entiled &quot;The World There Is Nowhere&quot; was released as live venue/mail order only exclusive and later appeared in the soundrack of the movie 王様になれ (Be Your King). The &quot;Nook in The World&quot; tour&#x27;s last concert was released as a DVD/Blu-ray on November 2017.

Following the release of the second season, &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot;, Adult Swim sponsored and presented a seven city tour across the US alongside a band on the same label called Noodles, as well as Cullen Omori formerly of the Smith Westerns.

On 5 September 2018, Toho released the fourth soundtrack from the anime series FLCL entitled &quot;Fool on Cool Generation&quot;. The collection features 14 tracks composed by The Pillows, including music found in the &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot; and &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; anime seasons, released together as part of the dual-theatrical showings of both series in Japan.

The Pillows released their 22nd studio album, &quot;Rebroadcast&quot;, under King Records and Delicious label on 19 September 2018. The Rebroadcast tour &quot;Life is Only Once&quot; DVD/Blu-ray was released on September 2019.

In March 2019, The Pillows announced their participation on the tribute album for UNISON SQUARE GARDEN&#x27;s 15th anniversary as a band, covering the song &quot;Shoegazer Speaker&quot;. It was released on 24 July.

In May 2019, it was announced that The Pillows&#x27; new song &quot;Happy Go Ducky!&quot; would be used as the opening theme for the anime series Ahiru no Sora premiering in October.

To celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a feature film entitled 王様になれ (&quot;Be the King&quot;) with music and original story by Sawao Yamanaka was released in Japan in the Fall season of 2019. Shûji Okui is responsible for the script and direction. The film stars actor Amane Okayama as Yuusuke, a young man who works in a ramen shop frequented by numerous Japanese rock bands. Yuusuke dreams of being a photographer, and he decides to follow his dreams by becoming a cameraman for live concert events. Ousama ni Nare also features appearances by numerous musicians, including: Teru and Jiro of Glay; Atsushi Horie, Hidekazu Hinata and Shinpei Nakayama of Straightener; Hirotaka Takahashi of The Predators; Ryosuke Sasaki, Tomoya Tabuchi, Hiroaki Arai and Hiroyuki Suzuki of THE KEBABS; Yoko and Shinya Kusube of Casablanca; Hirata Panda, Beat Ryo, Hoshikawa Don&#x27;t Let Me Down, Honma Domino and Chiba O&#x27;Reilly of THE BOHEMIANS; Eiichi Miyamoto of syurispeiloff; Ena Fujita, Asako Miyazaki, Aya Matsuoka and Misaki Yoshikawa of SHISHAMO.

As another celebration of 30 years of the pillows&#x27; existence, the band also held their own temporary museum. Titled &quot;the pillows museum: Buster&#x27;s Diner&quot; the event took the form of a vintage American diner filled with memorabilia related to the band. The shop also sold FLCL themed collaboration goods. The museum ran from 30 August 2019, to 8 September 2019, at Shibuya Tower Records, followed by a run from 13 to 22 September 2019 in Osaka.

=== 35th Anniversary and disbandment (2020–2025) ===
On 18 March 2020, the band released their 30th anniversary concert at Yokohama Arena as a DVD/Blu-ray entitled &quot;Thank You My Highlight&quot; and throughout 2021 until 2023 they released more DVDs/Blu-rays of the &quot;Do You Remember The Third Movement?&quot; series of concerts.

In anticipation of their 35th anniversary the band released a DVD/Blu-ray of their 2023-2024 &quot;Lostman Go to The City&quot; tour on June 2024 as well as a documentary. Entitled &quot;Talking About a Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Band&quot; it consists of interviews with friends from other bands such as Base Ball Bear, THE BOHEMIANS, SHISHAMO, go!go!vanillas, ArtTheaterGuild and Kaminarigumo.

On 16 September 2024, the band celebrated their 35th anniversary with a concert at Toyosu Pit. The live footage was eventually released as a DVD/Blu-ray in 2025. On November 2nd the band released &quot;Blank&quot;, their last single.

On 31 January 2025, The Pillows disbanded after their last concert at KT Zepp Yokohama on the same date.

==Logo and mascot==
Buster-kun has been The Pillows&#x27; mascot since about 1998, when on a visit to London, the band saw a doll of a &quot;grotesque and creepy-looking teddy bear&quot; in a shop window. Since then it has been constantly used in promotional videos, album artwork and goods such as T-shirts and bracelets. Buster-kun was named after the &quot;Little Busters&quot; album and the group also uses the term &quot;little busters&quot; for its fans.
The original doll can be seen in the promotional video for the song &quot;Hybrid Rainbow&quot; and on the DVD video and artwork cover of the &quot;Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown&#x27;s Happy Zoo (Instant Show)&quot; DVD.

In an interview, Sawao commented on the reason why they adopted Buster-kun and what it represents to the band&#x27;s music: 
&quot;The original doll was made out of really dirty old leather and had a real-looking eye and tongue, but one of the eyes was a button and it was displayed in a window, shaking like it was being electrocuted.
We still don&#x27;t know what it was and why it was there, because it wasn&#x27;t in a store display window and it didn&#x27;t look like it was for commercial purposes, but it just seemed like someone&#x27;s idea of a prank or some artist&#x27;s work that we thought was interesting. So we used it in our jacket booklet and while we were on tour, we thought of placing that bear image on T-shirts, so we sent the picture to a designer to arrange it. At first it looks cute, but once you get up close, it has sharp teeth like it&#x27;s ready to bite any minute. So that kind-of-cute but kind-of-scary look fits right in with The Pillows music perfectly.&quot;.

<text>The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is an annual physics competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first IPhO was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.

Each national delegation is made up of at most five student competitors plus two leaders, selected on a national level. Observers may also accompany a national team. The students compete as individuals, and must sit for intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honourable mention.

The theoretical examination lasts 5 hours and consists of three questions. Usually these questions involve more than one part. The practical examination may consist of one laboratory examination of five hours, or two, which together take up the full five hours.

== History ==
The idea of creating the International Physics Olympiad was conceived in Eastern Bloc countries, inspired by the 1959 established International Mathematical Olympiad. Poland seemed to offer the best conditions at the time, and so the first IPhO was held in Warsaw in 1967, organized by Czesław Ścisłowski. Some months prior to the competition, all Central European countries were invited, and the five countries Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania participated. Each country sent a delegation of three students and one supervisor. Already in this first edition, the competition consisted of two exams, one theoretical and one experimental, and the students went on excursions while their exams were marked.

The second IPhO was held in Hungary, with the additional participation of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Subsequent editions were carried out in the following years in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania. At that sixth IPhO in 1972, France joined the competition as the first Western country and Cuba as the first non-European country. With growing size and organizational effort (and no participation fee at that time), no country was willing to arrange an IPhO in 1973. To hold up the competition, Poland volunteered to host another IPhO in 1974, but the problem soon reappeared: With the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and Finland, additional Western countries had joined the IPhO, and the Eastern Bloc countries decided in 1977 that they would only host every other IPhO. As the Western countries were not yet ready with the necessary long-term preparation effort, no IPhO was held in 1978 and in 1980. The first Western Country to host the IPhO was the Federal Republic of Germany in 1982. Since then, the IPhO has been held regularly every year except 2020 due to the pandemic, and the organization has become a prestigious endeavor that many countries are happy to take.

The number of participating countries has grown steadily over the years. After the initial set of Eastern Bloc countries, many European countries joined since the 1970s, as well as Asian and American countries starting in the 1980s. Between 1990 and 2000 alone, the total number increased from 32 countries to 63. African countries have been joining since the 2000s. After accession into IPhO, every country must notify the others within five years about its willingness to host the IPhO. The venue of the Olympiad is decided for years ahead. With over 80 actively participating countries today, each IPhO is a big event with around 700 attendees and a total budget of several million euros. A small fraction of the cost is covered by a participation fee of around €3500 per team, which was introduced in 1997 on a voluntary basis and made obligatory in 2013.

The formal structure of the IPhO was established in 1968 at a dedicated meeting in Czechoslovakia, soon after the second IPhO. There the statutes and the syllabus were officially accepted by the International Board, which consists of the delegation heads from all participating countries. The team size was finally set to five students in 1971, and in 1976 the number of experimental problems was set to one or two, while there are three theoretical problems in each competition. In 1984, the IPhO established a permanent secretariat and a president&#x27;s office. This position was held by Waldemar Gorzkowski until the 2007 Olympiad, then Maija Ahtee (2007–2008), Hans Jordens (2008–2018) and Rajdeep Singh Rawat (2018 onwards). Since 1984 the IPhO has collaborated with UNESCO for moral support and publicity. An advisory committee, consisting of 14 experienced people, was introduced in 1996.

== Distribution of medals ==

The minimal scores required for Olympiad medals and honourable mentions are chosen by the organizers according to the following rules: A gold medal should be awarded to the top 8% of the participants. A silver medal or better should be awarded to the top 25%. A bronze medal or better should be awarded to the top 50%. An honourable mention or better should be awarded to the top 67%. All other participants receive certificates of participation. The participant with the highest score (absolute winner) receives a special prize, in addition to a gold medal.

The current ten countries with the best all-time results are as follows as of July 2024:


==Summary==

*In some contests, Taiwan uses Chinese Taipei as their team name.

<text>Metro Inc. is a Canadian supermarket chain operating in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The company is based in Montreal, Quebec, with head office at 11011 Boulevard Maurice-Duplessis. Metro is the third-largest grocer in Canada, after Loblaw Companies Limited and Sobeys.

Super C is the discount supermarket division operated in Quebec with 106 stores, averaging . In Ontario, Metro has 144 discount supermarkets under the Food Basics banner, which are very similar to the Super C stores. Large Metro stores in Quebec operate under the Metro Plus name. Metro also operates 51 groceries stores under the Marché Richelieu banner.

In November 2007, Metro reported a 9.3% increase in earnings for the fiscal year ending September 29, 2007, making $276.6 million in 2007 compared to $253 million in 2006. In 2011 Metro acquired a majority stake (55.5%) (CAD$153.8 million) in Marché Adonis, one of Quebec&#x27;s biggest ethnic food retailers specializing in Mediterranean food (Marché Adonis sales CAD$73 million 2011). In a March 2020 press release, Metro announced that it will invest about $420 million within next five years for the construction of a new automated distribution centre for fresh and frozen products, which they hope to open in 2023.

==History==
The company was founded in 1947 in Verdun, Quebec, by Rolland Jeanneau. Many independent grocery stores joined the company to form Magasins Lasalle Stores Ltée. In 1952, Magasins Lasalles Stores Ltée change its name to Épiceries Lasalle Groceteria. The company had 43 affiliated grocery stores at the time. In 1955, there were 50 franchised stores and the company had a revenue of $2 million. The company gained fame in 1956 through an advertisement in &quot;La Presse&quot; for turkeys at 39 cents. That year, Mayor Jean Drapeau was already talking about implementing in Montreal a rapid transit system to be called the Montreal Metro, which inspired the company to create a division called Metro. Other grocery stores joined the company bringing its number of stores to 73 in 1957 with revenue of $10 million.

Because of the success of the Metro division, the company renamed itself Metro-Lasalle in 1963. In 1972, Metro-Lasalle changed its name to Metro-Ltée. Metro merged with the Marché Richelieu grocery chain in 1975 to become Groupe Metro-Richelieu Inc in 1976.

In the early 1980s, Metro went through harder times because of fierce competition from Provigo and the ongoing recession. Metro merged with Epiciers Unis Inc. and took on the name Metro-Richelieu Inc. (dropping the &quot;Groupe&quot; from its name). During the rest of the 1980s, it fared better and entered the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1986.

Metro suffered from the early 1990s recession. A restructuring plan was established and changes were brought in the management team. Metro acquired 48 of 112 Steinberg supermarkets when that company went bankrupt in 1992. Metro entered the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1993. It acquired Loeb Stores from Loblaws in 1999. The Metro Plus banner was established in the early 2000s. Some of the stores were converted to Super C, and others continued to operate as Loeb. The Super C stores in Ontario were converted to Food Basics. In 2009, the company converted all Loeb stores to Metro.

===Mergers and acquisitions ===
On July 19, 2005, after beating out Sobeys in a bidding war, Metro announced that it had reached an agreement with The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company to acquire A&amp;P Canada, for an acquisition price of $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in cash and $500 million in the form of treasury shares of Metro. While the all-cash offer made by Sobeys was reportedly a higher bid than Metro&#x27;s, it was suggested that the Sobey family was unwilling to cede any control to the Tengelmann Group, the ultimate parent company of A&amp;P at the time. Though Sobeys remained the second largest grocery chain in Canada overall, it was a distant third place in most of the provinces outside the Atlantic region, particularly Ontario, where it was looking to bolster its weak position. Since A&amp;P Canada was the second-largest grocery chain in Ontario after Loblaws, Metro&#x27;s takeover effectively vaulted it to a strong market position there, where it previously had no presence. The acquisition of A&amp;P Canada was completed on August 15, 2005, with Metro having a network in Quebec and Ontario of 573 full-service and discount food supermarkets, and 256 pharmacies.

On August 7, 2008, Metro announced that it would invest $200 million consolidating the company&#x27;s conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all Dominion, A&amp;P, Loeb, the Barn, and Ultra Food &amp; Drug banners were converted to the Metro name. Food Basics stores were not affected as it competes in the discount food segment. Metro now holds the second largest market share in the food distribution and retailing business in Quebec and Ontario with nearly $11 billion in sales and more than 65,000 employees. Its stores operate under the banners Metro, Metro Plus, Super C, Food Basics, Marché Ami, Les 5 Saisons and Marché Adonis. Its pharmacies operate under the banners Brunet, The Pharmacy, Clini-Plus, and Drug Basics.

In 2017, Metro acquired the Canadian meal kit service Miss Fresh.

In May 2018, Metro closed a $4.5 billion (CAD) acquisition of the Quebec drug chain Jean Coutu Group, making it one of Canada’s largest retailers and distributors of food and drugs.

=== 2023 Unifor Local 414 strike ===
On July 29, 2023, front-line grocery store workers represented by Unifor rejected a tentative collective agreement and took strike action at 27 Greater Toronto Area stores. The union&#x27;s priorities included job precarity, job quality, wages and cost of living. The company reported high profits and earnings in its third quarter report. The strike ended a month later, with all workers&#x27; wages increased by $1.50/hr immediately and full-time and senior part-time workers earning an additional $0.50/hr beginning in January 2024.

==Loyalty programs==
=== Moi Rewards ===
In the early 2010s, Metro stores in Quebec launched an in-house loyalty program, &quot;metro&amp;moi&quot; (Metro and Me), later rebranded simply &quot;Moi&quot; (or alternately &quot;Moi Rewards&quot; in English-speaking Canada) upon expansion to other Metro-owned banners such as Jean Coutu in 2023. Customers earn 1 point for every $1 spent at Metro in Quebec (1 point per $3 spent at Metro in Ontario; offers vary at co-owned banners like Food Basics), which can be converted to rewards at the rate of $1 per 125 points accumulated, with a minimum balance of 500 points required for redemptions.

=== Previous programs ===

A&amp;P and Dominion stores in Ontario, excluding those in Thunder Bay, had joined the Air Miles coalition loyalty program in September 1997. Metro maintained this partnership following its acquisition and rebranding of A&amp;P Canada, but could not expand the program to its Quebec locations due to Air Miles&#x27; partnership at the time with Sobeys/IGA in eastern Canada. In April 2024, Metro announced it would end its participation in Air Miles (later announced as being effective July 21), with Moi Rewards launching in its place in October 2024.

A&amp;P (later Metro) stores in Thunder Bay were also blocked from participating in Air Miles by a pre-existing relationship with Safeway (later also acquired by Sobeys). These stores instead offered the in-house Thunder Bucks program, which functioned similarly but only offered Metro gift certificates as rewards. Thunder Bucks was also wound down and replaced by Moi Rewards in October 2024.

==Corporate governance==
Members of the board of directors of Metro Inc. are: Réal Raymond (Chair), Marc Guay (Administrateur), Maryse Bertrand, François J. Coutu, Michel Coutu, Stephanie Coyles, Marc DeSerres, Claude Dussault, Russell Goodman, Christian W.E. Haub, Eric R. La Flèche, Christine Magee, Marie-José Nadeau, and Line Rivard.

<text>Davao, officially the Province of Davao (; ), was a province in the Philippines on the island of Mindanao. The old province is coterminous with the present-day Davao Region or Region XI. It was divided into three provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, and Davao del Sur with the passage of Philippine Republic Act No. 4867 on May 8, 1967. Two more provinces, Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) and Davao Occidental, were carved out of the territories of Davao del Norte and Davao del Sur respectively. The descendant provinces were reorganized into the current region in 2001.

It was one of the largest, most populous and prosperous provinces in the country during its time, being settled by immigrants from the Luzon and the Visayas.

==Existence==
The province was established after the dissolution of Moro Province in 1914. Before the province broke up, massive waves of immigrants from Visayas and Luzon island groups are already settling in the province. Japanese immigrants, mostly rich businessmen and pioneers, also settled in its capital Davao in large numbers, making it the &quot;Philippines&#x27; Little Japan&quot;. Having an area of more than , its borders were almost identical to its predecessor, the province of Nueva Guipúzcoa that existed from 1849 to 1858, which also covered parts of what are now Cotabato, South Cotabato, Sarangani, Bukidnon, and the region of Caraga during the Spanish era.

After the dissolution of Nueva Guipozcoa, it was then converted into the Politico-Military Commandancia of Davao (District of Davao) for many years before it was incorporated into the Moro Province.

It was converted into a regular province and was made a district of Department of Mindanao and Sulu from 1914 until 1920.

Its capital town, Davao, became a city on March 16, 1936, as the provincial congressman Romualdo Quimpo filed Bill 609 (passed as Commonwealth Act 51), paving the creation of the city from the merger of the town of Davao (Mayo) and Guianga District. The bill called for the appointment of local officials by Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. By then, it was the only city in the province throughout the latter&#x27;s existence. What is now the Davao City Legislative Building served as the capitol for the governor and other provincial officials in the province.

On 1942, during the outbreak of World War II in the Philippines, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the province, becoming one of the territories in the country to be first taken by Japan. Guerrilla parties were then organized in the province to battle Japanese garrison forces there. It was in late 1944 when the Allies began liberating the island of Mindanao, and earlier the next year the dreadful Battle of Davao was fought to eliminate any Japanese resistance in the province.

The province was one of few to recover quickly from the war. Its capital city resumed its role as the main economic center of Mindanao. Though some local Japanese inhabitants in the provinces were expelled from the country due to enmity after the war, most have been integrated to the local Filipino population. After the war, migration to the province steadily increased due to the employment and agricultural opportunities the province offers, especially in its capital city.

In 1948, all municipal districts in the country were abolished. This paved the way for the creation of several towns in the province, such as Digos, Padada, Compostela, and many others.

To reorganize governance in the country, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed the Republic Act No. 4867 on May 8, 1967, dividing the province into three. The then-Davao Province is currently a region consisting of five provinces: Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte, Davao Occidental, Davao Oriental and Davao de Oro.

===Aftermath===
The province of Davao del Norte bore this name from 1972 to 1998, when Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) seceded as a separate province.

Davao Occidental was created by virtue of Republic Act 10360 enacted on July 23, 2013; the province is the newest in the country, carved out from the southern part of Davao del Sur. The Act was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on November 28, 2012, and December 5, 2012, respectively, and signed by President Benigno Aquino III on January 14, 2013. A plebiscite was held on October 28, 2013, along with the Barangay elections, and the majority of votes cast were &quot;Yes&quot;, ratifying the province.

<doc id="296151" wikidata="Q245023" url="?curid=296151" title="Taichung">
<text>Taichung (, Wade–Giles: [[Taichung|&#x27;, Taichung City, is a [[special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in central [[Taiwan]]. Taichung is Taiwan&#x27;s second-largest city, with more than 2.85 million residents, making it the largest city in [[Central Taiwan]]. It serves as the core of the [[Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area]], Taiwan&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area.

Located in the [[Taichung Basin]], the city was initially developed from several scattered hamlets helmed by the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]. It was constructed to be the new capital of [[Taiwan Province]] and renamed &quot;[[Taiwanfu (disambiguation)|Taiwan-fu]]&quot; in the late [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynastic era]] between 1887 and 1894. During the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]] from 1895, the urban planning of present-day Taichung was performed and developed by the Japanese. The urban area of Taichung was organized as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] from the start of ROC rule in 1945 until 25 December 2010, when the original provincial city and [[Taichung County]] were merged into a new special municipality.

The city is home to the [[National Museum of Natural Science]], the [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[National Taichung Theater]], the [[National Library of Public Information]], [[National Taiwan Museum of Comics]], [[National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra]], as well as many cultural sites, including the historic [[Taichung Park]], the [[Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden|Lin Family Gardens]], and many [[Temples of Taichung|temples]].

==History==
===Early history===
The [[Atayal people|Atayal aborigines]] as well as several [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|Taiwanese Plains Aboriginal tribes]] (including the [[Taokas people|Taokas]], [[Papora people|Papora]], [[Pazeh people|Pazeh]], [[Hoanya people|Hoanya]] and [[Babuza people|Babuzas]]) populated the plains that make up modern Taichung. They were originally [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter gatherers]] who later lived by cultivating [[millet]] and [[taro]]. In the 17th century, the [[Papora people|Papora]], [[Babuza people|Babuza]], [[Pazeh people|Pazeh]], and [[Hoanya people|Hoanya]] established the [[Kingdom of Middag]], occupying the western part of present-day Taichung.
===Qing dynasty===
In 1684, [[Zhuluo County]] was established, encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan. Modern-day Taichung traces its beginnings to a settlement named &quot;Toatun&quot; () in 1705. To strengthen Qing control, a garrison was established in 1721 near the site of present-day [[Taichung Park]] by Lan Ting-chen.

North of the city, on the [[Tachia River|Dajia River]], an aboriginal revolt broke out in 1731 after Chinese officials moved in and compelled them to provide labor. The revolt spread through the city as far south as [[Changhua County#Qing dynasty|Changhua County]] in May 1732 before the rebels were chased into the mountains by Qing forces. In 1786, another rebellion against the Qing, known as the [[Lin Shuangwen rebellion]], began as an attempt to overthrow the government and restore the [[Ming dynasty]]. Unfortunately, as the rebels moved northward, they turned to slaughter and looting. They were eventually defeated by a coalition of Qing forces, [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Quanzhou]] [[Fujian]]ese descendants, and aboriginal volunteers.

When [[Taiwan Province#Qing dynasty|Taiwan Province]] was declared an independent province in 1887, the government intended to construct its capital city at the centrally located &quot;Toatun&quot;, which was also designated as the seat of [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. Thus the city took the title of &quot;Taiwan-fu&quot;, meaning &quot;capital city of Taiwan&quot;, from modern-day [[Tainan]], which had held the title for more than 200 years. Qing official [[Liu Ming-chuan]] received permission to oversee development of the area, which included constructing a railway through the city. However, the provincial capital was ultimately moved to [[Taipei]].

===Empire of Japan===
After the Qing dynasty lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], and the name of the city was changed to . The Japanese sought to develop the city to make it the first &quot;modern&quot; area of Taiwan and invested in roads, dams, and levees. In 1901, was established as one of twenty local administrative districts on the island. In 1904, the town of Taichū had a population of 6,423, and Taichū District had more than 207,000.

[[Taichung Park|Taichū Park]] was completed in 1903. A tower marking the old north gate was moved to the new park where it stands today. The first market in Taichū was built in 1908, along Jiguang Road between the Zhongzheng and Chenggong Roads and it is still in use today. The Japanese undertook a north–south island railway project. [[Taichung Railway Station (TRA)|Taichū Train Station]] was completed and began operation in 1917, and still operates today. Taichū City was officially declared by Japanese authorities in 1920, and [[Taichū City Hall]] was completed in 1924 after eleven years of construction. , now known as [[Taichung Airport]], was constructed during Japanese rule.
Taichū Middle School (now known as [[Taichung First Senior High School]]) was founded in 1915 by elite members of local gentry, including [[Lin Hsien-tang]] and his brother , two wealthy Taiwanese intellectuals of the era. This was in an effort to teach children the [[culture of Taiwan]] and to foster the spirit of the [[Taiwanese localization movement]]. The [[Taiwanese Cultural Association]], founded in 1921 in Taipei by Lin Hsien-tang, was moved to Taichū in 1927. Most of the members of this association were from Taichū and the surrounding area. The city became a center of Taiwanese culture and nationalism.

From 1926 to 1945, [[Taichū Prefecture]] covered modern-day Taichung as well as [[Changhua County]] and [[Nantou County]].

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession of Taiwan|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in October 1945, [[Taichung County]] was established, which consists of present-day area of Taichung City, [[Miaoli County]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan City]]. In 1947 the first mayor of Taichung County (which included Taichung City) was Lai Tien Shen. The position was appointed by the government to rule during the interim period. Taichung also served as the temporary capital of the exiled [[Jiangxi]] (Kiangsi) provincial government in 1949 after the [[Chinese Communist Party]] took control of the province. In 1950, Miaoli and Taoyuan were taken out from Taichung County area to form [[Miaoli County]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan County]] respectively. In June 2009, the [[Executive Yuan]] approved the plan to merge Taichung City and Taichung County to form a larger Taichung City. On 25 December 2010, the city was merged with the surrounding [[Taichung County]] to create a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] of 2.65 million people spread across .

In 2020, Taichung was classified as a &quot;Gamma&quot; level global city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].

==Geography==
Taichung City is in the [[Taichung Basin]] along the main western coastal plain that stretches along the west coast from northern Taiwan almost to the southern tip. The city borders [[Changhua County]], [[Nantou County]], [[Hualien County]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], [[Hsinchu County]] and [[Miaoli County]].

The [[Central Mountain Range]] lies just east of the city. Rolling hills run to the north leading to [[Miaoli County]], while flat coastal plains dominate the landscape to the south leading to Changhua County and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the west. The [[Dadu Plateau]] lies to the northwest.

===Climate===
Taichung has a warm [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] &quot;Cwa&quot;) bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with an average annual temperature of . The highest temperature of the year occurs in July and August, while the lowest temperature occurs in January and February. Daytime temperatures remain warm to hot year-round, though night time temperatures during the winter months are significantly cooler than those during the summer and the warm daytime temperature. Its average annual rainfall is just above , relatively low compared to other major cities of Taiwan. The average humidity is 80%.

Due to the protection provided by the Central Mountain Range to the east and the Miaoli hills to the north, Taichung is rarely severely affected by [[typhoon]]s, but typhoons emerging from the [[South China Sea]] occasionally pose a threat to the city, as evidenced by [[Typhoon Wayne (1986)|Typhoon Wayne]] in 1986, which struck Taiwan&#x27;s west coast near Taichung.

==Demographics==

Taichung&#x27;s population was estimated to be 2,816,667 in March 2020. There are slightly more females in the city (50.97%) than males. 24.32% of residents are children, while 16.63% are young people, 52.68% are middle-age, and 6.73% are elderly. According to [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of Interior]] statistics, the fertility rate in Taichung City in 2007 was 1.165 for each woman.

The city surpassed [[Kaohsiung]] to become the second largest city in Taiwan in July 2017, growing at the 2nd fastest rate in Taiwan from 2012 to 2017. Recent population increases have been attributed to [[Rate of natural increase|natural population growth]], more people moving to the city, and subsidized housing.

==Politics==


===Local politics===
Unlike [[Taipei]] in the north, which is solidly in the [[Pan-Blue]] political camp, and the southern cities of [[Kaohsiung]] and [[Tainan City|Tainan]] that are solidly [[Pan-Green]], Taichung is more balanced, with the urban city center area leaning Blue and the suburban and rural areas leaning Green. In fact, both major political parties have won a mayoral election among the last four with at least 49 percent of the vote ([[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 1997 and 2014 and the [[Kuomintang]] in 2001 and 2005). Similarly, the Kuomintang majority in the [[Taichung City Council|city council]] is not as large as it is in other cities, and is only negligible when one excludes [[Beitun District]], which is solidly pro-Kuomintang. The incumbent Mayor of Taichung is [[Lu Shiow-yen]] of the [[Kuomintang]].

===Government===
Taichung City&#x27;s executive branch is headed by mayor [[Lu Shiow-yen]] of the Kuomintang. Taichung&#x27;s legislative branch is a unicameral 46-member City Council. Each member is elected from one of six member districts where each voter has only one vote.

==Administrative divisions==
Taichung consists of 29 districts, 28 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]] and 1 mountain indigenous district.

Inner Taichung refers to the eight former districts of Taichung City before the merger with [[Taichung County]] on December 25, 2010. Colors indicate statutory language status of [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka language]] in the respective subdivisions. Note that [[Heping District, Taichung|Heping District]] is also an [[Indigenous Area (Taiwan)|indigenous area]] of the [[Atayal people]].

==Economy==
Taichung is the center and the largest city in [[Central Taiwan]]. Its main industries are machinery and retail services.

Taichung is home to many industries. It has six main manufacturing industries: tool machines, mechanical components, photoelectric panels, bicycles, woodworking machinery, and aerospace manufacturing.

[[Taichung Industrial Park]], located in [[Xitun District]], is home to many factories, while nearby [[World Trade Center Taichung]] hosts many industrial conventions every year. Taichung is also home to the [[Central Taiwan Science Park]], known for the many semiconductor factories located there, most notably [[TSMC]]. Some other famous companies located in Taichung included [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation]], [[HIWIN]], [[Largan Precision]], and [[Pou Chen Corporation]].

Taichung is also known for its bicycle manufacturing. Notable business located in Taichung include [[Giant Bicycles]], [[SRAM Corporation|SRAM]], and TRP Brakes.

Taichung&#x27;s financial center and [[central business district]] is the [[Taichung&#x27;s 7th Redevelopment Zone|7th Redevelopment Zone]], where many corporation offices are located. The retail sector is another main industry in Taichung. Almost a quarter of all Taichung employees work in the retail sector., Its output value is 1.3 trillion NTD, second largest after Taipei (5.8 trillion NTD) in Taiwan.

Taichung is most famous for its [[Suncake (Taiwan)|suncakes]]. Taichung&#x27;s [[Chun Shui Tang]] teahouse () is where [[bubble tea]] was invented.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
Two railways run parallel to each other in Taichung: the [[Taichung Line]], which passes through the urban areas in the interior, and the [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|West Coast Line]], which passes through rural areas closer to the coastal shore. [[Taichung TRA station|Taichung railway station]] is located in the heart of the city in [[Central District, Taichung|Central District]] and numerous bus companies provide connections to other towns by bus.

The [[Taichung High Speed Rail Station|THSR Taichung Station]] is located in [[Wuri, Taichung|Wuri district]], serving travel demands of both Taichung City and the northern parts of Changhua County. THSR Taichung Station is accessible by [[Taiwan Railways Administration|local trains]] and [[Green Line (Taichung Metro)|MRT Green Line]] through [[Xinwuri railway station]] as well as free shuttle buses into the city.

===Seaport===
[[Port of Taichung|Taichung Port]], located on the coast in Taichung City, is the second largest cargo facility on the island capable of handling container shipping. Despite being the second largest port on the island of Taiwan, there are no passenger ferry services available and the port is closed to unauthorized personnel.

===Roads===
Taichung City generally follows a radial road layout, with its center at [[Taichung railway station]]. Major roads start in Central District and run outwards, including Taiwan Boulevard, Xiangshang Road, Zhongqing Road, and Zhongshan Road.

[[National freeway 1|Freeway 1]] runs along the Fazi River on the outskirts of the city, while [[National freeway 3|Freeway 3]] runs along the [[Dadu River (Taiwan)|Dadu River]] to the coastal plains on the west, where it then runs parallel to the coastline. [[Freeway 4 (Taiwan)|Freeway 4]] begins in [[Qingshui District]] and terminates in [[Fengyuan District]]. [[Provincial Highway 74 (Taiwan)|Highway 74]], known as the Taichung Ring Expressway circles the outskirts of the city, while [[Provincial Highway 63 (Taiwan)|Highway 63]], known as the Zhongtou Expressway, runs from Taichung southward to [[Caotun]], [[Nantou County|Nantou]]. Many other highways run through the city.

Most road signs in the city have [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized spelling]].

===Bus===
The most frequently used public transportation system in Taichung is by bus, with 18 bus companies providing 275 routes that cover all districts. All station names are announced in both Mandarin and English, while some also provide Hokkien pronunciations. For local passengers using a [[Contactless smart card|contactless smartcard]] (for example, an [[EasyCard]]), the first 10 kilometers are free. In addition, some taxi served as bus routes in rural areas.

===Mass Rapid Transit===
The city currently has one [[rapid transit|MRT]] line, the [[Green line (Taichung Metro)|Green line]], which opened on April 25, 2021. A second line, the [[Blue line (Taichung Metro)|Blue line]], was approved in 2024 and is expected to open in 2034.

For a short period of time, the city operated a [[bus rapid transit]] system, named the [[Taichung BRT Blue Line|BRT Blue Line]], running down Taiwan Boulevard. It used [[articulated bus]]es running a specialized lane, a first in Taiwan. The system began operation in July 2014; however, it did little to ameliorate traffic congestion, and was terminated within a year. The lane and specialized bus stops are currently used as a general bus lane, with bus lines 300-310 running through it.

===Taichung International Airport===

[[Taichung International Airport]] is the third and newest international airport in Taiwan. It occupies the western corner of [[Ching Chuan Kang Air Base]] (CCK) and is about 20 kilometers (12 mi) from downtown Taichung City. The current airport replaced [[Taichung Shuinan Airport|Shuinan Airport]] as Taichung&#x27;s airport in 2004.

==Education==
In 1915, the Taichung Middle School (台灣公立台中中學校) (now [[Taichung Municipal Taichung First Senior High School]]) was established as the first school for young people in Taiwan. In 1943, the Advanced Academy of Agronomy and Forestry (now [[National Chung Hsing University]]) became an independent entity and moved to Taichung. It is the beginning of higher education in Taichung. In 1955, [[Tunghai University]] was established, becoming the first private university in Taiwan.

Currently, there are 17 universities, 50 high schools, 71 junior high schools, and 235 elementary schools in Taichung. In addition, there are four special schools, [[List of international schools in Taiwan|three international schools]], and nine community colleges in the city.

==Romanization==
Taichung City is in the process of implementing [[Hanyu Pinyin]] on road signs throughout the city. However, there are still signs displaying spellings from previously used romanization systems, as well as [[Tongyong Pinyin]] and systems that do not conform to any standard system. Unlike [[Taipei]], which uses a capital letter at the beginning of every syllable, Taichung City uses the standard form of Hanyu Pinyin on street signs erected in recent years. However, the municipal website uses the Taipei system. Most major intersections have at least one sign containing some form of romanization. Nearly every intersection in the downtown area has signs in Hanyu Pinyin. However, outside of the downtown area, while coverage by Hanyu Pinyin signs is improving, many intersections have signs in other romanization systems (especially Wade–Giles and MPS2) or no Romanized signs at all.

==Culture and recreation==

===Museums and cultural centers===
*The [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]] houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Taiwanese art.
*[[National Museum of Natural Science]] together with [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei and the [[National Science and Technology Museum]] in Kaohsiung are called &quot;the Museums of Taiwan&quot;. Across , the museum is a six-venue complex housing the Space IMAX Theater, Science Center, Life Science Hall, Chinese Science Hall, Global Environment Hall and the Botanical Garden, excluding the Earthquake Museum in Wufong, which is dedicated to public education on seismology, located just 10 kilometers east of the main complex of NMNS. Over 30 permanent exhibit areas cover subjects on astronomy, space science, paleontology, ecology, gems and minerals, Taiwanese Aborigines, and tropical plants. Rotating special exhibits are a constant occurrence.
*Taichung Municipal Cultural Center: The Municipal Cultural Center is located on Yingcai Road on property adjacent to the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts.
*[[Taichung Folklore Park]]: This park is dedicated to presenting a more traditional Taiwanese way of life. It includes a combination of authentic and recreated buildings and streets in an attempt to recreate a more rustic Taiwan.
*[[921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan]]: This museum is located in [[Wufeng District]]. With the rebuilding of Kwangfu Junior High on its present site, the Earthquake Memorial Museum was renamed the 921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan on February 13, 2001. The new plan retains the original sites as a record of the damage wrought by the earthquake, and it also adds technological and educational facilities designed to inform the public and school children about earthquakes and disaster readiness.
*[[Asia Museum of Modern Art]]: This museum is located at [[Asia University (Taiwan)|Asia University]] in Wufeng District. On May 4, 2007, Dr. Tsai presented the project plan and officially invited Mr. Tadao Ando to design an art museum for Asia University. Therefore, the main purpose of inviting Tadao Ando to design the museum was to educate students and create the opportunity for them to have contact with art works from masters of international status. This museum provides various and amazing exhibitions which are related to Asian art and modern art.

===Temples===
Taichung has a large number of temples, many of which hold historic and cultural value. According to a 2018 survey by the city government, Taichung is home to 1,012 registered temples, of which 774 are [[Religion in Taiwan#Taoism and Confucianism|Taoist]] and 208 are [[Buddhism in Taiwan|Buddhist]].

The Goddess [[Mazu]] is one of the most popular [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Deity]]. [[Jenn Lann Temple]] is the starting point of the annual [[Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage]], one of two largest such pilgrimages in Taiwan (along with the [[Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage]]). Each year, worshippers carry a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] containing a statue of Mazu and travel on foot to [[Xingang, Chiayi]] and back. [[Lecheng Temple]] hosts a similar Eighteen Villages Pilgrimage, where the temple&#x27;s &quot;Hanxi Mazu&quot; is paraded through eighteen villages for good luck. Other notable Mazu temples include [[Wanhe Temple]] and [[Haotian Temple]].

[[Confucianism]] is a crucial part of many Chinese cultures. In Taichung, there are two historic major temples dedicated to [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Dijun]], the patron deity of literature: [[Beitun Wenchang Temple]] and [[Nantun Wenchang Temple]]. The [[Taichung Confucian Temple]] is a large and relatively new complex dedicated to [[Confucius]] himself. There are also several [[ancestral shrine]]s in Taichung, notably the [[Lin Family Ancestral Shrine]], the [[Zhang Family Temple]], and the [[Zhang Liao Family Temple]].

Many other deities are worshipped in the city, including:
*[[Baosheng Dadi]] at [[Yuanbao Temple]]
*[[Guanyin]] at [[Songzhu Temple]] and [[Zi Yun Yan]]
*[[Xuanwu (god)|Xuantian Shangdi]] at [[Zhenwu Temple]]

===Night markets===
Taichung has several open-air [[night market]]s that feature local food and diversions:

*[[Fengjia Night Market]] - located adjacent to [[Feng Chia University]]. 
*[[Yizhong Street]] - located at [[North District, Taichung|North District]], close to [[Taichung Park]]. One of the most popular night markets in Taichung.
*Zhonghua Night Market - located in the heart of Central District, along ZhongHua Road.
*Zhongxiao Night Market - located south of the Taichung Railroad Station around the intersections of ZhongXiao, Taichung and GuoGuang roads.

===Other annual activities===

*The [[Taichung Jazz Festival]] takes place annually through the month of October. It features a variety of acts at numerous venues throughout the city.

==Sports==
===Professional sports===
The [[Sinon Bulls]] was a professional baseball team playing in the four-team [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]]. While they were identified with Taichung City, many of their “home games” were played outside of the city due to the inadequacies of the old [[Taichung Baseball Field]]. The team was expected to move into the newly completed [[Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium]] in 2008, but never did. At the end of the 2012 season, Sinon Corporation announced its intention to sell the team. By late December, an agreement was reached between Sinon Corporation and E-United Group, and the team was renamed EDA Rhinos and moved to Kaohsiung. The &quot;[[Special Force II]]&quot; division of the [[Flash Wolves]] [[esports]] team is known as the Taichung Flash Wolves, the team competed in the Special Force II Pro League (SF2PL) based in Taipei. Taichung is home to Taichung City FC, a club which strives to represent Taichung in soccer tournaments as well as charitable events.

In 2015, after the CTBC Holdings took ownership of the Brother Elephants and renamed the team [[CTBC Brothers]], they made Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium their home as part of Taiwan&#x27;s [[Chinese Professional Baseball League|CPBL]]&#x27;s effort to establish home fields in all major Taiwanese cities.

Taichung has two professional basketball teams, the [[Taichung Suns]] of the [[T1 League]] and the [[Formosa Taishin Dreamers]] of the [[P. League+]] (shared with [[Changhua County]]).

=== Major Sporting Events ===
Cup Marathon is held on the city&#x27;s streets every autumn, either in October or November. Recent major sporting events held by Taichung include:

<doc id="296152" wikidata="Q7076775" url="?curid=296152" title="Octave illusion">
<text>The octave illusion is an auditory illusion discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. It is produced when two tones that are an octave apart are repeatedly played in alternation (&quot;high-low-high-low&quot;) through stereo headphones. The same sequence is played to both ears simultaneously; however when the right ear receives the high tone, the left ear receives the low tone, and conversely. Instead of hearing two alternating pitches, most subjects instead hear a single tone that alternates between ears while at the same time its pitch alternates between high and low.

==First experiment==

The two tones used were pitched at 400 Hz and 800 Hz, corresponding roughly to G4 and G5 in modern pitch notation. Each tone was played for 250 ms before switching ears. No gaps were allowed between tones. Both tones were therefore always present during the experiment; only the ears perceiving the high and the low tone at any one time changed repeatedly. After the initial test, the headphones were reversed, and the test was repeated.

==Results==

86 subjects were tested, and none perceived the tonal pattern correctly. Most subjects heard a single tone that alternated in pitch by an octave as it alternated between ears. When the earphones were reversed, the ear that initially heard the high tone continued to hear the high tone, and the ear that initially heard the low tone continued to hear the low tone. Some subjects only heard a single tone that moved between ears but did not change in pitch, or changed very slightly. Several subjects heard various &quot;complex&quot; illusions, such as two alternating pitches in one ear and a third pitch that sporadically occurred in the other ear.

Handedness also played an important role in the results. 58% of right-handed subjects and 52% of left-handed subjects heard a single pitch that switched between octaves as it switched between ears. Of the remaining subjects, nearly three times as many right-handers than left-handers heard a tone that switched ears but not pitch. Left-handed subjects were varied in their localization of the high and low tones, while right-handed subjects were much more likely to hear the high tone localized to their right ear during both tests.

Deutsch proposed that when a single tone that alternates between octaves is heard, this illusion results from the combined operation of two decision mechanisms. First, to determine the tone&#x27;s location, high pitches are given precedence; second, to determine the tone&#x27;s pitch, tones in the dominant ear are given precedence over tones in the non-dominant ear.
This is known as the two-channel model, since it is proposed that the operation of two separate &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; decision mechanisms combine to produce the illusion. The model is illustrated here.

==Further experiments==

In a further experiment, Deutsch examined the effect of handedness and familial handedness background on perception of the octave illusion. The subjects were 250 students, who were classified both according to their handedness and also according to whether they had a left-handed parent or sibling. It was found that right-handers were more likely to hear the high tone on the right (and the low tone on the left) than were mixed-handers, and mixed-handers were more likely to do so than left-handers. And for all three handedness groups the tendency to hear the high tone on the right was greater for subjects with only right-handed parents and siblings than for those with left- or mixed-handed parents or siblings.

In another experiment, Deutsch and Roll explored the two-channel model in further detail. They played 44 right-handed subjects a repeating pattern of tones pitched at 400 Hz and 800 Hz. This time the right ear was given three 800 Hz pitches alternating with two 400 Hz pitches, while the left ear simultaneously heard three 400 Hz pitches alternating with two 800 Hz pitches. A 250 ms pause was added between each successive tone combination. Subjects were asked to report how many high tones and how many low tones they heard, and in which ears they heard the tones. The results were consistent with the initial experiment.

In further experiments based on the same model Deutsch asked subjects to report whether the pattern was of the &quot;high-low-high-low&quot; type or the &quot;low-high-low-high&quot; type. From this it could be determined which ear the subject was following for pitch. The amplitude of the unheard pitch was then manipulated in order to determine how large it needed to be, in order to counteract the effect, and it was found that a significant amplitude disparity was sometimes needed. It was also determined that, when both tones were not present at the same time, the illusion was broken.

In yet other experiments, Deutsch varied the relative amplitudes of the high and low tones and asked subjects whether the pattern was of the &quot;right-left-right-left-&quot; type or the &quot;left-right-left-right&quot; type. From this it could be determined whether the subject was localizing the tone to the high or low pitch. Again, it was found that a large amplitude disparity was sometimes needed to counteract the effect.

==&quot;Deutsch illusion&quot;==

Brancucci, Padulo, and Tommasi argue that the octave illusion should be renamed the &quot;Deutsch illusion&quot;, since, according to their findings, the illusion is not limited to the octave. They performed an experiment similar to Deutsch’s original, except the two tones that were used ranged in interval from a minor third to an eleventh. The tones were presented initially for 200 ms before switching ears, then again for 500 ms. While the illusion was present for several people at all intervals, the illusion occurred more often with wider intervals.

==Criticism and rebuttal ==

Chambers, Moss, and Mattingley believe that the illusion is caused by a combination of harmonic fusion and binaural diplacusis, a condition in which a pitch is perceived slightly differently between ears. In experiments employing a few subjects, none reported the percept most commonly obtained by Deutsch’s subjects. This does not necessarily conflict with other studies, as the number of subjects used in this experiment was small and there are individual differences in perception of the illusion. The authors also argued that experiments conducted by others did not clarify whether the high tone and low tones were perceived as being an octave apart. They 
claimed, therefore, that their results were not consistent with those of Deutsch in relation to hand dominance and ear dominance versus location of pitch.

These criticisms were rebutted in two articles. Deutsch (2004a) used a new procedure, which provided more explicit documentation of the octave illusion; here musically trained subjects notated precisely what they heard. The experiment confirmed that subjects, on listening to the illusion, perceive an octave difference between the ears. This result cannot be explained by diplacusis, which refers to a difference of a fraction of a semitone between the ears. The article also documented that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures. In a further article, Deutsch (2004b) showed that Chambers et al. made inappropriate comparisons with other phenomena of sound perception, and failed to consider several key findings that support Deutsch’s model. In addition, the octave illusion, in which an octave difference between the ears is perceived, has been replicated in several other laboratories. For example, Oehler and Reuter recently replicated the handedness correlate in a study of 174 subjects Lamminmaki and Hari (2000) and Lamminmaki et al. (2012) in MEG studies provide an explanation of the illusion at the neurophysiological level that is in accordance with Deutsch’s two-channel model.

<doc id="296154" wikidata="Q1536626" url="?curid=296154" title="Vagrant Story">
<text>is a 2000 action role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation. The game has been re-released by Square Enix through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita consoles. &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was primarily developed by the team responsible for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, with Yasumi Matsuno serving as director, producer, designer, and writer.

The game takes place in the kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.

&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is unique as a console action role-playing game in that it features no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game received critical acclaim from gaming publications, with some calling it one of the greatest games ever made.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is a solo action role-playing game, in which the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective to allow for a 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.

Ashley can run, jump, and push crates and cubes to navigate around obstacles, adding puzzle and platforming elements to gameplay. During the game, the player must sometimes solve block puzzles to advance the story. When the player returns to a completed block puzzle room, a time-attack mode called &quot;Evolve, or Die!!&quot; begins. Players must reach the end of the room in the shortest time possible, after which they are ranked. This stage is optional and can be turned off from the menu.

In the field map, players may engage the enemy as soon as they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable real-time combat system, much like Square&#x27;s &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.

Magic in &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is learned later in the game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell associated with the Grimoire will remain in the menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley&#x27;s elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.

Risk is an essential element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley&#x27;s concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates, lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.

&quot;Vagrant Story&quot;″s crafting system allows the player to create and customize weapons and armor in designated &quot;workshop&quot; areas, inputting various ranges, strengths, and statistics. Weapons fall into one of three main damage types: blunt, piercing, and edged. Equipment are influenced by their material and affinity to enemy classes and elements. Affinities influence the effectiveness of weapons and armor, but equipment might lose one form of affinity when it gains another type. Weapons and armor can be combined, merging their affinities and sometimes creating a new type of blade or armor in the process. Different weapon types have different ranges, such as a crossbow having a longer range than melee weapons such as a mace.

Like several Square titles, the New Game Plus option is made available to the player upon first completing the game. In &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, selecting &quot;New Game+&quot; enables the player to replay the story using their end-game weapons, items, and statistics instead of the defaults. This option allows players to access a hidden level, which features more intimidating enemies and more powerful equipment. The story does not change, and original enemy statistics will remain at default.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is set in the fictitious city of Leá Monde, while the kingdom of Valendia is engulfed in civil war. Leá Monde is an old town with a history spanning more than two millennia. Located on an island surrounded by reefs, the walls have been the &quot;witness of many battles&quot; and are &quot;stronger than the mightiest forts of Valendia&quot;. In its golden years, Leá Monde was a thriving community until an earthquake struck the town 25 years before the game, destroying the city and leaving the ground unstable.

The Grand Cathedral and the Temple of Kiltia are at the center of the city. This area is surrounded by the west and east districts, both in fairly good shape, as well as the massive, fortress-like City Walls. Beneath the ground are an abandoned mineshaft and limestone quarry, the shadowy labyrinths of an &quot;Undercity&quot;, and the dark Iron Maiden dungeon. The maze-like Snowfly Forest, named for the so-called snowflies that can be found within, covers part of the city. Other locations include the Graylands, the setting for the prologue event; and Valnain, the city where the Valendia Knights of Peace&#x27;s Headquarters is located. While Valendia and Leá Monde are fictitious, the game&#x27;s scenery is inspired by real-life landscapes of the southwest of France, including the city of Saint-Émilion.

===Characters===
The protagonist is Ashley Riot, a male member of the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP) in pursuit of a cult leader named Sydney Losstarot. Sydney, leader of the religious cult Müllenkamp, laid siege to Duke Bardorba&#x27;s manor in search of a key and kidnapped Bardorba&#x27;s son, Joshua. Ashley&#x27;s partner is Callo Merlose, an agent of the VKP Inquisitors. Also attempting to capture Sydney is Romeo Guildenstern of the Crimson Blades, whose mission was undertaken without the approval of the VKP.

Ashley is a Riskbreaker, a militant division of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney&#x27;s hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp&#x27;s activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley&#x27;s battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley&#x27;s past. This casts suspicion on Ashley&#x27;s behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.

The Crimson Blades, under direct orders of Cardinal Batistum, are a group that is part of the Cardinal&#x27;s Knights of the Cross, in charge of seeking heretics and quelling cults. Romeo Guildenstern, their leader, is a pious man, deeply faithful to his belief and consequently immune to the Dark&#x27;s powers. Under orders of the Cardinal, he pursues Sydney with a small army in his command and his captains: Samantha, Duane, Grissom, Tieger and Neesa.

Müllenkamp is a cult based in Leá Monde. The city suffered a catastrophe when the population was killed in an earthquake. The city, filled with corpses controlled by Darkness, is the cult&#x27;s stronghold. Sydney and his accomplice, Hardin, survive the pursuit of the Crimson Blade, though Hardin sometimes doubts Sydney&#x27;s intentions.

===Story===
The plot of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, titled &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;, is presented as the prelude to the &quot;story of the wanderer&quot;. Beginning in the Graylands, Ashley and Callo are sent by the VKP to Duke Bardorba&#x27;s manor to investigate the Duke&#x27;s involvement with Müllenkamp and the Cardinal&#x27;s interest in Sydney Losstarot. Ashley infiltrates the manor and encounters Sydney, witnessing his powers first hand. Sydney escapes with his accomplice Hardin and the Duke&#x27;s son Joshua, leaving Ashley with a clue to his whereabouts. This event was dubbed the &quot;Graylands Incident&quot;.

Ashley and Callo arrive in Leá Monde and a lone Ashley infiltrates the city through the underground wine cellars. Along the way, he learns of objects holding magical power known as Grimoires and the city&#x27;s power to spawn the undead and mythological creatures. He encounters Guildenstern and his lover Samantha, and learns of the condition known as incomplete death and the Cardinal&#x27;s true intention for his pursuit of Sydney: immortality. The Crimson Blades confront Ashley and reveals his presence to Guildenstern.

Escaping unharmed, Ashley encounters Rosencrantz who intends to join him, though Ashley declines. Rosencrantz tells him of the VKP and the Parliaments&#x27; knowledge of the dark powers of Leá Monde, and that the hidden powers deep within a person can be unleashed with the help of the Dark. In his encounters with Sydney, Ashley is shown visions of his past, where his wife Tia and his son Marco are killed by rogues. Meeting Rosencrantz again, Ashley is told that they were not his family, but mistaken targets he killed during a mission of theirs. Ashley&#x27;s guilt over their deaths was manipulated by the VKP to turn Ashley into a loyal Riskbreaker. Ashley recalls his hidden battle skills and experiences &quot;clairvoyance&quot;, seeing the progress of the Crimson Blades, which leads him to the Great Cathedral.

Sydney had captured Callo earlier and brought her with them. Callo learned that Hardin was skeptical of Sydney&#x27;s plans. She begins to develop the powers of &quot;heart-seeing&quot;, a form of telepathy, as they continue their escape deeper into Leá Monde. With her powers, she learned of Sydney&#x27;s intentions and Hardin&#x27;s reason to join Müllenkamp and his closeness to Joshua. Sydney left them to stop the others from advancing; taunting Guildenstern and Samantha, and provoking Ashley to follow him as he intends to bestow his powers upon Ashley. Ashley was not interested in inheriting the powers of Darkness; seeing that Callo had been captured, his only intention is to rescue her.

While discussing the Gran Grimoire, a powerful source of magic, Guildenstern and Samantha discover ancient Kildean letterings carved throughout the city walls. Rosencrantz reveals that the city is the Gran Grimoire and its power lies at the city center: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz, confident in his immunity against Darkness, tries to force Sydney to surrender his powers. Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove that he is not a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness. Sydney refuses to listen and kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor.

Guildenstern continues on to the Great Cathedral in the center of the city, leading him to Callo, Hardin and Joshua. Interrogating Hardin about a certain &quot;key&quot; known as the Blood-Sin, Guildenstern reveals his intentions in acquiring the Dark&#x27;s powers. Sydney arrives to teleport Hardin and the rest away, leaving him to Guildenstern. Guildenstern acquires the &quot;key&quot; from him and murders Samantha as his sacrifice for the powers of darkness. Ashley arrives later and listens as Sydney reveals his true intentions. Ashley then confronts Guildenstern and manages to defeat him.

Upon Guildenstern&#x27;s defeat, Ashley, now bearing the &quot;key&quot;, carries Sydney out of the collapsing city. The creatures spawned within the city begin to disappear. Callo, Hardin and Joshua escape the city, though Hardin dies and the fate of Callo and Joshua remains unknown. In the epilogue, Ashley goes to visit the ailing Duke Bardorba in his manor, although once they were alone, it was Sydney who was in the room. Sydney tells the duke that he had found a suitable heir to the Darkness in Ashley, and that their plan to inherit the powers of Darkness was successful. The duke then proceeds to kill Sydney, and he himself died soon after of unknown causes. In a report received by the VKP a week after the Graylands Incident, the duke was believed to be murdered, and Ashley became the prime suspect, though he was never found again.

==Development==
Yasumi Matsuno, the game&#x27;s producer and director, preferred to create a new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.
During the design phase, Matsuno was shown photographs from France, particularly Saint-Émilion in the region of Bordeaux. This region was visited by one of Matsuno&#x27;s colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-Émilion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town&#x27;s architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game&#x27;s setting.

Development of the game began in January 1998, spanning two years with manpower that steadily increased from 20 to 50 at peak development phase. The storyline conceived for the game follows Ashley Riot&#x27;s origins as a dedicated government agent prior to being the titular &quot;vagrant&quot; who is &quot;involved in many incidents&quot; after the events in Leá Monde. Inspiration for the plot is derived from Hollywood &quot;classic and blockbuster&quot; films as well as European and Asian films. The gameplay was conceived to cater to hardcore gamers who do not &quot;ask for hints and read through strategy guides&quot;. However, Matsuno revealed that over half of the game&#x27;s story was cut due to capacity and development time constraints. Memory issues was considered the most challenging aspect of the game development, with the team forced to adjust the game&#x27;s interface, texture mapping and polygon mesh in maps, as well as removing gaming elements such as AI-controlled supporting non-player characters that would have joined Ashley in the middle of the game.

&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was conceived during a time when most games had made the transition into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the frame rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; are credited to Minoru Akao, the game&#x27;s sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.

===Releases===
A demo disc of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was included in the packaging of &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana&quot; in Japan. During the Square Millennium Event held by Square in Tokyo, movies of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; such as the opening sequence and the weapon crafting system were presented to onlookers. Matsuno said that a normal playthrough would take the player five to six hours to complete.

In Japan, the game was released on February 10, 2000. In North America, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was released as part of Square&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Adventure&quot; that lasted from May to September 2000. &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was released with two discs; the first disc is the game itself, while the second disc is a demo disc released by Square to give the player a preview of seven titles. The seven titles include three interactive demos and four non-interactive demos; the former being &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; and &quot;Threads of Fate&quot;, and the latter &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, &quot;SaGa Frontier 2&quot;, &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot; and &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;. Both discs were included in the North American release on May 16, 2000. Due to a ruling by the Quebec government that video game titles in Canada should be sold with both French and English-language instructions, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;&#x27;s release was delayed in Canada. In the European PAL release, the game did not feature the additional demo disc.

===Merchandise===
On April 13, 2000, DigiCube published the &quot;Vagrant Story Ultimania&quot;, the official 496-page strategy guide for the game with the . The contents include staff interviews, a detailed background story, and information on monsters and items. The book was republished by Studio BentStuff and Square Enix in July 2006. Other merchandise include jewellery, T-shirts, cigarette lighters and posters featuring character artwork and CG renders. For the North American release, a 16-page comic-book tie-in with art by Steve Firchow, Clarence Lansang and Michael Turner of &quot;Witchblade&quot; fame was published by Eruptor Entertainment and Squaresoft. The comic was freely distributed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2000 and included an interview between Matsuno and Square Electronic Arts assistant product manager Andrew Shiozaki.

===Music===
The original score for &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was composed, arranged, and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto, whose previous video game works included the soundtracks to &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, with additional arrangement by Takeharu Ishimoto for Track 2–30 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–31. A Japanese orchestra ensemble, Shinozuka Group, performed for the orchestral piece of Track 2–29. All synthesizing operations are led by Takeharu Ishimoto with assistance from Hidenori Iwasaki for Track 1–1 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–18.

Sakimoto noted that during the initial phase, he composed &quot;bright and cheerful&quot; tunes similar to &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, but Matsuno emphasized music that was &quot;more deep and heavy&quot;. Matsuno also advised him to listen to music from &quot;The X-Files&quot; for ideas on ambient scores, and Sakimoto pointed out influences of James Horner and Hans Zimmer in his compositions. Sakimoto was impressed with the dedication of the development team to the game, and expressed uneasiness trying to come up with music during the game previews. Sakimoto created themes for each character and monster, and made several changes in their melody to reflect their relationships, feelings as well as antagonistic views. The soundtrack for &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; remains to be one of Sakimoto&#x27;s favorite compositions.

The album was first released on two Compact Discs by DigiCube on March 8, 2000 bearing the catalog number &quot;SSCX-10042&quot;. It was subsequently re-released by Square Enix on March 24, 2006 with the catalog number &quot;SQEX-10068/9&quot;; the re-release removed some of the original PlayStation synth reverb, yielding a slightly different version of the audio. The CDs contain 57 tracks, including two remixes and tracks that were not used in the game. Packaged with it is a small booklet featuring interviews with the composer and character artworks.

==Reception==
In May 2000, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was the fifth best-selling PlayStation title of the month. 100,000 units were sold in the first 20 days of the game&#x27;s release, despite being overshadowed by other Square titles like &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;.

&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was the third of thirty games to date, and the only game on the PlayStation, to receive a perfect score of 40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine. Review aggregator website Metacritic stated that the critical response to the game featured &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, while GameRankings ranked it as the 15th best PS game. Multimedia news websites &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the gameplay and story. &quot;IGN&quot; described the story as &quot;so deep and intuitive that it&#x27;ll likely please fans&quot;, and said the battle system maintains &quot;a needed element of strategy and balance&quot;. The graphics were seen as a breakaway from the clichés of Square&#x27;s contemporary titles. Extensive detail was given to the background settings and character expressions. The game&#x27;s sound effects have been praised as &quot;well done and impressive, straying from Square&#x27;s synthed noise&quot;, as details such as the background audio help create a believable world for the player.

The battle system, however, was described by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as too complex for beginner players, as even hard-core players require a &quot;comprehensive understanding&quot; of the weapon customization system. &quot;IGN&quot; pointed out that enemy encounters can be more difficult than boss battles. &quot;1UP.com&quot; noted that the game&#x27;s inventory was too limited for the vast number of customizations possible; this was considered particularly troublesome because some boss enemies are only vulnerable to certain types of weapons.

Eric Bratcher for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the game four stars out of five, praising the game&#x27;s story, graphics and combat system.

Alexander O. Smith is responsible for the English localization of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, using archaic English as compared to its straightforward Japanese version. His effort on translating &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was described by Andrew Vestal as an &quot;unparalleled—and unprecedented—work&quot; of Japanese to English video game translation, &quot;in spite of the occasional typo or grammatical hiccup&quot;, as quoted by &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was awarded &quot;Best PlayStation Game&quot; in the E3 2000 IGN Awards and was nominated for &quot;Console Action/Adventure&quot; during the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards held by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. It was a runner-up for GameSpot&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Game Story&quot;, &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; awards among console games.

===Legacy===
Three years after its 2000 release, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; was selected as one of Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits. Games released as Greatest Hits were sold at a lower price, often increasing units sold. &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is also part of Ultimate Hits, Square Enix&#x27;s main budget range. The game was later made playable on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles on the PlayStation Stores in Japan, Europe and North America.

The 2006 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; contains several references to &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. Terms such as Riskbreaker, Leámonde and Kildea (albeit with different spellings in the localizations), are commonly used in both games. According to an interview with Joypad, a French gaming magazine, in 2004, Yasumi Matsuno claimed during its development that Ivalice, the game world he created when he joined Square in 1995, is a complex world with a very long history and the stories of &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map. The original plan, however, was not to place &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; in the Ivalice universe. Matsuno commented in 2011 that the plot elements of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; found in &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; were meant to be intertextual reference to the Ivalice title as a form of &quot;fan service&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood&quot; referenced the game further in 2017 through the &quot;Return to Ivalice&quot; raid series, most notably by including an alternate version of the city of Valnain and Leá Monde as existing locations in its own world. The follow-up story in &quot;Shadowbringers&quot; titled &quot;Save the Queen&quot; further referenced the game, including using concepts from an unused sequel.

&quot;Vagrant Story&quot; is acknowledged as a game with an &quot;extreme popularity&quot; outside Japan eight years after it was first released. In October 2007, during an interview with the development team responsible for the enhanced port of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions&quot;, executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu was asked about the possibility of a remake or port of the title to the PSP. Kawazu mentioned that it is &quot;the next natural candidate for such an update&quot;, although there would be difficulty in porting the game, because it was a title that already pushed the original PlayStation to its technical limits. Kawazu also remarked that bringing the character Ashley Riot into other Ivalice titles would be difficult since, even in &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;there&#x27;s really not that much learn(ed) about Ashley Riot&quot;.

<text>The glissando illusion is an auditory illusion, created when a sound with a fixed pitch, such as a synthesized oboe tone, is played together with a sine wave gliding up and down in pitch, and they are both switched back and forth between stereo loudspeakers. The effect is that the oboe is heard as switching between loudspeakers while the sine wave is heard as joined together seamlessly, and as moving around in space in accordance with its pitch motion. Right-handers often hear the glissando as traveling from left to right as its pitch glides from low to high, and then back from right to left as its pitch glides from high to low.

The effect was first reported and demonstrated by Diana Deutsch in &quot;Musical Illusions and Paradoxes&quot;, 1995.

<text>Davao Region, formerly called Southern Mindanao (; ), is an administrative region in the Philippines, designated as Region XI. It is situated at the southeastern portion of Mindanao and comprises five provinces: Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, and Davao Occidental.

The region encloses Davao Gulf, and its regional center and largest city is Davao City. &quot;Dávao&quot; is the Hispanicized pronunciation of &quot;daba-daba&quot;, the Bagobo word for &quot;fire&quot;.

==Etymology==
Many historians believe that the name &quot;Davao&quot; is the mixture of the three names that three different tribes, the earliest settlers in the region, had for the Davao River. The Manobos, an aboriginal tribe, referred to the Davao Rivers as &quot;Davohoho&quot;. Another tribe, the Bagobos, referred to the river as &quot;Davohaha&quot;, which means &quot;fire&quot;, while another tribe, the Guiangan tribe, called the river as &quot;Duhwow&quot;.

==History==
The history of the region dates back to the times when various tribes occupied the region. It is believed that the Manobos, Mandayas, Kalagans, Mansakas, and Bagobos occupied the area. These are the same tribes that created the small settlements and communities that eventually became Mindanao.

===Maguindanao era===
The Davao Region was once part of Sultanate of Maguindanao and was called &quot;Pinagurasan&quot; by the Maguindanaons. Early settlers of the region were Maguindanaons and the Tausugs under the Sultanate of Sulu. Datu Bago was one of the Datus in Davao Gulf who resisted the Spanish Empire colonization on the region.

===First European contact===
The Davao Gulf area was the first region in the country that was in contact with the Europeans, with such contacts taking place as early as 16th century. The Portuguese preceded the Spaniards, who were the ones to colonize the region albeit much later, in sighting and visiting the region. In 1512, Francisco Serrano was shipwrecked in the shallow waters and coral reefs of Cape of San Agustín, located in what is now the province of Davao Oriental. In 1538, Francisco de Castro, a Portuguese ship captain, was driven by strong winds to the southeastern coast of Mindanao. He baptized several chieftains in the area.

Around January 1546, Francis Xavier, a Jesuit priest, left Malacca and went to Molucca Islands, then called the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements, and for a year and a half he preached the Gospel to the inhabitants of Amboyna, Ternate, Baranura, and other lesser islands. It is claimed by some that during this expedition he landed on the island of Mindanao, which is confirmed by some writers of the seventeenth century, and in the Bull of canonization issued in 1623. It is also said that he is the one to have preached the Gospel in Mindanao.

===Spanish administration===
For centuries the tribes lived in relative peace until the Spanish, under the adventurous Spanish businessman Don Jose Oyanguren, arrived in the region in 1847. At that time, the Kalagan Moro chieftain Datu Bago was in control of the area in what is now Davao City. Don Oyanguren attempted to conquer the area which Datu Bago ruled; although he failed at first, the Moro chieftain eventually evacuated his people to live in the areas near Mount Apo. This is the time the town of Davao, then called Nueva Vergara by the Spaniards, was established in the year 1848.

Don Oyanguren attempted to develop the region. Although the Spanish gained the upper hand when they finally controlled the ports of the region, the population of Davao grew very slowly until the arrival of Christian missionaries in the area in 1890. Unlike the major parts of Luzon, Visayas and other coastal parts of Mindanao, Spanish rule in Davao lasted only for 50 years, abandoning it in 1898 when the Philippines became independent from Spain, making it among the shortest-lived areas controlled by Spain.

===American administration===
After the Spanish–American War in 1898, Spanish rule in the region ended. Americans then landed in the region and they subsequently developed the regions communications and transportation systems. During this period, private farm ownership grew in the region. Japanese migration in the region began as two Japanese entrepreneurs, Kyosaburo Ohta and Yoshizo Furukawa, were finding better agricultural lands for building abaca and coconut plantations in the region. The Port of Davao was opened on 1900, becoming the first Philippine international port to be established in the south.

In 1903 until 1914, the region was one of the districts of the former Moro Province in Mindanao. After 1914, the province was replaced by an American colonial agency called Department of Mindanao and Sulu, which spanned the entire Mindanao island except Lanao. The agency lasted from 1914 to 1920.

====Wartime Japanese occupation====
In 1942, during World War II, as the Japanese occupation of the Philippines began, the region was one of the first among the Philippine regions to be subjected by Japanese occupation. The Japanese immigrants in Davao acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II. These Japanese were hated by the Moro Muslims and disliked by the Chinese. The Moros were judged as &quot;fully capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike.&quot; The Moros were to fight the Japanese invaders when they landed at Davao on Mindanao. The Japanese went back to their ships at night to sleep since the Moros struck so much fear into them, even though the Moros were outnumbered by the Japanese. The longest battle of the Allied liberation campaign, the Battle of Davao, took place in 1945. After the war, the region eventually passed to the American hands again for at least almost one year before the formal Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, most of the Japanese living in the region were now integrated in the Filipino population.

===Philippine administration===
====Davao province====
Prior to Philippine independence in 1946, the entire region was a single province called Davao Province, with Davao City serving as its capital. The province was one of the largest provinces in the Philippines during that time, spanning more than . It lasted from 1920 until 1967, when the province was split into three provinces in May 1967: Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental. After the division, Davao City was officially named its regional center.

====Southern Mindanao and Davao Region====
Region XI, then known as &quot;Southern Mindanao&quot;, originally covered 6 provinces (Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, South Cotabato and Sarangani), and the cities of Davao, Digos, Panabo, Tagum, Samal, General Santos and Koronadal. Surigao del Sur was moved to the newly created region Caraga on February 23, 1995.

In September 2001, &quot;Executive Order No. 36&quot; was enacted which reorganized the regions in Mindanao. , then known as &quot;Southern Mindanao&quot;, was renamed &quot;Davao Region&quot;, and the provinces of South Cotabato and Sarangani, and the cities of General Santos and Koronadal were moved to .

On October 12, 2022, the Regional Peace and Order Council declared the entire region &quot;insurgency-free&quot; after decades of being a stronghold for the communist insurgency, barring some scattered members of the New People&#x27;s Army that are left in the region.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provinces===
Davao Region is subdivided into five provinces, 1 &quot;highly urbanized&quot; city, five &quot;component&quot; cities, 43 municipalities, and 1,162 barangays.

====Governors and vice governors====
===Cities===


== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
The region has a generally uniform distribution of rainfall through the year. It lies outside the typhoon belt.

== Demographics ==

Davao Region is the most populous region in Mindanao and the 7th most populous in the country, with a total of 5,243,536 inhabitants in 2020. Davao City, its regional capital, is also the largest city in Mindanao, with an area of 2,444 km2, the largest in the country and one of the largest in the world, and has 1,632,991 inhabitants in 2015, making it the third most populous city in the country and the most populous city proper in the entire Visayas-Mindanao region. Davao Metropolitan Area, the primary economic and urban build-up area in the region, is also the most populous in the island and the third most populous in the country, with about 2,274,913 inhabitants in that year.

Most of the region&#x27;s inhabitants speak Cebuano. Filipino and English are also spoken and widely used in schools, businesses, commerce, and industry. In the Davao City Metro Area, a linguistic phenomenon has developed whereby locals have either shifted to Filipino or significantly mix Filipino terms and grammar into their Cebuano speech. Minority indigenous groups of the region speak their own languages as well.

Chinese immigrants are widespread in the region, with a considerable population based in Davao City. Davao Chinatown is one of the two defined Chinatowns in the Philippines, alongside Binondo in Manila. A considerable population of Japanese are also found in the region, most of them also located in Davao City. Before World War II, Davao was and still is heavily populated by Japanese immigrants and their descendants, with Davao City being touted at one point in its history as the Little Tokyo of the Philippines.

===Religion===
The majority of the region&#x27;s population are Christians, mostly Catholics (); and there are also Muslims (3.55%), Buddhists (), and Shintoists living in the region.

==Economy==

While the region&#x27;s economy is predominantly agri-based, it is now developing into a center for agro-industrial business, trade and tourism. Its competitive advantage is in agri-industry as its products, papayas, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, fresh asparagus, flowers, and fish products are exported internationally. The region can be a vital link to markets in other parts of Mindanao, Brunei Darussalam and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. There is also a growing call center sector in the region, mostly centered in Davao City.

There is a gradual shift to industrialization as shown with industry&#x27;s growth rate of 8.1% in 1996. Other economic activities are mining, fishery, forestry and agriculture. Due to the region&#x27;s rise as the main commercial and industrial hub of Mindanao, many of its workers are oriented to urban services such as putting small-scale businesses and working in commercial industries in thriving urban areas like Davao, Tagum, and Digos. Both private and foreign investors and businessmen are putting up huge business centers in the region, fueling up its commercial growth rate.

The region is also venturing to online business like outsourcing.

===Ports and airport===
The region&#x27;s principal ports are the Sasa International Seaport in Sasa and Santa Ana Pier in the Chinatown District, both in Davao City; Panabo Seaport in Davao del Norte; and Mati Seaport in Davao Oriental. The former two, both of which are located in Port of Davao in Davao City, can service both interisland and international shipments. Sasa International Container Port, also located in the Port of Davao, is the busiest in Mindanao.

The international airport in Davao City, Francisco Bangoy International Airport, is the largest and most developed in Mindanao, has the first longest runway in the island, and the third busiest in the country, after Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Mactan–Cebu International Airport. Being the only airport in the island that is currently catering for international destinations, it can handle both domestic and international flights, serving several domestic flights to Manila, Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo, Zamboanga and other major Philippine cities, and international flights to Doha, Hong Kong, Manado, Quanzhou, and Singapore. Its ATC Tower is the most advanced in the country.

The region is accessible by land, air and sea. The region has adequate communications facilities, reliable power, and an abundant water supply.

In December 2016, President Duterte helped enter a contract with Chinese investors to create a new port in the region of Isla Verde in Davao. This involves the creation of three artificial islands by a set of Chinese companies including CCCC Dredging Group Co. Ltd for $200 million.

<text>The Mabuhay Gardens, also known as The Fab Mab or The Mab, was a former San Francisco nightclub, located at 443 Broadway Street, in North Beach on the Broadway strip area best known for its striptease clubs. It closed in 1987.

==History==
The Mabuhay Gardens was located in the lower level of the 435 Broadway Street building, which also housed the &quot;On Broadway Theater&quot;, known in 1984–1985 as &quot;Rock on Broadway.&quot;

Originally a Filipino restaurant and music club owned by Ness Aquino, it featured many Filipino celebrities, including Eddie Mesa, the &quot;Elvis Presley of the Philippines&quot;. Aquino and Amapola also co-hosted a weekly television program, &quot;The Amapola Presents Show&quot; on KEMO TV Channel 20.

During the late 1970s, Jerry Paulsen was the first promoter of bands to appear at Mabuhay Gardens on a regular basis. He booked them on Mondays and Tuesdays to begin with so he could showcase the bands that he featured in Psyclone magazine to existing record executives. The scene became so popular that he was soon booking two bands a night seven days a week.

Bay Area punk and New Wave bands performed there, and it was an important touring stop for bands from beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the local bands that performed regularly at the Mabuhay Gardens were Avengers, Dead Kennedys, The Contractions, The Nuns, Crime, Dils, Fear, Pearl Harbor and the Explosions, the Tubes and Wall of Voodoo, to name a few. After Paulson left, Dirk Dirksen (the &quot;pope of punk&quot;) booked The Dead Boys, Nico, The Runaways, Devo, X, The Police, SVT, The Go-Go&#x27;s, Motörhead, Sun Ra and his Arkestra, Patti Smith, Primus, The Jim Carroll Band, and REM, and others. Comedians such as Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams also made early appearances at the venue.

Dirk Dirksen, nephew of Senator Everett Dirksen, had a unique style as emcee, deliberately baiting and trading insults with audience and band members, which had the effect of raising the energy of audience and performers alike. In order to maintain the show&#x27;s fast pace, he would move past an encore to get to the next band and tell the audience, &quot;Eat it.&quot; Dirksen&#x27;s abrasive persona (which was largely a performance) was a central part of the atmosphere of Mabuhay Gardens. He was sometimes referred to as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Bill Graham.&quot; Dirksen was the sole person responsible for connecting the English punk rockers with those in the United States. By creating an exchange program, punk bands from England and New York City came to the Mabuhay Gardens and vice versa, staying in each city performing a few nights at a time. This spread the &quot;punk&quot; scene globally making it a household word, thanks to Dirksen and Aquino. The alley located next to the Mabuhay Gardens is now named for him.

The Mabuhay Gardens closed in 1987. The building subsequently housed a nightclub called the Velvet Lounge. The venue was again opened in September 2007 under the name Club 443. Currently, Fame Venue operates at 443 Broadway Street, which is used for conferences, concerts, catering and other events.

==In popular culture==

American visual artist Bruce Conner documented the punk scene at Mabuhay Gardens through a series of concert photographs that featured action shots of Negative Trend, Crime, Avengers, and other notable Mabuhay Gardens mainstays. In a 2014 essay, artist Emma Hart reflected on the legacy of Conner&#x27;s Mabuhay Gardens photographs writing, &quot;Never holding back while photographing punk rock shows at the Mabuhay Gardens, Conner documents his immersion in the scene, breaking the boundary between spectator and performer and providing a lens into the punk world of late 1970s when Mabuhay Gardens, or Fab Mab, emerged as the center of the San Francisco punk club milieu.&quot; 

The Mabuhay Gardens featured in a chapter from Jennifer Egan&#x27;s &quot;A Visit from the Goon Squad&quot; (Pulitzer 2011). This chapter, &quot;Ask Me if I Care,&quot; was also published in the March 8, 2010, issue of the &quot;New Yorker&quot;. The Mabuhay Gardens are referenced in the song &quot;Looking for Lewis And Clark&quot; by the Los Angeles band The Long Ryders on their 1985 album State of the Union.

Rapper Vinnie Paz named a track &quot;Mabuhay Gardens&quot; on his, &quot;As Above, So Below&quot; album.

The Mabuhay Gardens is also featured in &quot;Circus of the Sun&quot; (2019), J.Macon King&#x27;s novel set in late Seventies&#x27; North Beach. Jack, the main character in the novel, is in a band that plays its first major gig at the Mabuhay, along with the Dead Kennedys and Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Dirk Dirksen is portrayed in a real-life role as show host and MC. (J.Macon King is the founder and editor of the &quot;Mill Valley Literary Review.&quot;)

== Building history for 435 Broadway Street ==
The building was built in 1919 and was originally called the Garibaldi Hall, an Italian Men’s Club. During the 1940s the building housed the Italian Supper Club.

The On Broadway Theater was in the upper level of the 435 Broadway Street building in the North Beach area of San Francisco. &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; was presented at the On Broadway Theatre, in 1969. 
In 1984 the upstairs club opened as Brent Turner’s Rock On Broadway. The club was a mecca for glam, heavy metal, and Bay Area thrash metal. 

The &quot;Broadway Studios&quot; opened in 1993, later named the &quot;On Broadway Dinner Theater&quot;.

<doc id="296170" wikidata="Q1375828" url="?curid=296170" title="European route E19">
<text>European route E19 is a long European route. It connects the Netherlands to France via Belgium. The E19 is the busiest road in Europe. 
Among the places included in its itinerary are:

* &quot;Netherlands:&quot; Amsterdam - The Hague - Rijswijk - Rotterdam - Breda

* &quot;Belgium:&quot; Antwerp - Mechelen - Brussels - Mons
* &quot;France:&quot; Valenciennes - Cambrai - Compiègne - Paris

==Overview==
Since October 2007 construction works have started on a new railroad between Schaerbeek and Mechelen on the central reservation of the E 19 (Belgian A1) with the purpose of improving the train connection between Antwerp, Brussels Airport and Brussels.

In the Netherlands, the E19 starts in Amsterdam on the A4 to pass Through to the Hague, where it switches to the A13 to run Delft and to Rotterdam. There it goes on the Kleinpolderplein on the A20 and Terbregseplein on the A16. At Zwijndrecht it passes through the Drechttunnel as it goes on to Dordrecht, over the Moerdijkbruggen, following to the city of Breda and crossing the border at Hazeldonk/Meer into Belgium.

In Belgium the E19 runs on the A1 to the Antwerp ring and from Antwerp to the Brusselse ring. The route then leads to France via the A7.

In France, the E19 runs first in the Hauts-de-France region on the A2. In Valenciennes, it serves as the ring on the A23 motorway to Lille. At the junction of Graincourt-lès-Havrincourt near Cambrai, the E 19 joins the Autoroute des Anglais E 17. It then meets the E 15 European route in the node of Combles.

It now runs on the North Autoroute A1 through the Picardy to Paris. The European roads E 15 and E 19 merge into each other. The node of Ablaincourt-Pressoir connects the E 19 to the E 44. Then comes Compiègne before reaching the Île-de-France region.

It arrives in the agglomeration of Paris and meets the Francilienne, also known as A104, near the airport of Paris-Charles de Gaulle and then the A170 at the junction of Gonesse. Shortly thereafter, the E15 and E19 diverge in the knot of Garonor. The knot of la Courneuve connects it to the A86. The E 19 ends at the Porte de la Chapelle, where it connects to the Boulevard périphérique (ring) and the Rue de la Chapelle (street of La Chapelle).

In the past, this European road was number 10 (E 10). Of these, some names are derived, look for the E10 lake in Brasschaat / Schoten.

== Route ==
The E19 passes the following cities:
** : Amsterdam - Schiphol Airport - The Hague
** : The Hague - Delft - Rotterdam
** : Ring road Rotterdam
** : Rotterdam - Breda - Border

<text>La Mallorquina is a restaurant in Old San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico that specializes in the making of Puerto Rican and Spanish-particularly Palma de Mallorca-cuisine such as asopao, gazpacho, arroz con pollo, paella and flan.

It opened in 1848 and has been run by the Rojos family since 1900 and Yvonne Ortiz claims that La Mallorquina is the first eating establishment in Puerto Rico.
The restaurant&#x27;s original owners, Antonio Vidal Llinás and others, came from Palma de Mallorca, Spain; that&#x27;s why they named their restaurant &quot;La Mallorquina,&quot; which loosely translated into English means &quot;The Woman from Mallorca.&quot;

Puerto Rico&#x27;s first elected governor, Luis Muñoz Marín, was also one of the famous people to visit the restaurant.

<doc id="296175" wikidata="Q17090436" url="?curid=296175" title="Tritone paradox">
<text>The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of &quot;higher&quot; tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair C–F as ascending and the tone pair G–C as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair C–F as descending and the tone pair G–C as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener&#x27;s language or dialect.

Each Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves (880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.) and lower octaves (220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc.). The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves (622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc.). The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelope—for example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range.

Shepard predicted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones&#x27; absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English.

<doc id="296176" wikidata="Q4874266" url="?curid=296176" title="Bayamón City Hall">
<text>Bayamón City Hall is a building in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. As the name suggests, it serves as city hall to that city. It is named after Don Ángel Rivera Rodríguez, who was mayor of Bayamón from 1934 to 1944.

Bayamón City Hall was inaugurated in 1980 by Mayor Ramón Luis Rivera at the cost of $7.2 million. Rivera stepped down as mayor in 2000, giving way for his son Ramón Luis Rivera, Jr., to become mayor. Since its inauguration, it&#x27;s been occupied by mayors representing the Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), a political party that advocates statehood for Puerto Rico.

Located next to El Parque del tren, the city hall is considered a tourist attraction, as it was built over an existing avenue to use its air rights. Visitors park next to the building, walk to the avenue, and board an elevator to reach the offices.

According to the building&#x27;s architects, the reason for building it over the highway is because the city of Bayamón did not own property large enough within the city for a city hall building.

The second floor has a glass-window bridge, from where the visitors can cross from one side to the other, while looking at cars pass by. The upper levels are all for office activities, including citizen complaints, city planning, etc.

The building includes a theatre presenting live drama. This enables the building to be used and attract people in the evenings as well as during the day.

The Bayamón City Hall is painted gray. For a long time, it was the only building in Latin America that was built over an avenue.

In 2022, FEMA allocated close to $5 million for work on Bayamón City Hall.

<doc id="296180" wikidata="Q7323685" url="?curid=296180" title="Richard Epstein">
<text>Richard Allen Epstein (born April 17, 1943) is an American legal scholar known for his writings on torts, contracts, property rights, law and economics, classical liberalism, and libertarianism. He is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at New York University and the director of the Classical Liberal Institute. He also serves as a Senior Research Fellow at the Civitas Institute, as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and as a senior lecturer and the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Chicago.

According to James W. Ely Jr., Epstein&#x27;s writings have had a &quot;pervasive influence on American legal thought.&quot; In 2000, a study published in &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century; in 2008, he was chosen in a poll by &quot;Legal Affairs&quot; as one of the most influential modern legal thinkers. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the third-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky. In a 2021 examination by Fred R. Shapiro, Epstein was the fifth most-cited legal scholar of all time.

==Early life and education==
Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews who immigrated to the United States from Russia and Austria in the early 20th century. Epstein&#x27;s father, Bernard Epstein (19081978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (&quot;née&quot; Reiser; 19082004), managed his father&#x27;s medical office. He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S.161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island.

Epstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate in the early 1960s. He had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a single major, obtaining special permission from the university to pursue a self-selected program of study across sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in 1964.

Epstein&#x27;s undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year&#x27;s top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University; Epstein chose Oxford, where he studied jurisprudence at Oriel College. He received a B.A. with first-class honours in 1966, and then returned to the United States to attend Yale Law School. Because he had an English law degree, Epstein entered Yale as a transfer student with second-year standing. He graduated in 1968 with a LL.B., &quot;cum laude&quot;.

==Academic career==
After graduating from law school, Epstein became an assistant professor at the Gould School of Law of the University of Southern California (USC). He taught at USC for four years before moving to the University of Chicago Law School in 1972. Epstein taught at Chicago for 38 years, eventually holding the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of the New York University School of Law as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, occasionally teaching courses there. In 2013, NYU Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein its inaugural director.

Since 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank at Stanford University. He has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, he was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and, in 1985, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the &quot;Journal of Legal Studies&quot; from 1981 to 1991, and of the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent, and in 2018 he received an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Siegen. In 2005, the College of William &amp; Mary awarded him the Brigham–Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights. In 2011, he was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.

==Writings==
Epstein became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press&#x27;s publication of his book &quot;Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain&quot;. In the book, Epstein argued that the &quot;Takings Clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionwhich reads, &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation&quot;, and is traditionally viewed as a limit on the governmental power of eminent domaingives constitutional protection to citizens&#x27; economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the takings clause after the book&#x27;s publication. During Clarence Thomas&#x27;s Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings in 1991, then-Senator Joe Biden, &quot;in a dramatic movement&quot;, held the book up and &quot;repeatedly interrogated&quot; Thomas about his position on the book&#x27;s thesis. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government&#x27;s ability to control private property. It has also influenced how some courts view property rights and been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court four times, including in the 1992 case &quot;Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council&quot;.

At the height of the HIV pandemic in 1988, Epstein argued that companies ought to be able to discriminate against &quot;AIDS carriers&quot; and that anti-discrimination laws were unfair to employers. In place of such laws, Epstein argued that &quot;AIDS carriers&quot; ought to have their health insurance premiums subsidized via taxation so as to &quot;discipline the behavior of government and interests groups, here by requiring citizens to make choices about how much they individually are prepared to pay to subsidize AIDS carriers.&quot; Furthermore, he argued that &quot;[t]here is no reason to suppose that any public benefit obtained from having employers and their insurers care for AIDS victims will be at some level that matches the additional costs that are imposed.&quot; Instead, Epstein proposed that employers have the right to refuse to hire suspected &quot;AIDS carriers&quot;.

Epstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his 1995 book &quot;Simple Rules for a Complex World&quot;, he consolidates much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. Drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation ought to be repealed. Consistent with the principles of classical liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, should be repealed, stating:

: &quot;Under our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.&quot;

Epstein has criticized the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. In 2007, he defended the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies against the cheaper, generic production of AIDS drugs, writing that &quot;disregarding property rights in the name of human rights reduces human welfare around the globe&quot;.

In 2014, Epstein argued against reparations for African Americans in a piece published on the Hoover Institution&#x27;s website.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Epstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. Taking a decidedly skeptical approach, Epstein concluded that no new national narrative can be achieved &quot;unless we engage in what I call American minimalism—a conscious reduction of the issues that we think are truly best handled as a nation and not better address by smaller subnational groups: states, local governments, and, most importantly, all sorts of small private organizations that are free to choose as they please in setting their own membership and mission.&quot;

===COVID-19 pandemic===
In March and April 2020, Epstein wrote several essays published by the Hoover Institution giving a contrarian account of the COVID-19 pandemic and warning against extensive containment and mitigative United States responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he called an &quot;overreaction&quot;. In a piece published on March 16, he argued that the word &quot;pandemic&quot; is not to be used lightly and that the virus should be allowed to run its course, predicting there would be 500 U.S. deaths. In early June, the U.S. death total surpassed 100,000. On March 24, when U.S. deaths had already exceeded 500, Epstein added a &quot;Correction &amp; Addendum&quot;, in which he changed his forecast to 5,000 deaths without changing the underlying model that had led him to his first estimate. On April 6, when the death toll had already far surpassed his earlier predictions, he again revised that figure, with the &quot;Correction &amp; Addendum&quot; section declaring under the inaccurate date stamp &quot;March 24, 2020&quot; that the &quot;original erroneous estimate of 5,000 dead in the US [was] a number 10 times smaller than [he had] intended to state&quot;, implying that both &quot;500&quot; and &quot;5,000&quot; had been misprints for &quot;50,000&quot;. After several news reports about Epstein&#x27;s ever-increasing estimates, on April 21 an editor&#x27;s note appeared on the website that explained the latest changes as an &quot;editing error&quot; and clarified that Epstein&#x27;s original prediction had been 500 deaths. In December 2020, when the death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. was over 333,000, &quot;Politico&quot; named Epstein&#x27;s predictions among &quot;the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year&quot;.

Epstein compared COVID-19 to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and suggested that public health measures &quot;are done better at the level of plants, hotels, restaurants, and schools than remotely by political leaders.&quot; He argued that &quot;the response of the state governors to the coronavirus outbreak has become far more dangerous than the disease itself&quot;, writing that the number of deaths had been exaggerated. His essays, containing a number of factual errors and misconceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, circulated in conservative circles and in the Trump administration upon their publication. In an article published on June 6, Epstein praised Republican-governed states like Florida for their crisis management, linking the then greater deaths in Democratic-governed states to their &quot;interventionist policies&quot;.

==Influence==

In 2006, the American scholar James W. Ely Jr. wrote: &quot;It is a widely accepted premise that Professor Richard A. Epstein has exercised a pervasive influence on American legal thought.&quot; In 2000, a study published in &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by &quot;Legal Affairs&quot; as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky.

Epstein&#x27;s former students include a number of prominent judges, lawyers, and law professors, including Neomi Rao, Michael McConnell, Noel Francisco, Martha Pacold, and David McIntosh.

==Politics==
Epstein has said that when voting, he chooses &quot;anyone but the Big Two&quot; who are &quot;just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors&quot;. He has voted Libertarian. Epstein says he is &quot;certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy&quot;. Epstein served on The Constitution Project&#x27;s Guantanamo Task Force. Epstein has said that Learned Hand should have been on the Supreme Court and that his favorite English judge was Baron Bramwell.

In early 2015, Epstein commented on his relationship to the modern American political landscape, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m in this very strange position: I&#x27;m not a conservative when it comes to religious values and so forth, but I do believe, in effect, in a strong foreign policy and a relatively small domestic government, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as saying I believe in no government at all.&quot; He has also been characterized as a libertarian conservative. During a debate with Chris Preble in December 2016, Epstein identified himself as being a &quot;libertarian hawk&quot;.

In 2023, Epstein co-authored an op-ed in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; defending the 2023 Israeli judicial reform. Epstein has defended Israel&#x27;s policies vis-à-vis Palestinians, calling allegations of apartheid a canard.

In January 2025, Epstein argued against Birthright citizenship in the United States, a right enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Personal life==
Epstein&#x27;s wife, Eileen W. Epstein, is a fundraiser and educator who serves on the board of trustees for the philanthropic organization American Jewish World Service. They have three children: two sons, Benjamin M. and Elliot, and a daughter, Melissa. Epstein is a first cousin of the comedian and actor Paul Reiser.

Epstein, who had a bar mitzvah, has described himself as &quot;a rather weak, non-practicing Jew.&quot;

<text>The Gyeyul ( and Yul jong 律宗, or Vinaya in Sanskrit) school, founded by the Korean monk Gyeomik who went to India in 526 CE to learn Sanskrit and study the Vinaya, is the Korean name applied to a branch of Buddhism that specializes in the study and implementation of śīla (yuljang 律藏) the &quot;moral discipline&quot; or &quot;&quot;Buddhist ethics&quot;. It derives directly from the Indian &quot;Vinaya School&quot;. Gyeomik went to India from Baekje to study the trepitaka vedatta at &quot;Sangana Vinaya Temple&quot;, translated the text into a book called &quot;yulmun&quot; in Korea, and transmitted the Sanskrit from India to Korea. When Baekje, which is one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, the translated text and the Gyeyul monastic order were lost. 

Vinaya monk Jajang (590–658 CE), born in Silla as a true bone (jin&#x27;gol) aristocrat, revived the Gyeyul order and built the Woljeongsa temple in 643 of Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism on the eastern slopes of Odaesan in Pyeongchang County. In 641 CE, Jajang and his disciple Seungsil travelled to Tang dynasty China where he received bone relic of Buddha&#x27;s crown, Śarīra relics and an honorary robe. He also visited Yunju Temple where he stayed until his return to Silla in 643 CE.

== History ==

When Buddhism first came to Baekje in 384, it was introduced by a Serindian monk named Marananta, Buddhism was quickly embraced but largely unknown. So, a Korean monk named Gyeomik (겸익, 謙益) was sent to India to bring back more information. He is said to have traveled to India via the southern seas, studied Sanskrit and then came back to Baekje accompanied by another Indian monk, Paedalta (Vedatta?) and with many texts on the Vinaya and Abhidharma. Gyeomik translated these texts into Korean along with help from his disciples Tamuk and Hyerin and thus founded the Vinaya School in Korea.

<text>The FG 42 (German: &quot;Fallschirmjägergewehr&quot; 42, &quot;paratrooper rifle 42&quot;) is a selective-fire 7.92×57mm Mauser automatic rifle produced in Nazi Germany during World War II. The weapon was developed specifically for the use of the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in very limited numbers until the end of the war.

It combined the characteristics and firepower of a light machine gun in a lightweight form slightly shorter (but considerably bulkier and heavier) than the standard-issue Karabiner 98k bolt-action infantry rifle. Considered one of the most advanced weapon designs of World War II, the FG 42 influenced post-war small arms development, and many features of its design, such as general shape, stock style, gas-rotating bolt operation (itself copied from the Lewis gun) and sheet metal and plastic construction were copied by the US Army when they developed the M60 machine gun.

==History==

At the time of the Battle of Crete (Operation Mercury), German &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (parachute infantry) were equipped with the same assortment of small arms as the &quot;Heer&quot;, carrying only 9×19mm Parabellum chambered pistols and hand grenades on them during parachute jumps, with 9×19mm Parabellum submachine guns, 7.92×57mm Mauser chambered rifles, and crew-served weapons stored separately in containers that were dropped from the wing of the exit craft. The German RZ parachute harness, with one single riser and two straps attached to the body, making the paratrooper land on his hands and knees in a forward roll, did not allow heavier equipment such as rifles and machine guns to be safely carried during airborne jumps. At Crete, long-range rifle and machine gun fire from dug-in Commonwealth defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the outgunned German paratroopers in the early stages of battle as they attempted to retrieve their support weapons from containers scattered all over the battlefield. These combat experiences demonstrated the need for a rifle that could be carried by the paratrooper during a drop.

The classifications of the development and production &quot;Ausführungen&quot; (types) are as follows:
* Type A - First design
* Type B - Revised model prototype
* Type C - &quot;LC-6&quot; prototype
* Type D - First Fallschirmjägergewehr; acceptance trials
* Type E - First production Fallschirmjägergewehr (sometimes called the &quot;Modell I&quot; (&quot;Type I&quot;)
* Type F - First stamped receiver Fallschirmjägergewehr 
* Type G - Final production model Fallschirmjägergewehr (sometimes called the &quot;Modell II&quot; (&quot;Type II&quot;)

===Development===
In 1941, the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) requested a selective-fire hand-held weapon for the paratroopers; Senior Staff Air Secretary Ossenbach at the &quot;GL/C Erprobungsstelle-6&quot; (GL/C E-6—the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Weapons Development Branch at Tarnewitz near Wismar) was approached informally to develop this special new weapon. The Reich Air Ministry (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; or RLM) sought to develop a universal shoulder-fired automatic rifle that could replace the bolt-action rifle, submachine gun, and light machine gun in the air assault role. The proposed weapon would also simplify logistics and provide greater firepower to the individual paratrooper.

The RLM attempted to initiate a formal weapons development program through the &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (the HWaA, or Army Ordnance Department)—responsible for German small arms development—but conflicting priorities and friction with the Army (the HWaA dismissed the undertaking as unrealistic and offered their G 41(W) semi-automatic rifle instead) led to an independent development by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Plans were laid out to form a central authority for the new program at the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Erprobungstelle&quot; coastal testing station at Tarnewitz. The engineers on staff had acquired considerable expertise developing lightweight automatic weapons, having successfully converted the MG 15 aircraft machine gun to a ground configuration. However, due to the high casualties sustained by the paratroopers during Operation Mercury, Hitler changed his mind about the usefulness of airborne assaults and the plans were terminated. Nevertheless, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring privately ordered the continuation of the project.

The RLM went directly to German industry with its plans—the so-called LC-6 specification issued 14 December 1941 mentioned amongst others that the weapon should not exceed in length, should not be significantly heavier than the Karabiner 98k bolt action standard service rifle, should be able to fire single shots from a closed bolt, provide fully automatic fire from an open bolt, feed from detachable 10- or 20-round magazines and be able to mount a bayonet and use rifle grenades. Despite the introduction of the 7.92×33mm Kurz intermediate cartridge promoted by the &quot;Heer&quot; (developed for the promising MP 43 assault rifle), the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; favored the long-range potential of the 7.92×57mm Mauser full-power rifle cartridge and this chambering was one of the main design prerequisites.

Six manufacturers were solicited for prototype designs: Gustloff-Werke, Mauser, Johannes Großfuß Metall- und Lackierwarenfabrik, C.G. Hänel, Rheinmetall-Borsig and Heinrich Krieghoff Waffenfabrik. Several contracts were awarded but only a few prototypes are known to have been submitted. Mauser offered a version of the MG 81 (rejected due to excessive weight and its belt-fed operation) while Krieghoff presented a rising-block prototype, which too was quickly dropped. A design credited to Rheinmetall-Borsig&#x27;s Louis Stange of Sömmerda who had previously worked on the MG 34 proved satisfactory and underwent military trials conducted by the GL/C E-6 test station at Tarnewitz in mid-1942. This early prototype, known under the factory designation Gerät&quot; 450 (&quot;device 450&quot;) or Ausführung&quot; &quot;A&quot; (&quot;type A&quot;), was intended to be a pure sheet metal design, using pressed steel in the construction of the receiver, buttstock and corrugated handguard. The proposed system of operation was modeled on that used in World War I Lewis light machine gun, with a gas-operated turning bolt action geared to a spiral (clock-type) recoil spring. The type &quot;A&quot; was never produced beyond model form, but the basic design layout was retained for further development.

With the basic characteristics of the LC-6 accepted, a series of modifications followed. The revised &quot;Ausführung&quot; &quot;B&quot; replaced the sheet metal handguard with a resin-impregnated fiber type that provided protection against heat and a better grip when wet.

These tests exposed several shortcomings, addressed by Stange in April 1942 with the LC-6/II prototype. The prototype was then submitted to a series of endurance tests led by the HWA and further modified to increase functional reliability and durability, resulting in the final LC-6/III prototype variant that was ultimately accepted into production as the FG 42. Fifty rifles were fabricated by Rheinmetall-Borsig for evaluation purposes by the end of 1942.

A pre-series batch of 50 rifles was produced in early 1943 and 6 examples were sent to GL/C E-6 for additional testing. Almost identical to the LC-6/III, these guns differ from later models by using a smooth sheet metal buttstock and an experimental muzzle brake. The weapons experienced serious malfunctions: one rifle suffered a catastrophic failure after firing only 2,100 rounds, a soldier was injured when attempting to fire a rifle grenade and the pressed metal buttstock would deform after launching a small number of rifle grenades.

===Production===
Several other improvements were made before being authorized for large-scale production. The original Rheinmetall design used chrome-nickel steel heavily in many essential components, a strategic alloy in short supply. When the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was finally given permission to produce 3,000 rifles for combat trials, the material specifications were changed to accommodate the use of manganese steel as a substitute. The Heinrich Krieghoff company of Suhl (authors of the previous unsuccessful LC-6 tender) was contracted to manufacture the FG 42 in limited quantity as Rheinmetall did not have the capacity to bring the FG 42 into serial production.

The weapon system underwent continuous development. Its expedited development, remedial changes to the original design and ever-changing &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; requirements resulted in a myriad of variants. Post-war literature typically identifies three versions, however the Germans did not give them separate designations; the &quot;Modell I&quot;, and &quot;Modell II&quot; were never officially referenced and period documents simply refer to the weapon as the &#x27;Fallschirmjägergewehr 42&#x27; or &quot;FG 42&quot;, and the reference was always made to the latest production model.

====First operational use====
The weapon saw first operational use during the Gran Sasso raid (&quot;Unternehmen Eiche&quot;) in September 1943 when German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos rescued Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from his captors – 200 well-equipped Carabinieri guards. However, during the whole airborne operation (which was personally ordered by Hitler) not a single shot was fired.

===Deployment===
After approximately 2,000 FG 42s had been produced by Krieghoff, supplies of the manganese steel from which the receivers were forged were diverted to other needs; this meant a redesign was required to use stamped sheet metal in its place. Field reports that the lightweight rifle was not sturdy enough to handle full-power rifle ammunition in cyclic mode made Krieghoff engineers design the Type G. Improvements were: relocating the bipod from the front of the handguard to the muzzle to reduce shot dispersion; changing the pistol grip angle to near vertical; enlarging the handguard and changing the stock from stamped steel to wood to minimize overheating, adding weight to the bolt and lengthen its travel to reduce the cyclic rate of fire. Also a four position gas regulator was fitted, the bolt and recoil spring were changed to wound wire, a case deflector was fitted and the muzzle brake and the bayonet mount was changed. These changes, particularly the pistol grip change and the bipod relocation, are clearly visible on late-model FG 42s. Production models also had a simple flip-out spike bayonet under the barrel hidden by the bipod. In the later version the bayonet was shortened from around to around . There were never enough FG 42s to arm most &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; as originally intended, however most were employed in the western front following the events of D-Day, with the particular use of FG-42 during the Battle of Carentan and the Falaise Pocket (nearly a quarter of all FG-42 produced were in the hands of the 2nd Parachute Division).

==Design details==


===General configuration/layout===
The FG 42 was a select-fire air-cooled weapon and one of the first to incorporate the &quot;straight-line&quot; recoil configuration. This layout, combined with the side magazine, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The operating system was derived from that used in the successful Lewis light machine gun with a gas piston-actuated rotating bolt locking mechanism. The angled pistol grip on the first model was to maintain familiarity with the Kar98k as well as drop container storage and making it less likely to snag on all the straps of parachute equipment in a descent.

This system used pressurized exhaust gases from the bore and channeled them through a port drilled in the barrel into a gas cylinder located under the barrel. The rapid build-up of propellant gases imparted rearward pressure on a long-stroke piston, driving it backwards, while an extension of the bolt carrier interacted with a helical camming slot machined into the bolt carrier, converting this linear movement into an angular velocity and forcing the bolt into a rotary motion, clearing the locking nuts and unlocking it near the end of the bolt carrier&#x27;s travel. The weapon was locked into battery by two lugs on the bolt head which recessed into appropriate cavities machined into the receiver walls. Owing to its main intended use by paratroopers, the rear sight (which necessarily was rather high due to the straight stock design) was a flip-up construction. The iron sight line had a sight radius and consisted of an open-pointed-post-type front sight, and a diopter-type rear sight. It was graduated for 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridges from in increments. On later models the post front sight was hooded to reduce glare under unfavourable light conditions and add protection for the post.

The top of the receiver of the FG 42 was specifically machined with a long dovetail type base designed to accept telescopic sight mounts. The scope mount featured locking lever(s) that allowed quick installation and removal of a telescopic sight depending on the specific combat scenario; general combat or in a limited sniping role. The telescopic sights used on the FG 42 were the ZFG42 or ZF4.

===Receiver specifics and magazine feeding===
The receiver was a sophisticated, machined alloy forging with the magazine housing placed on the left-hand side and the ejection port on the right. Whilst not a true bullpup rifle design the seemingly awkward placement of the magazine housing (horizontally to the side rather than directly beneath the receiver) allowed the bolt mechanism to extend into the buttstock assembly, effectively reducing the overall length of the weapon as the magazine well did not interfere with the location of the pistol grip. The pistol grip was integrated into the trigger group assembly, a separate housing containing the trigger mechanism and fire control components, and was formed from pressed sheet metal during fabrication from two separate halves and then welded together.

The rifle fed from either a 10- or 20-round detachable box magazine or standard 5-round stripper clips into an empty magazine in the gun. The empty weight of the long 10-round magazine is and of the long 20-round magazine .

===Firing===
The FG 42 fired in semi-automatic mode from a closed bolt, accomplished by delaying the release of the firing pin (mounted on the bolt carrier and released by the front sear notch) until after the trigger had been pressed; the short lock time, and little movement in the action during firing translated into greater single-shot accuracy. When operating in the automatic mode, the sear mechanism was designed to fire from an open bolt by simultaneously releasing both the bolt and bolt carrier; and with this mode selected, the bolt would remain open between bursts to provide maximum cooling. This had the advantage of preventing a phenomenon known as &quot;cook off&quot; where the heat of repeated rounds being fired caused a chambered round to overheat and prematurely ignite the powder or primer. The rotating fire selector switch was situated in the trigger group, above the pistol grip on the right side. The charge lever also served as the safety, disabling the sear mechanism when engaged.

===Testing===
The FG 42 was intended to fill a niche in Nazi Germany&#x27;s arsenal and was produced only in small numbers. It was somewhat well received by paratroopers when tested, but it did have its drawbacks. The FG 42 had a 20-round, or sometimes 10 round, magazine that was mounted on the left side of the rifle. Though a side-mounted magazine was common in submachine guns of the time, the larger magazine with heavier ammunition of a full-powered rifle tended to unbalance the weapon. In addition controllable bursts were difficult. This made full-automatic fire only marginally useful. The FG 42 used a fairly sophisticated muzzle device that did help with recoil and muzzle flash, but made blast and noise much greater than on other similar weapons. The US M14 rifle had similar problems, and attempts were made to upgrade that rifle the same way with an in-line stock and muzzle device.

==Influences/derivatives==
The American M41 Johnson LMG has many parallels with the contemporary FG 42. Both had in-line stocks, fed from the left side, and both fired from the open bolt in automatic mode and closed bolt in semi-automatic mode. Despite these similarities, there is no evidence that either weapon had any effect on the design of the other. As they were both seeking to solve similar problems, it is reasonable to expect that each weapon&#x27;s respective engineers approached these problems similarly but independently, unaware of the developments of their counterparts.

It is not easy to determine the significance of the FG 42 in terms of weapons history. With a slightly longer barrel and belt-feeding the weapon would have been an excellent light machine gun. Its designer Louis Stange knew that, he also built a prototype with belt feed.

Some features, such as the details of the gas-operated bolt selection process, were studied by US Army engineers after the war. These, along with some aspects of the MG 42 general-purpose machine gun, are commonly reported to have been incorporated in the similarly troubled M60 general-purpose machine gun. The last known derivatives of the FG 42 were the Swiss Sturmgewehr 52 and M60 machine gun.

The scarcity and prohibitive cost of genuine FG 42s in contemporary firearms collecting circles has brought about an industry of reproduction FG 42 style rifles by manufacturers in US and Germany.

<text>In mathematics, the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem limits the number of sets in a family of sets for which every two sets have at least one element in common. Paul Erdős, Chao Ko, and Richard Rado proved the theorem in 1938, but did not publish it until 1961. It is part of the field of combinatorics, and one of the central results of 

The theorem applies to families of sets that all have the same and are all subsets of some larger set of size One way to construct a family of sets with these parameters, each two sharing an element, is to choose a single element to belong to all the subsets, and then form all of the subsets that contain the chosen element. The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem states that when formula_1 is large enough for the problem to be nontrivial this construction produces the largest possible intersecting families. When formula_2 there are other equally-large families, but for larger values of formula_1 only the families constructed in this way can be largest.

The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem can also be described in terms of hypergraphs or independent sets in Kneser graphs. Several analogous theorems apply to other kinds of mathematical object than sets, including linear subspaces, permutations, and strings. They again describe the largest possible intersecting families as being formed by choosing an element and forming the family of all objects that contain the chosen element.

==Statement==
Suppose that formula_4 is a family of distinct subsets of an set and that each two subsets share at least one element. Then the theorem states that the number of sets in formula_4 is at most the binomial coefficient

The requirement that formula_7 is necessary for the problem to be nontrivial: all sets intersect, and the largest intersecting family consists of all sets, with 

The same result can be formulated as part of the theory of hypergraphs. A family of sets may also be called a hypergraph, and when all the sets (which are called &quot;hyperedges&quot; in this context) are the same it is called an hypergraph. The theorem thus gives an upper bound for the number of pairwise overlapping hyperedges in an hypergraph with 
The theorem may also be formulated in terms of graph theory: the independence number of the Kneser graph formula_8 for formula_7 is
formula_10
This is a graph with a vertex for each subset of an set, and an edge between every pair of disjoint sets. An independent set is a collection of vertices that has no edges between its pairs, and the independence number is the size of the largest Because Kneser graphs have symmetries taking any vertex to any other vertex (they are vertex-transitive graphs), their fractional chromatic number equals the ratio of their number of vertices to their independence number, so another way of expressing the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem is that these graphs have fractional chromatic number 

==History==
Paul Erdős, Chao Ko, and Richard Rado proved this theorem in 1938 after working together on it in England. Rado had moved from Berlin to the University of Cambridge and Erdős from Hungary to the University of Manchester, both escaping the influence of Nazi Germany; Ko was a student of Louis J. Mordell at However, they did not publish the result with the long delay occurring in part because of a lack of interest in combinatorial set theory in the 1930s, and increased interest in the topic in The 1961 paper stated the result in an apparently more general form, in which the subsets were only required to be size and to satisfy the additional requirement that no subset be contained in any A family of subsets meeting these conditions can be enlarged to subsets of size either by an application of or by choosing each enlarged subset from the same chain in a symmetric chain decomposition 

==Maximum and maximal families==
===Families of maximum size===

A simple way to construct an intersecting family of sets whose size exactly matches the Erdős–Ko–Rado bound is to choose any fixed and let formula_4 consist of all subsets that For instance, for 2-element subsets of the 4-element this produces the family

Any two sets in this family intersect, because they both The number of sets is formula_12, because after the fixed element is chosen there remain formula_13 other elements to choose, and each set chooses formula_14 of these remaining elements.

When formula_15 this is the only intersecting family of this size. However, when formula_2, there is a more general construction. Each set can be matched up to its complement, the only set from which it is disjoint. Then, choose one set from each of these complementary pairs. For instance, for the same parameters above, this more general construction can be used to form the family

where every two sets intersect despite no element belonging to all three sets. In this example, all of the sets have been complemented from the ones in the first example, but it is also possible to complement only some of the sets.

 families of the first type (variously known as stars, dictatorships, juntas, centered families, or principal families) are the unique maximum families. In this case, a family of nearly-maximum size has an element which is common to almost all of its This property has been called although the same term has also been used for a different property, the fact that (for a wide range of parameters) deleting randomly-chosen edges from the Kneser graph does not increase the size of its independent 

===Maximal intersecting families===

An intersecting family of sets may be maximal, in that no further set can be added (even by extending the ground set) without destroying the intersection property, but not of maximum size. An example with formula_17 and formula_18 is the set of seven lines of the Fano plane, much less than the Erdős–Ko–Rado bound More generally, the lines of any finite projective plane of order formula_19 form a maximal intersecting family that includes only formula_1 sets, for the parameters formula_21 The Fano plane is the case formula_22 of this construction.

The smallest possible size of a maximal intersecting family of sets, in terms is unknown but at least formula_23 Projective planes produce maximal intersecting families whose number of sets but for infinitely many choices of formula_24 there exist smaller maximal intersecting families of 

The largest intersecting families of sets that are maximal but not maximum have size formula_25
They are formed from an and an not by adding formula_26 to the family of sets that include both formula_27 and at least one element This result is called the Hilton–Milner theorem, after its proof by Anthony Hilton and Eric Charles Milner in 

==Proofs==
The original proof of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem used induction The base case, follows easily from the facts that an intersecting family cannot include both a set and its complement, and that in this case the bound of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem is exactly half the number of all sets. The induction step for uses a method called &quot;shifting&quot;, of substituting elements in intersecting families to make the family smaller in lexicographic order and reduce it to a canonical form that is easier to 

In 1972, Gyula O. H. Katona gave the following short proof using 

It is also possible to derive the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem as a special case of the Kruskal–Katona theorem, another important result in Many other proofs are

===Generalizations===
A generalization of the theorem applies to subsets that are required to have large intersections. This version of the theorem has three parameters: formula_1, the number of elements the subsets are drawn from, formula_24, the size of the subsets, as before, and formula_30, the minimum size of the intersection of any two subsets. For the original form of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, In general, for formula_1 large enough with respect to the other two parameters, the generalized theorem states that the size of a family of subsets is at formula_32
More precisely, this bound holds and does not hold for smaller values When the only families of this size are obtained by designating as the common intersection of all the subsets, and constructing the family of all subsets that include these formula_30 designated The maximal size of a -intersecting family when formula_34 was determined by Ahlswede and Khachatrian, in their Ahlswede–Khachatrian theorem.

The corresponding graph-theoretic formulation of this generalization involves Johnson graphs in place of Kneser For large enough values of formula_1 and in particular both the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem and its generalization can be strengthened from the independence number to the Shannon capacity of a graph: the Johnson graph corresponding to the subsets has Shannon 

The theorem can also be generalized to families in which every formula_36 subsets have a common intersection. Because this strengthens the condition that every pair intersects (for which these families have the same bound on their maximum size, formula_12 when formula_1 is sufficiently large. However, in this case the meaning of &quot;sufficiently large&quot; can be relaxed from formula_7 

===Analogs===
Many results analogous to the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, but for other classes of objects than finite sets, are known. These generally involve a statement that the largest families of intersecting objects, for some definition of intersection, are obtained by choosing an element and constructing the family of all objects that include that chosen element. Examples include the following:

There is a -analog of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem for intersecting families of linear subspaces over finite fields. If formula_40 is an intersecting family of subspaces of an vector space over a finite field of then
formula_41
where the subscript marks the notation for the Gaussian binomial coefficient, the number of subspaces of a given dimension within a vector space of a larger dimension over a finite field of In this case, a largest intersecting family of subspaces may be obtained by choosing any nonzero vector and constructing the family of subspaces of the given dimension that all contain the chosen 

Two permutations on the same set of elements are defined to be intersecting if there is some element that has the same image under both permutations. On an set, there is an obvious family of formula_42 intersecting permutations, the permutations that fix one of the elements (the stabilizer subgroup of this element). The analogous theorem is that no intersecting family of permutations can be larger, and that the only intersecting families of size formula_42 are the cosets of one-element stabilizers. These can be described more directly as the families of permutations that map some fixed element to another fixed element. More generally, for any formula_30 and sufficiently large formula_1, a family of permutations each pair of which has formula_30 elements in common has maximum size formula_47, and the only families of this size are cosets of pointwise Alternatively, in graph theoretic terms, the permutations correspond to the perfect matchings of a complete bipartite graph formula_48 and the theorem states that, among families of perfect matchings each pair of which share formula_30 edges, the largest families are formed by the matchings that all contain formula_30 chosen Another analog of the theorem, for partitions of a set, includes as a special case the perfect matchings of a complete graph formula_51 (with formula_1 even). There are formula_53 matchings, where formula_54 denotes the double factorial. The largest family of matchings that pairwise intersect (meaning that they have an edge in common) has size formula_55 and is obtained by fixing one edge and choosing all ways of matching the remaining formula_56 vertices.

A partial geometry is a system of finitely many abstract points and lines, satisfying certain axioms including the requirement that all lines contain the same number of points and all points belong to the same number of lines. In a partial geometry, a largest system of pairwise-intersecting lines can be obtained from the set of lines through any single 

A signed set consists of a set together with sign function that maps each element Two signed sets may be said to intersect when they have a common element that has the same sign in each of them. Then an intersecting family of signed sets, drawn from an universe, consists of at most
formula_57
signed sets. This number of signed sets may be obtained by fixing one element and its sign and letting the remaining formula_14 elements and signs 

For strings of over an alphabet of two strings can be defined to intersect if they have a position where both share the same symbol. The largest intersecting families are obtained by choosing one position and a fixed symbol for that position, and letting the rest of the positions vary arbitrarily. These families consist of formula_59 strings, and are the only pairwise intersecting families of this size. More generally, the largest families of strings in which every two have formula_30 positions with equal symbols are obtained by choosing formula_61 positions and symbols for those positions, for a number formula_62 that depends on formula_1, formula_19, and formula_30, and constructing the family of strings that each have at least formula_66 of the chosen symbols. These results can be interpreted graph-theoretically in terms of the 
An unproven conjecture, posed by Gil Kalai and Karen Meagher, concerns another analog for the family of triangulations of a convex polygon with formula_1 vertices. The number of all triangulations is a and the conjecture states that a family of triangulations every pair of which shares an edge has maximum An intersecting family of size exactly formula_68 may be obtained by cutting off a single vertex of the polygon by a triangle, and choosing all ways of triangulating the remaining polygon.

==Applications==
The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem can be used to prove the following result in probability theory. Let formula_69 be independent 0–1 random variables with probability formula_70 of being one, and let formula_71 be any fixed convex combination of these variables. Then formula_72
The proof involves observing that subsets of variables whose indicator vectors have large convex combinations must be non-disjoint and using the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem to bound the number of these 

The stability properties of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem play a key role in an efficient algorithm for finding monochromatic edges in improper colorings of Kneser graphs. The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem has also been used to characterize the symmetries of the space of phylogenetic trees.

<text>James Douglas Packer (born 8 September 1967) is an Australian billionaire businessman and investor. Packer is the son of Kerry Packer, a media mogul, and his wife, Roslyn Packer. He is the grandson of Frank Packer. He inherited control of the family company, Consolidated Press Holdings Limited, as well as investments in Crown Resorts and other companies. He is the former executive chairman of Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) and Consolidated Media Holdings, which predominantly owned media interests across a range of platforms, and a former executive chairman of Crown Resorts.

, Packer&#x27;s net worth was assessed as 4.95 billion by the &quot;Financial Review Rich List&quot;, ranking him as the eighteenth-wealthiest Australian; he was the richest person in Australia in 2006 and 2007. &quot;Forbes Asia&quot; magazine assessed Packer&#x27;s net worth at 3.6 billion in January 2019, the ninth-richest Australian. In June 2022, the Federal Court approved Blackstone&#x27;s takeover of Crown Casinos, delivering Packer 3.36 billion in exchange for his 37 percent stake in the company, which he has been involved with since 1999. Packer has an investment in ADH TV, although the total value is unknown.

==Early life and education==
James Packer was born in Sydney, the son of philanthropist Roslyn (née Weedon) and media mogul Kerry Packer. His grandfather was the media proprietor Sir Frank Packer. Packer was educated at Cranbrook School in Bellevue Hill, Sydney. After obtaining the Higher School Certificate (HSC) at Cranbrook, he began working at his father&#x27;s extensive Newcastle Waters cattle station in the Barkly Tableland of the Northern Territory, where he was a jackeroo. Packer has stated he did not attend university as he &quot;didn&#x27;t have the marks&quot;. His mentors, he has said, include his father and corporate executive Albert J. Dunlap.

==Career==
===Early internet investments===
Following the dotcom crash of 2000–2001, Packer acquired stakes in the online classified sites Seek and Carsales.com, believing that newspaper companies relying heavily on classified advertising were vulnerable to online companies in categories including employment and vehicle listings.

Packer purchased a 25% stake in SEEK for A$33 million in August 2003. He sold most of his stake six years later for A$440 million. At Packer&#x27;s urging, the magazine group then controlled by his family, Australian Consolidated Press, acquired a 41% stake in online advertiser Carsales in October 2005. The deal, initially valued at A$100 million, was eventually worth A$462 million to Packer-controlled entities.

===Selling Channel Nine===
In March 2006, Packer began discussing whether to sell Channel Nine and the Australian Consolidated Press magazine group to help fund his move into the international gaming and tourism business. Given changes in media due to the Internet and pay-TV, Packer was concerned about the future of free-to-air television. On 17 October 2006, Packer&#x27;s team finalised a deal to sell 50% of the media assets—which also included a 50% stake in web portal Ninemsn and a 51% stake in Carsales—to private equity group CVC Asia Pacific for A$4.5 billion, plus an additional A$1 billion in equity in the new company, which would be called PBL Media.

In June 2007, Packer sold another 25% share of the joint-venture PBL Media to CVC for $515 million. In October 2008, Packer wrote down his final 25% stake in PBL Media to zero. By the end of 2012, debt from CVC&#x27;s acquisition had overwhelmed Channel Nine and US hedge funds ousted CVC, taking complete ownership.

===One.Tel===

Packer was a director of Australian Telecommunications company One.Tel, which was declared insolvent during May 2001. The collapse of One.Tel cost PBL A$327 million. Packer admitted at a PBL annual general meeting that he had learned &quot;painful lessons&quot; from the collapse of One.Tel. Later at the liquidator&#x27;s inquiry over the collapse he denied that he was apologising for his own conduct; instead, he claimed, &quot;I was making an apology for accepting the bona fides of Mr. [Jodee] Rich and the executive directors of One.Tel.&quot;

In April 2014, Lachlan Murdoch and Packer agreed to a A$40 million settlement over the One.Tel failure. The settlement was approved by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 17 April 2014, with A$14.93 million to be paid by the Packer family&#x27;s Consolidated Press Holdings, A$11.77 million to be paid by Packer&#x27;s Crown Resorts and A$13.3 million to be paid by News Corp.

===Crown Resorts===
Since his father&#x27;s death, Packer has moved away from the family&#x27;s traditional media businesses and focused on creating a worldwide gambling empire: Crown Resorts. It has businesses and investments in the integrated resort and casino sectors in Australia and Macau, and wholly owns and operates a high-end casino in London, Crown Aspinall&#x27;s. In October 2017, Crown&#x27;s market capitalization was over $8 billion. On 21 March 2018, Packer resigned as executive chairman of Crown Resorts. In May 2019, Packer sold half of his stake in Crown Resorts to Lawrence Ho.

In October 2020, Packer appeared before an independent inquiry into Crown&#x27;s suitability to hold casino licence in NSW. When questioned over impropriety, illegality and corruption, Packer admitted that while a director of Crown he made &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;disgraceful&quot; threats against businessman Ben Gray. In February 2021, the inquiry found that Crown was unsuitable to hold a casino licence due in part to Packer&#x27;s threats to Ben Gray, as well as its &quot;continued commercial relationships with junket operators who had links to triads and other organised crime groups.” In February 2022, The Blackstone Group acquired Crown Resorts for A$8.9 billion (US$6.4 billion). Packer held 37% of Crown Resorts stock at the time of the sale. He received A$3.36 billion for his shares.

=== Other business activities ===
Packer purchased an 18% stake in Network Ten in 2010, quickly offloading half to Lachlan Murdoch. Three months later, after a dispute with Murdoch over a senior management appointment, Packer resigned his Network Ten board seat. There was also speculation that he resigned due to a conflict of interest with his interests in Consolidated Media Holdings. Following the implementation of CBS&#x27;s restructure of Network Ten announced in August 2017, Packer will no longer have an interest in Network Ten. In late May 2011, Packer made a reported A$80 million investment in daily deals sites Scoopon and Catch of the Day through a partnership between his Consolidated Press Holding and several other investors, including Andrew Bassat, a co-founder of Seek.com.au.

In December 2012, Packer and producer-filmmaker Brett Ratner formed a joint venture, RatPac Entertainment. The first film financed by RatPac was a major success. &quot;Gravity&quot;, a space thriller directed by Alfonso Cuaron and starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, generated the strongest-ever October opening in the US and took box office receipts of more than 100 million in its first five days. Packer sold his investment in RatPac for an undisclosed amount in April 2017. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; &quot;Who knows what sort of legacy James Packer is going to leave when he shuffles off this mortal coil, but I maintain the films he helped finance...will stand out among the more positive achievements.&quot; 

In October 2014, Packer bought out Peter Holmes à Court&#x27;s 37.5% share of the ownership of South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL club, becoming Russell Crowe&#x27;s partner in the Blackcourt League Investments Pty Limited venture.

In 2022, following the sale of his $3.3 billion stake in Crown Resorts, Packer sought to simplify his investment portfolio concentrating on big tech stocks, AI and property. As at 30 June 2024, Packer holds almost $500 million of Nvidia, $452 million of Meta and $366 million of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. 

==Personal life==
Packer owns residential property in Bondi Beach and in Bellevue Hill, in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs. The Packer family also have pastoral property holdings in , called &quot;Ellerston Station&quot;, and, since 2018, owned by his sister, Gretel. Following the breakdown of his first marriage, and the development of a friendship with American actor Tom Cruise, Packer began attending the Church of Scientology in Australia, taking courses on the Church&#x27;s Dundas business centre in 2002. He subsequently confirmed his involvement with Scientology, saying he had found it &quot;helpful&quot;. He later distanced himself from the church. In 2020, during the public inquiry into Crown Casinos, Packer revealed he had bipolar disorder.

=== Relationships ===
Packer and actress Kate Fischer separated in 1998 after five years together and a two-year engagement. Packer married Jodhi Meares at his home in Bellevue Hill, Sydney in October 1999; the relationship lasted two years, and the couple separated in 2002. Packer later married part-time model and singer Erica Baxter, whom he wed in the equivalent of a civil ceremony on 20 June 2007. The wedding was at the Antibes town hall, and the second ceremony took place at Hotel du Cap – Eden Roc in Cap d&#x27;Antibes on the French Riviera. Together, Packer and Baxter have three children: a daughter, born 27 July 2008, a son, born 1 February 2010, and another daughter, born 22 September 2012. In September 2013 James and Erica Packer announced they were separating.

Packer and American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey became engaged in January 2016, but had broken up by October. At the time it was alleged that the break-up was a result of Carey&#x27;s extravagant spending and rows over her reality show &quot;Mariah&#x27;s World&quot;, but Packer later said that the relationship had just been a &quot;mistake&quot; for both sides. In November 2017, Packer paid Carey a multi-million dollar settlement, in response to a lawsuit pursued by Carey citing an &quot;inconvenience fee&quot;. In 2019, Packer was dating Kylie Lim.

===Philanthropy===
Packer has supported a number of Australian medical institutions such as the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Centre and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and mental wellbeing programs such as Lifeline.

Packer is the founder of both the Packer Family Foundation and Crown Resorts Foundation. In July 2014, the two foundations launched their 200 million National Philanthropic Fund, one of Australia&#x27;s largest philanthropic commitments. According to the two foundations, they are working together to promote Indigenous education opportunities, the arts and culture, and partnerships with organisations that encourage and foster social cohesion. Underlying these priorities are learning, accessibility and engagement outcomes for young Australians – staying engaged with school and learning is the key to long-term positive outcomes, and this is the approach and message that the partner organisations are delivering. 

The Packer Family Foundation has provided $50 million to support Australia&#x27;s arts and cultural institutions as well as arts education programs throughout lower socio economic communities. The arts education funding has supported schools throughout areas like Mt Druitt, Liverpool, Campbelltown, Penrith and Blacktown to provide arts, music and literacy programs which support educational outcomes, teachers, and school engagement. 

Packer and the Packer Family Foundation continue to provide support for mental wellbeing programs. In March 2023, Packer and the Packer Family Foundation gave $6 million to Lifeline International to work towards decriminalizing suicide globally. In May 2023, Packer and the Packer Family Foundation jointly donated $7 million to the University of New South Wales for mental health research, with a focus on mood disorders.

=== Controversies ===
Packer was involved in a public physical brawl at Bondi Beach in 2014 with David Gyngell, a long-term friend and head of Channel Nine. Gyngell and Packer were both fined $500 for offensive behaviour over the incident. In late 2016, Israeli Police started looking into reports that Packer gave members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s family gifts and benefits. Packer, who is trying to gain residency in Israel, has taken the first step and registered with Israeli tax authorities. 

In February 2018, Packer was mentioned in an Israeli Police report recommending the prosecution of Netanyahu on corruption charges for accepting bribes, and acting against the interests of the state of Israel. Packer is mentioned in the report to have provided Netanyahu and his family members with champagne, cigars, jewelry and clothing valued at approximately US$100,000.

In March 2019, leaked text messages showed that Kevin Tsujihara had promised auditions and acting jobs to actress Charlotte Kirk in return for sex in September 2013. They also showed that the sex was facilitated by her then friend Packer for his personal influence. In September 2020 her lawyers filed a petition in the Los Angeles Superior Court to vacate a gag order that has kept her mostly silent amid the years-long battle. The petition paints a picture of Tsujihara engaging in non-consensual sex.

===Net worth===
Packer first appeared on various wealth lists in 2006, following the death of his father the previous year and the intergeneration transfer of the bulk of Kerry Packer&#x27;s wealth to his son, James. James Packer&#x27;s wealth was valued at A$7.25 billion. The 2008 &quot;BRW&quot; Rich 200 listed Packer as the third-richest person in Australia with a personal wealth of A$6.1 billion, behind Fortescue Metals Group chief executive Andrew Forrest and Westfield Group&#x27;s Frank Lowy. That was the first time in 21 years that a member of the Packer family had not topped the list. According to &quot;BRW&quot;, Packer&#x27;s wealth dipped to an estimated A$3 billion during 2009. In its 2013 &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot; list, Packer was ranked third with his wealth estimated at A$6.0 billion, a boost of A$1.1 billion on the previous year. In the 2014 wealth rankings by &quot;BRW&quot;, Packer&#x27;s wealth was assessed at A$7.19 billion, making him the third-richest Australian. In 2015 &quot;BRW&quot; Rich 200, Packer&#x27;s net worth was assessed at A$6.08 billion, making him the seventh-richest Australian. , Packer&#x27;s net worth, according to the &quot;Financial Review&quot; Rich List, the successor of the &quot;BRW&quot; Rich 200, was assessed at 4.95 billion, making him the eighteenth wealthiest Australian.

In January 2009, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that due to ongoing financial problems, Packer&#x27;s wealth dropped to under A$3 billion; also reporting that Packer listed for sale his Mangusta yacht and delayed the purchase of a Boeing business jet. Yet by mid-2010, it was reported that Packer owned a number of assets including &quot;Ellerston Z&quot; (a superyacht), &quot;Arctic P&quot; (a luxury cruise ship and former ice-breaker), a private jet, a 12-seater Sikorsky S-76 helicopter, and a variety of cars. , &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated Packer&#x27;s wealth at 3.6 billion, down from the 6.60 billion published by &quot;Forbes&quot; in their 2014 list of the richest people in Australia. In the 2017 &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the 50 Richest Australians, Packer&#x27;s net worth was assessed at 3.9 billion, making him the ninth-richest Australian.

<doc id="296199" wikidata="Q1165046" url="?curid=296199" title="Urban Terror">
<text>Urban Terror is a freeware multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by FrozenSand. Originally a total conversion of id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, FrozenSand released &quot;Urban Terror&quot; as a free standalone game in 2007 utilizing ioquake3 as the game engine. While the game engine is licensed under the open-source GPL, &quot;Urban Terror&quot;&#x27;s game code is closed source and its assets are freeware but not open content.

== History ==
&quot;Urban Terror&quot; started out in 1998 as a planned map pack for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, in which real world environments would be featured. It expanded from this idea to a full total conversion featuring realistic weapons and gameplay similar to &quot;Action Quake 2&quot;. Development group &quot;Silicon Ice Development&quot; was formed in spring 2000 and was made of several international developers, many whom were familiar with modifying Quake III Engine games; hence progress was made quickly. When its first version, beta 1.0, was released at QuakeCon 2000, &quot;Urban Terror&quot; was the realism mod with the most features and graphics completed.

FrozenSand began development on Urban Terror HD in 2009 and was set to release an alpha version in 2010 but soon abandoned the project and switched engines from idtech3 to Unreal Engine 4 due to licensing complications of idtech3.

The most recent version, 4.3.4, was released on June 21, 2018.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Urban Terror&quot; is billed by FrozenSand as a &quot;Hollywood tactical shooter.&quot; It blends elements from games such as &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. The realism in the mod is introduced through a number of changes: The number of weapons and other gear that can be carried is limited. Damage is also more realistic than in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, based on dividing the player target into discrete areas.

Numerous game modes are featured, including classic first-person shooter modes such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Last Man Standing. Additionally, &quot;Urban Terror&quot; has a nonviolent &quot;jump mode,&quot; in which players utilize the game&#x27;s unique mechanics to progress through movement-based &quot;jump maps&quot; of varying difficulties.

== Mods ==
Zombie Mode is a mod of the Survivor game mode in Urban Terror. Zombie mode consists of two teams Humans and Zombies. Humans are able to carry guns and zombies are only allowed a knife. The weapons in this mod only do low damage to zombie players. It takes up to 25 rounds for a single kill. The damage from sniper rifles is the highest at 30% and the heavy machine gun, Negev, only does 1%. All other guns damage somewhere within that range. Humans in most mods are allowed to carry 3 or fewer guns. Zombies only have a knife which does 66% damage or something less in regards to where the hit lands. Zombies have a fast knife which means it becomes proximity-instant kill weapon. The round is over when the 3-minute time limit expires or all players from one team die.

The company&#x27;s tagline is &quot;Life Skills with Attitude!&quot; In a 1996 &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; profile, the company describes itself as a &quot;strong player in the hemp and psychedelia market&quot; that has little competition from major publishers.

Ronin&#x27;s catalog includes the Leary Library, The Lilly Library, The Fringe Series, The Entheo-Spirituality Series, and various books on psychedelia.

The company has been subpoenaed by the Drug Enforcement Administration to provide names and addresses for people having purchased their books on marijuana horticulture. A number of their books are reprints of out-of-print works from the 1960s and 1970s — including a number of titles published by Ronin&#x27;s predecessor, And/Or Press — on the psychedelic experience and related subjects.

In 2006, Ronin republished the 1963 Discordian religious text &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; with altered text, altered images, and a new name, so Ronin could copyright the work. This action offended many fans of the original work, whose authors, Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) and Kerry Thornley, had died several years previously. Malaclypse the Younger, et el purposefully put their book, &quot;Principle Discordia&quot; into the public domain outside of copyright. Beverly Potter then created a derivative of the work, as she did with eleven Timothy Leary and three John C. Lilly works.

<doc id="296209" wikidata="Q959189" url="?curid=296209" title="Quoridor">
<text>Quoridor is a two- or four-player intuitive strategy game designed by Mirko Marchesi and published by Gigamic Games. Quoridor received the &quot;Mensa Mind Game&quot; award in 1997 and the &quot;Game Of The Year&quot; in the United States, France, Canada and Belgium.

==Rules of the game==
Quoridor is played on a game board of 81 square spaces (9×9). Each player is represented by a pawn which begins at the center space of one edge of the board (in a two-player game, the pawns begin opposite each other). The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the game board from which it begins.

The distinguishing characteristic of Quoridor is its twenty walls. Walls are flat two-space-wide pieces which can be placed in the groove that runs between the spaces. Walls block the path of all pawns, which must go around them. The walls are divided equally among the players at the start of the game, and once placed, cannot be moved or removed. On a turn, a player may either move their pawn, or, if possible, place a wall.

Pawns can be moved to any space at a right angle (but not diagonally). If adjacent to another pawn, the pawn may jump over that pawn. If that square is not accessible (e.g., off the edge of the board or blocked by a third pawn or a wall), the player may move to either space that is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the first pawn. Multiple pawns may not be jumped. Walls may not be jumped, including when moving laterally due to a pawn or wall being behind a jumped pawn.

Walls can be placed directly between two spaces, in any groove not already occupied by a wall. However, a wall may not be placed which cuts off the only remaining path of any pawn to the side of the board it must reach.

Though it can be played with three players, doing so is not recommended, because the third player does not have a player on the opposite side and thus has an advantage.

==History==
Quoridor is based on an earlier game, namely Blockade (also known as &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;), invented by Philip Slater in 1975. Mirko Marchesi, a well-known board game designer, created another version of this game, called &quot;Pinko Pallino&quot;, which was published in 1995 by Epta games. &quot;Pinko Pallino&quot; was only for two players and was played on an 11×11 game board with a total of 42 walls and slightly different rules.

After initial release, the game aroused interest. By 1997, bought the copyright of this game and released it to the world. As a result, Quoridor quickly became popular all over the world. Many European educational institutions (e.g., MindLab) have also selected Quoridor as teaching aids and brought them into the classroom.

===History of notations===

Since Gigamic does not provide a notation system, multiple systems have arisen in the history of Quoridor. The ones below appear in chronological order.

*ASCII diagrams: ASCII diagrams are used to create a visual. In earlier stages of the online version of the game, it is played by manually editing the ASCII diagram. Nowadays, they are still used to communicate the boards situation more effectively in online forums. Commonly, they are mixed with another type of notation.
*NESW Notation: Cardinal directions (north, east, south, and west) are used to indicate the pawn movements. When a jump occurs the letter is written twice (e.g. NN, SS). If it is a mid-air jump, two directions will be written (e.g., NE, SW, WS). The grooves in the board are labeled a to h (right to left) in alphabetical order, and 1 to 8 (top to bottom). The wall placements are noted by the intersection points of the grooves followed by the direction (e.g., codice_1, codice_2). If the wall is vertical a slash codice_3, if the wall is horizontal a dash codice_4 is used to indicate so. All letters are in capitals. Some consider NESW notation hard to follow, because if one does not know the pawn&#x27;s location, it must be traced again from the starting position.
*Glendenning&#x27;s Notation: In 2005, Lisa Glendenning&#x27;s thesis proposed a different notation, which is partly influenced by NESW notation. From the first player&#x27;s view, the squares are labeled a to i (right to left), and 9 to 1 (bottom to top). The 1st player always starts at the top of the board and the 2nd player starts at the bottom. The board never changes its orientation. Wall placements are noted by the northwest square of the wall followed by its orientation. 
*Modern Algebraic Notation: Algebraic chess notation has also influenced Quoridor&#x27;s notation and now a similar notation is used.

==Notation==

===Board===
Each square is denoted using algebraic notation.
:From &quot;player 1&quot;″s perspective, columns are a to i from left to right and rows are 1 to 9 from bottom to top.
:From &quot;player 1&quot;″s perspective, the near-left square is a1, and the far-right square is i9.

===Pawns===

====Starting positions====
Two players:
:&quot;Player 1&quot;″s pawn starts on e1
:&quot;Player 2&quot;″s pawn starts on e9
Four players:
:&quot;Player 1&quot;″s pawn starts on e1
:&quot;Player 2&quot;″s pawn starts on a5
:&quot;Player 3&quot;″s pawn starts on e9
:&quot;Player 4&quot;″s pawn starts on i5

====Moves====
Each pawn move is defined by the new square occupied by the pawn.
:For example, if &quot;player 1&quot; moves their pawn from e1 to e2, &quot;player 1&quot;″s move is denoted as e2.

===Walls===
Every wall touches four squares.
A wall move is denoted by the closest square to a1, with a horizontal h or vertical v orientation.
:For example, a vertical wall between columns e and f and spanning rows 3 and 4 is denoted e3v.

===Formatting===
A game or series of moves is generally written in one of two ways.

#In columns, as player groups, preceded by the move number and a period:
#* Two player game:
#*:1. e2 e8
#*:2. e3 e7
#* Four player game:
#*:1. e2 b5 e8 h5
#*:2. e3 c5 e7 g5
#Horizontally:
#* Two player game:
#*:1. e2 e8 2. e3 e7
#* Four player game:
#*:1. e2 b5 e8 h5 2. e3 c5 e7 g5
Moves may be interspersed with commentary (annotations). When the game score resumes with &quot;player 2&quot;, &quot;player 3&quot; or &quot;player 4&quot;″s move, an ellipsis (...) fills the position of &quot;player 1&quot;″s move, for example:

:3. e6h
::&quot;Player 1&quot; places a wall to lengthen &quot;player 2&quot;″s path.
:3... e3h
::&quot;Player 2&quot; responds by placing a wall to lengthen &quot;player 1&quot;″s path.

===Defined game positions===
A Forsyth–Edwards Notation-like record can define a particular game position:

codice_5

# Horizontal wall positions
# Vertical wall positions
# Pawn positions:
## Player 1 pawn position
## Player 2 pawn position
## Player 3 pawn position*
## Player 4 pawn position*
# Walls available:
## player 1 walls available
## player 2 walls available
## player 3 walls available*
## player 4 walls available*
# Active player

*Four player only.

====Two player example====
codice_6

====Four player example====
codice_7

== Game phases ==
A game can be divided into three phases, namely opening, middle game, and endgame. The first five to seven moves can be considered as the opening phase. A typical midgame consist of around ten moves. The endgame starts when one of the players has less than three pieces.

===Opening===
In this phase both players make relatively long-term plans. The openings can be divided into two categories, orthodox and unorthodox openings. In orthodox openings the goal is to advance one&#x27;s pawn to the center. Unorthodox openings are uncommon and use two or more wall moves before one&#x27;s pawn reaches e4 or e6.

Reed opening: This opening consists in placing, during the first two moves of the game, two walls on the third row in front of the opponent with a single gap in the middle (codice_8 and codice_9). A counter-strategy to the Reed opening is to place two horizontal walls on the third row, one at the extreme left and one at the extreme right, which effectively reduces both players&#x27; path counts to one. The game would start as follows: codice_10 . This opening is attributed to Dr. Scott Reed (Edinburgh, UK). Students of the University of Edinburgh have studied the opening in an AI 2021 course and discovered that it is not a particularly strong opening. The analysis was done using an implementation of the Minimax algorithm and different heuristics.

Shiller opening: Both players advance their pawns three times (codice_11). Then the first player places one wall vertically in the column closest to him (codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, or codice_15), providing two paths for the other player while maintaining just one path for herself. The Shiller opening implements the strategy of maximizing the opponent&#x27;s path count and of minimizing one&#x27;s own path count. This opening is attributed to Larry Shiller, who is also known as the Voice of Backgammon.

The Stonewall: After both players advance their pawns two times (codice_16), one of the players starts building a stonewall with codice_17 or codice_18. If the first player starts the stonewall the idea is codice_19 (or mirrored version). The goal is to push back the opponents if they advances their pawn further. A common idea is to close the back rank with a vertical wall. (i.e. codice_20) So, the opponent cannot make the Stonewall player to go back all the way behind the wall.

Ala opening: Both players advance their pawns three times (codice_11). then the first player places one wall horizontally behind their pawn (codice_22). Next turn the first player places their second fence next to their first fence (codice_23) and creates a wall behind them. In their third and fourth turns they places their fences perpendicular to their previous fences (codice_24 and codice_25). By this opening the first player provides two paths at the corners of the board for the other player while maintaining one easy path for themselves.

Standard opening: Both players advance their pawns three times (codice_11) and the first player plays codice_14. There are 2 options for the second player: codice_28 (mirrored variation) or codice_29 (symmetrical variation). 
* Rush variation: codice_30 
** the goal is to create a big reverse box like shape: codice_31
** counter play = codice_32
Gap opening: After both players advance their pawns three times (codice_11)

*mainline: codice_34
* Anti-gap: codice_35
* double-gap:

The Sidewall: Both players advance their pawns (codice_36). 1st player places a wall next to 2nd players pawn codice_37. The purpose of this strategy is to create two paths, one that continues to move straight ahead, and the second path is to retreat and detour to the other side. Obviously route 1 would be closer to the destination, so second player blocks the shorter path with codice_38. This reaction from second player is considered bad because first player can continue to put walls in the way. (i.e. codice_39) The aim of the strategy is to create redundant moves for the second player in a direction that will inevitably be blocked in the future.

Proper counter-play: Second players&#x27; move is codice_40. With this move a horizontal wall on the left side is placed, exactly 2 spaces from the edge of the board. The goal is to create up to 3 different wall layouts to block the detour to your left.

Quick Box variation: codice_41

Shatranj Opening: Named after an online player, Shatranj. The game starts with the move codice_42, which is considered as an unorthodox opening. The goal is to canalize one&#x27;s path to the last rank. The move codice_43 has the same idea in mind but flipped. 
*Lee Inversion: The first player advances once before placing a vertical wall immediately to one side, connecting to the back wall codice_44. Usually, the opponent will then &quot;help&quot; to build a winding path for the player (ie. codice_45 note that at this position codice_46 is necessary to prevent codice_47 which lengthens the path 1 to 3 moves). At a critical moment the first player can slam the door by playing the moves codice_48 and codice_49 (the Lee Switcharoo), sending the opponent up and around the path he helped create. If the opponent elects not to participate in building the maze, trivially the player can execute a Samson Bowl[?].

=== Midgame ===
In the midgame both players tries to maximize the possible opponents paths (most commonly 2) and close their back. Closing the back prevents the possibility of making a roundabout. Not closing the back mostly results in a loss.

=== Endgame ===
When both of the players uses all walls in the hand, the game can be ended (upon agreement) by simply counting the shortest path length for both players.

== Strategies ==
Between games common patterns can be seen.

===Mirroring===

Mirroring can be a powerful strategy if the opponent doesn&#x27;t know how to respond.

===Walls===

The walls are used to direct the game. Their value increases as the game progresses.

The walls become more important in the endgame. If there is a major difference in the number of the walls in hand, generally the player with more walls wins the game. Nonetheless, if the movable area lacks space, this may result in a loss because if none of the moves increases the path length of the opponents&#x27; they become useless.

===Leaving the position (more) complex===

Shiller opening and Gap opening are the perfect example for this strategy.

===Spatial advantage===

The space each player has can give them advantages.

Sidestepping: Within the first three moves the first player moves their pawn horizontally left or right, giving the opponent the opportunity to move forward or place the first wall. The goal is to make a corridor to make the opponent go backwards. However, by doing so, the first player loses their spatial advantage and the second player can force the first player go backwards. Therefore, this is considered as a bad move.

== Derivations of the game ==
There are different board sizes of the game: Pocket &lt; Mini &lt; Standard &lt; Deluxe &lt; Giant

* Quoridor Pocket: A portable version. The regular version of the board and top is made of wood, but the &quot;pocket&quot; is made of plastic.
* Quoridor Mini / Quoridor Travel: A smaller version.
*Quoridor: Known, standard sized game board. 
* Quoridor Deluxe: A carved version of wood. The game board is not painted and colored, the wood grain is visible. Size of the board is one size larger than the regular version. The color of the pieces has also been changed.
* Quoridor Giant: The design is the same as the regular version, but the size is about 4 times bigger.

Quoridor Kid: In 2004 Gigamic released the Children&#x27;s version. The number of squares on the board is 7×7 squares, which is one size smaller than the regular version, and the number of walls is 16 (for two players, each player gets eight walls; for four players, four each). Other rules are the same. The board is round and yellow, where classic figures are replaced with a mice. The top is in the shape of a mouse, and a cheese top is placed in the back of the row on the other side, adding the theme of &quot;a mouse is trying to reach the cheese.&quot;

== Awards ==
In 1997, the game was awarded the Mensa Select, a prize given to five board games by the American Mensa every year. It was also by Games Magazine named &quot;Game of the Year 1998&quot;.


The Children&#x27;s version of the game &quot;Quoridor Kid&quot; won four awards. 

== Competitions ==
Mindsports Olympiad: As part of the Mindsports Olympiad 2020, Quoridor was played.

Pentamind World Championship: In 2018, Quoridor was played among 5 games in the Pentamind tournament.

MINDLAB: Kids between the ages 9–12 can participate in this yearly tournament.

== Miscellanea ==

===Time control===

In competition, Quoridor games are played with a time control. If a player&#x27;s time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost.

Time can be controlled using a chess clock that has two displays, one for each player&#x27;s remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with increments.

<doc id="296218" wikidata="Q1610025" url="?curid=296218" title="Heritage Guitars">
<text>Heritage Guitar is an American musical instrument manufacturer company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States. The company produces a range of electric guitars, including hollow-body models.

==History==
Heritage Guitar was founded in 1985 by three former employees of the Gibson guitar factory, Jim Deurloo, Marv Lamb, and JP Moats. Two other former Gibson employees that took part in the company were Bill Paige and Mike Korpak.

In the early 1980s, Gibson closed its historic Parsons Street factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, due to excess production, and relocated much of its production to its factory in Nashville, Tennessee. Some of the Gibson employees who did not move to Tennessee started production of guitars under a new name, &quot;Heritage,&quot; which was likely meant to stake a claim to their guitar-making tradition. The company produced instruments in much smaller numbers than Gibson had.

The Heritage line initially consisted of electric and acoustic guitars, electric basses, mandolins, and a banjo. The line was eventually narrowed to electric guitars only. Although most of Heritage&#x27;s guitars were based on Gibson designs, a few of their early electric guitars were based on modified Stratocaster and Telecaster designs.

== Current status ==

Heritage Guitars is a boutique manufacturer, making semi-hollow guitars, large jazz boxes, and solid-body electrics. Heritage makes guitars that are said to have been similar to Gibson&#x27;s products, which the company&#x27;s advocates and fans would say are constructed in a much more &quot;handmade&quot; fashion and with more attention to detail. The result of Heritage being a smaller operation than Gibson is probably a reaction against the cost-cutting practices that developed at Gibson under Norlin&#x27;s ownership.

The design of the Heritage H-150 solid-body guitar is modelled on the Les Paul Standard, while the H-575 resembles the ES-175 and the H-535 reinterprets the ES-335. All Heritage full-body semi-acoustics have solid wood tops, while many of the Gibson guitars of this type had laminated tops after World War II. Heritage has also introduced several new designs, such as the Millennium models, which employ a &quot;semi-solid&quot; body that is more solid than a traditional semi-hollow design, but chambered. The guitars are made without the use of CNC machines for woodworking.

During the first several years of the company, Heritage advertised its guitars in guitar magazines. The marketing was handled by the former VP of Sales at Gibson, Lane Zastrow. The advertisements wrote that Heritage was making guitars on Parsons Street in Kalamazoo, without mentioning Gibson by name. In the 1990s, in an attempt to keep costs down, the company stopped advertising.

==Endorsers==

===Johnny Smith===
In 1989, jazz guitarist Johnny Smith withdrew his endorsement from Gibson and awarded it to Heritage, which began production of &quot;Heritage Johnny Smith&quot;. The Gibson model continued in production as the &quot;Gibson LeGrand&quot;. Smith had since moved his endorsement from Heritage to the Guild Guitar Company.

===Alex Skolnick===
Guitarist Alex Skolnick, of the band Testament, formerly endorsed Heritage Guitar. For a short time, the Heritage Guitar company offered an &quot;Alex Skolnick signature model H-150&quot;. In 2013, Skolnick announced his endorsement of ESP Guitars. Skolnick is now an endorser of Godin Jazz guitars.

===David Becker===
Jazz guitarist, composer, and two-time Grammy nominee David Becker has been endorsing Heritage Guitar for more than 30 years. He was one of the first artists to join Heritage in 1988. The &quot;David Becker H-575 Signature Model&quot; features a solid spruce top, maple sides and back, and a humbucker and piezo pickup.

===Others===
Jazz guitarist, producer, and composer Henry Johnson was the second endorser of Heritage Guitar, beginning in 1985. Country musician Roy Clark endorsed Heritage Guitar, which make his signature model. Jazz guitarist Mimi Fox&#x27;s guitars are a &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; and an H-575 custom with a spruce top. American jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell plays a &quot;Heritage Super KB&quot; hollow body through a &quot;Heritage 1 x 12 Kenny Burrell&quot; combo amp.

<text>Network utilities are software utilities designed to analyze and configure various aspects of computer networks. The majority of them originated on Unix systems, but several later ports to other operating systems exist.

The most common tools (found on most operating systems) include:
* , ping a host to check connectivity (reports packet loss and latency, uses ICMP).
* shows the series of successive systems a packet goes through &quot;en route&quot; to its destination on a network. It works by sending packets with sequential TTLs which generate ICMP TTL-exceeded messages from the hosts the packet passes through.
* , used to query a DNS server for DNS data (deprecated on Unix systems in favour of and ; the preferred tool on Microsoft Windows systems).
* vnStat, useful command to monitor network traffic from the console. vnstat allows to keep the traffic information in a log system to be analyzed by third party tools.
Other network utilities include:
* , displays network connections (both incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and a number of network interface and network protocol statistics. It is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network as a performance measurement.
* , which sprays numerous packets in the direction of a host and reports results
* allows local or remote configuration of network devices, Microsoft Windows

<doc id="296223" wikidata="Q29231" url="?curid=296223" title="Frans Snyders">
<text>Frans Snyders or Frans Snijders (11 November 1579, Antwerp – 19 August 1657, Antwerp) was a Flemish painter of animals, hunting scenes, market scenes, and still lifes. A versatile artist, his works depict all sorts of foods, utensils, and tableware and wide assortment of animals. He was one of the earliest specialist animaliers and he is credited with initiating a wide variety of new still-life and animal subjects in Antwerp. His hunting scenes and still lifes engage the viewer with their dramatic and dynamic effects. He was a regular collaborator with leading Antwerp painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Abraham Janssens.

==Life==
Snyders was born in Antwerp as the son of Jan Snijders, the keeper of a wine inn frequented by artists. According to legend the famous 16th-century painter Frans Floris squandered his fortune in the inn of his father. Snyders&#x27; mother was Maria Gijsbrechts. Snyders had five siblings. His brother Michiel also became a painter but no works of him are known.
Snyders was recorded as a student of Pieter Brueghel the Younger in 1593, and subsequently trained with Hendrick van Balen, who was the first master of Anthony van Dyck. Snyders became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1602. He travelled to Italy in 1608-9 where he first resided in Rome. The artist subsequently traveled from Rome to Milan. Jan Brueghel the Elder had introduced him there by letter to the famous art collector Cardinal Borromeo. Brueghel asked Snyders to paint a copy after a portrait by Titian in the Borromeo collection. This is regarded as evidence that Snyders was a skilled figure painter before he turned his attention to still life painting.

Snyders had returned to Antwerp in the spring of 1609. In 1611 he married Margaretha, the sister of Cornelis de Vos and Paul de Vos, two leading painters in Antwerp. His collaboration with Rubens started in the 1610s.

Snyders had many patrons including the Ghent Bishop Antonius Triest who commissioned four paintings of market scenes around 1615 (Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). He was a friend of van Dyck who painted Snyders and his wife more than once (Frick Collection, Kassel etc.). Snyders was commercially successful and was able to purchase a house on the high-end Keizerstraat in Antwerp. In 1628 he became the dean of the Guild of Saint Luke.
In the period 1636–1638, he was one of the Antwerp artists who assisted Rubens in a large commission for decorations for the hunting pavilion Torre de la Parada of Philip IV of Spain. The two artists also worked together on decorations for the Royal Alcazar of Madrid and the royal Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. Snyders painted about 60 hunting paintings and animal pieces after designs by Rubens. In 1639 Rubens and Snyders received a follow-up commission for an additional 18 paintings for the hunting pavilion.

After Peter Paul Rubens&#x27; death Snyders acted as one of the appraisers of the inventory of Rubens&#x27; collection.

In the years 1641 and 1642 Snyders traveled with other artists to the Dutch Republic. In 1646 Snyders was probably in Breda working on a commission. Snyders became a widower in 1647. He died himself on 19 August 1657 in Antwerp. He died childless and bequeathed his fortune to his sister, a beguine. The Antwerp art dealer Matthijs Musson acquired his extensive art collection which included works of leading 16th and 17th century Flemish and Dutch artists such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Hendrick van Balen, Jan Breughel the Elder, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Joos van Cleve, Coninxloo, Jacob Foppens van Es, Willem Claeszoon Heda, Jacob Jordaens, Lucas van Leyden, Jan Lievens, Lambert Lombard, Jan Massys, Joachim Patinir, Adriaen van Utrecht, and Frans Ykens.

He had many apprentices. His pupils are believed to have included Nicasius Bernaerts, Peter van Boucle, Juriaen Jacobsze, Jan Roos and Paul de Vos. Jan Fyt (Joannes Fijt) was a student, and then assistant of Snyders from 1629. Peter van Boucle claimed that he was a pupil of Frans Snyders but there are no written sources available in Antwerp that support this contention. However, there are stylistic similarities in van Boucle&#x27;s works which suggest that he worked in the circle of Frans Snyders.

==Work==
===General===
Sny initially devoted himself to painting flowers, fruit and still lifes. Later he turned to painting animals. He was particularly interested in depicting wild animals, which he showed engaged in lively hunts and fierce combats. He was one of the earliest specialist &quot;animaliers&quot;. His work as an animal painter was very influential on his contemporaries as well as on 18th-century French animaliers such as Jean-Baptiste Oudry and François Desportes. Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The Ray&quot; recalls Snyders&#x27; pictorial strength.

His residence in Italy is believed to have had an important influence on his style of fruit painting. He is likely to have seen Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Basket of Fruit&quot; in Cardinal Borremeo&#x27;s collection in Milan.

===Market and pantry scenes===
He painted many market scenes and his earliest work in this area was inspired by the work of Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer who had pioneered and developed the genre in 16th century Antwerp. Whereas Aertsen and Beuckelaer often included a religious scene in the background of their market pieces, Snyders dispensed with this. Initially he worked in a Mannerist idiom. His style gradually matured as a result of his exposure to Italian art during his trip to Italy and the work of Rubens after his return to Antwerp. As a result, the dark surroundings of his early still lifes disappeared after 1614 and he became a fine colourist with strong compositional skills allowing him to structure a profusion of disparate objects.
He not only created many large market and pantry scenes and game still lifes, usually including dead deer, he also painted smaller works which were reminiscent of the breakfast pieces and still lifes that originated in northern art around 1600. Rather than continue the descriptive manner of the Antwerp painter Osias Beert, Snyders&#x27; innovative still lifes combined objects in groups to form a geometrically structured composition. Recurring motifs were dead hares and birds, tazze (shallow dishes on a tall foot), baskets with grapes and other fruit, enamelled pitchers and Chinese Kraak porcelain.

Snyders typically depicted game in the stage before it is prepared as food. These dead animals therefore resemble hunting trophies, which were often not even intended as food but rather for stuffing. Snyders often included live animals such as cats to create a contrast between the animate and inanimate elements. Snyders&#x27; large game pieces were very influential and the Dutch painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who worked in Antwerp for a significant period of time took inspiration from Snyders&#x27; work to develop his own large-scale game pieces.

The large and abundant still lifes of Snyders have been interpreted in many ways. Some read a propagandistic message into these paintings. The display of the luxurious abundance available in Antwerp which was at the time under Spanish administration possibly served the propagandistic purpose of showing the superiority of Spanish rule over Flanders when compared with Protestant control over the rebellious Northern Netherlands.

While in the Baroque tradition many of his compositions are complex and dynamic some are more focused and quiet. An example of the latter is the &quot;Grapes, Peaches and Quinces in a Niche&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), where his brushwork is also more sketchy than usual.

===Collaborations===

Snyders is believed to have been a skilled figure painter in his own right as is evidenced by Jan Breughel the Elder&#x27;s request that he make a copy after a Titian portrait in the Borromeo collection during his stay in Milan.
Even so, he still often collaborated with figure artists such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, his brother-in-law Cornelis de Vos, Theodoor van Thulden and Jan Boeckhorst, who painted the figures in compositions to which he added the still life elements. He also collaborated with landscape specialists such as Jan Wildens, who provided the landscape setting for his hunting scenes.

Collaborations with Rubens were particularly frequent. Snyders&#x27; expressiveness and ability to render different textures of furs and skins excited the admiration of Rubens. Rubens frequently employed him to paint animals, fruit and still life in his own pictures. Snyders developed a particularly close collaborative relationship with Rubens between 1610 and 1640. Their collaborative efforts are well documented. In the early period of their collaboration, Rubens would paint an oil sketch of the complete composition and mark out clearly where Snyders would have to put his contribution. This has been documented for the painting &quot;The Recognition of Philopoemen&quot;. It is possible that in this early period Rubens was not sure about Snyders&#x27; compositional skills and wanted to show him the way. In the later &quot;Prometheus bound&quot; the process was reversed and Snyders made a sketch leaving the space for the figure by Rubens. &quot;The Recognition of Philopoemen&quot; is considered the first Baroque still life with figures. A famous collaboration between Rubens and Snyders is the &quot;Medusa&quot; (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Painted around 1613–1617/1618, this small-scale work showed that Snyders&#x27; manner was not only well suited to Rubens&#x27; large pieces, but also adaptable to his smaller-scale works. Rubens relied on Snyders to create the visual richness that went hand in hand with his Baroque style, which stressed abundance and bounteousness. The two artists&#x27; brushwork was so close that contemporaries had difficulty distinguishing their contributions in collaborative works.
His pupil and brother-in-law Paul de Vos was also a regular collaborator with Rubens. One art historian has compared Paul de Vos&#x27; contributions to Rubens&#x27; hunting scenes with those of Frans Snyders&#x27; and found de Vos to be less accurate in the animal anatomy and less accomplished in the psychological expression of the animals. Other art historians regard the hunting scenes of de Vos as more dynamic and evidencing a more personal style when compared with those of Snyders, who was more a still life painter. The expressive style and motifs of Rubens&#x27; animal paintings had an important influence on both Snyders and de Vos.

Snyders also painted the still life elements for other Antwerp painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Jan Janssens and other artists. Frans Snyders collaborated with his second brother-in-law Cornelis de Vos. An example is the &quot;Still life with fruit and vegetables&quot;, which likely represents a larder of a fine house. The impression given by this composition is one of abundance as well as chaos. Closer inspection shows that the produce is arranged in a hierarchy reflecting their value and rarity. Cheaper root vegetables are on the ground while highly prized peas and asparagus are placed in the basket on the right.

===Animalier===

Snyders was the first artist to concentrate on incidents exclusively featuring animals in everyday environments. In these creations animals such as dogs, cats and monkeys were the sole protagonists. The scenes included fights between animals, hunts by animals, scenes from fables and symbolic representations.

&quot;Concert of Birds&quot;

One of the symbolic representations that Snyders created and to which he returned regularly is the &quot;concert of birds&quot;. Compositions on this theme represent different species of birds perched on tree trunks in the form of a &quot;concert of birds&quot;, sometimes with a musical score. 
The theme of the concert of birds predates the courtly fashion of the Baroque period of maintaining aviaries.
The theme has its roots in the representations of Aeolus with birds in the Middle Ages, which became very popular at the end of the 16th century. Its symbolic meaning is linked to the representation of the birds of Saint Francis of Assisi and to the devotion to Our Lady of the Birds. According to legend, in the 13th century a flock of birds had been observed gathering near a grove of beech trees outside Brussels. They had been attracted to that location by an image of the Virgin clamped between the branches of the trees. A Franciscan chapel dedicated to the Virgin was then built. It was destroyed during the iconoclastic fury of the Beeldenstorm in the 16th century but reconstructed at the end of the century. A particular feature of the chapel were the bird cages that were suspended from the ceiling. The birds in the cages contributed their song to the liturgy in the chapel. Snyders is said to have had a special relationship with the Franciscan order and he wanted to be buried in the Franciscan habit. In addition to this religious connotation, the concert of birds is also regarded as an allegory of the sense of hearing. Other interpretations are that the concert represents Wisdom, as the owl, which is the animal representing this quality, is sometimes depicted as the conductor of the bird concerts. A further interpretation is that the concert of birds symbolically alludes to harmony and natural regulation, in the sense of balance with nature. These concepts are embodied in the systematization of the birds&#x27; song. So, more generally, the concert of birds imagery refers to the political harmony and social order enjoyed by the owners of these paintings during the time the Southern Netherlands were governed by the Archdukes of Austria Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia. This explains the success of the concert of birds paintings in bourgeois and aristocratic circles. Various followers of Snyders also painted this theme: in the Spanish Netherlands there were Paul de Vos, Jan Fyt and Jan van Kessel the Elder; in the Dutch Republic, Gijsbert d&#x27;Hondecoeter, his son Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter, Abraham Busschop and Jacobus Victors reworked the subject by making it more courtly; and in France the Flemish expatriates Nicasius Bernaerts or Pieter Boel also created compositions on the theme.
One of the four &quot;Concert of Birds&quot; pictures by Frans Snyders in the Prado Museum shows an owl on a branch. The owl conducts the other 15 species of birds shown in the composition while it holds a musical score between its legs. As in many of Snyders&#x27; compositions, the larger birds are placed near the border and protect the smaller birds in the middle. Some exotic species alien to European are included such as the Raggiana bird-of-paradise. Some fragments of the score are visible and show the titles of the voices, which are written in French. The composer and the work have not been identified. It seems a composition for four voices and is possibly a French song.

&quot;Monkey business&quot;

His compositions with monkeys wreaking havock became very popular. The Louvre collection holds four such monkey-themed paintings. Three of them show capuchin monkeys pillaging baskets of fruit and toppling dishes in pantries or in an outdoor setting. The monkeys are painted with naturalism, neither idealizing nor caricaturing them.
While the monkey had since the Middle Ages symbolized the sinner - a greedy, lecherous creature, driven by its senses only – during the 16th and 17th centuries it became the symbol of stupidity. Through their uncontrolled grabbing and consuming of food the monkeys show their barbaric nature which is driven solely by animal instinct and desire. The Louvre compositions with capuchin monkeys can also be interpreted as a form of vanitas paintings: the fruit in these still lifes is appetizing yet bound to perish. The fruit thus symbolizes the brevity and futility of life. The compositions can further be regarded as illustrations of the risk of poor household management which is driven solely by the satisfaction of the senses.

<doc id="296234" wikidata="Q18809" url="?curid=296234" title="Anatoly Lunacharsky">
<text>Anatoly Vasilyevich Lunacharsky (, born &quot;Anatoly Aleksandrovich Antonov&quot;; – 26 December 1933) was a Russian Marxist revolutionary and the first Soviet People&#x27;s Commissar (Narkompros) responsible for the Ministry of Education as well as an active playwright, critic, essayist, and journalist throughout his career.

==Background==
Lunacharsky was born on 23 or 24 November 1875 in Poltava, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), as the illegitimate child of Alexander Antonov and Alexandra Lunacharskaya, née Rostovtseva. His mother was then married to statesman Vasily Lunacharsky, a nobleman of Polish origin, whence Anatoly&#x27;s surname and patronym. She later divorced Vasily Lunacharsky and married Antonov, but Anatoly kept his former name. 

In 1890, at the age of 15, Lunacharsky became a Marxist. From 1894, he studied at the University of Zurich under Richard Avenarius for two years without taking a degree. In Zürich he met European socialists, including Rosa Luxemburg and Leo Jogiches, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He also lived for a time in France.

==Early career==

In 1899, Lunacharsky returned to Russia, where he and Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s sister revived the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), until they were betrayed by an informant and arrested. He was allowed to settle in Kyiv, but was arrested again after resuming his political activities, and after ten months in prison he was sent to Kaluga, where he joined a Marxist circle that included Alexander Bogdanov and Vladimir Bazarov. 

In February 1902, he was exiled to Kushinov village in Vologda, where he again shared his exile with Bogdanov, whose sister he married, and with the Legal Marxist Nikolai Berdyaev and the Socialist Revolutionary terrorist Boris Savinkov among others. After the first issue of Lenin&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Iskra&quot; had reached Vologda, Bogdanov and Lunacharsky organised a Marxist circle that distributed illegal literature, while he also legally wrote theatre criticism for a local liberal newspaper. In March 1903, the governor of Vologda ordered Lunacharsky to be transferred further north, to Totma, where they were the only political exiles.

In 1903, the RSDLP split between the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, and the Mensheviks. Lunacharsky, who by now had ended his period in exile and was back in Kyiv, originally believed that the split was unnecessary and joined the &#x27;conciliators&#x27;, who hoped to bring the two sides together, but he was converted to Bolshevism by Bogdanov. In 1904, he moved to Geneva and became one of Lenin&#x27;s most active collaborators and an editor of the first exclusively Bolshevik newspaper, &quot;Vpered&quot;. According to Nadezhda Krupskaya:

Lunacharsky returned to Russia after the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution. In Moscow he co-edited the journal &quot;Novaya zhizn&quot; and other Bolshevik publications, which could be published legally, and gave lectures on art and literature. Arrested during a workers&#x27; meeting, he spent a month in Kresty Prison. 

Soon after his release, he faced &quot;extremely serious&quot; charges, and fled abroad, via Finland, in March 1906. In 1907, he attended the International Socialist Congress held in Stuttgart.

=== Vpered ===
In 1908, when the Bolsheviks split between Lenin&#x27;s supporters and Alexander Bogdanov&#x27;s followers, Lunacharsky supported his brother-in-law Bogdanov in setting up a new &quot;Vpered&quot;. During this period, he wrote a two-volume work on the relationship between Marxism and religion, &quot;Religion and Socialism&quot; (1908, 1911), declaring that god should be interpreted as &quot;humanity in the future&quot;. This earned him the description &quot;god builder&quot;. 

Like many contemporary socialists (including Bogdanov), Lunacharsky was influenced by the empirio-criticism philosophy of Ernst Mach and Avenarius. Lenin opposed Machism as a form of subjective idealism and strongly criticised its proponents in his book &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot; (1908). 

In 1909, Lunacharsky joined Bogdanov and Maxim Gorky at the latter&#x27;s villa on the island of Capri, where they started a school for Russian socialist workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky and their supporters moved the school to Bologna, where they continued teaching classes through 1911. In 1911, Lunacharsky moved to Paris, where he started his own Circle of Proletarian Culture.

=== World War I ===
After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lunacharsky adopted an internationalist antiwar position, which put him on a course of convergence with Lenin and Leon Trotsky. In 1915, Lunacharsky and Pavel Lebedev-Poliansky restarted the social democratic newspaper &quot;Vpered&quot; with an emphasis on proletarian culture. From 1915, he also worked for the daily newspaper &quot;Nashe Slovo&quot;, sometimes acting as peacemaker between the two editors, Trotsky and the Menshevik internationalist Julius Martov.

After the February Revolution of 1917, Lunacharsky left his family in Switzerland and returned to Russia on a sealed train - though not the same train that Lenin had used earlier. Like other internationalist social democrats returning from abroad, he briefly joined the Mezhraiontsy before they merged with the Bolsheviks in July–August 1917. He was also the cultural editor of &quot;Novaya Zhizn&quot;, until forced against his will to sever this connection, because the paper took an anti-Bolshevik line. 

Even before he formally joined the Bolsheviks, he proved to be one of their most popular and effective orators, often sharing a platform with Trotsky. He was arrested with Trotsky on 22 July 1917, on a charge of inciting the &quot;July Days&quot; riots, and was held in Kresty prison until September.

==People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education (Narkompros)==
After the October Revolution of 1917, Lunacharsky was appointed head of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education (Narkompros) in the first Soviet government. On 15 November, after eight days in this post, he resigned in protest over a rumour that the Bolsheviks had bombarded St Basil&#x27;s Cathedral on Red Square while they were storming the Kremlin, but after two days he withdrew his resignation. After the creation of the Soviet Union, he was People&#x27;s Commissar for Enlightenment, which was a function devolved to the union republics, for the Russian Federation only.

Lunacharsky opposed the decision in 1918 to transfer Russia&#x27;s capital to Moscow and stayed for a year in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) and left the running of his commissariat to his deputy, Mikhail Pokrovsky.

=== Education ===
On 10 November 1917, Lunacharsky signed a decree making school education a state monopoly at local government level and said that his department would not claim central power over schools. In December, he ordered church schools to be brought under the jurisdiction of local Soviets. 

He faced determined opposition from the teachers&#x27; union. In February 1918, the fourth month of a teachers&#x27; strike, he ordered all teachers to report to their local soviets and to stand for re-election to their jobs. In March, he reluctantly disbanded the union and sequestered its funds. Largely because of the opposition from teachers, he had to abandon his scheme for local autonomy.

He also believed in polytechnic schools, in which children could learn a range of basic skills, including manual skills, with specialist training beginning in late adolescence. All children were to have the same education and would automatically qualify for higher education, but opposition from Trotsky and others later compelled him to agree that specialist education would begin in secondary schools.

In July 1918, he proposed that all university lecturers should be elected for seven-year terms, irrespective of their academic qualifications, that all courses would be free, and that institutions would be run by elected councils made of staff and students. His ideas were vigorously opposed by academics.

In June 1919, &quot;The New York Times&quot; decried Lunacharsky&#x27;s efforts in education in an article entitled &quot;Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia&quot;. It claimed that he was instilling a &quot;system of calculated moral depravity [...] in one of the most diabolical of all measures conceived by the Bolshevik rulers of Russia&quot;.

=== Culture ===

A week before the October Revolution, Lunacharsky convened and presided over a conference of proletarian cultural and educational organisations, at which the independent art movement Proletkult was launched, with Lunacharsky&#x27;s former colleague, Bogdanov, as its leading figure. In October 1920, he clashed with Lenin, who insisted on bringing Proletkult under state control. But though he believed in encouraging factories to create literature or art, he did not share the hostility to &quot;bourgeois&quot; art forms exhibited by RAPP and other exponents of proletarian art. 

In the week after the revolution, he invited everyone in Petrograd involved in cultural or artistic work to a meeting at Communist Party headquarters. Although the meeting was widely advertised, no more than seven people turned up, though they included Alexander Blok, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold and Larissa Reissner.

==== Art ====
Lunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution, such as the agit-trains and agit-boats that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts. He also gave support to constructivism&#x27;s experiments and the initiatives such as the ROSTA Windows, revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko and others. With his encouragement, 36 new art galleries were opened in 1918-21.

==== Cinema ====
Mayakovsky stimulated his interest in cinema, then a new art form. Lunacharsky wrote an &quot;agit-comedy&quot;, which was filmed in the streets of Petrograd for the first anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. Soon afterwards, he nationalised the film industry and founded the State Film School. In 1920, he told George Lansbury: &quot;So far, cinemas are not much use owing to shortage of materials. ... When these difficulties are removed ... the story of humanity will be told in pictures&quot;.

==== Theatre ====
In the early 1920s, theatre appears to have been the art form to which Lunacharsky attached the greatest importance. In 1918, when most Bolsheviks despised experimental art, Lunacharsky praised Mayakovsky&#x27;s play Mystery-Bouffe, directed by Meyerhold, which he described as &quot;original, powerful and beautiful&quot;. But his main interest was not experimental theatre. During the civil war, he wrote two symbolic dramas, &quot;The Magi&quot; and &quot;Ivan Goes to Heaven&quot;, and a historical drama &quot;Oliver Cromwell.&quot; In July 1919, he took personal charge of the theatre administration from Olga Kameneva, with the intention of reviving realism on stage.

Lunacharsky was associated with the establishment of the Bolshoi Drama Theater in 1919, working with Maxim Gorky, Alexander Blok and Maria Andreyeva. He also played a part in persuading the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) and its renowned directors Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko to end their opposition to the regime and resume productions. In January 1922 he protested vigorously after Lenin had ordered that the Bolshoi Ballet was to be closed, and succeeded in keeping it open.

In 1923 he launched a &quot;Back to Ostrovsky&quot; movement to mark the centenary of Russia&#x27;s first great playwright. He was also personally involved in the decision to allow the MAT to stage Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; (usually known by its original title, &quot;The White Guard&quot;)

==== Literature ====
Despite his belief in &#x27;proletarian&#x27; literature, Lunacharsky also defended writers who were not experimental, nor even sympathetic to the Bolsheviks. He also helped Boris Pasternak. In 1924, Pasternak&#x27;s wife wrote to his cousin saying &quot;so far, Lunacharsky has never refused to see Borya&quot;.

==== Music ====
Lunacharsky was the first Bolshevik to recognise the value of the composer Sergei Prokofiev, whom he met in April 1918, after the premiere of his &quot;Classical Symphony&quot;. In 1926, he wrote &quot;the freshness and rich imagination characteristic of Prokofiev attest to his exceptional talent&quot;. He arranged a passport that allowed Prokofiev to leave Russia, then in July 1925 he persuaded the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to invite Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and the pianist Alexander Borovsky to return to Russia. Stravinsky and Borovsky rejected the offer, but Prokofiev was given permission to come and go freely while Lunacharsky was in office. In February 1927, he sat with Prokofiev during the first Russian performance of The Love for Three Oranges, which he compared to &quot;a glass of champagne, all sparkling and frothy&quot;.

In 1929, Lunacharsky supported a change in the Russian alphabet, latinizing it from Cyrillic to Latin.

== Personality ==
Though he was influential in setting Soviet policy on culture and education, particularly in the early years while Lenin was alive, Lunacharsky was not a powerful figure. Trotsky described him as &quot;a man always easily infected by the moods of those around him, imposing in appearance and voice, eloquent in a declamatory way, none too reliable, but often irreplaceable.&quot; But Ilya Ehrenburg wrote: &quot;I was struck by something different: he was not a poet, he was engrossed in political activity, but an extraordinary love of art burned in him&quot;, and Nikolai Sukhanov, who knew him well, wrote that

==Later career==
Lunacharsky avoided taking sides when the Communist Party split after Lenin&#x27;s death, but he almost became embroiled in the split by accident by publishing his selection of &quot;Revolutionary Silhouettes&quot; in 1923, which included portraits of Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Martov, but failed to mention Stalin. Later, he offended Trotsky by saying at an event in the Bolshoi Theatre to commemorate the second anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s death, that &quot;they&quot; (he did not say who) were willing to offer Trotsky &quot;a crown on a velvet cushion&quot; and &quot;hail him as Lev I&quot;.

After about 1927, he was losing control over cultural policy to Stalinists like Leopold Averbakh. After he was removed from office, in 1929, Lunacharsky was appointed to the Learned Council of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee. He also became an editor for the Literature Encyclopedia (published 1929–1939).

Lunacharsky represented the Soviet Union at the League of Nations from 1930 through 1932.

In 1930, Anatolii Lunacharsky established a government commission to research satirical genres in all kinds of art.

In 1933, he was appointed ambassador to Spain, a post he never assumed, as he died &quot;en route&quot;.

===Death===
Lunacharsky died at 58 on 26 December 1933 in Menton, France, while travelling to Spain to take up the post of Soviet ambassador there, as the conflict that became the Spanish Civil War appeared increasingly inevitable.
==Personal life==
In 1902, he married Anna Alexandrovna Malinovskaya, Alexander Bogdanov&#x27;s sister. They had one child, a daughter named Irina Lunacharsky. In 1922, he met Natalya Rozenel, an actress at the Maly Theatre. He left his family and married her. Sergei Prokofiev, who met her in 1927, described her as &quot;one of his most recent wives&quot;, and as &quot;a beautiful woman from the front, much less beautiful if you looked at her predatory profile&quot;. He claimed that Lunacharsky had previously been the lover of the ballerina Inna Chernetskaya.

Lunacharsky was known as an art connoisseur and a critic. Besides Marxist dialectics, he had been interested in philosophy since he was a student. For instance, he was fond of the ideas of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Frederich Nietzsche and Richard Avenarius. He could read six modern languages and two dead ones. Lunacharsky corresponded with H. G. Wells, Bernard Shaw and Romain Rolland. He met numerous other famous cultural figures such as Rabindranath Tagore and Nicholas Roerich.

Lunacharsky once described Nadezhda Krupskaya as the &quot;soul of Narkompros&quot;.

Friends included Igor Moiseyev.

==Legacy==

Lunacharsky&#x27;s remains were returned to Moscow, where his urn was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, a rare privilege during the Soviet era. During the Great Purge of 1936–1938, Lunacharsky&#x27;s name was erased from the Communist Party&#x27;s history and his memoirs were banned. A revival came in the late 1950s and 1960s, with a surge of memoirs about Lunacharsky and many streets and organizations named or renamed in his honour. During that era, Lunacharsky was viewed by the Soviet intelligentsia as an educated, refined and tolerant Soviet politician.

In the 1960s, his daughter Irina Lunacharsky helped revive his popularity. Several streets and institutions were named in his honour.

In 1971, Asteroid 2446 was named after Lunacharsky.

Some Soviet-built orchestral harps also bear the name of Lunacharsky, presumably in his honour. These concert pedal harps were produced in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg, Russia).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed Nikolai Gubenko, last culture commissar of the Soviet Union, &quot;the first arts professional since Anatoly V. Lunacharsky&quot; because he seemed to &quot;identify&quot; with Lunacharsky.

==Works==
Lunacharsky was also a prolific writer. He wrote literary essays on the works of several writers, including Alexander Pushkin, George Bernard Shaw and Marcel Proust. However, his most notable work is his memoirs, &quot;Revolutionary Silhouettes&quot;, which describe anecdotes and Lunacharsky&#x27;s general impressions of Lenin, Leon Trotsky and eight other revolutionaries. Trotsky reacted to some of Lunacharsky&#x27;s opinions in his own autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;.

In the 1920s, Lunacharsky produced Lyubov Popova&#x27;s &quot;The Locksmith and the Chancellor&quot; at the Comedy Theater.

Some of his works include:
* &quot;Outlines of a Collective Philosophy&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Self-Education of the Workers: The Cultural Task of the Struggling Proletariat&quot; (1918)
* &quot;Three Plays&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Revolutionary Silhouettes&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Theses on the Problems of Marxist Criticism&quot; (1928)
* &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky, Innovator&quot; (1931)
* &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot; (1931)
* &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; (1932)
* &quot;On Literature and Art&quot; (1965)

<text>Regnal numbers are ordinal numbers used to distinguish among persons with the same name who held the same office. Most importantly, they are used to distinguish monarchs. An &quot;ordinal&quot; is the number placed after a monarch&#x27;s regnal name to differentiate between a number of kings, queens or princes reigning the same territory with the same regnal name.

It is common to start counting either since the beginning of the monarchy, or since the beginning of a particular line of state succession. For example, Boris III of Bulgaria and his son Simeon II were given their regnal numbers because the medieval rulers of the First and Second Bulgarian Empire were counted as well, although the recent dynasty dates only back to 1878 and is only distantly related to the monarchs of previous Bulgarian states. On the other hand, the kings of England and kings of Great Britain and the United Kingdom are counted starting with the Norman Conquest. That is why the son of Henry III of England is called Edward I, even though there were three English monarchs named Edward before the Conquest (they were distinguished by epithets instead).

Sometimes legendary or fictional persons are included. For example, the Swedish kings Eric XIV (reigned 1560–68) and Charles IX (1604–11) took ordinals based on a fanciful 1544 history by Johannes Magnus, which invented six kings of each name before those accepted by later historians. A list of Swedish monarchs, represented on the map of the Estates of the Swedish Crown, produced by French engraver (1673–1721) and published in Paris in 1719, starts with Canute I and shows Eric XIV and Charles IX as Eric IV and Charles II respectively; the only Charles holding his traditional ordinal in the list is Charles XII. Also, in the case of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia, he chose his regnal number with reference to a mythical ancestor and first sovereign of his country (a supposed son of biblical King Solomon) to underline his legitimacy into the so-called Solomonic dynasty.

==Examples of monarchical ordinals==

Monarchs with the same given name are distinguished by their ordinals:
* Kings Umberto I and Umberto II of Italy
* Empresses Catherine I and Catherine II of Russia
* Princes Rainier II and Rainier III of Monaco
* Popes Benedict XV and Benedict XVI

Ordinals may also apply where a ruler of one realm and a ruler of that realm&#x27;s successor state share the same name:
* Queens Elizabeth I of England and Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom
* Kings Alfonso XI of Castile and Alfonso XII of Spain
* Kings Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and Victor Emmanuel II of Italy
* Kings Peter I of Serbia and Peter II of Yugoslavia

=== Double names ===
Practice varies where monarchs go by two or more given names. For Swedish monarchs, the ordinal qualifies only the first name; for example, Gustav VI Adolf, known as &quot;Gustav Adolf&quot;, was the sixth Gustav/Gustaf, but the third Gustav Adolf. By contrast, the Kingdom of Prussia was ruled in turn by Friedrich I, Friedrich Wilhelm I, Friedrich II, and Friedrich Wilhelm II; and later by Wilhelm I. Likewise Pope John Paul I, who chose his double name to honour predecessors John XXIII and Paul VI, and was succeeded by John Paul II.

=== Ordinals for non-reigning royalty ===
In any case, it is usual to count only the monarchs or heads of the family, and to number them sequentially up to the end of the dynasty. A notable exception to this rule is the German House of Reuss. This family has the particularity that every male member during the last eight centuries was named Heinrich, and all of them, not only the head of the family, were numbered. While the members of the elder branch were numbered in order of birth until the extinction of the branch in 1927, the members of the younger line were (and still are) numbered in sequences that began and ended roughly as centuries began and ended. This explains why the current (since 2012) head of the Reuss family is called Heinrich XIV, his late father Heinrich IV and his sons Heinrich XXIX and Heinrich V.

It is rare, but some German princely families number all males whether head of the family or not; for example, Hans Heinrich XV von Hochberg was preceded as Prince of Pless by Hans Heinrich XI and succeeded by Hans Heinrich XVII; the ordinals XII, XIII, XIV, and XVI were borne by von Hochbergs who were not Prince of Pless. Similarly for the House of Reuss, where all men were numbered Heinrichs and some were reigning Princes of Reuss-Gera or Reuss-Greiz.

Pretenders and rulers of formerly deposed dynasties are often given regnal numbers &quot;as if non-reigning pretenders had actually ruled&quot;. For example Louis XVIII of France took a regnal number that implicitly asserts that Louis XVII had been king, though he never reigned; his pretendership was during the First French Republic. A similar case is that of Napoleon III whose regnal number implicitly asserts a ruling Napoleon II. Louis XVIII numbered his regnal year from the death of Louis XVII, something Napoleon III never did.

==History==
Almost all West European monarchs and popes after medieval times have used ordinals. Ordinals are also retrospectively applied to earlier monarchs in most works of reference, at least as far as they are not easy to distinguish from each other by any other systematical means. In several cases, various sorts of &quot;semi-regnal&quot; members of dynasties are also numeraled, to facilitate their individuality in works of reference – in cases such as co-regents, crown princes, succession-conveying , prime ministers and deputy monarchs. In the first centuries after the Middle Ages, the use was sometimes sporadic, but became established by the 18th century. In the past couple of centuries, European monarchs without an official ordinal have been rarities.

As a rule of thumb, medieval European monarchs did not use ordinals at their own time, and those who used were rarities and even their use was sporadic. Ordinals for monarchs before the 13th century are anachronisms, as are also ordinals for almost all later medieval monarchs. Still, they are often used, because they are a practical way of distinguishing between different historical monarchs who had the same name.

Popes were apparently the first to assume official ordinals for their reigns, although this occurred only in the last centuries of the Middle Ages. It is clear, from renumberings of Popes John XV–XIX and Popes Stephen II–IX, that as of the 11th century the popes did not yet use established ordinals. The official, self-confirmed numbering of John XXI means that at latest from the 13th century the popes did take official ordinals in their accession.

Emperor Frederick II, King Charles II of Naples and King Premislas II of Poland evidently used ordinals sometimes during their reign, whereas most of their contemporary monarchs did not. In the 14th century, Emperor Charles IV sometimes used that ordinal. Presumably, use of the ordinal of king Frederick III of Sicily also is contemporaneous. The royal chroniclers of the Abbey of Saint-Denis were using ordinals to refer to the French kings as early as the thirteenth century with the practise entering common usage among royalty and the nobility by the late fourteenth century. The British tradition of consistently and prevalently numbering monarchs dates back to Henry VIII and Mary I; however, sporadic use occurred at least as early as the reign of Edward III.

The long history of the papacy has led to difficulties in some cases. For example, Stephen was only pope for three days before dying of apoplexy, and was never consecrated. Because not all list-makers count him as having been pope (as &quot;Stephen II&quot;), there has been some confusion in regard to later popes who chose the name Stephen. Later Stephens are sometimes numbered with parentheses, e.g., his immediate successor (in name) is denoted either Stephen (II) III or Stephen III (II). The church did consider Stephen II a pope until 1960, when he was removed from the list of popes in 1961. The history of the numbering of popes taking the regnal name &quot;John&quot; is even more convoluted, owing to the long history of popes taking the name (a common name, chosen frequently to honour the Apostle), bad record-keeping, and political confusion; among other results, the regnal name &quot;John XX&quot; is completely skipped under all reckonings.

==Personal unions==
In the case of personal unions, some monarchs have had more than one ordinal, because they had different ordinals in their different realms. For instance, Charles XV of Sweden was also king of Norway, but in Norway he went under the name Charles IV. The Swedish-Norwegian union was in force 1814–1905 and both realms had had kings called Charles before the union, but Sweden had had more kings by that name.

In the event of one kingdom achieving independence from another but retaining the same monarch, the monarch often retains the same number as was already used in the older realm. King Christian X of Denmark thus became King Christian X of Iceland when Iceland became an independent kingdom in personal union with Denmark in 1918. The same is true for Commonwealth realms, where the monarch retains the regnal number from the British line of monarchs (see below).

===Ordinals and the British Acts of Union 1707===
Beginning in 1603, when England and Scotland began to share a monarch but were still legally separate realms, their monarchs were numbered separately. The king who began the personal union was James VI of Scotland who was also James I of England, and his name is often written (especially in Scotland) as James VI and I. Similarly, his grandson is James VII and II. Mary II&#x27;s ordinal coincidentally relates to both her predecessors Mary I of England and Mary I of Scotland; her co-sovereign husband is William III and II (here the English number is first). Charles I and Charles II had a name not used in either country before 1603.

====Acts of Union====

After the realms were united with the Acts of Union 1707, separate numbers were not needed for the next five monarchs: Anne and the four Georges. However, when William IV acceded in 1830, he was not called William III in Scotland. (George Croly pointed out in 1830 the new king was William I, II, III, and IV: of Hanover, Ireland, Scotland, and England respectively.) Nor were Edward VII and Edward VIII known as Edward I and Edward II (or possibly II and III, if one counts the disputed reign of Edward Balliol) of Scotland. These kings all followed the numbering consistent with the English sequence of sovereigns (which, incidentally, was also the higher of the two numbers in all occurring cases). This was not without controversy in Scotland, however; for example, Edward VII&#x27;s regnal number was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the established Church of Scotland, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had &quot;been excluded from Scotland by battle&quot;.
====Current state====

The issue arose again with the accession of Queen Elizabeth II, as Scotland had never before had a regnant Queen Elizabeth, the previous queen of that name having been queen of England only. Objections were raised, and sustained, to the use of the royal cypher ER anywhere in Scotland, resulting in several violent incidents, including the destruction of one of the first new ER pillar boxes in Scotland, at Leith in late 1952. Since that time, the cipher used in Scotland on all government and Crown property and street furniture has carried no lettering, but simply the Crown of Scotland from the Honours of Scotland. A court case, &quot;MacCormick v Lord Advocate,&quot; contesting the style &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; within Scotland, was decided in 1953 on the grounds that the numbering of monarchs was part of the royal prerogative, and that the plaintiffs had no title to sue the Crown.

To rationalise this usage, it was suggested by Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the day, that in future, the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences would always be used. This had been the case &quot;de facto&quot; since the Acts of Union 1707; nine of the thirteen monarchs since the Act had names either never previously used in England or Scotland (Anne, six Georges, and Victoria) or used in both only after the 1603 Union of Crowns (three Charleses), which sidestepped the issue, while the English numbers for the remaining four monarchs&#x27; names have consistently been both higher and the ones used (William, two Edwards, and Elizabeth). Under the Churchill rule, if a future British monarch were to use the regnal name &quot;Alexander&quot;, even though there has never been a King of England of that regnal name, they would be Alexander IV, there having been three Kings Alexander of Scotland (reigning 1107–1124, 1214–1249, and 1249–1286).

====Ireland====
As the Lordship of Ireland (1171–1542) and Kingdom of Ireland (1542–1800) were subordinate to the Kingdom of England, the English ordinals were used in Ireland even before the Acts of Union 1800. William III of England and William IV of the United Kingdom were still called &quot;William III&quot; and &quot;William IV&quot; in Ireland, even though neither William I or William II ruled any part of Ireland. Similarly, the various Kings Henry are numbered II–VIII as they are in England even though Henry I of England never ruled any part of Ireland. Elizabeth I of England is referred to in Irish regnal year legal citations as &quot;Elizabeth&quot; rather than &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; because Ireland became a republic before Elizabeth II became queen.

==&quot;The first&quot; ==

In some monarchies it is customary not to use an ordinal when there has been only one holder of that name. For example, Queen Victoria will not be called &quot;Victoria I&quot; unless there is a Victoria II. This tradition is applied in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands. It was also applied in most of the former German monarchies and in Hungary. In Sweden, the practice is not consistent, as Sigismund and Adolf Frederick never have ordinals, whereas Frederick I often does.

Other monarchies assign ordinals to monarchs even if they are the only ones of their name. This is a more recent invention and &quot;appears&quot; to have been done for the first time when Francis I of France issued testoons (silver coins) bearing the legend FRANCISCVS I DE. GR. FRANCORV. REX. This currently is the regular practice in Spain and Monaco (at least for Prince Albert I, as Princess Louise Hippolyte, who reigned 150 years earlier, does not appear to have used an ordinal). It was also applied in Brazil, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Montenegro, Portugal (where Kings Joseph, Louis and Charles are usually referred to as &quot;Joseph I&quot;, &quot;Louis I&quot; and &quot;Charles I&quot; although there has not yet been any Joseph II, Louis II or Charles II, but Kings Denis, Edward, Sebastian and Henry are usually referred without the ordinal). The ordinal for King Juan Carlos I of Spain is used in both Spanish and English, but he is sometimes simply called King Juan Carlos of Spain in English. In Russia, use of &quot;The First&quot; ordinal started with Paul I of Russia. Before him, neither Anna of Russia nor Elizabeth of Russia had the &quot;I&quot; ordinal. In Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie used the &quot;I&quot; ordinal (, &quot;qädamawi&quot;) although previous Ethiopian monarchs had not used it, and they are not referred as &quot;the first&quot; unless there were successors of the same name.

The Catholic papacy used the ordinal I under Pope John Paul I, but early popes who are the only ones to have reigned under a certain name are not referred to as &quot;the first&quot; (for instance, Peter the Apostle; his immediate successor, Pope Linus, as well as Pope Anacletus, are referred to without an ordinal). The current Pope Francis has declined the use of an ordinal, but on the other hand, his Orthodox counterpart, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, uses one, as does Aram I, the catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

In Austria, Emperors Francis, Ferdinand, Francis Joseph and Charles all styled themselves as &quot;the first&quot; although all the only Emperors of Austria with those names. Three of those names were previously the names of Austrian Archdukes (the Archduchy of Austria was a state within the Holy Roman and the Austrian Empires), which makes three of these emperors Francis II, Ferdinand V, and Charles IV in their capacity as Archdukes. Francis Joseph was the first Austrian Archduke of that name.

The use of &quot;The First&quot; ordinal is also common to self-proclaimed ephemeral &quot;kings&quot; or &quot;emperors&quot;, such as Napoleon I in France; Dessalines, Christophe and Soulouque in Haiti; Iturbide in Mexico; Zog in Albania; Bokassa in the Central African Empire; Skossyreff in Andorra; Theodore in Corsica; and &quot;Emperor&quot; Norton in San Francisco. In those cases, they wanted to emphasize the change of regime they introduced or attempted to introduce.

==Pretenders==
It is traditional amongst French monarchists to continue to number their pretenders even though they have never reigned. Hence, a supporter of the late Comte de Paris would have referred to him as Henri VII even though only four men named &quot;Henri&quot; have been King of France.

Non-consecutive ordinals may indicate dynastic claims for non-regnant monarchs. For example, after Louis XVI of France was executed during the French Revolution, legitimists consider him to have been succeeded by his young son, whom they called Louis XVII. Although the child died in prison a few years later and never reigned, his uncle, who came to the French throne in the Bourbon Restoration, took the name Louis XVIII in acknowledgement of his dynasty&#x27;s rights. Similarly, after Emperor Napoleon I&#x27;s regime collapsed, he abdicated in favour of his four-year-old son, who was proclaimed Napoleon II. The young emperor was deposed only weeks later by Napoleon&#x27;s European rivals and was never recognized internationally; but when his first cousin Louis Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852, he declared himself Napoleon III in recognition of his predecessor.

=== Jacobite usage ===
Following the Glorious Revolution, a line of pretenders descended from the dethroned James VII and II claimed the throne and declared themselves to be James VIII and III, Charles III and Henry IX and I. They numbered themselves separately for Scotland and England because they did not recognize the Acts of Union, which joined the two kingdoms into one in 1707, as valid.

James VII&#x27;s last legitimate descendant died in 1807, and the claim passed to descendants of his sister Henrietta, Duchess of Orléans. Although none of them has actively claimed the throne, their supporters have assigned them the regnal numbers that they &quot;should have had&quot;; for example, from 1919 to 1955, the claim was held by &quot;Robert I &amp; IV&quot;, which was numbered for England and Scotland respectively.

This custom is currently not followed by any other ethnic groups other than the French and British (Jacobites), being unique to them, monarchists from other nations do not usually use royal numbers for the pretenders they support.

==Queens consort==

While reigning monarchs use ordinals, ordinals are not used for royal female consorts. Thus, while King George V used an ordinal to distinguish him from other kings in the United Kingdoms called George, his wife, Queen Mary, had no ordinal.

The lack of an ordinal in the case of royal consorts complicates the recording of history, as there may be a number of consorts over time with the same name with no way to distinguish between them. For that reason, royal consorts are sometimes after their deaths recorded in history books and encyclopaedias by the use of their premarital name or, if they were from royalty or sovereign nobility, the name of the dynasty or the country. For example, Henry VIII of England&#x27;s fifth wife, Katherine Howard (of noble but not sovereign ancestry), is known by her maiden surname, and George V&#x27;s wife (a descendant of the sovereign ducal house of Württemburg) is commonly known as Mary of Teck (after her father&#x27;s title) and Edward VII&#x27;s wife (a daughter of the King of Denmark) is known as Alexandra of Denmark.

<text>The Alfa class, Soviet designation Project 705 Lira (, meaning &quot;Lyre&quot;, NATO reporting name Alfa), was a class of nuclear-powered attack submarines in service with the Soviet Navy from 1971 into the early 1990s, with one serving in the Russian Navy until 1996. They were among the fastest military submarines ever built, with only the prototype submarine (NATO reporting name Papa-class) exceeding them in submerged speed.

The Project 705 submarines had a unique design among other submarines. In addition to the revolutionary use of titanium for its hull, it used a powerful lead-bismuth liquid metal cooled reactor as a power source, which greatly reduced the size of the reactor compared to conventional designs, thus reducing the overall size of the submarine, and allowing for very high speeds. However, it also meant that the reactor had a short lifetime and had to be kept warm when it was not being used. As a result, the submarines were used as interceptors, mostly kept in port ready for a high-speed dash into the North Atlantic.

== Design and development ==

=== Preproduction ===
Project 705 was first proposed in 1957 by M. G. Rusanov and the initial design work led by Rusanov began in May 1960 in Leningrad with design task assigned to SKB-143, one of the two predecessors (the other being TsKB-16) of the Malakhit Design Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with Rubin Design Bureau and Lazurit Central Design Bureau.

The project was highly innovative in order to meet demanding requirements: sufficient speed to successfully pursue any ship; the ability to avoid anti-submarine weapons and to ensure success in underwater combat; low detectability, in particular to airborne MAD arrays, and also especially to active sonars; minimal displacement; and minimal crew complement.

A special titanium alloy hull would be used to create a small, low drag, 1,500 ton, six compartment vessel capable of very high speeds (in excess of ) and deep diving. The submarine would operate as an interceptor, staying in harbor or on patrol route and then racing out to reach an approaching fleet. A high-power liquid-metal cooled nuclear reactor was devised, which was kept liquid in port through external heating. Extensive automation would also greatly reduce the needed crew numbers to just 16 men.

The practical problems with the design quickly became apparent and in 1963 the design team was replaced and a less radical design was proposed, increasing all main dimensions and the vessel weight by 800 tons and almost doubling the crew.

A prototype of a similar design, the Project 661 or &quot;K-162&quot; (since 1978 &quot;K-222&quot;) cruise missile submarine (referred to by NATO as the ), was built at the SEVMASH shipyard in Severodvinsk and completed in 1972. The long build time was caused by numerous design flaws and difficulties in manufacture. Extensively tested, she was taken out of service following a reactor accident in 1980. She had a top speed of and a test depth of . This combined with other reports created some alarm in the U.S. Navy and prompted the rapid development of the ADCAP torpedo program and the Sea Lance missile programs projects (the latter was cancelled when more definitive information about the Soviet project was known). The creation of the high-speed Spearfish torpedo by the Royal Navy was also a response to the threat posed by the reported capabilities of submarines of the Project 705.

=== Production ===
Production started in 1964 as Project 705 with construction at both the Admiralty yard, Leningrad and at Sevmashpredpriyatiye (SEVMASH — Northern Machine-building Enterprise), Severodvinsk. The lead boat – the &quot;K-64&quot; – was built in Leningrad. Leningrad built three subsequent Project 705 submarines, and Severodvinsk built three Project 705K submarines (only differing in the reactor plant; see below). The first vessel was commissioned in 1971. Project 705 boats were intended to be experimental platforms themselves, to test all innovations and rectify their faults, that would afterwards found a new generation of submarines. This highly experimental nature mostly predetermined their future. In 1981, with the completion of the seventh vessel, production ended. All vessels were assigned to the Northern Fleet.

=== Propulsion ===
The power plant for the boat was a lead-bismuth cooled, beryllium-moderated reactor. Such liquid metal cooled reactors have a number of advantages over other types:

* Due to higher coolant temperature, their energy efficiency is up to 1.5 times higher.
* Lifetime without refueling can be increased more easily, in part due to higher efficiency.
* Liquid lead-bismuth systems can not cause an explosion and quickly solidify in case of a leak, greatly improving safety.
* Lead-bismuth cooled reactors are much lighter and smaller than water-cooled reactors, which was the primary factor when considering power plant choice for the Project 705 submarines.
Even though 1960s technology was barely sufficient to produce reliable LMRs, which are even today considered challenging, their advantages were considered compelling. Two power plants were developed independently, BM-40A by OKB Gidropress (Hydropress) in Leningrad and OK-550 by the OKBM design bureau in Nizhniy Novgorod, both using a eutectic lead-bismuth solution for the primary cooling stage, and both producing 155 MW of power.

Designed burst speed in tests was for all vessels, and speeds of could be sustained. Acceleration to top speed took one minute and reversing 180 degrees at full speed took just 40 seconds. This degree of maneuverability exceeds all other submarines and most torpedoes that were in service at the time. Indeed, during training the boats proved able to successfully evade torpedoes launched by other submarines, which required introduction of faster torpedoes such as the American ADCAP or British &quot;Spearfish&quot;. However, the price for this was a very high noise level at burst speed. According to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the tactical speed was similar to s.

Propulsion was provided to the screw by a 40,000 shp steam turbine, and two 100 kW electric thrusters on the tips of the stern stabilizers were used for quieter &quot;creeping&quot; (low speed tactical maneuvering) and for emergency propulsion in the event of an engineering casualty. Electrical power was provided by two 1,500 kW turbogenerators, with a backup 500 kW diesel generator and a bank of 112 zinc-silver batteries.

The OK-550 plant was used on Project 705, but later, on 705K, the BM-40A plant was installed due to the low reliability of the OK-550. While more reliable, BM-40A still turned out to be much more demanding in maintenance than older pressurized water reactors. The issue was that the lead/bismuth eutectic solution solidifies at . If it ever hardened, it would be impossible to restart the reactor, since the fuel assemblies would be frozen in the solidified coolant. Thus, whenever the reactor is shut down, the liquid coolant must be heated externally with superheated steam. Near the piers where the submarines were moored, a special facility was constructed to deliver superheated steam to the vessels&#x27; reactors when the reactors were shut down. A smaller ship was also stationed at the pier to deliver steam from her steam plant to the Alfa submarines.

Coastal facilities were treated with much less attention than the submarines and often turned out unable to heat the submarines&#x27; reactors. Consequently, the plants had to be kept running even while the subs were in harbor. The facilities completely broke down early in the 1980s and since then the reactors of all operational Alfas were kept constantly running. While the BM-40A reactors are able to work for many years without stopping, they were not specifically designed for such treatment and any serious reactor maintenance became impossible. This led to a number of failures, including coolant leaks and one reactor broken down and frozen while at sea. However, constantly running the reactors proved better than relying on the coastal facilities. Four vessels were decommissioned due to freezing of the coolant.

Both the OK-550 and the BM-40A designs were single-use reactors and could not be refueled as the coolant would inevitably freeze in the process. This was compensated for by a much longer lifetime on their only load (up to 15 years), after which the reactors would be completely replaced. While such a solution could potentially decrease service times and increase reliability, it is still more expensive, and the idea of single-use reactors was unpopular in the 1970s. Furthermore, Project 705 does not have a modular design that would allow quick replacement of reactors, so such maintenance would take at least as long as refueling a normal submarine.

=== Hull ===
Like most Soviet nuclear submarines, Project 705 used a double hull, where the internal hull withstands the pressure and the outer one protects it and provides an optimal hydrodynamic shape. The gracefully curved outer hull and sail were highly streamlined for high submerged speed and maneuverability.

Apart from the prototypes, all six Project 705 and 705K submarines were built with titanium alloy hulls, which was revolutionary in submarine design at the time due to the cost of titanium and the technologies and equipment needed to work with it. The difficulties in the engineering became apparent in the first submarine that was quickly decommissioned after cracks developed in the hull. Later, metallurgy and welding technology were improved and no hull problems were experienced on subsequent vessels. American intelligence services became aware of the use of titanium alloys in the construction by retrieving metal shavings that fell from a truck as it left the St. Petersburg ship yard.

The pressure hull was separated into six watertight compartments, of which only the third (center) compartment was manned and others were accessible only for maintenance. The third compartment had reinforced spherical bulkheads that could withstand the pressure at the test depth and offered additional protection to the crew in case of attack. To further enhance survivability, the ship was equipped with an ejectable rescue capsule.

The original test depth requirement specified for Project 705 was , but after the preliminary design was completed, SKB-143 proposed relaxing this requirement to . Reducing test depth and thinning the pressure hull would make up for increases in weight of the reactor, sonar system, and transverse bulkheads. The common myth that the Alfas could dive to or deeper is rooted in Western intelligence estimates made during the Cold War.

=== Control system ===
A suite of new systems was developed for these submarines, including:
* &quot;Akkord&quot; (Accord) combat information and control system, which received and processed hydroacoustic, television, radar, and navigation data from other systems, determining the location, speed, and predicted trajectory of other ships, submarines, and torpedoes. Information was displayed on control terminals, along with recommendations for operating a single submarine, both for attack and torpedo evasion, or commanding a group of submarines.
* &quot;Sargan&quot; weapon control system controlling attack, torpedo homing, and use of countermeasures, both by human command and automatically if required.
* &quot;Okean&quot; (Ocean) automated hydroacoustic (sonar) system that provided target data to other systems and eliminated the need for crew members working with detection equipment.
* &quot;Sozh&quot; navigation system and &quot;Boksit&quot; (Bauxite) course control system, which integrated course, depth, trim, and speed control, for manual, automated, and programmed maneuvering.
* &quot;Ritm&quot; (Rhythm) system controlling operation of all machinery aboard, eliminating the need for any personnel servicing reactor and other machinery, which was the main factor in reducing crew complement.
* &quot;Alfa&quot; radiation monitoring system.
* &quot;TV-1&quot; television optical system for outside observation.
All the systems of the submarine were fully automated and all operations requiring human decision were performed from the control room. While such automation is common on aircraft, other military ships and submarines have multiple, separate teams performing these tasks. Crew intervention was required only for course changes or combat and no maintenance was performed at sea. Due to these systems, the combat shift of Alfa submarines consisted only of eight officers stationed in the control room. While nuclear submarines typically have 120 to 160 crew members, the initially proposed crew number was 14 — all officers, except the cook. Later it was considered more practical to have additional crew aboard that could be trained to operate the new generation of submarines and the number was increased to 27 officers and four warrant officers. Also, given that most of the electronics were newly developed and failures were expected, additional crew was stationed to monitor their performance. Some reliability problems were connected with electronics, and it is possible that some accidents could have been foreseen with more mature and better developed monitoring systems. Overall performance was considered good for an experimental system.

The main reason behind the small crew complement and high automation was not just to allow a reduction in the size of the submarine, but rather to provide an advantage in reaction speed by replacing long chains of command with instant electronics, speeding up any action.

== Incidents ==
Two loss-of-coolant accidents occurred in Alfa class submarines. In 1971, suboptimal welding on the steam system allowed moisture to leak into an area where it picked up chlorides and then condensed and dripped onto primary coolant pipes containing the liquid metal coolant. This caused corrosion and breakage of the primary coolant pipes on Task Order 900. A move towards an integral pool-type reactor was considered the appropriate design evolution after this.

The second incident occurred on Project 705K (Task Order 105). Steam generator tubes in the evaporator section corroded and leaked steam into the primary system. Pressure increased in the primary system, which was designed to withstand the full pressure in this incident. However, a procedural step mandating that a valve to a sensitive manometer be closed during operation had not been followed. As a result, the high pressure could reach the sensitive instrument and broke through it, pouring Polonium-contaminated aerosols into the inhabited part of the reactor compartment. While the reactor could have been repaired, it was decided to replace it entirely with a new one.

== Impact ==

Alfas, as with almost all other nuclear submarines, were never actually used in combat. However, the Soviet government still made good use of them, by exaggerating the planned number of vessels, which were assumed to allow naval superiority to be gained by shadowing major ship groups and destroying them in case of war. The US replied by starting the ADCAP program, and the British Royal Navy the Spearfish torpedo program, to create torpedoes with the range, speed, and intelligence to reliably pursue Alfa-class submarines.

The Alfas were intended to be only the first of a new generation of light, fast submarines, and before their decommissioning, there was already a family of derivative designs, including Project 705D, armed with long-range 650 mm torpedoes, and the Project 705A ballistic missile variant that was intended be able to defend herself successfully against attack submarines, therefore not needing patrolled bastions. However, the main thrust of Russian/Soviet SSN development was instead focused toward the larger, quieter boats that eventually became the .

The technologies and solutions developed, tested, and perfected on Alfas formed the foundation for future designs. The suite of submarine control systems was later used in the &quot;Akula&quot;-class, or Project 971 attack submarines that have a crew of 50, more than the Alfa but still less than half as many as other attack submarines. The &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarines represent a hybrid of the Alfa and Victor III classes, combining the stealth and towed sonar array of the Victor III with the automation of the Alfa class.

== Project Sapphire ==

Project Sapphire was a covert United States military operation to retrieve of very highly enriched uranium fuel intended for the Alfa-class submarines from a warehouse at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant outside Ust-Kamenogorsk in far eastern Kazakhstan, where it was stored with little protection after the fall of the Soviet Union. The material, known as uranium oxide-beryllium, was produced by the Ulba plant in the form of ceramic fuel rods for use by the submarines. &quot;The Kazakh government had no idea that this material was there&quot;, Kazakh officials later told Harvard&#x27;s Graham Allison, a national-security analyst. In February 1994 it was uncovered by Elwood Gift, an engineer from the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, stored in quart sized steel cans in a vault about twenty feet wide and thirty feet long. Some of it was on wire shelves while others were sitting on the floor. The cans were covered with dust. Word soon came that Iran had officially visited the site looking to purchase reactor fuel. Washington set up a tiger team, and on 8 October 1994 the Sapphire Team flew out of McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base in three blacked out C-5 Galaxy cargo planes with 130 tons of equipment. It took the team six weeks, working twelve-hour shifts, six days a week, to process and can the 1,050 cans of uranium. The Sapphire Team finished recanning the uranium on 18 November 1994 at a cost of between ten and thirty million dollars (actual cost classified). The cans were loaded into 447 special fifty-five gallon drums for secure transport to the United States. Five C-5 Galaxys were dispatched from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, to retrieve the team and the uranium, but four were forced to turn back because of bad weather. Only a single C-5, carrying 30,000 pounds of supplies Tennesseans had donated for Ust-Kamenogorsk area orphanages, got through. Eventually a second C-5 arrived, and the two planes carried the uranium to Dover, from where it was transported to Oak Ridge to be blended down for reactor fuel.

== Decommissioning ==
The first vessel was decommissioned in 1974. five more in 1990 and the seventh in 1996. &quot;K-123&quot; underwent a refit between 1983 and 1992 and had her reactor compartment replaced with a VM-4 pressurized water reactor. After being used for training she was officially decommissioned July 31, 1996. Decommissioning of the ships entailed the singular complication that, the reactor being cooled by liquid metals, the nuclear rods became fused with the coolant when the reactor was stopped and conventional methods for disassembling the reactor were unavailable. France&#x27;s Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives designed and donated special equipment for a dedicated dry-dock (SD-10) in Gremikha, which was used to remove and store the reactors until they could be dismantled.

<doc id="296241" wikidata="Q311452" url="?curid=296241" title="Albert VII, Archduke of Austria">
<text>Albert VII (; 13 November 1559 – 13 July 1621) was the ruling Archduke of Austria for a few months in 1619 and, jointly with his wife, Isabella Clara Eugenia, sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1598 and 1621. Prior to this, he had been a cardinal, Archbishop of Toledo, viceroy of Portugal and Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He succeeded his brother Matthias as reigning archduke of Lower and Upper Austria, but abdicated in favor of Ferdinand II the same year, making it the shortest (and often ignored) reign in Austrian history.

==Early life==
Archduke Albert was the fifth son of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria of Spain, daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Isabella of Portugal. He was sent to the Spanish Court at the age of eleven, where his uncle, King Philip II, looked after his education, where he was apparently quite intelligent. Initially he was meant to pursue an ecclesiastical career. On 3 March 1577 he was appointed cardinal by Pope Gregory XIII, with a dispensation because of his age of eighteen, and was given Santa Croce in Gerusalemme as his titular church. Philip II planned to make Albert archbishop of Toledo as soon as possible, but the incumbent, Gaspar de Quiroga y Sandoval, lived much longer than expected; he died on 12 November 1594. In the meantime Albert only took lower orders. He was never ordained priest or bishop, and thus he resigned the See of Toledo in 1598. He resigned the cardinalate in 1598. His clerical upbringing did however have a lasting influence on his lifestyle.

After the dynastic union with Portugal, Albert became the first viceroy of the kingdom and its overseas empire in 1583. At the same time he was appointed Papal Legate and Grand Inquisitor for Portugal. As viceroy of Portugal he took part in the organization of the Great Armada of 1588 and beat off an English counter-attack on Lisbon in 1589. In 1593 Philip II recalled him to Madrid, where he would take a leading role in the government of the Spanish Monarchy. Two years later, Irish clan chiefs Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell offered Albert the Irish crown in the hope of obtaining Spanish support in the ongoing Nine Years War against Queen Elizabeth I.

==Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands==

After the death of Archduke Ernest of Austria in 1595, Albert was sent to Brussels to succeed his elder brother as Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He made his entry to Brussels on 11 February 1596. His first priority was restoring Spain&#x27;s military position in the Low Countries. Spain was facing the combined forces of the Dutch Republic, England and France and had known nothing but defeats since 1590. During his first campaign season, Albert surprised his enemies by capturing Calais and nearby Ardres from the French and Hulst from the Dutch. These successes were however offset by the third bankruptcy of the Spanish crown later that year. As a consequence, 1597 was marked by a series of military disasters. Stadholder Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange captured the last Spanish strongholds that remained north of the great rivers, as well as the strategic town of Rheinberg in the Electorate of Cologne. Between 13 May and 25 September 1597, the Spanish, who had sent a large army in March, had captured the city of Amiens easily in a ruse. Finally the Spanish Army of Flanders lost Amiens in September the same year to Henry IV of France despite desperate efforts to relieve the place by Albert and Ernst von Mansfeld. With no more money to pay the troops, Albert was also facing a series of mutinies.
While pursuing the war as well as he could, Albert made overtures for peace with Spain&#x27;s enemies, but only the French king was disposed to enter official negotiations. Under the mediation of the papal legate Cardinal Alessandro de&#x27;Medici — the future Pope Leo XI — Spain and France concluded the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598. Spain gave up its conquests, thereby restoring the situation of Cateau Cambrésis. France tacitly accepted the Spanish occupation of the prince-archbishopric of Cambray and pulled out of the war, but maintained the financial support for the Dutch Republic. Only a few days after the treaty, on 6 May 1598, Philip II announced his decision to marry his eldest daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, to Albert and to cede them the sovereignty over the Habsburg Netherlands. The Act of Cession did however stipulate that if the couple would not have children, the Netherlands would return to Spain. It also contained a number of secret clauses that assured a permanent presence of the Spanish Army of Flanders. After obtaining the pope&#x27;s permission, Albert formally resigned from the College of Cardinals on 13 July 1598 and left for Spain on 14 September, unaware that Philip II had died the night before. Pope Clement VIII celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrara, while the actual marriage took place in Valencia on 18 April 1599.
He was 39 and his bride 33; they had three children who all died in infancy.

==War years==

The first half of the reign of Albert and Isabella was dominated by war. After overtures to the United Provinces and to Queen Elizabeth I of England proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength. Even if Madrid and Brussels tended to agree on these options, Albert took a far more flexible stance than his brother-in-law, King Philip III of Spain. Albert had first-hand knowledge of the devastation wrought by the Dutch Revolt, and he had come to the conclusion that it would be virtually impossible to reconquer the northern provinces. Quite logically, Philip III and his councillors felt more concern for Spain&#x27;s reputation and for the impact that a compromise with the Dutch Republic might have on Habsburg positions as a whole. Spain provided the means to continue the war. Albert took the decisions on the ground and tended to ignore Madrid&#x27;s instructions. Under the circumstances, the division of responsibilities repeatedly led to tensions.
Albert&#x27;s reputation as a military commander suffered badly when he was defeated by the Dutch stadtholder Maurice of Nassau, prince of Orange in the Battle of Nieuwpoort on 2 July 1600. His inability to conclude the lengthy Siege of Ostend (1601–1604), resulted in his withdrawal from the tactical command of the Spanish Army of Flanders. From then on military operations were led by the Genoese Ambrogio Spínola. Even though he could not prevent the almost simultaneous capture of Sluis, Spínola forced Ostend to surrender on 22 September 1604. He seized the initiative during the next campaigns, bringing the war north of the great rivers for the first time since 1594.

Meanwhile, the accession of James VI of Scotland as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604 England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the Treaty of London. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the Gunpowder Plot caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels. Yet on the whole relations between the two courts tended to be cordial.

Spínola&#x27;s campaigns and the threat of diplomatic isolation induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1607. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace treaty. They did lead however to conclusion of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in Antwerp on 9 April 1609. Under the terms of the Truce, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for its duration. Albert had conceded this point against the will of Madrid and it took him a lot of effort to persuade Philip III to ratify the agreement. When Philip&#x27;s ratification finally arrived, Albert&#x27;s quest for the restoration of peace in the Low Countries had finally paid off.
==Years of peace==

The years of the Truce gave the Habsburg Netherlands a much needed breathing-space. The fields could again be worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of the Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian–French border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population after decades of demographic losses. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery. International trade was however hampered by the closure of the River Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Pietà based on the Italian model.
Meanwhile, the archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Counter-Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public. Engaging in religious debates was also forbidden by law. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechelen of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of able and committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the Catholic confessionalisation of the population. The same period saw important waves of witch-hunts.
In the process of recatholicisation, new and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of Albert and Isabella. Even though the archduke had certain reservations about the order, the Jesuits received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. Other champions of the Catholic Reformation, such as the Capuchins, were also given considerable sums. The foundation of the first convents of Discalced Carmelites in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality.

The reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The States General of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces. The years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called Perpetual Edict (1611), for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the nobility, duels, gambling, etc.

Driven by strategic as well as religious motives, Albert intervened in the squabbles over the inheritance of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. He played a major role in the war and the subsequent confrontation with the armies of the Dutch Republic led to the Treaty of Xanten. The episode was in many ways a rehearsal of what was to come in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. After the defenestration of Prague, Albert responded by sending troops to his cousin Ferdinand II and by pressing Philip III for financial support to the cause of the Austrian Habsburgs. As such he contributed considerably to the victory of the Habsburg and Bavarian forces in the Battle of the White Mountain on 8 November 1620.

==Death and succession==
Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607 and 1609. As the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring. When Albert&#x27;s health suffered a serious breakdown in the winter of 1613–1614, steps were taken to ensure the accession of Philip III of Spain in accordance to the Act of Cession. As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the king as heir of the archduke and archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617. Philip III however predeceased his uncle on 31 March 1621. The right to succeed the couple thereupon passed to his heir, King Philip IV.

Albert&#x27;s health again deteriorated markedly in the closing months of 1620. As the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce would expire the next April, he devoted his last energies to securing its renewal. In order to reach this goal he was prepared to make far reaching concessions. Much to his frustration, neither the Spanish Monarchy, nor the Dutch Republic took his pleas for peace seriously. His death on 13 July 1621 therefore more or less coincided with the resumption of hostilities.

==Artistic patronage==
Virtually nothing remains of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia&#x27; Palace of Coudenberg in Brussels, their summer retreat in Mariemont or their hunting lodge in Tervuren. Their once magnificent collections were scattered after 1633 and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes Albert and Isabella enjoy a well merited reputation as patrons of the arts. They are probably best remembered for the appointment of Peter Paul Rubens as their court painter in 1609. They likewise gave commissions to outstanding painters such as Frans Pourbus the Younger, Otto van Veen and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Less well known painters such as Hendrik de Clerck, Theodoor van Loon and Denis van Alsloot were also called upon. Mention should furthermore be made of architects such as Wenzel Cobergher and Jacob Franquart, as well as of the sculptors de Nole. By far the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at Scherpenheuvel where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, the painter Theodoor van Loon and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city.

<text>Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 189417 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine&#x27;s interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.

As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine &quot;The Sackbut&quot;. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent.

Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by suicide.

==Life==

===Early life===

====Childhood and family background====

Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the Savoy Hotel, London, which his parents were using at the time as their town residence. The family was wealthy, with strong artistic connections and some background in classical scholarship. Philip&#x27;s parents were Arnold Heseltine, a solicitor in the family firm, and Bessie Mary Edith, née Covernton. She was the daughter of a country doctor from the Welsh border town of Knighton and was Arnold&#x27;s second wife. Soon after Philip&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Chelsea where he attended a nearby kindergarten and received his first piano lessons.

In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45. Six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones&#x27;s estate, Cefn Bryntalch, Llandyssil, near Montgomery, although the London house was retained. The youthful Philip was proud of his Welsh heritage and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases.

In 1903 Heseltine entered Stone House Preparatory School in Broadstairs, where he showed precocious academic ability and won several prizes. In January 1908, at a concert in the Royal Albert Hall, he heard a performance of &quot;Lebenstanz&quot;, composed by Frederick Delius. The work made little impression on him until he discovered that his uncle, Arthur Joseph Heseltine (known as &quot;Joe&quot;), an artist, lived close to Delius&#x27;s home in Grez-sur-Loing in France. Philip then used the connection to obtain the composer&#x27;s autograph for Stone House&#x27;s music teacher, W. E. Brockway.

====Eton: first meeting with Delius====

Heseltine left Stone House in the summer of 1908 and began at Eton College that autumn. His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton, &quot;with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel&quot;. He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life, such as the Officers&#x27; Training Corps, the suggestive homosexuality, and endemic bullying. He found relief in music and, perhaps because of the connection with his uncle, formed an interest in Delius that developed into a near-obsession. He also found a kindred spirit in an Eton music teacher and Delius advocate, the cellist Edward Mason, from whom Heseltine borrowed a copy of the score of &quot;Sea Drift&quot;. He thought it &quot;heavenly&quot;, and was soon requesting funds from his mother to purchase more of Delius&#x27;s music. According to Cecil Gray, Heseltine&#x27;s first biographer, &quot;[Heseltine] did not rest until he had procured every work of Delius which was then accessible&quot;.

In June 1911 Heseltine learned that Thomas Beecham was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the composer would be present, and his &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot; would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine was introduced to the composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: &quot;I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music&quot;. He told his mother that &quot;Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it&quot;. Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine&#x27;s compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine&#x27;s life.

===Cologne, Oxford and London===
By the summer of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted him to go to university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in &quot;Railway and Travel Monthly&quot; on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.
In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and engaged a tutor to prepare for his university entrance examinations. He spent time with Delius at that summer&#x27;s Birmingham Festival, and published his first music criticism, an article on Arnold Schoenberg that appeared in the &quot;Musical Standard&quot; in September 1912. Despite his mother&#x27;s wishes and his lack of formal musical training, he hoped to make a career in music. He consulted Delius, who advised him that, if his mind was set, he should follow his instincts and pursue this objective in the face of all other considerations. Beecham, who knew both men, later sharply criticised this advice, on the grounds of Heseltine&#x27;s immaturity and instability. &quot;Frederick should never have committed the psychological blunder of preaching the doctrine of relentless determination to someone incapable of receiving it&quot;. In the end Heseltine acceded to his mother&#x27;s wishes. After passing the necessary examinations, he was accepted to study classics at Christ Church, Oxford, and began there in October 1913.

A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine as &quot;probably about 22, but he appears to be years older ... 6 feet high, absolutely fit ... brilliant blue eyes ... and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God&quot;. Although he enjoyed social success, he soon became depressed and unhappy with Oxford life. In April 1914 he spent part of his Easter vacation with Delius at Grez, and worked with the composer on the scores of &quot;An Arabesque&quot; and &quot;Fennimore and Gerda&quot;, in the latter case providing an English version of the libretto. He did not return to Oxford after the 1914 summer vacation; with his mother&#x27;s reluctant consent he moved to Bloomsbury in London, and enrolled at University College London to study language, literature and philosophy. In his spare time he conducted a small amateur orchestra in Windsor, after admitting to Delius that he knew nothing of the art of conducting. However, his life as a student in London was brief; in February 1915, with the help of Lady Emerald Cunard (a mistress of Beecham) he secured a job as a music critic for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; at a salary of £100 per year. He promptly abandoned his university studies to begin this new career.

===Unsettled years===

====Music critic====
During Heseltine&#x27;s four months at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, he wrote about 30 notices, mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis. His first contribution, dated 9 February 1915, described a performance by Benno Moiseiwitsch of Delius&#x27;s Piano Concerto in C minor, as &quot;masterly&quot;, while Delius was hailed as &quot;the greatest composer England has produced for two centuries&quot;. The other work in the programme was &quot;the last great symphony that has been delivered to the world&quot;: the Symphony in D minor by Franck. He wrote for other publications; a 5000-word article, &quot;Some notes on Delius and his Music&quot;, appeared in the March 1915 issue of &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, in which Heseltine opined: &quot;There can be no superficial view of Delius&#x27;s music: either one feels it in the very depths of one&#x27;s being, or not at all&quot;. Only Beecham, Heseltine suggested, was capable of interpreting the music adequately. Heseltine&#x27;s last notice for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was dated 17 June; later that month he resigned, frustrated by the paper&#x27;s frequent cutting of his more critical opinions. Unemployed, he spent his days in the British Museum, studying and editing Elizabethan music.

====New friends and acquaintances====
Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham, with a party that included a young artist&#x27;s model named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as &quot;Puma&quot; because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair. During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle naked down nearby Crickley Hill. However, his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any clear sense of purpose. In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met D. H. Lawrence and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be &quot;the greatest literary genius of his generation&quot;, and enthusiastically fell in with the writer&#x27;s plans to found a Utopian colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them. Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled; when she revealed that she was pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child.

In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London, ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service. However, it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence; in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols, Heseltine described Lawrence as &quot;a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is&quot;. The social centre of Heseltine&#x27;s life now became the Café Royal in Regent Street, where among others he met Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a Battersea studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine, and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter&#x27;s English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham&#x27;s productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be &quot;no compromise with the mob&quot;. Beecham ridiculed the plan; he said it would &quot;be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life&quot;.

An event of considerable significance in Heseltine&#x27;s musical life, late in 1916, was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren. This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine, who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer&#x27;s music. In November 1916 Heseltine used the pseudonym &quot;Peter Warlock&quot; for the first time, in an article on Eugene Aynsley Goossens&#x27; chamber music for &quot;The Music Student&quot;.

Puma bore a son in July 1916, though there is confusion about the child&#x27;s exact identity. Most biographers assumed him to be Nigel Heseltine, the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992. However, in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother; he was, he says, the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl. Subsequently, he was given to foster-parents, then adopted by Heseltine&#x27;s mother. Parrott records that the son born to Puma was called Peter, and died in infancy. Smith, however, states that Puma&#x27;s baby was originally called Peter but was renamed Nigel &quot;for reasons which have not as yet been satisfactorily explained&quot;. Whatever the truth of the paternity, and in spite of their mutual misgivings, Heseltine and Puma were married at Chelsea Register Office on 22 December 1916.

====Ireland====

By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine&#x27;s military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.

In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was &quot;tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic&quot;. To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books &quot;full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination&quot;; these works included Eliphas Levi&#x27;s &quot;History of Transcendental Magic&quot;, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin&#x27;s cultural life. He met W. B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine&#x27;s obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine&#x27;s interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of Béla Bartók.

On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, &quot;What Music Is&quot;, at Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bartók, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine&#x27;s championing of Van Dieren&#x27;s music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter&#x27;s rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine&#x27;s own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered to be among his finest work.

====Journalism and &quot;The Sackbut&quot;====
When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as &quot;Peter Warlock&quot;. They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer Charles Wilfred Orr recalled Heseltine as &quot;a tall fair youth of about my own age&quot;, trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of Van Dieren&#x27;s piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine&#x27;s whistling abilities which he describes as &quot;flute-like in quality and purity&quot;.

For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism. In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association, &quot;The Modern Spirit in Music&quot;, that impressed E.J. Dent, the future Cambridge University music professor. However, much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome. He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism (&quot;the average newspaper critic of music ... is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician, or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting&quot;) which offended senior critics such as Ernest Newman. He wrote provocative articles in the &quot;Musical Times&quot;, and in July 1919 feuded with the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of Igor Stravinsky.

In a letter dated 17 July 1919, Delius advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing: &quot;I ... know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you&quot;. By this time Heseltine&#x27;s privately expressed opinions on Delius&#x27;s music were increasingly critical, although in public he continued to sing his former mentor&#x27;s praises. In &quot;The Musical Times&quot; he cited &quot;Fennimore and Gerda&quot;, Delius&#x27;s final opera, as &quot;one of the most successful experiments in a new direction that the operatic stage has yet seen&quot;.

Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine, which he intended to start as soon as he found appropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine &quot;The Organist and Choirmaster&quot;, with a new music journal, &quot;The Sackbut&quot;, and invited Heseltine to edit it. Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial. &quot;The Sackbut&quot; also organised concerts, presenting works by Van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others. However, Rogers withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled to run it himself for several months; in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor with Ursula Greville.

===Productive years in Wales===
With no regular income, in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to Cefn Bryntalch, which became his base for the next three years. He found the atmosphere there conducive to creative efforts; he told Gray that &quot;Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman&quot;. The Welsh years were marked by intense creative compositional and literary activity; some of Heseltine&#x27;s best-known music, including the song-cycles &quot;Lilligay&quot; and &quot;The Curlew&quot;, were completed along with numerous songs, choral settings, and a string serenade composed to honour Delius&#x27;s 60th birthday in 1922. Heseltine also edited and transcribed a large amount of early English music. His recognition as an emerging composer was marked by the selection of &quot;The Curlew&quot; as representing contemporary British music at the 1924 Salzburg Festival.

Heseltine&#x27;s major literary work of this period was a biography of Delius, the first full-length study of the composer, which remained the standard work for many years. On its 1952 reissue, the book was described by music publisher Hubert J. Foss as &quot;a work of art, a charming and penetrating study of a musical poet&#x27;s mind&quot;. Heseltine also worked with Gray on a study of the 16th-century Italian composer Carlo Gesualdo, although disputes between the two men delayed the book&#x27;s publication until 1926.

While visiting Budapest in April 1921, Heseltine befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist Béla Bartók. When Bartók visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert, he stayed for a few days at Cefn Bryntalch. Although Heseltine continued to promote Bartók&#x27;s music, there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit. Heseltine&#x27;s on-off friendship with Lawrence finally died, after a thinly disguised and unflattering depiction of Heseltine and Puma (&quot;Halliday&quot; and &quot;Pussum&quot;) appeared in &quot;Women in Love&quot;, published in 1922. Heseltine began legal proceedings for defamation, eventually settling out of court with the publishers, Secker and Warburg. Puma, meanwhile, had disappeared from Heseltine&#x27;s life. She returned from Ireland before he did, and had lived for a while with the young child Nigel at Cefn Bryntalch where the local gentry considered her &quot;not of the same order of society as we are&quot;. There was no resumption of married life, and she left Heseltine sometime in 1922.

In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer Ernest John Moeran on a tour of eastern England, in search of original folk music. Later that year he and Gray visited Delius at Grez. In June 1924 Heseltine left Cefn Bryntalch and lived briefly in a Chelsea flat, a stay marked by wild parties and considerable damage to the property. After spending Christmas 1924 in Majorca he leased a cottage (formerly occupied by Foss) in the Kent village of Eynsford.

===Eynsford===

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, &quot;Maltworms&quot;. The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine&#x27;s long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general . Peache was described by Delius&#x27;s assistant Eric Fenby as &quot;a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil&#x27;s usual types&quot;. Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.

The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the &quot;Five Bells&quot; public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the &quot;Capriol Suite&quot; in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne&#x27;s entry in &quot;The History of Music in England&quot;. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, &quot;The English Ayre&quot;.

In January 1927, Heseltine&#x27;s string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, His Master&#x27;s Voice recorded the ballad &quot;Captain Stratton&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine&#x27;s music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem &quot;Bethlehem Down&quot;, which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.

===Final years===
By November 1928, Heseltine had tired of Cefn Bryntalch, and returned to London. He sought concert reviewing and cataloguing assignments without much success; his main creative activity was the editing, under the pseudonym &quot;Rab Noolas&quot; (&quot;Saloon Bar&quot; backwards), of &quot;Merry-Go-Down&quot;, an anthology in praise of drinking. The book, published by The Mandrake Press, was copiously illustrated by Hal Collins.

Early in 1929 Heseltine received two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored his sense of purpose. Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927; he now invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal. Beecham also asked Heseltine to help organise a festival to honour Delius, which the conductor was planning for October 1929. Although Heseltine&#x27;s enthusiasm for Delius&#x27;s music had diminished, he accepted the assignment, and travelled to Grez in search of forgotten compositions that could be resurrected for the festival. He declared that he was delighted to discover &quot;Cynara&quot;, for voice and orchestra, abandoned since 1907. For the festival, Heseltine prepared many of the programme notes for individual concerts and supplied a concise biography of the composer. According to Delius&#x27;s wife Jelka: &quot;Next to Beecham, he [Heseltine] really was the soul of the thing&quot;.

At a Promenade Concert in August 1929, Heseltine conducted a performance of the &quot;Capriol Suite&quot;, the single public conducting engagement of his life. In an effort to reproduce their success with &quot;Bethlehem Down&quot;, he and Blunt proffered a new carol for Christmas 1929, &quot;The Frostbound Wood&quot;. Although the work was technically accomplished, it failed to achieve the popularity of its predecessor. Heseltine edited three issues of the ILO journal, but in January 1930, Beecham announced the closure of the venture, and Heseltine was out of work again. His attempt on behalf of Van Dieren to raise financing to mount a performance of the latter&#x27;s opera &quot;The Tailor&quot; also failed.

The final summer of Heseltine&#x27;s life was marked by gloom, depression, and inactivity; ApIvor refers to Heseltine&#x27;s sense of &quot;crimes against the spirit&quot;, and an obsession with imminent death. In July 1930 a fortnight spent with Blunt in Hampshire brought a brief creative revival; Heseltine composed &quot;The Fox&quot; to Blunt&#x27;s lyrics, and on his return to London he wrote &quot;The Fairest May&quot; for voice and string quartet. These were his final original compositions.

===Death===

In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of &quot;Bethlehem Down&quot; with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.

An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine&#x27;s close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine&#x27;s 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.

Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.

In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine&#x27;s illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer&#x27;s death. Sewell&#x27;s mother, private secretary Mary Jessica Perkins (who subsequently married Robert Sewell in 1936), a Camden publican&#x27;s daughter, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic who refused Heseltine&#x27;s offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father&#x27;s identity until 1986.

===Legacy===
Heseltine&#x27;s surviving body of work includes about 150 songs, mostly for solo voice and piano. He also wrote choral pieces, some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, and a few purely instrumental works. Among lost or destroyed works the musicologist Ian Copley lists two stage pieces: sketches for the abandoned opera &quot;Liadain and Curither&quot;, and the draft of a mime-drama &quot;Twilight&quot; (1926) which Heseltine destroyed on the advice of Delius. Music historian Stephen Banfield described the songs as &quot;polished gems of English art song forming a pinnacle of that genre&#x27;s brilliant brief revival in the early 20th century ... [works of] intensity, consistency and unfailing excellence&quot;. According to Delius&#x27;s biographer Christopher Palmer, Heseltine influenced the work of fellow-composers Moeran and Orr, and to a lesser extent Lambert and Walton, primarily by bringing them within the Delius orbit. In the case of the latter pair, Palmer argues, &quot;those reminiscences of Delius which crop up from time to time in [their] music ... are more probably Delius filtered through Warlock&quot;.

Heseltine biographer Brian Collins considers the composer a prime mover in the 20th-century renaissance of early English music; apart from much writing on the subject, he made well over 500 transcriptions of early works. He also wrote or contributed to ten books, and wrote dozens of general music articles and reviews. Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: &quot;In the memory of his friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last of us are dead&quot;. During his Eynsford years, Heseltine had provided his own epitaph:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Here lies Warlock the composer
 Who lived next door to Munn the grocer.
 He died of drink and copulation,
 A sad discredit to the nation.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Music==
===Influences===
In the early 20th century the German-influenced 19th-century song-writing traditions generally followed by Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Edward Elgar and Roger Quilter, were in a process of eclipse. For composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth, English folk-song became a dominant feature of their work; at the same time, songwriters were seeking to extend their art by moving beyond the piano to develop richer forms of vocal accompaniment. Thus, as Copley observes, at the outset of his career as a composer Heseltine found in song-writing a dynamic ambience, &quot;within which he could express himself, or against which he could react&quot;.

By the time Heseltine began composing seriously, around 1915–16, he had started to shake off the overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study Elizabethan and Jacobean music. In 1916 he came under the spell of Van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the &quot;Saudades&quot; song cycle of 1916–17. Gray writes that from Van Dieren, Heseltine &quot;learned to purify and organise his harmonic texture ... and the thick, muddy chords which characterised the early songs gave place to clear and vigorous part-writing&quot;. &quot;In 1917–18 Heseltine&#x27;s passion for Celtic culture, stimulated by his stay in Ireland, brought a new element to his music, and in 1921 he discovered Bartók. A late passion was the music of John Dowland, the Elizabethan lutenist, one of whose dances he arranged for brass band. These constituent parts contributed to the individual style of Heseltine&#x27;s music. Gray summarised this style thus;

They [the differing elements] are fused together in a curiously personal way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the ultimate product, which is not Dowland &quot;plus&quot; Van Dieren or Elizabethan &quot;plus&quot; modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable—Peter Warlock. No one else could have written it.

Apart from those within his circle, Heseltine drew inspiration from other composers whose work he respected: Franz Liszt, Gabriel Fauré, and Claude Debussy. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow song-writer Hugo Wolf. Heseltine&#x27;s songs demonstrate moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel the idea of a split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory was rejected by the composer&#x27;s friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of &quot;Philip drunk or Philip sober&quot;.

===General character===
In a summary of the Warlock oeuvre, Copley asserts that Heseltine was a natural melodist in the Schubert mould: &quot;With very few exceptions his melodies will stand on their own ... they can be sung by themselves with no accompaniment, as complete and satisfying as folk-songs&quot;. Copley identifies certain characteristic motifs or &quot;fingerprints&quot;, which recur throughout the works and which are used to depict differences of mood and atmosphere: anguish, resignation but also warmth, tenderness and amorous dalliance. The music critic Ernest Bradbury comments that Heseltine&#x27;s songs &quot;serve both singer and poet, the one in their memorably tuneful vocal lines, the other in a scrupulous regard for correct accentuation free from any suggestion of pedantry&quot;.

In musical parlance Heseltine was a miniaturist, a title which he was happy to accept in disregard of the sometimes derogatory implications of the label: &quot;I have neither the impulse nor the ability to erect monuments before which a new generation will bow down&quot;. He was almost entirely self-taught, avoiding through his lack of a formal conservatory training the &quot;teutonic shadow&quot;—the influence of the German masters. To the charge that his technique was &quot;amateurish&quot;, he responded by arguing that a composer should express himself in his own terms, not by &quot;string[ing] together a number of tags and clichés culled from the work of others&quot;. His compositions were themselves part of a learning process; &quot;The Curlew&quot; song cycle originated in 1915 with the setting of a Yeats poem, but did not reach completion until 1922. Brian Collins characterises this work as &quot;a chronicle of [the composer&#x27;s] progress and development&quot;.

===Critical appraisal===
Heseltine&#x27;s music was generally well received by public and critics. The first Warlock compositions to attract critical attention were three of the Dublin songs which Rogers published in 1918. William Child in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; thought these &quot;first rate&quot;, and singled out &quot;As Ever I Saw&quot; as having particular distinction. In 1922, in the same magazine, the short song cycle &quot;Mr Belloc&#x27;s Fancy&quot; was likewise praised, especially &quot;Warlock&#x27;s rattling good tunes and appropriately full-blooded accompaniment&quot;. Ralph Vaughan Williams was delighted with the reception accorded to the &quot;Three Carols&quot;, when he conducted the Bach Choir at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in December 1923. Early in 1925 the BBC broadcast a performance of the Serenade for string orchestra written to honour Delius, a sign, says Smith, that the music establishment was beginning to take Warlock seriously. Heseltine himself noted the warmth of the Prom audience&#x27;s reaction to his conducting of the &quot;Capriol Suite&quot; in 1929: &quot;I was recalled four times&quot;.

After Heseltine&#x27;s death, assessments of his musical stature were generous. Newman considered some of Heseltine&#x27;s choral compositions &quot;among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman.&quot; Constant Lambert hailed him as &quot;one of the greatest song-writers that music has ever known&quot;, a view echoed by Copley. In a tribute published in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, Van Dieren referred to Heseltine&#x27;s music as &quot;a national treasure&quot; that would long survive all that was currently being said or written about it. In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance in the inter-war years became obscured. However, when the Peter Warlock Society was created in 1963, interest in his music began to increase. Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, &quot;frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative to the point of being revolutionary&quot;.

<text>The Spirit of Butts&#x27; Farm (also known as TAM 5) was the first model aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean on August 11, 2003. The aircraft was launched from Cape Spear () near St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, and landed at Mannin Beach () near Clifden, Ireland 38.9 hours later. It was recognized by the FAI as a double world record flight for its duration of 38h 52 min 19 sec and straight-line distance of using an autopilot, and using the Argos System for telemetry to track the flight&#x27;s progress; the team&#x27;s use of technology also spurred the FAI to create new record categories. The aircraft was controlled by autopilot for &gt;99% of the flight in a manner similar to that used by the Insitu Aerosonde UAV &quot;Laima&quot; that crossed the Atlantic in 1998. The flight used 99.2% of its fuel and left only (or 44 minutes of flight time) remaining when it reached its destination.

The aircraft was built by a team led by Maynard Hill, a retired metallurgist. Hill had previously set 25 model airplane records and was inducted into the Model Aviation Hall of Fame in 1977. &quot;The Spirit of Butts&#x27; Farm&quot; was the 25th of 28 airframes the team had built in the attempt to cross the Atlantic; the five best models were selected for actual transatlantic flight attempts. The 25th airframe was the fifth selected for the record attempt and was redesignated TAM-5. Later, describing his reaction to learning that the flight had been successful, Hill said, &quot;I just grabbed my wife, hugged her and cried like a baby.&quot;

The aircraft was named after R. Beecher Butts, an aviation enthusiast who allowed the use of his farm for testing of the aircraft. The name echoes that of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, the aircraft used by Charles Lindbergh in his transatlantic flight. The aircraft is on display at the National Model Aviation Museum. A backup plane for the transatlantic effort is in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum.

An article on the flight can be found in the October 2003 edition of Model Aviation Canada magazine.

The Society for Technical Aeromodel Research (S.T.A.R.) was organized to help support the costs of the project.

<text>Existenz (stylized as eXistenZ) is a 1999 science fiction horror film written, produced and directed by David Cronenberg. The film follows Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a game designer who finds herself targeted by assassins while playing a virtual reality game of her own creation. An international co-production between Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, it also stars Jude Law, Ian Holm, Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccleston, Willem Dafoe, and Robert A. Silverman.

The film received mostly positive reviews upon release. Cronenberg was awarded a Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival for the film.

== Plot ==
In the year 2030, ultra-sustainable biotechnological devices have replaced unsustainable electronic ones. Game pods present &quot;UmbiCords&quot; that attach to &quot;bio-ports&quot;, connectors surgically inserted into players&#x27; spines. Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of fanatics called Realists fight both companies, decrying the &quot;deforming&quot; of reality by virtual reality games.

World renowned game designer Allegra Geller demonstrates Antenna Research&#x27;s latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, to a focus group. The demonstration is disrupted by a Realist named Noel Dichter, who shoots Allegra with an organic pistol he smuggled past security. As Dichter is gunned down, security guard and publicist Ted Pikul escorts Geller outside.

Geller discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of eXistenZ, may have been damaged. Pikul reluctantly agrees to have a bio-port installed in his spine so they can jointly test the game&#x27;s integrity. Allegra takes him to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas, who deliberately installs a faulty bio-port into Pikul&#x27;s spine. He reveals his intention to kill Geller for the bounty on her head, but Pikul kills Gas. The two lie low at a former ski lodge used by Geller&#x27;s mentor Kiri Vinokur, who repairs the damaged pod and gives Pikul a new bio-port.

Testing the game, Geller and Pikul meet D&#x27;Arcy Nader, who provides them with new &quot;micro pods,&quot; enabling them to enter a deeper layer of virtual reality. In the new layer they assume new identities as workers Larry Ashen and Barb Bricken in a game pod factory. Another worker in the factory, Yevgeny Nourish, claims to be their Realist contact. At a Chinese restaurant near the factory, Nourish recommends that they order &quot;the special&quot; for lunch. Pikul eats the unappetizing special, and constructs a pistol from the inedible parts. He impulsively threatens Geller, then shoots the Chinese waiter. When the pair return to the game store, Hugo Carlaw informs them that Nourish is actually a double agent for Cortical Systematics, and the waiter Pikul murdered was the actual contact.

At the factory, they find a diseased pod. Geller connects it to her bio-port, planning to infect the other pods and sabotage the factory. When Geller quickly becomes ill, Pikul cuts the UmbiCord, but she begins to bleed to death. Nourish appears with a flamethrower and blasts the diseased pod, which bursts into deadly spores.

Geller and Pikul awaken back at the ski lodge, where they discover Geller&#x27;s game pod is also diseased. Geller surmises that Vinokur must have infected Pikul&#x27;s new bio-port to destroy her game, and she inserts a disinfecting device into Pikul&#x27;s bioport. Unexpectedly, Carlaw reappears as a Realist resistance fighter and escorts Geller and Pikul outside to witness the death of eXistenZ. Before Carlaw can kill Geller, Vinokur, who is a double agent for Cortical Systematics, shoots Carlaw in the back and informs Geller that he copied her game data while fixing her pod; she then vengefully kills Vinokur. Pikul then reveals that he himself is a Realist sent to kill her. Geller, having figured out his intentions since he pointed the gun at her in the Chinese restaurant, detonates the disinfecting device in his bioport, killing him.

Suddenly, Pikul and Geller are seated in chairs in a small abandoned church, seeing rows of pews as they come to, together with all of the other members of the cast, all wearing blue electronic virtual reality devices. That whole story was all part of Nourish&#x27;s new virtual reality game called transCendenZ, which receives praises and admiration from the test group.

Nourish tells his assistant Merle that he feels uneasy, as the heavy anti-game plot elements may have originated from one of the testers&#x27;s thoughts. Pikul and Geller approach Nourish and accuse him of distorting reality, before fatally shooting him and Merle. As Pikul and Geller leave, they aim their guns at the person who played the Chinese waiter, who first pleads for his life, then asks if they are still in the game. Pikul and Geller stand together silently, not answering.

== Cast ==
==Production==

The film&#x27;s plot came about after Cronenberg conducted an interview with Salman Rushdie for &quot;Shift&quot; magazine in 1995. At the time, Rushdie was in hiding due to a fatwa having been put on his life, due to his controversial book &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Rushdie&#x27;s dilemma gave Cronenberg an idea of &quot;a Fatwa [sic] against a virtual-reality game designer&quot;. &quot;Existenz&quot; was originally pitched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but they did not green-light the film due to its complex structure.

This was Cronenberg&#x27;s first original script since &quot;Videodrome&quot;.

==Novelizations==
* Christopher Priest wrote the tie-in novel to accompany the film &quot;eXistenZ&quot;, the theme of which has much in common with some of Priest&#x27;s other novels.
* In 1999, a graphic novel credited to David Cronenberg and Sean Scoffield was published.

== Reception ==

The film received generally positive reviews, with a 76% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Gooey, slimy, grotesque fun.&quot; Metacritic assigned a score of 68 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four in his review of the film, noting its release after fellow science-fiction film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He compared the two films, stating that while both have special effects, Cronenberg&#x27;s film was stranger along with having his best effects involve &quot;gooey, indescribable organic things&quot;.

Conversely, James Berardinelli gave the film a two out of four star rating in his review. He cites that the film had a &quot;disjointed feel&quot;, and called it a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; that suffered from being released near &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, which he states did similar things that were accomplished better in those films.

===Box office===
The film grossed $2.9 million in Canada and the United States and $2.6 million in the United Kingdom.

His father later became, according to Law, . He is of Welsh descent through his maternal grandmother, who had originally been &quot;long lost&quot; from his family because Law&#x27;s mother had been put up for adoption as a child. Law was given the first name David after the best friend of his father, but has always been referred to by his middle name, Jude, which was taken both from the protagonist of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1987–1999: Early work and breakthrough ===
Law began acting in 1987 with the National Youth Music Theatre, though his interest in performing began during his childhood, having been previously cast in a Saint George and the Dragon rendition as a five-year-old. Having grown a dislike for school, Law dropped out at age 17 to pursue acting, playing various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play &quot;The Ragged Child&quot;. One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley&#x27;s &quot;The Fastest Clock in the Universe&quot;, which he performed at the Hampstead Theatre in London. Law went on to appear as Michael in the 1994 West End rendition of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot;, directed by Sean Mathias. This performance earned him a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Outstanding Newcomer, as well as a Ian Charleson Award under the same category title. Following a title change to &quot;Indiscretions&quot;, the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon. This role earned him a Tony Award nomination for best supporting actor, and the Theatre World Award.

In 1989, Law received his first television role in a film based on the Beatrix Potter children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot;. Following this, he took on minor roles in various British television series, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV produced ITV soap opera &quot;Families&quot;. He also appeared in the episode &quot;Shoscombe Old Place&quot; in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and he played the leading role in the BFI/Channel 4 short &quot;The Crane&quot; (1992).

In 1994, Law appeared in his first major leading film role with the British crime drama &quot;Shopping&quot;, which also starred his then future wife, Sadie Frost. He later gained prominence for his role in the Oscar Wilde biopic &quot;Wilde&quot; (1997), for which he won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer as well as a London Film Critics Circle Award for his portrayal of Lord Alfred Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry&#x27;s Wilde. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Janet Maslin noted that Law&#x27;s Other reviewers including William Gallagher also complimented Law&#x27;s appearance as the character.

In Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; (1997), he played the role of Billy Hanson, a male prostitute killed by his partner, an art dealer portrayed by Kevin Spacey. Law also played Steven Grlscz, a vampire and an expert seducer, in &quot;The Wisdom of Crocodiles&quot; (1998).

In 1999, Law starred alongside Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the psychological thriller film &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, directed by Anthony Minghella. Law learned to play the saxophone for his role in the film, and his performance earned him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw commented on Law giving

Instead of promoting a film, this &quot;trailer&quot;, which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie by Polish artist Paweł Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this unfilmed reenactment, in real time, of the sequence of events shown in &quot;Realtime Movie Trailer&quot; by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish labourer, held on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its &quot;The World as a Stage&quot; exhibition, which explored the boundaries between arts and reality.

=== Music ===

== Personal life ==
In 2010, Law purchased a property in Highgate, London, moving from Primrose Hill with his then-partner Sienna Miller. His residence was at The Grove, a street known for its notable residents. Throughout the 2000s, an about Law&#x27;s life had been in the possession of the media, prompting his involvement in the News International phone hacking scandal. Additionally, a family member of his was alleged to have been paid by &quot;News of the World&quot; to share information with them.

=== Family and relationships ===
Law is the younger brother of Natasha Law, an illustrator and artist based in London. His parents live in Vaudelnay, France, where they run their own drama school and theatre.

On 2 September 1997, Law married actress Sadie Frost, whom he had met in 1992 on the set of &quot;Shopping&quot;. They have three children, including Raff and Iris. On 29 October 2003, the couple divorced. While filming &quot;Alfie&quot; (2004) in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship; they became engaged in 2004.

<text>The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (, ), abbreviated INSEE or Insee ( , ), is the national statistics bureau of France. It collects and publishes information about the French economy and people and carries out the periodic national census. Headquartered in Montrouge, a commune in the southern Parisian suburbs, it is the French branch of Eurostat. The INSEE was created in 1946 as a successor to the Vichy regime&#x27;s National Statistics Service (SNS). It works in close cooperation with the Institut national d&#x27;études démographiques (INED).

== Purpose ==
The INSEE is responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France. Its best known responsibilities include:

* Organising and publishing the national census.
* Producing various indices – which are widely recognised as being of excellent quality – including an inflation index used for determining the rates of rents and the costs associated with construction.
* Eurostat uses INSEE statistics in combination with those of other national statistical agencies to compile comparable statistics for the European Union as a whole. It is also widely recognized as representing France on international questions of statistics.

== Organisation ==
The INSEE is the responsibility of MINEFI, the French Ministry of Finance. The current director is Jean-Luc Tavernier. However, Eurostat considers INSEE as an independent body, although its independence is not written in the law.

=== Teaching and research ===
Research and teaching for the INSEE is undertaken by GENES or Group of the National Schools of the Economy and Statistics (French: &quot;Groupe des Écoles Nationales d&#x27;Économie et Statistique&quot;) which includes:

* ENSAE (&quot;École nationale de la statistique et de l&#x27;administration économique&quot;), a &quot;grande école&quot; which trains INSEE administrators and engineers specialized in statistics, the economy, and finance. 
* ENSAI, (&quot;École nationale de la statistique et de l&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;information&quot;), an engineering school.

== Codes and numbering system ==

INSEE gives numerical indexing codes (French: &quot;les Codes INSEE&quot;) to various entities in France:

* INSEE codes (known as COG) are given to various administrative units, notably the French communes (they do not coincide with postcodes). The &#x27;complete&#x27; code has 8 digits and 3 spaces within, but there is a popular &#x27;simplified&#x27; code with 5 digits and no space within:
** 2 digits (&quot;département&quot;) and 3 digits (commune) for the 96 &quot;départements&quot; of Metropolitan France. 
** 3 digits (&quot;département&quot; or collectivity) and 2 digits (commune) for the Overseas departments, Overseas Territorial Collectivities and Overseas Countries and Territories. 
* INSEE numbers (13 digits + a two-digit key) are national identification numbers given to people. The format is as follows: &quot;syymmlllllooo kk&quot;, where
** &quot;s&quot; is 1 for a male, 2 for a female for a permanent number; it is 7 for a male, 8 for a female for a temporary number,
** &quot;yy&quot; are the last two digits of the year of birth,
** &quot;mm&quot; is the month of birth or a number above 20 if the birthdate is unknown
** &quot;lllll&quot; is the COG for the location of birth,
** &quot;ooo&quot; is an order number to distinguish people being born at the same place in the same year and month.
** &#x27;kk&#x27; is the &quot;control key&quot;, equal to 97-(the rest of the number modulo 97).&lt;br&gt;There are exceptions for people in particular situations.
* SIREN codes are given to businesses and nonprofit associations, SIRET codes to their establishments and facilities.

== History ==
=== Statistics in France before the INSEE ===
The INSEE was preceded by several related statistical agencies in France. In 1833, the Statistics Bureau (French: &quot;Bureau de la statistique&quot;) was created by Adolphe Thiers. In 1840 it was renamed &quot;SGF&quot; or &quot;General Statistics of France&quot;.

Under the direction of Lucien March, the SGF expanded its activities. It began an investigation of consumption habits in 1907, following with periodic investigations on retail prices in 1911.

In 1920 Alfred Sauvy introduced competitive entrance exams for SGF recruitment. However, it was René Carmille, a pioneer of the use of the calculators, who laid the foundations of the modern organization. In 1940, the Demographic Service (&quot;Service de la démographie&quot;) was created under the Ministry of Finance in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the June 1940 Armistice with Nazi Germany. In order to better conceal its undertakings, the Demographic Service absorbed the SGF on 11 October 1941. The new organization was called the &quot;SNS&quot; or &quot;National Statistics Service&quot;. As part of this reorganization, six new offices were created in the Northern (occupied) zone whose regional structure is maintained today in INSEE.

René Carmille created an Applied Sciences School (predecessor of the current ENSAE) to specially train members for the SNS.

Carmille worked for Vichy France but he was actually a double agent for the French underground. From his position in the SNS he sabotaged the Nazi census of France, which saved untold numbers of Jewish people from death camps. He also used his department to help mobilize French resistance in Algeria. He was caught by the Nazis and sent to Dachau where he died in 1945.

=== Creation of the INSEE ===
The SNS was finally transformed into the INSEE by the law of 27 April 1946, The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Surveys for the metropolis and overseas France (&quot;L&#x27;Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques pour la métropole et la France d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;).

=== IRIS ===
IRIS is the name for France&#x27;s unit of division of geographical regions for the purposes of taking a census. In order to prepare for the dissemination of the 1999 French population census, INSEE developed a system for dividing the country into units of equal size, known as IRIS2000, now known simply as &#x27;IRIS&#x27;. The acronym stands for &#x27;Ilots Regroupés pour l&#x27;Information Statistique&#x27; (&#x27;aggregated units for statistical information&#x27;) and the 2000 in the name referred not only to the upcoming millennium year but to the target size of 2,000 residents per basic unit. Since 1999, IRIS has represented the fundamental unit for dissemination of infra-municipal data in France and its overseas departments and regions. Towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and a large proportion of towns with between 5,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, are divided into several IRIS units. France is composed of around 16,100 IRIS in total, of which 650 are in the overseas departments. There are 3 types of IRIS unit in use; residential IRIS (pop. between 1,800 and 5,000), business IRIS (containing more than 1,000 employees) and miscellaneous IRIS (specific large zones which are sparsely inhabited and have large surface areas (leisure parks, ports, forests etc.).

=== List of directors ===
The following is a list of directors of the INSEE since it was founded:

*1946–1961: Francis-Louis Closon
*1961–1967: 
*1967–1974: 
*1974–1987: Edmond Malinvaud 
*1987–1992: Jean-Claude Milleron 
*1992–2003: 
*2003–2007: Jean-Michel Charpin 
*2007–2012: 
*2012–present:

<text>Verín is a town and municipality in the southeast of the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. The population of the municipality is about 14,433. It is located 70 kilometers east of the provincial capital of Ourense and 15 kilometers north of the Portuguese city of Chaves. The Tâmega River flows through the town. In the Middle Ages it was known as Santa María de Verín.

The town is linked with Madrid and Ourense by the four-lane A-52 (Autovia das Rias Baixas) and by the N-525. The main railway line linking Ourense to Madrid passes through mountains north of the town, but the nearest station is at La Gudiña, 31 km to the east.

Verín is a town of services with declining agricultural activity. There is a denominated wine region—Monterrei—located in the surrounding area. There are also three mineral water bottling plants in the town: Cabreiroá, Fontenova and Sousas.

Carnival here is one of the most original in Spain with the Cigarrón, masked figures running through the streets brandishing whips and making an interesting sound caused by cow bells tied to their waists (See &quot;zanpantzar&quot; for a similar tradition in the Pyrenees). Everything has a medieval air, with little influence from the Brazilian-style carnival, which has become popular in other Spanish and Portuguese cities.

Verín major tourist site is actually in the neighboring Monterrei, which is the Castle of Monterrei, a huge complex looming over the rather non-descript urban area. To reach the castle you drive about two kilometers in the direction of Ourense on the old highway, turning off on the right to climb two kilometers, passing a winery on the left. There is a parador next to the castle.

The Castle of Monterrei played an important role throughout the Portuguese-Spanish wars, having been strategically built on the frontier for the purpose. It was more than a castle since included within the perimeter were a monastery, a hospital and a small town which was abandoned in the 19th century. The castle itself is more impressive from afar than at closer look, but the view from the heights is worth the drive up. At night it is lit up and you can see it for miles on clear nights, even from the hills of Chaves in neighboring Portugal.

<doc id="296265" wikidata="Q12946" url="?curid=296265" title="Michel Rocard">
<text>Michel Rocard (; 23 August 1930 – 2 July 2016) was a French politician and a member of the Socialist Party (PS). He served as Prime Minister under François Mitterrand from 1988 to 1991 during which he created the &quot;Revenu minimum d&#x27;insertion&quot; (RMI), a social minimum welfare program for indigents, and achieved the Matignon Accords regarding the status of New Caledonia. He was a member of the European Parliament, and was strongly involved in European policies until 2009. In 2007, he joined a Commission under the authority of Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s Minister of Education, Xavier Darcos.

==Early life and education==
Rocard was born in Courbevoie, Hauts-de-Seine, to a Protestant family. The son of nuclear physicist Yves Rocard, he entered politics as a student leader while he was studying at Sciences Po. He became chair of the &quot;French Socialist Students&quot; affiliated to the main French Socialist party at the time, the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), and studied at the École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA), after which he chose to enter the prestigious Inspection des finances. As an anti-colonialist, he went to Algeria and wrote a report regarding the widely-ignored refugee camps of the Algerian War (1954–1962). The report was leaked to the newspapers &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;France Observateur&quot; in April 1959, which almost cost Rocard his position.
Michel Rocard was a certified glider pilot.

==Unified Socialist Party==
Having left the SFIO because of Guy Mollet&#x27;s position towards the Algerian War, Rocard led the dissident Unified Socialist Party (PSU) from 1967 to 1974. He was a prominent figure during the May 1968 crisis, supporting the auto-gestionary project. He ran in the 1969 presidential election but obtained only 3.6% of the vote. Some months later, he was elected deputy for the Yvelines &quot;département&quot;, defeating the former Prime minister Maurice Couve de Murville. He lost his parliamentary seat in 1973, but retook it in 1978.

In 1973–74, he participated in the LIP conflict, selling watches with the workers and participating, behind the scenes, in the attempts to find an employer who would take back the factory, which was on the verge of being liquidated.

==Socialist Party==
In 1974, he joined François Mitterrand and the renewed Socialist Party (PS), which had replaced the old SFIO. Most of the PSU members and a part of the French and Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) trade union – the non-Marxist section of the left that Rocard famously defined as the &quot;Second Left&quot; – followed him.
Elected mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in 1977, he led the opposition to Mitterrand inside the Socialist Party (as a candidate of the right wing of the party). After the defeat of the left at the 1978 legislative election, he tried to take over the leadership of the party. In spite of his alliance with Pierre Mauroy, the number 2 of the PS, he lost at the Metz Congress (1979). As the Socialist Party&#x27;s most popular politician at the time (including Mitterrand himself), he announced that he would run for president; but his &quot;Call of Conflans&quot; did not result in majority support within the PS, and he withdrew his candidacy. Mitterrand was the successful Socialist candidate in the 1981 presidential election.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, Rocard&#x27;s group inside the Socialist Party, known as &quot;&quot;les rocardiens&quot;, advocated a re-alignment of French socialism through a clearer acceptance of the market economy, more decentralisation and less state control. It was largely influenced by Scandinavian social democracy, and stood in opposition to Mitterrand&#x27;s initial agenda of nationalization, programmed in the &quot;110 Propositions for France&quot;. Nonetheless, the &quot;rocardiens&quot;&quot; always remained a minority.

===In government===
Under Mitterrand&#x27;s first presidency, he was Minister of Territorial Development and Minister of Planning from 1981 to 1983 and Minister of Agriculture from 1983 to 1985. He resigned from the cabinet in due to his opposition to the introduction of the proportional system for the legislative elections. He hoped, in vain, that Mitterrand would not run for re-election so he could be the PS candidate in the 1988 presidential election.

After Mitterrand&#x27;s re-election, he was chosen as Prime Minister (May 1988 – May 1991). Indeed, Rocard was popular and his position, on the right wing of the PS, corresponded with the slogan of the electoral campaign, &quot;a United France.&quot; He formed a cabinet including 4 center-right ministers. As Prime Minister, he led the Matignon Accords regarding the status of New Caledonia, which ended the troubles in this overseas territory. His record in office also include a decrease in unemployment and a large-scale reform of the welfare state&#x27;s financing system. He created a minimum social assistance scheme, the RMI, which helped to alleviate poverty.

===Party leadership===
Rocard&#x27;s poor relations with Mitterrand, notably during his mandate as Prime Minister, were notorious. In addition, the Socialists only held a small parliamentary majority. In 1991, when his popularity decreased, President Mitterrand forced him to resign. However, according to Mauroy, who led the party, Rocard stood as the &quot;natural candidate&quot; for the following presidential elections. After the 1993 electoral disaster, he became leader of the PS by advocating a political &quot;big-bang&quot;, that was to say a questioning of the left/right divide. His speech did not have the desired effect.

Rocard remained as leader of the Socialist Party for only one year, in part because of the PS&#x27;s complete defeat during the 1994 European elections. The defeat was in part due to the success of the list of the Left Radicals Movement, which was covertly supported by President Mitterrand. Consequently, he was toppled by the left-wing of the party and lost his last chance to run for president the next year. Having lost his deputy&#x27;s seat in 1993, he became Senator of Yvelines from 1995 to 1997. His supporters within the Socialist Party became allies of candidate Lionel Jospin, who was Prime Minister in 1997–2002, and then Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

===Member of European Parliament===
Rocard was a member of the European Parliament (1994–2009), and chaired the Committee on Development and Cooperation (1997–1999), the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (1999–2002) and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Michel Rocard was known for his hostility for proposed directives to allow software patents in Europe, and has been an outspoken opponent of what he considers to be manoeuvres to force the decision on this issue.

On the French political scene, Rocard presented himself as the political heir of Pierre Mendès-France, known for his moral rigour, and as the politician who &quot;speaks the truth&quot;. After Mitterrand&#x27;s death, he caused controversy when he said, about the former president, &quot;he was not an honest man&quot;. An impersonator mocked him for his problems of elocution. In the run up to the presidential elections in 2007, Rocard called for an alliance between the Socialists and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) party of François Bayrou in an effort to defeat Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) candidate Nicolas Sarkozy. Ségolène Royal, the PS candidate, rejected any such compromise, lamenting that she was once again obliged to face obstacles from within her own party. Rocard also publicly admitted, after the election, having asked Ségolène Royal to step down in his favor in March 2007, one month before the first round of voting.

Like other Socialist politicians, such as Jack Lang or Hubert Védrine, who accepted similar positions, Rocard accepted a post on the Committee on the re-evaluation of the teaching profession, which was placed under the &quot;high authority&quot; of Sarkozy&#x27;s Minister of Education Xavier Darcos. Criticized by Medhi Ouraoui, national delegate of the PS, Rocard claimed it was a &quot;democrat&#x27;s duty&quot; to participate in such Commissions and that he was &quot;not concerned&quot; by the &quot;game of the President of the Republic [consisting of making of such left-wing participations] political symbols&quot;. He furthermore explained that he had accepted to speak before the Gracques&#x27; spring university (a group of senior left-wing civil servants who advocated a centrist strategy) because political parties were not suited any more to serious reflexion. Finally, he again claimed that the (Marxist) SFIO had been created in 1905 on a fundamental &quot;ambiguity&quot;, that of whether to accept or reject market economy.

He remained active in European Union politics as late as June 2014, when he delivered his thoughts on the British on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. Rocard quoted Churchill&#x27;s words about the &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, issued a strong condemnation of the UK policy of the 40 years to that date, and begged for a European strongman, which he saw in Martin Schulz. He concluded by inviting the UK to leave.

Rocard was also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations.

<doc id="296266" wikidata="Q387513" url="?curid=296266" title="List of Doctor Who episodes (2005–present)">
<text>&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. Having ceased broadcasting in 1989, it resumed in 2005. The 2005 revival traded the earlier multi-episode serial format of the original series for a run of self-contained episodes, interspersed with occasional multi-part stories and structured into loose story arcs.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; depicts the adventures of an extraterrestrial being called the Doctor, part of a humanoid species called Time Lords. The Doctor travels in the universe and in time using a time travelling spaceship called the TARDIS, which externally appears as a British police box. While travelling, typically with companions, the Doctor works to save lives and liberate oppressed peoples by combating various enemies. The Doctor has been played by various actors; the transition between actors is written into the plot with the concept of regeneration, a plot device in which a Time Lord&#x27;s cells regenerated when they are fatally injured and they are reincarnated into a different body. Each actor&#x27;s distinct portrayal represents different stages in the Doctor&#x27;s life and, together, they form a single lifetime and narrative.

Six actors have led the revived series in the role of the Doctor under three showrunners, beginning with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor and Russell T Davies as showrunner. Eccleston departed the role after the first series, succeeded by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who played the role for three regular series. Tennant and Davies departed following a series of specials, replaced by Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Steven Moffat as showrunner, respectively. Smith portrayed the character for three series, leaving after the 2013 specials. Peter Capaldi took over the role for three series as the Twelfth Doctor; he and Moffat departed following the 2017 Christmas special. Capaldi was replaced by Jodie Whittaker, the first woman to play the role, as the Thirteenth Doctor; Chris Chibnall became showrunner. After three series, Whittaker and Chibnall left at the end of the 2022 specials, and Davies returned for a second term as showrunner. Tennant returned as the Fourteenth Doctor in the 60th anniversary specials, succeeded by Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor, who has headlined the series since 2024.

&lt;section begin=AiredEpisodes /&gt;&lt;section end=AiredEpisodes /&gt; This includes one television movie and multiple specials, and encompasses stories over 40 seasons, starting in 1963; out of these, are from the revived series, encompassing stories over 14 series and various specials. The programme&#x27;s high episode count has resulted in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; holding the world record for the highest number of episodes of a science-fiction programme. As of November 2023, up to a seventeenth series of the revived era has been planned. The story numbers below are meant as a guide to placement in the overall context of the programme. The numbering scheme in this list follows the official website&#x27;s episode guide; other sources sometimes diverge in their numbering.

==Series overview==
The following table dictates the season or series in question for the programme as a whole.
===Regular seasons===
===Specials===
===Notes===

==Episodes==
In 2005, the BBC relaunched &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner, and Mal Young as executive producers, and Phil Collinson as producer. For the first time since the third season, each episode has a title. Unlike the classic series, most episodes told standalone stories. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.

===Ninth Doctor===
The revived series began with Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor. During Eccleston&#x27;s tenure, all episodes were set on Earth, or its orbit, in the past, present, or future. In his last story, &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, the Doctor absorbed the Time Vortex to save his companion, leading to his regeneration.

====Series 1 (2005)====

The 2005 series introduces Billie Piper as the companion Rose Tyler. A loose story arc deals with the consequences of the Time War and its impact on the Doctor, and the mystery of the seemingly omnipresent phrase &#x27;Bad Wolf&#x27;. Beginning with &quot;The Empty Child&quot;, John Barrowman appears as Jack Harkness.
===Tenth Doctor===
The Tenth Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant, who was cast before the first series aired. With the success of the first series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned to its old formula of visiting alien planets in addition to time travel. Tennant retained the role until Part Two of &quot;The End of Time&quot; when the Doctor is killed by radiation poisoning while saving his companion.

====Series 2 (2006)====

The back-story for the spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; is &quot;seeded&quot; in various episodes of the 2006 series. Rose continues travelling with the Doctor, leaving the programme at the end of the finale &quot;Doomsday&quot;. From &quot;School Reunion&quot; through &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, Noel Clarke, who recurred in series 1, appeared as companion Mickey Smith.
====Series 3 (2007)====

This series introduces Freema Agyeman as the companion Martha Jones, whose time as the companion ends in the finale &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;, and deals with the mysterious Mr. Saxon, and the Doctor dealing with the loss of Rose Tyler.
====Series 4 (2008)====

In this series, Catherine Tate reprises her role as Donna Noble from &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;, this time as a full-fledged companion. The coincidences binding the Doctor and Donna together are explored. Donna departs in the second part of the finale &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. The first part &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; brings back all the long-term companions in the revived series up to that moment for the finale. There is also a loose story arc of many planets as well as bees mysteriously disappearing.
====Specials (2008–2010)====

The specials focus (&quot;Planet of the Dead&quot; onwards) on a premonition of &quot;four knocks&quot; leading to the death of the Tenth Doctor. The Doctor continues travelling alone in all the specials, taking one-off companions as he deals with the grief of continuously ending up alone again and again.
===Eleventh Doctor===
The Eleventh Doctor was portrayed by Matt Smith. Steven Moffat took over as showrunner from the fifth series, with an emphasis on stories involving twisting and complicated plots. Smith retained the role until the Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;&quot;&quot;, with the Doctor dying due to old age and fatigue from a centuries-long war.

====Series 5 (2010)====

This series introduces Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill as companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams respectively. It deals with cracks spreading throughout time and space erasing things from existence; the opening of the &quot;Pandorica&quot; is also mentioned in various episodes.
====Series 6 (2011)====

This series centres on the true identity of River Song (who was introduced in series 4 and recurred in series 5, played by Alex Kingston), and the Doctor&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;. The original transmission of series 6 was split into two parts, with the first seven episodes airing April to June 2011 and the final six from late August to October 2011.
====Series 7 (2012–2013)====

Series 7 started with five episodes, was split by a Christmas special in late 2012, and was completed by eight episodes in 2013. It deals with the exit of the Ponds midway through the series in &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, and the mystery of the new companion Clara Oswald portrayed by Jenna Coleman.
====Specials (2013)====

The first special focuses on various incarnations of the Doctor, including the return of the Tenth Doctor as well as the reveal of a secret incarnation called the War Doctor and his actions during the Time War. The second special focuses on the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s regeneration as he dedicates his life to protecting the planet Trenzalore.
===Twelfth Doctor===
The Twelfth Doctor was portrayed by Peter Capaldi. His tenure saw a reduction of total episodes per series from thirteen to twelve. His Doctor was characterised by his grappling with the question of the meaning of goodness and whether he is himself a good man. Capaldi played the role until the Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, after his last stand against the Cybermen in the previous episode.

====Series 8 (2014)====

The series deals with the Doctor&#x27;s questioning of him being a good man, and the mystery of the identity of the character &quot;Missy&quot;. 
====Series 9 (2015)====

The series is almost exclusively made up of two-episode stories and loose story arcs. It deals with the &quot;prophecy of the Hybrid&quot;, and the consequences of the changing dynamics of the Doctor and Clara&#x27;s relationship, which leads to her departure in the finale &quot;Hell Bent&quot;.
====Series 10 (2017)====

The series deals with the mystery of a vault and the Doctor&#x27;s oath of guarding it, later exploring the Doctor and Missy&#x27;s relationship, and the possibility of Missy turning good. This season introduces Pearl Mackie and Matt Lucas as the Doctor&#x27;s new companions Bill Potts and Nardole respectively, both of whom depart in the series&#x27;s corresponding Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.
===Thirteenth Doctor===
The Thirteenth Doctor was portrayed by Jodie Whittaker, becoming the first woman to play the role. Chris Chibnall took over as showrunner from the eleventh series onwards, with a reduction of episodes from twelve to ten. The time slot was changed to Sunday. They both departed in the special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, with the Doctor dying at the hands of the Master.

====Series 11 (2018)====

The series introduces Mandip Gill, Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole as the new companions Yasmin Khan, Graham O&#x27;Brien and Ryan Sinclair respectively. No enemies from the programme&#x27;s history return in the series.
====Series 12 (2020)====

This series deals with a new incarnation of the Master, the appearance of an unknown incarnation of the Doctor, the destruction of her homeworld Gallifrey and the secret of the Timeless Child. It saw the return of Jack Harkness in a cameo. The special is the last regular appearance of Graham and Ryan.
====Series 13 (2021)====

Series 13 is a single story arc, subtitled &quot;Flux&quot;, consisting of six episodes. It involves a universe-ending anomaly, called the &quot;Flux&quot;, which leads to several enemies separately attempting to take over Earth and destroy most of the universe. John Bishop joined the series as new companion Dan.
====Specials (2022)====

The specials loosely continued from &quot;Flux&quot;, with the last special celebrating the BBC&#x27;s centenary. They deal with Yaz and the Doctor&#x27;s relationship and the lead up to the Thirteenth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration. Both Dan and Yaz depart in the finale.

Bad Wolf and Disney began co-producing the programme, while Disney+ handled international distribution outside the UK.

They reunite the Doctor with Donna Noble; introduce Beep the Meep on-screen; involve thwarting a threat at the universe&#x27;s edge; re-introduce the Toymaker; and conclude with the Fourteenth Doctor&#x27;s unique bi-generation.
===Fifteenth Doctor===
The Fifteenth Doctor is the current incarnation of the Doctor, and portrayed by Ncuti Gatwa. His tenure saw the episode count reduced from ten to eight. For marketing purposes, the series&#x27; numbering system was reset, starting with &quot;Season 1&quot;.
====Series 14 (2024) ====

The Christmas special introduces Millie Gibson as companion Ruby Sunday, while the following series centred around the mystery of Ruby&#x27;s birth, and a mysterious woman who appeared in different forms within each of the Doctor and Ruby&#x27;s adventures.

<text>Arsenal Stadium was a football stadium in Highbury, London, which was the home of Arsenal Football Club between 6 September 1913 and 7 May 2006. It was popularly known as &quot;Highbury&quot; from the name of the district in which it was located, and was given the affectionate nickname of &quot;The Home of Football&quot;.

It was originally built in 1913 on the site of a local college&#x27;s recreation ground, and was significantly redeveloped twice. The first reconstruction came in the 1930s, from which the Art Deco East and West Stands date. There was a second development; the first phase, which added executive boxes to the Clock End, was completed in 1989, and afterward in 1993 a new North Bank Stand was constructed. These latter developments both followed the recommendations of the Taylor Report by replacing the terraces to make the stadium an all-seater with four stands. However, further attempts to expand the stadium were blocked by the community, resulting in a reduction in capacity and matchday revenue. This led to Arsenal opting to build a new stadium, the [[Emirates Stadium]]. After the club moved to its new stadium upon the conclusion of the 2005–06 season, Highbury was redeveloped as a residential development known as Highbury Square, with the Clock End and North Bank stands being demolished; parts of the East and West Stands remained and were incorporated into the new development due to their listed status.

The stadium also hosted international matches – both for England and in the 1948 Summer Olympics – and FA Cup semi-finals, as well as boxing, baseball and cricket matches. Its presence also led to the local London Underground station being renamed as Arsenal in 1932, making it the only station on the Underground network to be named after a football club.

In addition to its architecture, the stadium was known for its small but immaculate pitch and for the clock that had been positioned in the southern side of the ground since its introduction in 1930.

==History==

The original stadium was built in 1913 after Woolwich Arsenal chairman Henry Norris moved the club from the Manor Ground in Plumstead, South East London to Highbury, leasing the recreation fields of St John&#x27;s College of Divinity for 21 years for £20,000. The move was initially opposed by Islington Borough Council, residents and nearby clubs, Tottenham Hotspur and Clapton Orient. The lease agreement, signed by the Archbishop of Canterbury Randall Davidson, allowed no matches to be played on &quot;holy days&quot; and that no &quot;intoxicating liquor&quot; would be sold at the stadium; however, these stipulations were later dropped. One advantage of the site was its close proximity to Gillespie Road tube station.

The stadium, designed by Archibald Leitch, architect of many other football grounds of that era, was hurriedly built over the summer of 1913. It featured a single stand on the eastern side and the other three sides had banked terracing and cost £125,000. It opened on 6 September 1913 whilst not fully complete, for Arsenal&#x27;s first match of the 1913–14 season, a 2–1 Second Division win against Leicester Fosse. Leicester&#x27;s Tommy Benfield scored the first goal at the new ground while George Jobey was the first Arsenal player to do so. 

Highbury hosted its first England match in 1920. The Australian rugby league team suffered the first loss of their 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain at Highbury to an English side 4 points to 5 before approximately 12,000 spectators.

In 1925, Arsenal bought the stadium site outright for £64,000.

No significant portion of Leitch&#x27;s original stadium remains today following a series of bold redevelopments during the 1930s. The idea was to create a ground for London that could capture the grandeur of Villa Park, home of Birmingham club Aston Villa. The Highbury project was ambitious in its scale and reach, the first stand completed being the West Stand, designed by Claude Waterlow Ferrier and William Binnie in the Art Deco style which opened in 1932. On 5 November the same year, the local Tube station was renamed from Gillespie Road to Arsenal following successful persuasion by manager Herbert Chapman. The stadium&#x27;s name was also changed from Highbury to Arsenal Stadium. Chapman next decided to install a 45-minute clock on the North Bank despite the Football Association&#x27;s concern that it would undermine the referee&#x27;s authority. The North Bank terrace was given a roof in 1935 and the clock was moved to the front of the southern terrace, giving it the name the Clock End. Leitch&#x27;s main stand was demolished to make way for a new East Stand, matching the West, in 1936. The West Stand cost £45,000, while the East Stand went far over budget and ended up costing £130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade.
During the 1948 Summer Olympics, the stadium hosted the football preliminaries. For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed and had to be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. 

Chapman had demonstrated floodlit football at Highbury in November 1932, however, the Football Association had banned its members from taking part in a floodlit match. Following the lifting of the ban in December 1950, in 1951 Arsenal became the first team in Division One to fit floodlights, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park, once stood at the Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural floodlit match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.

Before the Taylor report in January 1990 on the Hillsborough disaster was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater, both the North Bank and Clock End consisted of terracing, and the stadium often saw crowds of up to 60,000 or more; its largest attendance was 73,295 on 9 March 1935 when Arsenal played Sunderland in the First Division; the game finished 0–0. When the ground was initially constructed, it was to &quot;accommodate 90,000 spectators&quot;.

The Clock End was redeveloped in 1988–89 with the addition of a roof and 48 executive boxes, while seating was fitted into the remaining standing area in 1993.

The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal&#x27;s most passionate supporters, was demolished at the end of the 1991–92 season. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified. The lengthy process of rebuilding the North Bank meant that Highbury was three-sided for the entire 1992–93 season, which was also the first season of the new FA Premier League. Although a lack of goals meant that Arsenal only finished 10th in the new league, they won both of the domestic cup competitions that season. Populous (then LOBB Partnership) designed all-seater two-tier North Bank Stand, the last area of Highbury to be refurbished, which was opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million amid strong opposition from local residents. The new North Bank Stand contained a museum and a concourse with video arcades, bars, confectionery counters, souvenir shops and fast-food stands. While the all-seater North Bank was &quot;never the same as the old-fashioned Archibald Leitch stand&quot; that it replaced, it was &quot;much more like the future of Arsenal than the past&quot; with its added amenities and &quot;Gone were the days of pushing a petrified child through a packed crowd and placing them on a barrier from which they could only see a small section of the pitch&quot;. The old stand had received a fitting send off with a 5–1 defeat of Southampton, though the new stand had a less auspicious start, the first game being a surprise 0–3 defeat to Coventry City with all three goals coming from striker Micky Quinn. The first victory came 10 days later against Leeds United.

Arsenal did not always play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium was used as an ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal&#x27;s home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury&#x27;s already limited capacity had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal&#x27;s record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, it would not have been able to host their 2000–01 campaign. The club set a record attendance at Wembley, with 73,707 against RC Lens on 25 November 1998.

==Structure==

At the time of its closure, the stadium consisted of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north–south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club&#x27;s offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.

The stadium&#x27;s main entrances were on Gillespie Road, Avenell Road and Highbury Hill. When it closed, Highbury had a capacity of 38,419 (approximately 12,500 in the North Bank, 11,000 in the West Stand, 9,000 in the East Stand and 6,000 in the Clock End), all seated, and had Jumbotron screens in the south-east and north-west corners.

Arsenal Stadium was well known for its very small immaculately-kept pitch, which measured only 109×73 yards (100×67 metres). Arsenal&#x27;s groundsmen, Steve Braddock and his successor Paul Burgess, won the FA Premier League&#x27;s Groundsman of the Year award several times for their work on the stadium.

==Closure and redevelopment==
The post-Taylor capacity of Highbury was limited to 38,419, while Arsenal&#x27;s success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity. Restrictions, such as the East Stand&#x27;s status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club&#x27;s directors would have liked to have kept Arsenal at a modernised and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to share with the England national football team.

In November 1999, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury and construct a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was confirmed in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the Emirates Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines. The stadium opened in July 2006; Arsenal&#x27;s offices were moved to a new building, Highbury House, which was named in commemoration of the former stadium.

For their final season at Highbury (2005–06) Arsenal ran a series of promotions honouring the stadium&#x27;s legacy. A commemorative logo was designed featuring the club&#x27;s traditional Art Deco crest from the 1930s, and the club&#x27;s history at Highbury was celebrated through a series of themed matchdays. On the field, Arsenal temporarily set aside their traditional red shirts with white sleeves for the season and adopted a solid redcurrant shirt, the colour they wore during their first season at Highbury in 1913–14.

Arsenal&#x27;s final game at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on 7 May 2006 against Wigan Athletic, the last game of the season. The team needed to better the result of neighbours Tottenham Hotspur to again secure qualification for the Champions League. Having been 2–1 behind, a hat trick by captain and all-time leading goal scorer Thierry Henry secured qualification, with Henry kneeling down to kiss the turf on scoring what proved to be the final goal seen at the stadium. The last goal scored in a regulation game at the stadium came in a Football Aid charity match when lifelong fan Alan Alger scored a penalty in the final minute of a fixture played on Thursday 8 June 2006 (exactly one month and one day after Henry&#x27;s goal). After the stadium&#x27;s closure, Arsenal held an auction to sell off many of the stadium&#x27;s parts, including pieces of the pitch, the goalposts and former manager George Graham&#x27;s desk. Sale of the stadium&#x27;s seats had to be cancelled after it was found they contained trace amounts of the toxic metal cadmium.

, Arsenal Stadium was redeveloped and converted into flats in a project known as &quot;Highbury Square&quot;, a scheme that had 711 properties built on the site. The North Bank and Clock End stands were demolished. The exteriors of the listed Art Deco East Stand and the matching West Stand were preserved and incorporated into the new developments, while the rest of the stands&#x27; structures were removed, and the pitch became a communal garden. In October 2005 the proposed flats went on sale; as of May 2006 all properties in the North, East and West Stands had been taken.

Arsenal&#x27;s clock was moved from Highbury to the outer side of the new stadium, with a new larger version of the feature added inside the ground in August 2010. At the same time as the unveiling of the new clock, the south stands at the venue were also renamed &quot;Clock End&quot; in line with the same name previously used at Highbury.
==Arsenal&#x27;s record of results==
Arsenal&#x27;s complete competitive record at Highbury is as follows:
===Record scorelines===
Arsenal&#x27;s biggest win at Highbury came on 9 January 1932, with an 11–1 victory over Darwen in the FA Cup. Their biggest defeats were 0–5 losses to Huddersfield Town in the First Division on 14 February 1925 and against Chelsea in the League Cup on 11 November 1998.

==Other events==

===International football===
As well as being home to Arsenal, the stadium also hosted games for England matches; 12 internationals were played at Highbury from 1920 to 1961, most of them being friendlies. These included both England&#x27;s first full home international against opposition outside of Great Britain and Ireland (Belgium in 1923), and the &quot;Battle of Highbury&quot;, England&#x27;s 3–2 win over World Champions Italy in 1934, where a record seven Arsenal players started the match, the most players from a single club to play in an England fixture. 

England&#x27;s record at Highbury is as follows:

In May 1963, England played The Football League XI at the stadium to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Football Association and the 75th anniversary of the Football League.

The stadium was also used as a football venue for two matches in the 1948 London Olympics – a first-round match and a quarter-final. It was also provisionally named as one of London&#x27;s two host stadiums for the 1966 FIFA World Cup (along with Wembley), but was eventually dropped with White City Stadium taking the role instead. By the time of Euro 96, the pitch had been ruled too small for international football and the stadium would have been ineligible.

===FA Cup semi-finals===
Highbury was the venue for twelve FA Cup semi-finals as a neutral ground; the first in 1929 and the last in 1997. Between 1984 and 1992 the stadium was not included in the FA&#x27;s list of approved venues after Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing following a pitch invasion by Everton fans during their semi-final against Southampton. FA Cup semi-finals held at Highbury are listed below. Teams in bold went on to win the competition that year
===FA Amateur Cup finals===
Arsenal Stadium was the venue for three FA Amateur Cup finals until it moved permanently to Wembley Stadium in 1949.

===1955-58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup===
The stadium also hosted the London XI&#x27;s home leg against Lausanne Sports in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals; London won 2–0 on the night and 3–2 on aggregate.
===Other sporting events===
The stadium also hosted several cricket games and also baseball matches involving American servicemen between 1916 and 1919. It was the venue for the 1966 World Heavyweight boxing title bout between Henry Cooper and Muhammad Ali, which Ali won. 

Highbury also played host to an international rugby league match on 10 October 1921 as part of the Australian rugby league team&#x27;s 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. The match saw England defeat Australia 5–4 in front of 12,000 fans.

==Broadcasting milestones==
On 22 January 1927, Arsenal&#x27;s game against Sheffield United was the first radio broadcast of a football match. On 16 September 1937, a practice match between Arsenal and their reserves was the first trial televised game.

==Appearance in films==
The stadium has been the backdrop for at least three films: &quot;The Arsenal Stadium Mystery&quot; (1939), and &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1997).

A floodlight match in the stadium, against unknown opposition, is the setting for the climax of the 1960 film &quot;Jackpot&quot;.

<text>The  (; ENA; ) was a French &quot;grande école&quot;, created in 1945 by President Charles de Gaulle and principal author of the 1958 Constitution Michel Debré, to democratise access to the senior civil service. It was abolished on 31 December 2021 and replaced by the Institut national du service public (INSP).

The ENA selected and undertook initial training of senior French officials. It was considered to be one of the most academically exceptional French schools, both because of its low acceptance rates and because a large majority of its candidates have already graduated from other elite schools in the country. Thus, within French society, the ENA stood as one of the main pathways to high positions in the public and private sectors. Indeed, 4 Presidents of France under the beginning of the 5th Republic in 1958 (including Emmanuel Macron) and multiple prime-ministers and ministers, studied at ENA.

Originally located in Paris, it had been relocated to Strasbourg to emphasise its European character. It was based in the former Commanderie Saint-Jean, though continued to maintain a Paris campus. ENA produced around 80 to 90 graduates every year, known as &quot;étudiants-fonctionnaires&quot;, &quot;&quot;enaos&quot; or &quot;énarques&quot;&quot; (). In 2002 the Institut international d&#x27;administration publique (IIAP) which educated French diplomats under a common structure with the ENA was merged with it. The ENA shares several traditions with the College of Europe, which was established shortly after.

In 2019, President Emmanuel Macron announced he would propose to abolish and replace the ENA. Macron is an ENA graduate himself, but the tight network of ENA graduates influencing the French civil service has been decried by populist protests such as the yellow vests movement as an elite governing class out of touch with the lower social classes. In April 2021, Macron confirmed the closure of the school, calling the closure &quot;the most important reform of the senior public service&quot; since the school&#x27;s creation in 1945.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

The was formally established in October 1945 at the decree of Michel Debré as part of his project to reform the recruitment and training of high-ranking officials.

The ENA was designed to democratize access to the higher ranks of the French civil service. Until then, each ministry had its own hiring process and selection standards. The examinations for particular ministries were often extremely specialized, meaning that few candidates possessed the knowledge to pass. In addition, the narrow expertise required meant few officials were capable of serving in a variety of roles.

The school was designed to broaden and standardize the training provided to senior public servants, and to ensure they possessed extensive knowledge of policy and governance. Debré&#x27;s stated intention was to create &quot;a body of officials proven to be highly competent, especially in financial, economic and social matters.&quot; The new system, based on academic proficiency and competitive examination, was also intended to guard against nepotism and make recruitment to top positions more transparent.

Access to senior positions of the French civil service is threefold: first, through generalist civil service positions; second, through &quot;technical&quot; (engineering) positions; and third, through internal promotion.

=== Relocation to Strasbourg ===
In November 1991 the government of Prime Minister Édith Cresson announced that the ENA would be relocated to Strasbourg. The &quot;Commanderie Saint-Jean&quot;, a former barracks and prison dating back to the 14th century, was chosen as its new site. The move was designed to emphasize the school&#x27;s symbolic proximity to the numerous European institutions based in the city. However, though the school was officially relocated, it maintained many of its facilities in Paris. It remained split between the two cities, requiring students to complete studies in both locations, until it was fully re-located to Strasbourg in January 2005.

In 2002, it was merged with its sister institution the Institut international d&#x27;administration publique (IIAP), called the “foreigners’ ENA”, with the aim of increasing its international profile.

=== Closure ===
In April 2019, it was claimed that a leaked speech to be delivered by French President Macron would announce that ENA would be closed as part of the solution to the Gilets Jaunes crisis. On 25 April 2019, President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that he will close ENA. In April 2021, Macron announced the closure of the school, calling the closure &quot;the most important reform of the senior public service&quot; since the school&#x27;s creation by Charles de Gaulle in 1945. In January 2022, it has been replaced by the Institut national du service public (INSP).

== Recruitment ==
Admission to the ENA is granted based on a competitive examination taking place from the end of August to November, which people generally take after completing studies at the &quot;Sciences Po&quot; or any &quot;Prép&#x27;Ena&quot; (preparatory classes for the ENA examination for people coming from universities or &quot;grandes écoles&quot;). The &quot;concours externe&quot; exam is divided into two parts:
: The written part includes:
::* An essay on public law;
::* An essay on economics;
::* An essay on a question about the role of public institutions and their relations with the society
::* A &quot;note de synthèse&quot; (analyzing a 25-page document and proposing a brief for a Senior Executive [Minister or Director]) on Social Law and Policies (&quot;Questions Sociales&quot;);
::* Three questions on Public Finance.

: The oral exam, taken only by those with the highest marks at the written exam, consists of:
::* An oral examination on International Politics (&quot;Questions Internationales&quot;);
::* An oral examination on &quot;Questions Européennes&quot; (European Law and Policies);
::* An English oral test;
::* A collective exam, simulating a case in management to assess interaction skills;
::* A 45-minute entrance exam, known as &quot;Grand Oral&quot; since any question can be asked, based on the CV given by the candidate.

Results of this exam process are published by the end of December.

Other exam processes govern admission for career civil servants (&quot;concours interne&quot;) and for all other people, already active in business, political or union activities (&quot;troisième concours&quot;).

Following a two-year intensive programme combining high-responsibility internships and examinations, the ENA ranks students according to their results. Students are then asked, by order of merit, the position/body they want to join. Top-ranked students (between 12 and 15 students) usually join the so-called &quot;grands corps&quot; &quot;Inspection générale des finances&quot;, or Cour des comptes, usually followed by the French Treasury and the diplomatic service. Other students will join various ministries and administrative justice or . To quote the ENA&#x27;s site:
:&quot;In fact, although these famous alumni are the most visible, the majority are largely unknown, lead quiet and useful careers in our civil service, and don&#x27;t recognise themselves in the stereotyped images about our school.&quot;

== Promotions ==
Academic years at the ENA are known as &quot;promotions&quot;, and are named by the students after outstanding French people (Vauban, Saint-Exupéry, Rousseau), Foreigners (Mandela), characters (Cyrano de Bergerac), battles (Valmy), concepts (Croix de Lorraine, Droits de l&#x27;homme) or values (liberté-égalité-fraternité).

This tradition comes from old French military academies such as the Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr.

The &quot;Promotion Voltaire&quot; of 1980 has attracted particular attention, since numerous graduates that year went on to become significant figures in French politics. François Hollande, Dominique de Villepin, Ségolène Royal, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Michel Sapin were all members of this &quot;promotion&quot;.

== Ranking ==
In 2011, the &quot;Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities&quot; ranked the ENA third in France and ninth in the world according to the number of alumni holding the position of CEO at Fortune Global 500 companies.

In 2013, a Times Higher Education ranking that ordered universities according to the same metric placed the ENA sixth in the world.

== Alumni ==

Few &quot;énarques&quot; (around 1%) actually get involved in politics. Most ENA alumni hold neutral, technical, and administrative positions in the French civil service. Researchers at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique have shown that many ENA alumni become business executives in France.

French law makes it relatively easy for civil servants to enter politics: civil servants who are elected or appointed to a political position do not have to resign their position in the civil service; instead, they are put in a situation of &quot;temporary leave&quot; known as &quot;disponibilité&quot;. If they are not re-elected or reappointed, they may ask for their reintegration into their service (well-known examples include Lionel Jospin and Philippe Séguin). In addition, ENA graduates are often recruited as aides by government ministers and other politicians; this makes it easier for some of them to enter a political career. As an example, Dominique de Villepin entered politics as an &quot;appointed&quot; official, after serving as an aide to Jacques Chirac, without ever having held an elected position. The ENA also participates in international Technical Assistance programmes, funded by the EU or other donors.

Since its creation 60 years ago, the ENA has trained 5600 French senior officials and 2600 foreigners. Some famous alumni include:

* Head of state: Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (France), Jacques Chirac (France), François Hollande (France), Emmanuel Macron (France), Nicéphore Soglo (Benin), Adly Mansour (Egypt, acting), Paul Biya (Cameroon)
* Head of government: Jean Castex (France), Édouard Philippe (France), Laurent Fabius (France), Michel Rocard (France), Édouard Balladur (France), Alain Juppé (France), Lionel Jospin (France), Dominique de Villepin (France), Edem Kodjo (Togo), Alfred Sant (Malta), André Milongo (Republic of the Congo), Patrick Leclercq (Monaco), Jean-Paul Proust (Monaco), Brigi Rafini (Niger).
* Industry leaders: Guillaume Pepy (CEO of SNCF), Michel Bon (former CEO of Carrefour and France Telecom), Jean-Marie Messier, Ernest-Antoine Seillière, Louis Schweitzer, Gunnar Graef (former CEO of Deutsche Post, France), Philippe Heim (CEO of La Banque Postale, France), Gérard Mestrallet, Louis Gallois (former CEO of EADS), Henri de Castries (former CEO of Axa), Baudouin Prot, Frédéric Oudéa, Frédéric Lemoine, Pierre-André de Chalendar (CEO of Saint-Gobain), Claire Dorland-Clauzel.
* Current French ministers: Jean Castex (Prime Minister), Florence Parly and Bruno Le Maire.
* Former French ministers: Édouard Philippe (former Prime Minister), Michel Sapin or Ségolène Royal (typically one-third of every French cabinet since the 1960s and one-half of the Cabinet for recent administrations until Sarkozy&#x27;s were alumni of the ENA).
* Other political leaders: Pavel Fischer (Ambassador of the Czech Republic to France 2003–2010, Czech presidential candidate 2018, ended third), Milos Alcalay (Venezuelan diplomat), Tea Tsulukiani (Minister of Justice of Georgia), Marcin Korolec (Minister of Environment, Poland), French left-wing: Jean-Pierre Chevènement, Élisabeth Guigou, Christian Paul, French right-wing: Laurent Wauquiez, Jean-François Copé, Valérie Pécresse, French far-right: François Asselineau, Florian Philippot.
* International organisations presidents: Pascal Lamy (WTO), Jean-Claude Trichet (ECB), Michel Camdessus (IMF), Jacques de Larosière (IMF and EBRD), Pierre Moscovici (European Commissioner).
* Intellectuals: Françoise Chandernagor, Jean-François Deniau, Gabriel de Broglie, Jacques Attali.

== International cooperation ==
An agreement was signed in Paris on 16 October 2012 between the ENA and the Uzbek Academy of administration; it allows for cooperation in the modernization of state administration and improving skills of public servants in Uzbekistan. The first cooperation was due to begin in January 2013.

== Criticism ==
Critics have accused the ENA of educating a narrow ruling class who are prone to groupthink and averse to alternative perspectives. According to these critics, the ENA discourages its students from innovative thinking and pushes them to take conventional, middle-of-the-road positions. Peter Gumbel, a British academic, has claimed that France&#x27;s &quot;grande école&quot; system, and especially the ENA, has the effect of perpetuating an intellectually brilliant yet out-of-touch ruling elite. Yannick Blanc, a former senior civil servant, has also suggested that &quot;énarques&quot; have often been too &#x27;intellectually conformist&#x27;.

The ENA was indeed constantly criticized for being a school perpetuating social-economic inequalities, as only a very tiny portion of its students was coming from modest backgrounds (only around 6% of students were children of laborers for example).

Some French politicians such as Bruno Le Maire and François Bayrou proposed abolishing the ENA, a step that was ultimately taken by President Macron in 2021.

<doc id="296285" wikidata="Q7582062" url="?curid=296285" title="Square dance club">
<text>Square dance clubs are the primary form for organization within the recreational activity of square dancing, and more specifically modern western square dance. This article&#x27;s focus is the modern western square dance club, and it is understood in the context of this article that when the terms &quot;square dance club&quot; or &quot;square dance&quot; are used it refers to the form of square dance called &quot;modern western square dance&quot;.

Square dance clubs are primarily, but not exclusively, local in character. A square dance club is only as strong as its members, i.e. individual square dancers.

== Promoting and advancing square dance ==
The club&#x27;s primary goal is to promote and advance square dance as a recreational activity. Typically clubs accomplish this goal through the following activities:

* Providing classes and other training opportunities to new, as well as experienced dancers
* Showcasing the activity through public performances
* Organizing dances
* Participation in other associations dedicated to the promotion and advancement of square dancing
* Providing employment and training opportunities to square dance callers.

This is not an exclusive list, and square dance clubs are constantly on the look out for new ways to achieve their goals. Associations, partnerships and other cooperative ventures have become increasingly more important to square dance clubs. Membership in square dance clubs seems to have peaked in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, and has gradually decreased since that time.

=== Classes and training for dancers ===
Providing classes and training opportunities is the main activity for the majority of square dance clubs. This activity develops competent dancers, a core membership for the club, club solidarity and feeling, and a renewable base for the sustainability of the club. Most clubs start classes in September and/or January, although strategies are being developed for starting classes more often.

Callerlab recommends that the Mainstream program be taught in no less than 56 hours. Depending on the length of the individual class and how often one meets, it can take a half year or longer to learn the full program. Therefore, consideration is being given to many different ways to quicken the learning curve, and to get new dancers on the dance floor. 

Callerlab also dictates what the plus, advanced 1 and 2, and 4 levels of challenge programs are. 

Callerlab not only has a number of American callers that are members, but callers from all over the world.

In Europe, most notably in Denmark, there have been recognized a series of partial dance levels with corresponding dances available at those partway points (Mainstream 23, 45, 53, 69). The American Callers Association also has a simplified program, called &quot;1&quot;. In America, clubs sponsoring classes often hold &quot;Red-light/Green-light&quot; dances, where alternating tips are called at a level where class members can participate. These accommodations allow dancers to begin attending dances quicker in the learning cycle.

Some clubs, especially those with younger or more motivated dancers, teach at accelerated rates. As an example, Tech Squares, associated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, teaches the longer Plus program in one semester (12 classes of roughly 90 minutes of teaching time). Other clubs have reported success with intensive courses of one or two weekends to learn the Mainstream level, while other areas offer a &quot;Five Saturday, or Sunday&quot; program to instruct new students in the program.

=== Public performance ===
This is a way of bringing public attention to the club, with the hope of recruiting more members. Public performances may be those done in public areas (malls, fairs, exhibitions) or it may refer to televised performances.

=== Organizing dances ===
Organizing dances is one of the primary activity of clubs. In addition to sheer enjoyment, dances provide the club&#x27;s members and members of other clubs the opportunity to practice the skills learned in classes. It also gives the club an opportunity to showcase itself to the wider square dance community, provides dancers an opportunity to socialize, and provides employment for callers.

=== Participating in associations ===
Square dance clubs participate in square dance associations of regional, area-wide, national and special interest character, as well as non-square dance association and organizations.

=== Employment and training for square dance callers ===
Employment of square dance callers is a key means of securing competent dancers for the club, and for the activity as a whole.

Callers will have resources available to them that the general public may not know about. By contacting a caller, you may find information on the activity in your area that is not widely publicized.

Training for callers is done by other callers; some of whom have been Certified by organizations. Training can be done in seminars and in week-long classes. A caller is never done with education as he/she is always trying to improve their craft.

== Dress code ==

Some clubs have a policy regarding appropriate clothing at club events; others do not. This is referred to as a dress code. Clubs that sponsor dances are encouraged to advertise the dress code that is appropriate for their dance.

<doc id="296295" wikidata="Q914655" url="?curid=296295" title="Guybrush Threepwood">
<text>Guybrush Ulysses Threepwood is a fictional character who serves as the main protagonist of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series of computer adventure games by LucasArts. He is a pirate who adventures throughout the Caribbean in search of fame and treasure alongside his love interest and later wife, Elaine Marley, often thwarting the plans of the undead pirate LeChuck in the process. Though a &quot;mighty pirate&quot; by his own account, he is a rather clumsy and disorganized protagonist throughout the series. It is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood&#x27;s unusual name, either deliberately or accidentally. In all voiced appearances, Guybrush is voiced by actor Dominic Armato.

==Conception and design==
The origin of the name &quot;Guybrush&quot; comes in part from Deluxe Paint, the raster graphics editor used by the artists to create the character sprite. Since the character had no name hitherto, the file was simply called &quot;. When the file was saved, Steve Purcell, the artist responsible for the sprite, added &quot; to the filename, indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint &quot;brush file&quot; for the &quot;Guy&quot; sprite. The file name was then , so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed &#x27;Guy&#x27; as &quot;Guybrush&quot;. Guybrush&#x27;s surname &quot;Threepwood&quot; was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s family of characters including Galahad Threepwood and Freddie Threepwood (with whom he shares similar characteristics). &quot;Threepwood&quot; is also rumoured to have been the name of Dave Grossman&#x27;s RPG character.

==Appearances==
Guybrush is introduced in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, where he travels to Mêlée Island in hopes of becoming a pirate. Over the course of his journey, he falls in love with the island&#x27;s governor, Elaine Marley, and works with her to destroy the ghost pirate LeChuck. In &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Guybrush goes on a quest for the legendary treasure of Big Whoop, which is needed to destroy the reanimated zombie LeChuck. In &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, Guybrush works to defeat LeChuck once more and lift a curse from Elaine, with the two marrying at the game&#x27;s conclusion. In &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, Guybrush must help Elaine be reelected as governor and prevent the corporate takeover of the Caribbean. In &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, Guybrush accidentally releases a voodoo pox, and must team up with an allegedly reformed LeChuck to cure Elaine and the rest of the Caribbean. In &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, an older Guybrush tells his and Elaine&#x27;s young son, Boybrush, about an adventure in which he and LeChuck race to find the supposed &quot;Secret of Monkey Island&quot;.

In &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, Guybrush can be accessed as a playable character via a cheat code; in addition, a secret room hidden in the game&#x27;s final level temporarily transforms the player into Guybrush. Guybrush also appears in &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; as part of the expansion &quot;The Legend of Monkey Island&quot;. Set between &quot;Curse&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot;, Guybrush and Elaine honeymoon in the Sea of Thieves, but they are intercepted by LeChuck, who traps them in a dream based on Mêlée Island to prevent them from stopping his latest scheme.

==Promotion and reception==
Symbiote Studios and LucasArts have made a statue which features Guybrush Threepwood facing off against LeChuck in a fight. In &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II&quot;, a skin called &quot;Guybrush Threepkiller&quot; based on the character is included.

IGN thought Guybrush was one of the few characters that would be strong enough to carry their own movie franchise, calling him &quot;delightfully amusing&quot; and noting that humour was one of his defining traits. Guybrush was included in GameSpot&#x27;s vote for the all-time greatest video game hero. Guybrush was eliminated in the first round when facing off against Wander from &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, garnering 46.5% of the votes. &quot;Empire&quot; listed Guybrush as the seventh top greatest video game character, saying that he was &quot;[a]rguably the most-loved character in point and click adventure gaming history&quot;. UGO Networks listed Guybrush as one of their best heroes of all time. When detailing pirates, UGO also called Guybrush &quot;[t]he perfect protagonist for a light-hearted pirate adventure&quot;. Tom Chatfield, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, listed Guybrush as one of the 10 best video game characters, characterizing Guybrush as &quot;an unforgettable presence in countless nascent gaming lives, from his knobbly knees to his less-than-silky sword skills&quot;. Guybrush also was listed in the Guinness World Records as the 38th top video game character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 10th best hero in video games, adding &quot;he may not be the most intimidating of protagonists[...], he gets by with his sharp wit and resourcefulness&quot;, and that &quot;he&#x27;s not only an unlikely pirate, but also an unlikely hero&quot;. In 2021, Rachel Weber of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked Guybrush as 30th of their &quot;50 iconic video game characters&quot;. HobbyConsolas included Guybrush on their &quot;The 30 best heroes of the last 30 years&quot;. During the 26th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, the writing and vocal performance of Guybrush Threepwood in &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character&quot;.

<doc id="296301" wikidata="Q1020958" url="?curid=296301" title="Ormskirk">
<text>Ormskirk is a market town in the West Lancashire district of Lancashire, England. It is located north of Liverpool, northwest of St Helens, southeast of Southport and southwest of Preston. Ormskirk is known for its gingerbread. In 2011 it had a population of 24,073.

==Geography and administration==
Ormskirk lies on sloping ground on the side of a ridge, whose highest point is above sea-level, at the centre of the West Lancashire Plain, and has been described as a &quot;planned borough&quot;, laid out in the 13th century. Ormskirk is an unparished area, surrounded by the parishes of Bickerstaffe, Aughton, Scarisbrick, Burscough, Lathom and Lathom South.

The town is located in the district of West Lancashire and is the site of the headquarters of West Lancashire Borough Council.

Since Ormskirk does not have a parish council, a voluntary association, Ormskirk Community Partnership, was created in 2009, with the support of the West Lancashire Borough Council, to act as a voice for Ormskirk. Ormskirk is home to Edge Hill University.

==History==
The name is Old Norse in origin and is derived from &quot;Ormres kirkja&quot;, from a personal name, &quot;Ormr&quot; (which means &quot;serpent&quot; or dragon), and the Old Norse word &quot;kirkja&quot; for &quot;church&quot;. Ormr may have been a Viking who settled here, became a Christian and founded the church but there are no other records or archaeological evidence to support this and Ormr&#x27;s identity is unknown.

There is no reference to Ormskirk in the Domesday Book of 1086, but it has been suggested that it may have been part of Lathom at that time. In about 1189, the lord of Lathom granted the church of Ormskirk to Burscough Priory, which does suggest that Ormskirk had been subordinate to Lathom before that date.

An open market is held twice weekly, on Thursdays and Saturdays, in the pedestrianised centre of Ormskirk. The location was originally the junction of the main roads to Preston, Liverpool and Wigan, and was marked by a market cross going back to medieval times. During the 18th and 19th centuries the Cross, as the junction was known, was the location of a large lamp mounted on an obelisk with a circular drinking fountain for both people and animals around the base. This was moved to the junction of St Helens Road and Moor Street to make room for the erection of the clock tower in 1876.

The fountain was then moved again to opposite the Drill Hall down Southport Road in the 1890s when space was needed to site the Disraeli statue. The market was established by a royal charter that was granted by Edward I in 1286 to the monks of Burscough Priory. Thursday has been market day in Ormskirk since at least 1292. The King also granted a borough charter to Ormskirk at about the same time, but this seems to have become extinct by the end of the 15th century.

The Ormskirk Poor Law Union was established in 1837, covering 21 parishes and townships from Tarleton to Simonswood, and from Birkdale to Skelmersdale. Ormskirk Union Workhouse was built in 1853 on Wigan Road and later became Ormskirk District General Hospital.

With its weekly markets, the town became a focal point for local farmers and their agricultural workers, cottagers, cow-keepers etc. to trade their goods and obtain necessities from the markets and from the retail establishments which were established along with public houses and inns. An engineering industry, based on making and mending agricultural machinery also developed.

The town became known for its gingerbread over the years when local women would bake the gingerbread in their own homes and then take it to the staging inns to sell to passengers. When the railway arrived in the mid 19th century, the local gingerbread sellers found a new market. They were allowed to sell their product to passengers travelling through the railway station. One particular customer Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, enjoyed the local gingerbread so much he sent orders to the town. The baking of gingerbread became part of the retail history of the town, with several local bakers claiming to have the original gingerbread recipe. A well known local woman, Sally Woods, was a recognisable figure on the market selling her gingerbread.

===Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul===

The Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul is believed to be on the site of the original kirk, on a sandstone outcrop, and is the oldest building in the town. Its exact age is unknown; the building does contain some fragments of Norman architecture.

The parish church has many connections with the Earls of Derby and the Stanley family. Many family members are buried in the church&#x27;s Derby Chapel, including Thomas Stanley, the first Earl, who caused Richard III to lose his crown by changing sides at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, and the Royalist James Stanley, the seventh Earl, who was beheaded at Bolton in 1651 after the Civil War. His body is buried in one coffin and his head in a separate casket.

This is one of only three parish churches in England to have a tower and a separate spire, and is unique in that it has both at the same end of the building. (The other two are St Mary&#x27;s Church, Purton and St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Wanborough, both near Swindon, in Wiltshire). Legend has it that Orme had two sisters, one who wanted a tower, and one who wanted a spire, and Orme built both to please both.

The &#x27;steeple&#x27; in fact dates from the early 15th century, but the original blew down in 1731 and was rebuilt between 1790 and 1832. The large west tower was added to the church around 1548 to house the bells of nearby Burscough Priory following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. One of these bells can still be seen in the church.

==Transport==

The A59 is the main road, with Preston to the north and Liverpool to the south. The A570, from Southport, crosses the town from west to east and provides a link to the national motorway network at junction 3 of the M58, about three miles from the town centre. It then continues to St Helens before reaching the M62 at Junction 7, Rainhill Stoops. The town has its own bus station, Ormskirk bus station.

The town&#x27;s railway station, which was refurbished at a cost of £1 million in 2009, is a northern terminus of Merseyrail, and the line continues, with a change from electric to diesel multiple units, through to Preston, after the direct service was partitioned in 1970. This line was promoted by the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway in August 1846, but was completed by the East Lancashire Railway. The route and Ormskirk station opened on 2 April 1849, the undertaking being merged into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on 13 May 1859.

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway built the Skelmersdale Branch line to Skelmersdale and Rainford Junction, which opened on 1 March 1858. Passenger services ended on 5 November 1956, goods to Rainford Junction finished on 16 November 1961 and to Skelmersdale on 4 November 1963.

==Local economy==
There is a Morrisons on Park Road, which was converted from a Safeway in 2005. The building was formerly home to the local gasworks, and the local Rover/Morris car dealership (&quot;Balmforths&quot;). The &quot;Two Saints&quot; is a modest retail park which opened in 2000 and contains a number of retailers including McDonald&#x27;s, Argos, &quot;Mobility Store&quot;, Poundland, Aldi and a gym. In December 2013, when Blockbuster entered administration, its store at &quot;Two Saints&quot; closed. A Tesco Metro was located on Church Street, but it closed in April 2015.

An out of town business park, &quot;The Hattersley Centre&quot;, opened in February 2008, with a Home Bargains, Howdens, Tile Giant, Magnet, Jewson, Halfords (which closed in 2020) and a Plumbase. After Focus DIY went into administration, its store on the Hattersley Centre closed. An application for Asda to open in the unit was rejected in February 2011, after the application was submitted in August 2009. The centre was never fully occupied, and had been struggling since its completion. Netto closed down in August 2016, after the firm pulled out of the United Kingdom. The store had opened in November 2014. 2019 saw the Hattersley Centre expand with new units being built on adjacent unused land and occupied by Lidl and Toolstation. The expansion followed funding of £6.2M being secured from the Royal Bank of Scotland to clear the adjacent land and build new units. 

One of the last significant manufacturing businesses remaining in Ormskirk were Atkinson &amp; Kirby, who make hardwood floors and employed 80 people. They relocated in September 2015 after operating from Ormskirk for over 100 years. Businesses in the town are mainly professional and financial services, such as solicitors, estate agents, and accountants.

==Education==
Ormskirk School (ages 11–18) is on Wigan Road in the east of the town, situated on a site formerly home to the demolished Cross Hall High School. The school is now part of the Endeavour Learning Trust. Ormskirk School is the result of a merger between Ormskirk Grammar School and Cross Hall High School. St Bede&#x27;s Catholic High School (ages 11–16) is on St Anne&#x27;s Road next to the A59 and Prescot Road, and opposite St Anne&#x27;s Church. Edge Hill University is on the A570 St Helens Road heading east. West Lancashire College, a further education college, used to have a site in the town centre on Hants Lane but its students now have to travel to Skelmersdale. Ormskirk is also home to a public library.
==Media==
The &quot;Ormskirk Advertiser&quot;, a Reach plc title, is the local newspaper; it shares a website with the &quot;Liverpool Echo.&quot; The town was formerly also served by the &quot;Champion&quot;, which closed in 2022. Sandgrounder Radio and Radio Heartbeat broadcast to patients at the Ormskirk District General Hospital.

==Parks and open spaces==
The town has three main parks and a number of other smaller play areas and open spaces. The main parks are:-
* Victoria Park, named after Queen Victoria, is Ormskirk&#x27;s oldest park, established towards the end of the 19th century. It contains a monument to local heroes of the Boer War and Crimean War. It is located on the triangle of land between Knowsley Road, St Helens Road and Ruff Lane.
* Coronation Park, a large park in the town centre on Park Road, which has children&#x27;s play areas, skateboard area, games area for football and basketball, fitness equipment, duck pond, bowling green, bandstand and wildlife meadow. The Park was established in about 1905 by the former Ormskirk Urban District to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII. In 2012 the Ormskirk War Memorial was relocated here from its original site in front of the former Comrades&#x27; Club on Southport Road.
* Ruff Wood, a countryside park on the edge of the town, on Ruff Lane.

<text>USNS &quot;Bob Hope&quot; (T-AKR-300), the lead ship of its class of vehicle cargo ships for United States Army vehicle prepositioning, was a naval ship of the United States named after Bob Hope, the entertainer. Very few ships of the United States Navy have been named after a person who was alive at the time of the christening.

The contract to build her was awarded to Avondale Industries on 2 September 1993 and her keel was laid down on 29 May 1995. She was launched on 27 March 1997, and delivered on 18 November 1998.

A non-combatant roll-on/roll-off (RORO) vessel crewed by U.S. civilian mariners under the Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command, &quot;Bob Hope&quot; and other ships of the class are used to preposition tanks, trucks and other wheeled vehicles and supplies needed to support an army heavy brigade.

She has seen service delivering supplies and equipment to the Balkans and Iraq.

&quot;Bob Hope&quot; was transferred to Marad on 19 December 2022.

==Features==
The ship has two 110-ton Hagglunds deck crane pedestals mounted with twin cranes.

<doc id="296311" wikidata="Q2660437" url="?curid=296311" title="Whig history">
<text>Whig history (or Whig historiography) is an approach to historiography that presents history as a journey from an oppressive and benighted past to a &quot;glorious present&quot;. The present described is generally one with modern forms of liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy: it was originally a term for the metanarratives praising Britain&#x27;s adoption of constitutional monarchy and the historical development of the Westminster system. The term has also been applied widely in historical disciplines outside of British history (e.g. in the history of science) to describe &quot;any subjection of history to what is essentially a teleological view of the historical process&quot;. When the term is used in contexts other than British history, &quot;whig history&quot; (lowercase) is preferred.

In the British context, whig historians emphasize the rise of constitutional government, personal freedoms and scientific progress. The term is often applied generally (and pejoratively) to histories that present the past as the inexorable march of progress towards enlightenment. The term is also used extensively in the history of science to refer to historiography that focuses on the successful chains of theories and experiments that led to present-day theories, while ignoring failed theories and dead ends.

Whig history laid the groundwork for modernization theory and the resulting deployment of development aid around the world after World War II, which has sometimes been criticized as destructive to its recipients.

== Terminology ==
The British historian Herbert Butterfield used the term &quot;Whig history&quot; in his short but influential book &quot;The Whig Interpretation of History&quot; (1931). It takes its name from the British Whigs, advocates of the power of Parliament, who opposed the Tories, advocates of the power of the king.

Butterfield&#x27;s usage of the term was not in relation to the British or American Whig parties or Whiggism, but rather took aim at &quot;the nineteenth-century school of historiography that praised all progress and habitually associated Protestantism with liberal views of liberty&quot;. The terms &quot;whig&quot; and &quot;whiggish&quot; are now used broadly, becoming &quot;universal descriptors for all progressive narratives&quot;.

When H. A. L. Fisher gave a Raleigh lecture in 1928, he implied that the &quot;whig historians&quot; really were Whigs (i.e. associated with the Whig party or its Liberal successor) and had written centrist histories that were &quot;good history despite their enthusiasm for Gladstonian or Liberal Unionist causes&quot;; on introduction the term was mostly approbatory, unlike Butterfield&#x27;s later use, since Fisher applauded Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;instructive and illuminating&quot; history. By the time Butterfield wrote his &quot;Whig Interpretation&quot;, he may have been beating a dead horse: P. B. M. Blaas, in his 1978 book &quot;Continuity and Anachronism&quot;, argued that whig history itself had lost all vitality by 1914. Subsequent generations of academic historians have rejected Whig history because of its presentist and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal.

=== &quot;The Whig Interpretation of History&quot; ===
Butterfield&#x27;s purpose with writing his 1931 book was to criticise oversimplified narratives (or &quot;abridgements&quot;) which interpreted past events in terms of the present for the purposes of achieving &quot;drama and apparent moral clarity&quot;. Butterfield especially noted:

Butterfield argued that this approach to history compromised the work of the historian in several ways. The emphasis on the inevitability of progress leads to the mistaken belief that the progressive sequence of events becomes &quot;a line of causation&quot;, tempting the historian to go no further to investigate the causes of historical change. The focus on the present as the goal of historical change leads the historian to a special kind of &quot;abridgement&quot;, selecting only those events that seem important from the present point of view.

He also criticised it for modernising the past: &quot;the result [of whig history] is that to many of us [historical figures] seem much more modern than they really were, and even when we have corrected this impression by closer study we find it difficult to keep in mind the differences between their world and ours&quot;.

Whig history is also criticised as having an overly dualist view with heroes on the side of liberty and freedom against traditionalist villains opposing the inevitability of progress. It also casts an overly negative view of opposing parties to heroes described, taking such parties &quot;to have contributed nothing to the making of the present&quot; and at worst converting them into a &quot;dummy that acts as a better foil to the grand whig virtues&quot;. Butterfield illustrated this by criticising views of Martin Luther and the Reformation which &quot;are inclined to write sometimes as though Protestantism in itself was somehow constituted to assist [the process of secularisation]&quot; and misconceptions that the British constitution was created by Whigs opposed by Tories rather than created by compromise and interplay mediated by then-political contingencies.

He also felt that whig history viewed the world in terms of a morality play: that &quot;[the whig historian imagines himself] inconclusive unless he can give a verdict; and studying Protestant and Catholic in the 16th century he feels that loose threads are still left hanging unless he can show which party was in the right&quot;.

Butterfield instead advances a view of history stressing the accidental and contingent nature of events rather than some kind of inevitable and structural shift. Moreover, he called upon historians &quot;to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past &#x27;for the sake of the past&#x27;, which delights in the concrete and the complex, which &#x27;goes out to meet the past&#x27;, which searches for &#x27;unlikenesses between past and present.

A decade later however, if under wartime pressure from the Second World War, Butterfield would note of the Whig interpretation that &quot;whatever it may have done to our history, it has had a wonderful effect on our politics...In every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart-strings&quot;.

=== Subsequent views ===
Butterfield&#x27;s formulation has subsequently received much attention and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalized terms is no longer academically respectable. Despite its polemical success, Butterfield&#x27;s celebrated book was criticized by David Cannadine as &quot;slight, confused, repetitive and superficial&quot;. However, of the English tradition more broadly, Cannadine wrote:

E. H. Carr in &quot;What Is History?&quot; (1961) gave Butterfield&#x27;s book the backhanded compliment of being &quot;a remarkable book in many ways&quot; noting that &quot;though it denounced the whig interpretation over some 130 pages, it did not... name a single whig except Fox, who was no historian, or a single historian save Acton, who was no whig&quot;.

Michael Bentley analyses Butterfield&#x27;s whig theory as referring to a canon of 19th-century historians in and of England (such as William Stubbs, James Anthony Froude, E. A. Freeman, J. R. Green, W. E. H. Lecky, Lord Acton, J. R. Seeley, S. R. Gardiner, C. H. Firth and J. B. Bury) that in fact excludes few except Thomas Carlyle. The theory identifies the common factors and Bentley comments:

Carlyle apart, the so-called Whigs were predominantly Christian, predominantly Anglican, thinkers for whom the Reformation supplied the critical theatre of enquiry when considering the origins of modern England. When they wrote about the history of the English constitution, as so many of them did, they approached their story from the standpoint of having Good News to relate ... If they could not have found the grandeur that they developed had they been writing half a century earlier, neither could they have supported their optimism had they lived to endure the barbarisms of the Somme and Passchendaele.

Roger Scruton takes the theory underlying whig history to be centrally concerned with social progress and reaction, with the progressives shown as victors and benefactors. According to Victor Feske, there is too much readiness to accept Butterfield&#x27;s classic formulation from 1931 as definitive.

== British whig history ==
In Britain, whig history is a view of British history that sees it as a &quot;steady evolution of British parliamentary institutions, benevolently watched over by Whig aristocrats, and steadily spreading social progress and prosperity&quot;. It described a &quot;continuity of institutions and practices since Anglo-Saxon times that lent to English history a special pedigree, one that instilled a distinctive temper in the English nation (as whigs liked to call it) and an approach to the world [which] issued in law and lent legal precedent a role in preserving or extending the freedoms of Englishmen&quot;.

Paul Rapin de Thoyras&#x27;s history of England, published in 1723, became &quot;the classic Whig history&quot; for the first half of the eighteenth century. Rapin claimed that the English had preserved their ancient constitution against the absolutist tendencies of the Stuarts. However, Rapin&#x27;s history lost its place as the standard history of England in the late 18th century and early 19th century to that of David Hume.

According to Arthur Marwick, however, Henry Hallam was the first whig historian, publishing &quot;Constitutional History of England&quot; in 1827, which &quot;greatly exaggerated the importance of &#x27;parliaments&#x27; or of bodies [whig historians] thought were parliaments&quot; while tending &quot;to interpret all political struggles in terms of the parliamentary situation in Britain [during] the nineteenth century, in terms, that is, of Whig reformers fighting the good fight against Tory defenders of the status quo&quot;.

=== David Hume ===
In &quot;The History of England&quot; (1754–1761), Hume challenged whig views of the past and the whig historians in turn attacked Hume; but they could not dent his history. In the early 19th century, some whig historians came to incorporate Hume&#x27;s views, dominant for the previous fifty years. These historians were members of the &quot;New Whigs&quot; around Charles James Fox (1749–1806) and Lord Holland (1773–1840) in opposition until 1830 and so &quot;needed a new historical philosophy&quot;. Fox himself intended to write a history of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, but only managed the first year of James II&#x27;s reign. A fragment was published in 1808. James Mackintosh then sought to write a Whig history of the Glorious Revolution, published in 1834 as the &quot;History of the Revolution in England in 1688&quot;.

=== Thomas Babington Macaulay ===
Hume still dominated English historiography, but this changed when Thomas Babington Macaulay entered the field, utilising Fox and Mackintosh&#x27;s work and manuscript collections. Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; was published in a series of volumes from 1848 to 1855. It proved an immediate success, replacing Hume&#x27;s history and becoming the new orthodoxy. As if to introduce a linear progressive view of history, the first chapter of Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; proposes:

The history of our country during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.While Macaulay was a popular and celebrated historian of the whig school, his work did not feature in Butterfield&#x27;s 1931 &quot;Whig Interpretation of History&quot;. According to Ernst Breisach, &quot;his style captivated the public as did his good sense of the past and firm whiggish convictions&quot;.

=== William Stubbs ===
William Stubbs (1825–1901), the constitutional historian and influential teacher of a generation of historians, was the author of the extremely influential &quot;Constitutional History of England&quot; (published between 1873–78) and became a crucial figure in the later survival and respectability of whig history. According to Reba Soffer,

Stubb&#x27;s history began with an imagined Anglo-Saxon past into which representative parliamentary institutions emerged and fought for control with the absolutist crown in various stages (including overreaches in during the English Civil War) before uniting in &quot;nation, church, peers and people&quot; in the Glorious Revolution. This view of events was substantially challenged: Maitland discovered in 1893 that the early &quot;parliaments&quot; had &quot;no hint of operating as a representative body but resembled instead a meeting of the King&#x27;s Council, called to meet the king&#x27;s purposes; it passed no &#x27;legislation&#x27;, but rather considered petitions or &#x27;bills&#x27; as though acting as an ultimate court of justice&quot;. Albert Pollard, writing in 1920, also shot through much of Stubbs&#x27; ideas on the representative and law-making powers of early English parliaments, pulling the emergence of a semi-independent House of Commons to the 1620s.

=== Robert Hebert Quick ===
Political history was the usual venue for whig history in Great Britain, but it also appears in other areas. Robert Hebert Quick (1831–1891) was one of the leaders of the Whig school of the history of education, along with G. A. N. Lowndes. In 1898, Quick explained the value of studying the history of educational reform, arguing that the great accomplishments of the past were cumulative and comprised the building blocks that “would raise us to a higher standing-point from which we may see much that will make the right road clearer to us”.

=== End of whig history ===
Frederic William Maitland is &quot;now universally recognised as the first practitioner of the modern discipline of history&quot;, using &quot;medieval law as a tool to prise open the mind of medieval men&quot;. Blaas, in &quot;Continuity and Anachronism&quot; (1978) discerns new methods in the work of J. H. Round, F. W. Maitland and A. F. Pollard; Bentley believes that their work &quot;contained the origins of much twentieth-century [historical] thinking in England&quot;. Marwick also positively mentions Gardiner, Seeley, Lord Acton, and T. F. Tout as transforming the teaching and study of history at British universities into a recognisable modern form.

The First World War, however, did substantial damage to whig history&#x27;s fundamental assumption of progress and improvement:

Accelerated by the sceptical power of a new breed of historian epitomized in the brilliance of F. W. Maitland, whiggery had begun its turn downwards (we are told) and met its Waterloo on the Somme ... [T]win thrusts—on the one hand cultural despair in face of a dead civilization, on the other a determination to make history say something different for the post-war generation—worked between them to put whig susceptibilities between a rock and a hard place.

Bentley also speculates that 19th-century British historiography took the form of an indirect social history which &quot;attempted to embrace society by absorbing it into the history of the state&quot;, a project gravely disrupted by the First World War and renewed questions on &quot;the pretensions of the state as an avatar of social harmony&quot;. He, however, notes that whig history has not died &quot;outside the academy&quot; and lives on partially in criticism of history as something published in &quot;a row of small-minded monographs written by authors calling themselves &#x27;doctor&#x27;, whose life-experience and sense of English culture extended no further than taking cups of tea in the Institute of Historical Research&quot;.

== Later instances and criticism ==
=== In science ===
It has been argued that the historiography of science is &quot;riddled with Whiggish history&quot;. Like other whig histories, whig history of science tends to divide historical actors into &quot;good guys&quot; who are on the side of truth (as is now known), and &quot;bad guys&quot; who opposed the emergence of these truths because of ignorance or bias. Science is seen as emerging from &quot;a series of victories over pre-scientific thinking&quot;. From this whiggish perspective, Ptolemy would be criticized because his astronomical system placed the Earth at the center of the universe while Aristarchus would be praised because he placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System. This kind of evaluation ignores historical background and the evidence that was available at a particular time: Did Aristarchus have evidence to support his idea that the Sun was at the center? Were there good reasons to reject Ptolemy&#x27;s system before the sixteenth century?

The writing of Whig history of science is especially found in the writings of scientists and general historians, while this whiggish tendency is commonly opposed by professional historians of science. Nicholas Jardine describes the changing attitude to whiggishness this way:

By the mid-1970s, it had become commonplace among historians of science to employ the terms &quot;Whig&quot; and &quot;Whiggish&quot;, often accompanied by one or more of &quot;hagiographic&quot;, &quot;internalist&quot;, &quot;triumphalist&quot;, even &quot;positivist&quot;, to denigrate grand narratives of scientific progress. At one level there is, indeed, an obvious parallel with the attacks on Whig constitutional history in the opening decades of the century. For, as P. B. M. Blaas has shown, those earlier attacks were part and parcel of a more general onslaught in the name of an autonomous, professional and scientific history, on popular, partisan and moralising historiography. Similarly, ... For post-WWII champions of the newly professionalized history of science the targets were quite different. Above all, they were out to establish a critical distance between the history of science and the teaching and promotion of the sciences. In particular, they were suspicious of the grand celebratory and didactic narratives of scientific discovery and progress that had proliferated in the inter-war years.

More recently, some scholars have argued that Whig history is essential to the history of science. At one level, &quot;the very term &#x27;the history of science&#x27; has itself profoundly Whiggish implications. One may be reasonably clear what &#x27;science&#x27; means in the 19th century and most of the 18th century. In the 17th century &#x27;science&#x27; has very different meaning. Chemistry, for example, was then inextricably mixed up with alchemy. Before the 17th century dissecting out such a thing as &#x27;science&#x27; in anything like the modern sense of the term involves profound distortions.&quot; The science historians&#x27; rejection of whiggishness has been criticised by some scientists for failing to appreciate &quot;the temporal depth of scientific research&quot;.

=== In economics ===
Retrospectives on modern macroeconomics are generally whiggish histories. For example, the popularisation of mathematical models by Paul Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot;, when viewed by economists trained in a mathematical framework becomes &quot;an important milestone on the road to the mathematization of economics&quot; in a story told by the victorious. Yet &quot;those who do not agree that such mathematization is a good thing could argue that the mathematical developments... represent a regression rather than a progression&quot;. The introduction of rational expectations similarly carries implicit hindsight bias: people who disagree on the reality of agents making decisions in the manner assumed (e.g. behavioral economics) &quot;would not necessarily rejoice in [rational expectations&#x27;] present ascendancy&quot;.

Burrow views Marxist history, with its &quot;[supposed] anticipated terminus from which it derives its moral and political point&quot;, as &quot;characteristically whig&quot;.

=== In philosophy ===
One very common example of Whig history is the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, to whom is often ascribed a teleological view of history with an inexorable trajectory in the direction of progress.

Marxists have had varied views on Whig history. The traditional inheritance of Hegel, interpreted through Engels&#x27; articulation of historical materialism, implied that history progressed from a &quot;primitive communism&quot;, through slave societies, feudal societies, capitalism, and finally to socialism and communism. However, contemporary Marxists, such as Ellen Meiksins Wood, have aggressively challenged those assumptions as deterministic and ahistorical. Walter Benjamin criticized conception of history which assumed a necessarily progressive or teleological course, though he did not employ the term &quot;Whig history&quot;. &quot;The danger affects both the content of the [progressive] tradition and its receivers. The same threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it.&quot;

=== In Canadian history ===
Regarding Canada, Allan Greer argues:
=== In the emergence of intelligent life ===
In &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot; (1986), John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler identify whiggishness with a teleological principle of convergence in history to liberal democracy. This is in line with what Barrow and Tipler call the &quot;anthropic principle&quot;.

=== In general history and biography ===
James A. Hijiya points out the persistence of whiggish history in history textbooks. In the debate over Britishness, David Marquand praised the whig approach on the grounds that &quot;ordered freedom and evolutionary progress &quot;have&quot; been among the hallmarks of modern British history, and they &quot;should&quot; command respect&quot;.

Historian Edward J. Larson in his book &quot;Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America&#x27;s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion&quot; (1997) challenged a whiggish view of the Scopes trial. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1998.

<text>A sales tax is a tax paid to a governing body for the sales of certain goods and services. Usually laws allow the seller to collect funds for the tax from the consumer at the point of purchase. When a tax on goods or services is paid to a governing body directly by a consumer, it is usually called a use tax. Often laws provide for the exemption of certain goods or services from sales and use tax, such as food, education, and medicines. A value-added tax (VAT) collected on goods and services is related to a sales tax. See Comparison with sales tax for key differences.

==Types==

Conventional or retail sales tax is levied on the sale of a good to its final end-user and is charged every time that item is sold retail. Sales to businesses that later resell the goods are not charged the tax. A purchaser who is not an end-user is usually issued a &quot;resale certificate&quot; by the taxing authority and required to provide the certificate (or its ID number) to a seller at the point of purchase, along with a statement that the item is for resale. The tax is otherwise charged on each item sold to purchasers without such a certificate and who are under the jurisdiction of the taxing authority.

Other types of sales taxes, or similar taxes:
*Manufacturers&#x27; sales tax, a tax on sales of tangible personal property by manufacturers and producers
*Wholesale sales tax, a tax on sales of wholesale of tangible personal property when in a form packaged and labeled ready for shipment or delivery to final users and consumers
*Retail sales tax, a tax on sales of retail of tangible personal property to final consumers and industrial users
*Gross receipts taxes, levied on all sales of a business. They have been criticized for their &quot;cascading&quot; or &quot;pyramiding&quot; effect, in which an item is taxed more than once as it makes its way from production to final retail sale.
*Excise taxes, applied to a narrow range of products, such as gasoline or alcohol, usually imposed on the producer or wholesaler rather than on the retail seller.
*Use tax, imposed directly on the consumer of goods purchased without sales tax, generally items purchased from a vendor not under the jurisdiction of the taxing authority (such as a vendor in another state). Use taxes are commonly imposed by states with a sales tax but are usually enforced only for large items such as automobiles and boats.
*Securities turnover excise tax, a tax on the trade of securities.
*Value added tax (VAT), in which tax is charged on all sales, thus avoiding the need for a system of resale certificates. Tax cascading is avoided by applying the tax only to the difference (&quot;value added&quot;) between the price paid by the first purchaser and the price paid by each subsequent purchaser of the same item.
*FairTax, a proposed federal sales tax, intended to replace the US federal income tax.
*Turnover tax, similar to a sales tax, but applied to intermediate and possibly capital goods as an indirect tax.

Most countries in the world have sales taxes or value-added taxes at all or several of the national, state, county, or city government levels. Countries in Western Europe, especially in Scandinavia, have some of the world&#x27;s highest valued-added taxes. Norway, Denmark and Sweden have higher VATs at 25%, Hungary has the highest at 27% although reduced rates are used in some cases, as for groceries, art, books and newspapers.

In some jurisdictions of the United States, there are multiple levels of government which each impose a sales tax. For example, sales tax in Chicago (Cook County), IL is 10.25%, consisting of 6.25% state, 1.25% city, 1.75% county and 1% regional transportation authority. Chicago also has the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority tax on food and beverage of 1% (which means eating out is taxed at 11.25%).

For Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the tax is 9.45%, which is 4.45% state &amp; 5% local. In Los Angeles it is 9.5%, which is 7.25% state &amp; 2.25% county.

Sales and use taxes in California are made up of various state, county and city taxes. The state tax is &quot;imposed upon all retailers&quot; for the &quot;privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail&quot;. Strictly speaking, only the retailer is responsible for the payment of the tax; when a retailer adds this tax to the purchase price, the consumer is merely reimbursing the retailer by contractual agreement. When consumers purchase goods from out-of-state (in which case the seller owes no tax to California) the consumer is required to pay a &quot;use tax&quot; identical to the sales tax. Use tax is levied upon the &quot;storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property&quot;. Consumers are responsible for declaring these purchases in the same filing as their annual state income tax, but it is rare for them to do so. An exception is out-of-state purchase of automobiles. Then, use tax is collected by the state as part of registering the vehicle in California.

The global trend has been for conventional sales taxes to be replaced by more broadly based value-added taxes. Value-added taxes provide an estimated 20% of worldwide tax revenue and have been adopted by more than 140 countries. The United States is now one of the few countries to retain conventional sales taxes.

==Electronic commerce==
Sales tax on online purchasers operates in a different manner. Generally, there are four types of electronic commerce: intermediaries, retail, business-to-business and media, all of which are affected by consumer response to sales tax. However, while consumers are technically supposed to pay a sales tax when it comes to cross state border transactions, the practicality of enforcing it is impossible. As a result, online retail stores have had a distinct advantage in that they do not have to charge a sales tax. That has led many economists to examine consumer sensitivity when it comes to sales taxes. While some researchers have concluded a high elasticity of online purchase probability with respect to sales tax at around 2.3, others have found smaller figures of around 0.5. That means that enforcing an online sales tax would have negligible effects on aggregate sales.

==Effects==
Economists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development studied the effects of various types of taxes on the economic growth of developed nations within the OECD and found that sales taxes are one of the least harmful taxes for growth.

Because the rate of a sales tax does not change based on a person&#x27;s income or wealth, sales taxes are generally considered regressive. However, it has been suggested that any regressive effect of a sales tax could be mitigated, e.g., by excluding rent, or by exempting &quot;necessary&quot; items, such as food, clothing and medicines. Investopedia defines a regressive tax as &quot;[a] tax that takes a larger percentage from low-income people than from high-income people. A regressive tax is generally a tax that is applied uniformly. This means that it hits lower-income individuals harder&quot;.

===Effects on local economies===

Higher sales taxes have been shown to have many different effects on local economies. With higher taxes, more consumers are starting to reconsider where they shop, according to a study conducted in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where the sales tax was raised on cigarettes. Effects of higher sales tax were not shown immediately in sales, but about six months after the taxes were raised. High sales taxes can be used to relieve property taxes but only when property taxes are lowered subsequently. Studies that have shown this correlation were conducted in Georgia by cities raising sales tax and lowering property taxes. To combat sales loss, a city must be able to import consumers to buy goods locally. If local sales taxes are too high, consumers will travel to other areas to purchase goods.

===Enforcement of tax on remote sales===
In the United States, every state with a sales tax law has a use tax component in that law applying to purchases from out-of-state mail order, catalog and e-commerce vendors, a category also known as &quot;remote sales&quot;. As e-commerce sales have grown in recent years, noncompliance with use tax has had a growing impact on state revenues. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that uncollected use taxes on remote sales in 2003 could be as high as $20.4 billion. Uncollected use tax on remote sales was projected to run as high as $54.8 billion for 2011.

Enforcement of the tax on remote sales, however, is difficult. Unless the vendor has a physical location, or &quot;nexus&quot;, within a state, the vendor cannot be required to collect tax for that state. This limitation was defined as part of the Dormant Commerce Clause by the Supreme Court in the 1967 decision on National Bellas Hess v. Illinois. An attempt to require a Delaware e-commerce vendor to collect North Dakota tax was overturned by the court in the 1992 decision on Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. A number of observers and commentators have argued, so far unsuccessfully, for a Congressional adoption of this physical presence nexus test.

The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 established a commission to study the possibility of internet taxation, but the commission did not make any formal recommendations. In a report issued in 2003, the Congressional Budget Office warned of the economic burden of a &quot;multiplicity of tax systems, particularly for smaller firms&quot;.

In an effort to reduce the burden of compliance with the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, the Streamlined Sales Tax Project was organized in March 2000. Cooperative efforts in this project by 44 state governments and the District of Columbia eventually produced the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement in 2010. This agreement establishes standards necessary for simplified and uniform sales tax laws. As of December 2010, 24 states had passed legislation conforming with the agreement. Whether the Streamlined Sales Tax can actually be applied to remote sales ultimately depends upon Congressional support, because the 1992 Quill v. North Dakota decision determined that only the U.S. Congress has the authority to enact interstate taxes.

=== Effect of electronic commerce ===
Electronic commerce business can also be affected by consumption taxes. It can be separated into four categories: retail, intermediaries, business-to-business and media (Goldfarb 2008). These categories were affected varying degrees. The intermediaries were affected by the retail sales tax since it provides platforms for transitions between different parties (such as the Amazon marketplace). Business-to-Business transactions will be placed in different circumstances by whether the case will be taxed in the US. Electronic commerce goods are usually not taxed the same especially across the stats in the US. Different states have their own sales tax regulations, for example, some states use their standard sales taxes law for the digital goods, and some of the states have specific laws for them. It is difficult to enforce the taxes on electronic commerce especially for digital goods that trade across different countries.

The effect that a sales tax has on consumer and producer behavior is rather large. The price elasticity of demand for online products is high, meaning that consumers are price sensitive and their demand will significantly change with small changes in price. This means that the tax burden lies primarily with the producer. To avoid altering demand, the producer will either avoid the tax if possible by relocating their fulfillment centers to areas without a high sales tax or they will internalize the cost of the sales tax by charging consumers the same price but paying for the tax from their profits.

==History==

===Early examples===
A tax imposed on the sale of goods is depicted on the walls of Egyptians tombs, which have been dated as far back as 2000 BC. These paintings describe the collection of tax for specific commodities, such as cooking oil.

Sales tax amounts, measured in drachmas at a rate of one percent, were recorded in a separate column of a record prepared for the auction of 16 slaves in Piraeus, Greece in 415 BC. Nearby Athens collected duties on the import and export of commodities, recorded at a rate of two percent in 399 BC. At that period of time, Athens did not rely on government agencies to collect its taxes; the responsibility was delegated to the highest bidder, a practice known as tax farming.

The Roman emperor Augustus collected funds for his military aerarium in AD 6 with a one percent general sales tax, known as the &quot;centesima rerum venalium&quot; (hundredth of the value of everything sold). The Roman sales tax was later reduced to a half percent (&quot;ducentesima&quot;) by Tiberius, then abolished completely by Caligula.

===In the United States===

Although the United States government has never used a general sales tax, an excise tax on whiskey enacted in 1791 was one of its first fund raising efforts. The unpopularity of this tax with farmers on the western frontier led to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.

Federal and state sales taxes in the United States remained selective, rather than general, through the 19th century. However, excise taxes were applied to so many specific commodities during the Civil War that they functioned collectively as a general sales tax.

The first broad-based, general sales taxes in the United States were enacted by Kentucky and Mississippi in 1930, although Kentucky repealed its sales tax in 1936.

The federal government&#x27;s per-gallon tax of gasoline (beginning at one cent per gallon in 1932) and per-package tax of cigarettes ($1.01 per package since 2009) are the most well-known current sales taxes administered by the federal government.

Twenty-two other states began imposing general sales taxes later in the 1930s, followed by six in the 1940s and five in the 1950s. Kentucky re-enacted its sales tax law in 1960. Eleven more states enacted sales tax laws during the 1960s, with Vermont as the last in 1969. Five states currently do not have general sales taxes: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon.

The 2010 health care reform law imposed a 10 percent federal sales tax on indoor tanning services, effective July 1, 2010. Unlike previous federal excise taxes, this tax is collected directly from the consumer by the seller and based on the sale price rather than a quantity. However, the new tax is &quot;selective&quot; rather than general, applying only to a specific service.

===In Canada===

Canada uses a value-added federal Goods and Services Tax with a rate of 5 percent, effective since January 1, 2008. Alberta, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have no territorial sales taxes, so only the GST is collected. Other provinces have either a Provincial Sales Tax (PST) or the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), which is a single, blended combination of the GST and PST.

==Sales tax mitigation==
Businesses can reduce the impact of sales tax for themselves and their customers by planning for the tax consequences of all activities. Sales tax reduction or mitigation strategies can include the following:
* Designing invoices to reduce the taxable portion of a sale transaction. In Maryland, for example, a delivery charge is exempt if it is stated separately from handling and other taxable charges.
* New facilities. Jurisdictions with no sales tax or broad exemptions for certain types of business operations would be an obvious consideration in selecting a site for a new manufacturing plant, warehouse, or administrative office.
* Delivery location. For a business operating in several jurisdictions, choosing the best location in which to take delivery can reduce or eliminate the sales tax liability. That is particularly important for an item to be sold or used in another jurisdiction with a lower tax rate or an exemption for that item. Businesses should consider whether a temporary storage exemption applies to merchandise initially accepted in a jurisdiction with a higher tax rate.
* Periodic review of record-keeping procedures related to sales and use tax. Proper supporting detail, including exemption and resale certificates, invoices and other records must be available to defend the company in the event of a sales and use tax audit. Without proper documentation, a seller may be held liable for tax not collected from a buyer.

<text>Steven Berkoff (born Leslie Steven Berks; 3 August 1937) is an English actor, author, playwright, theatre practitioner and theatre director. 

As a theatre maker he is recognised for staging work with a heightened performance style known as &quot;Berkovian theatre&quot;, which combines elements of physical theatre, total theatre and expressionism. His work has sometimes been viewed as an example of in-yer-face theatre, due to the intense presentation and taboo-breaking material in a number of his plays. 

As a screen actor, he is known for his performances in villainous roles, including the portrayals of General Orlov in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), Victor Maitland in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), Lt. Col. Podovsky in &quot;&quot; (1985) and Adolf Hitler in &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988–89).

==Early life==
Berkoff was born Leslie Steven Berks on 3 August 1937, in Stepney in the East End of London, the son of Pauline &quot;Polly&quot; (née Hyman), a housewife, and Alfred &quot;Al&quot; Berks, a tailor. He had an older sister, Beryl (1930–before 2010). He comes from a Jewish family; his grandparents emigrated to England in the 1890s, his paternal grandparents from Romania, and his maternal grandparents from Russia. The family name was originally Berkowitz, but Steven&#x27;s father anglicised it to Berks in order to aid the family&#x27;s assimilation into British society. Steven (who had been known as Leslie growing up) later legally changed his surname to Berkoff and went by his middle name.

During World War II, Berkoff, his sister and their mother were evacuated to Luton, Bedfordshire in 1942. In 1947 he and his family emigrated to the United States, sailing from Southampton aboard the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to live with relatives of Berkoff&#x27;s mother in Nyack, New York. However, Berkoff&#x27;s father struggled to find work, and after a few months the family returned to England. Berkoff attended Raine&#x27;s Foundation Grammar School (1948–50) and Hackney Downs School (1950–55). 

In 1952, he was arrested for stealing a bicycle and was sentenced to three months in borstal. He took drama courses at City Literary Institute (1957–58), trained as an actor at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art (1958–59), and later trained in physical theatre and mime at L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, graduating in 1965.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Berkoff started his theatre training in the Repertory Company at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Barrow-in-Furness, for approximately two months, in June and July 1962.

As well as an actor, Berkoff is a noted playwright and theatre director. His earliest plays are adaptations of works by Franz Kafka: &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (1969); &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Trial&quot; (1971). In the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote a series of verse plays including &quot;East&quot; (1975), &quot;Greek&quot; (1980), and &quot;Decadence&quot; (1981), followed by &quot;West&quot; (1983) (later adapted and recorded at Limehouse Studios for transmission on Channel 4 in 1983), &quot;Harry&#x27;s Christmas (Lunch)&quot; (also recorded at Limehouse Studios in 1983 but was never transmitted by C4 as it was considered &quot;too dark&quot;), &quot;Sink the Belgrano!&quot; (1986), &quot;Massage&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Secret Love Life of Ophelia&quot; (2001). Berkoff described &quot;Sink the Belgrano!&quot; as &quot;even by my modest standards... one of the best things I have done&quot;.

Drama critic Aleks Sierz describes Berkoff&#x27;s dramatic style as &quot;In-yer-face theatre&quot;:
In 1988, Berkoff directed an interpretation of &quot;Salome&quot; by Oscar Wilde, performed in slow motion, at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. For his first directorial job at the UK&#x27;s Royal National Theatre, Berkoff revived the play with a new cast at the Lyttelton Auditorium; it opened in November 1989. In 1998, his solo play &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Villains&quot; premièred at London&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre and was nominated for a Society of London Theatre Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment.

In a 2010 interview with guest presenter Emily Maitlis on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;, Berkoff stated that he found it &quot;flattering&quot; to play evil characters, saying that the best actors assumed villainous roles. In 2011, Berkoff revived a previously performed one-man show at the Hammersmith Riverside Studios, titled &quot;One Man&quot;. It consisted of two monologues; the first was an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, the second a piece called &quot;Dog&quot;, written by Berkoff, which was a comedy about a loud-mouthed football fan and his dog. In 2013, Berkoff performed his play &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Lament&quot; at the Sinden Theatre in Tenterden, Kent; it is his first verse play since &quot;Decadence&quot; in 1981. His 2018 one-act play &quot;Harvey&quot; deals with the story of Harvey Weinstein.

===Film===
In film, Berkoff has played villains such as Soviet General Orlov in the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), the corrupt art dealer Victor Maitland in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), the Soviet officer Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky in &quot;&quot; (1985), and gangster George Cornell in &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990). Berkoff has stated that he accepts roles in Hollywood only to subsidise his theatre work, and that he regards many of the films in which he has appeared as lacking artistic merit.

In the Stanley Kubrick films &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971) and &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), Berkoff played, respectively, a police officer and a gambler aristocrat. His other films include the Hammer film &quot;Prehistoric Women&quot; (1967), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;The Passenger&quot; (1975), &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1977), &quot;McVicar&quot; (1980), &quot;Outland&quot; (1981), &quot;Coming Out of the Ice&quot; (1982), &quot;Underworld&quot; (1985), &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985), &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986), Prince&#x27;s film &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; (1986), &quot;Prisoner of Rio&quot; (1988), the Australian film &quot;Flynn&quot; (1993), &quot;Fair Game&quot; (1995), and &quot;Legionnaire&quot; (1998).

Berkoff was the main character voice in &quot;Expelling the Demon&quot; (1999), a short animation with music by Nick Cave. It received the award for Best Debut at the KROK International Animated Films Festival. He has a cameo in the 2008 film &quot;The Cottage&quot;. Berkoff appeared in the 2010 British gangster film &quot;The Big I Am&quot; as &quot;The MC&quot;, and in the same year, portrayed the antagonist in &quot;The Tourist&quot;. Berkoff portrayed Dirch Frode, attorney to Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), in David Fincher&#x27;s 2011 adaptation of &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. Another 2011 credit is the independent film &quot;Moving Target&quot;. He also stars in &quot;Decline of an Empire&quot; (2014) playing the role of Liberius.

In 1994, he both appeared in and directed the film version of his verse play &quot;Decadence&quot;. Filmed in Luxembourg, it co-stars Joan Collins.

===Television===
In television, Berkoff had early roles in episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;UFO&quot; episodes &quot;The Cat with Ten Lives&quot; and &quot;Destruction’ in 1970. Other TV credits include: Hagath, in the episode &quot;Business as Usual&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;; Stilgar, in the mini-series &quot;Children of Dune&quot;; gangster Mr. Wiltshire in one episode of &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;; Dr. Paul Jorry in the episode &quot;Deadline&quot; of &quot;Space Precinct&quot;; lawyer Freddie Eccles in &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot;, an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;; and Adolf Hitler in the mini-series &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. In 1998, he made a guest appearance in the Canadian TV series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (in the episode &quot;In Between&quot;). In 2006, he played celebrity/criminal Ray Cook in the &quot;New Tricks&quot; episode &quot;Bank Robbery&quot;.

In 2010, Berkoff played former Granada Television chairman Sidney Bernstein for the BBC Four drama, &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;. In the same year, he presented the BBC Horizon episode &quot;To Infinity and Beyond&quot;. He has played the historical Florentine preacher Girolamo Savonarola in two separate TV productions: the 1990 TV film &quot;A Season of Giants&quot; and the 2011 series &quot;The Borgias&quot;. Berkoff appears as himself in the &quot;Science&quot; episode of the British current affairs satire &quot;Brass Eye&quot; (1997), warning against the dangers of the fictional environmental disaster &quot;Heavy Electricity&quot;. In September 2012, Berkoff appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Power of Three&quot;.

In 2014, Berkoff played a supporting role in the second season of the Lifetime TV show &quot;Witches of East End&quot; as King Nikolaus, the patriarch of the Beauchamp family.

In 2016, he appeared in series 3, episode 1 of the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Man Down&quot; as Mr. Klackov, a &quot;terrifying&quot; caretaker with an Eastern European accent &quot;who makes covering [series protagonist] Dan&#x27;s mistakes even more complicated&quot; when his job as a schoolteacher is threatened.

===Other work===
In 1996, Berkoff appeared as the Master of Ceremonies in a BBC Radio 2 concert version of Kander and Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot;. He provided the voice-over for the N-Trance single &quot;The Mind of the Machine&quot;, which rose to No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1997. He appeared in the opening sequence to Sky Sports&#x27; coverage of the 2007 Heineken Cup Final, modelled on a speech by Al Pacino in the film &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999).

Berkoff voices the character General Lente, commander of the Helghan Third Army, in &quot;Killzone&quot;. He provides motion capture and voice performance for the PlayStation 3 game &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, as General Flying Fox.

Berkoff&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Sod the Bitches&quot; was described by Guardian critic Stuart Jeffries as &quot;a kind of Philip Roth-like romp through the sex life of a libidinous actor&quot;. His 2014 memoir &quot;Bad Guy! Journal of a Hollywood Turkey&quot; records his time working on a Hollywood blockbuster.

Berkoff appeared in the British Heart Foundation&#x27;s two-minute public service advertisement, &quot;Watch Your Own Heart Attack&quot;, broadcast on ITV in August 2008. He also presented two episodes of the BBC Two &quot;Horizon&quot; episodes: &quot;To Infinity and Beyond...&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Power of the Placebo&quot; (2014).

He is a patron of Brighton&#x27;s Nightingale Theatre, a fringe theatre venue.

===Critical assessment===
According to Annette Pankratz in her 2005 &quot;Modern Drama&quot; review of &quot;Steven Berkoff and the Theatre of Self-Performance&quot; by Robert Cross: &quot;Steven Berkoff is one of the major minor contemporary dramatists in Britain anddue to his self-fashioning as a bad boy of British theatre and the ensuing attention of the media – a phenomenon in his own right.&quot; Pankratz further asserts that Cross &quot;focuses on Berkoff&#x27;s theatre of self-performance: that is, the intersections between Berkoff, the public phenomenon and Berkoff, the artist.&quot;

==Personal life==
Berkoff married Alison Minto in 1970, and Shelley Lee in 1976; both marriages ended in divorce. He lives with his wife Clara Fischer, a German pianist, in Limehouse, east London. Fischer appeared onscreen with Berkoff in his film &quot;Decadence&quot;. He has two daughters, Mylea and Sarah, from previous relationships.

===Defamation lawsuit===
In 1996, Berkoff won &quot;Berkoff vs. Burchill&quot;, a libel civil action that he brought against &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist Julie Burchill after she published comments suggesting that he was &quot;hideously ugly&quot;. The judge ruled for Berkoff, finding that Burchill&#x27;s actions &quot;held him to ridicule and contempt.&quot;

===Political and religious views===
Berkoff has spoken and written about how he believes Jews and Israel to be regarded in Britain. In a January 2009 interview with &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, in which he discussed anti-Israel sentiment in the aftermath of the Gaza War, he said: Interviewer Simon Round noted that Berkoff was also keen to express his view that right-wing Israeli politicians, such as Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu, were &quot;wretched&quot;. Asked if British antisemitism manifested itself in theatre, Berkoff responded: &quot;They quite like diversity and will tolerate you as long as you act a bit Gentile and don&#x27;t throw your chicken soup around too much. You are perfectly entitled occasionally even to touch the great prophet of British culture, Shakespeare, as long as you keep your Jewishness well zipped up.&quot; Berkoff also referred to the Gaza war as a factor in writing &quot;Biblical Tales&quot;: &quot;It was the recent &#x27;Gaza&#x27; war and the appalling flack that Israel received that prompted me to investigate ancient Jewish values.&quot;

Speaking to &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in May 2010, Berkoff criticised the Bible but added, &quot;it inspires the Jews to produce Samsons and heroes and to have pride&quot;. Berkoff went on to say of the Talmud in the same article: &quot;As Jews, we are so incredibly lucky to have the Talmud, to have a way of re-interpreting the Torah. So we no longer cut off hands, and slay animals, and stone women.&quot;

In a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; travel article written while visiting Israel in 2007, Berkoff described Melanie Phillips&#x27; book &quot;&quot;, as &quot;quite overwhelming in its research and common sense. It grips me throughout the journey.&quot;

In 2012, Berkoff, with others, wrote in support of Israel&#x27;s national theatre, Habima, performing in London.

In 2015, Berkoff expressed his view that white actors should be allowed to play the classic Shakespearean role of Othello, referring to any efforts to restrict the character’s casting as &quot;racism in reverse&quot;.

==References in popular culture==
In the 1989 romantic comedy &quot;The Tall Guy&quot;, struggling actor Dexter King (Jeff Goldblum) auditions unsuccessfully for an imaginary &quot;Berkoff play&quot; called &quot;England, My England&quot;. In the audition, characters dressed as skinheads swear repetitively at each other and a folding table is kicked over. Afterwards, Dexter&#x27;s agent Mary (Anna Massey) muses, &quot;I think he&#x27;s probably mad ...&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m scared of Steven Berkoff&quot; is a line in the lyrics of the song &quot;I&#x27;m Scared&quot; by Queen guitarist Brian May, issued on his 1993 debut solo album &quot;Back to the Light&quot;. May has declared himself to be an admirer of Berkoff and his wife, Anita Dobson, has appeared in several of Berkoff&#x27;s plays.

<text>In mathematics, in particular the theory of Lie algebras, the Weyl group (named after Hermann Weyl) of a root system Φ is a subgroup of the isometry group of that root system. Specifically, it is the subgroup which is generated by reflections through the hyperplanes orthogonal to at least one of the roots, and as such is a finite reflection group. In fact it turns out that &quot;most&quot; finite reflection groups are Weyl groups. Abstractly, Weyl groups are finite Coxeter groups, and are important examples of these.

The Weyl group of a semisimple Lie group, a semisimple Lie algebra, a semisimple linear algebraic group, etc. is the Weyl group of the root system of that group or algebra.

==Definition and examples==

Let formula_1 be a root system in a Euclidean space formula_2. For each root formula_3, let formula_4 denote the reflection about the hyperplane perpendicular to formula_5, which is given explicitly as
:formula_6,
where formula_7 is the inner product on formula_2. The Weyl group formula_9 of formula_1 is the subgroup of the orthogonal group formula_11 generated by all the formula_4&#x27;s. By the definition of a root system, each formula_4 preserves formula_1, from which it follows that formula_9 is a finite group.

In the case of the formula_16 root system, for example, the hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots are just lines, and the Weyl group is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, as indicated in the figure. As a group, formula_9 is isomorphic to the permutation group on three elements, which we may think of as the vertices of the triangle. Note that in this case, formula_9 is not the full symmetry group of the root system; a 60-degree rotation preserves formula_1 but is not an element of formula_9.

We may consider also the formula_21 root system. In this case, formula_2 is the space of all vectors in formula_23 whose entries sum to zero. The roots consist of the vectors of the form formula_24, where formula_25 is the formula_26th standard basis element for formula_23. The reflection associated to such a root is the transformation of formula_2 obtained by interchanging the formula_26th and formula_30th entries of each vector. The Weyl group for formula_21 is then the permutation group on formula_32 elements.

==Weyl chambers==

If formula_33 is a root system, we may consider the hyperplane perpendicular to each root formula_5. Recall that formula_4 denotes the reflection about the hyperplane and that the Weyl group is the group of transformations of formula_2 generated by all the formula_4&#x27;s. The complement of the set of hyperplanes is disconnected, and each connected component is called a Weyl chamber. If we have fixed a particular set Δ of simple roots, we may define the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to Δ as the set of points formula_38 such that formula_39 for all formula_40.

Since the reflections formula_41 preserve formula_1, they also preserve the set of hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. Thus, each Weyl group element permutes the Weyl chambers.

The figure illustrates the case of the A2 root system. The &quot;hyperplanes&quot; (in this case, one dimensional) orthogonal to the roots are indicated by dashed lines. The six 60-degree sectors are the Weyl chambers and the shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to the indicated base.

A basic general theorem about Weyl chambers is this:
:Theorem: The Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. Thus, the order of the Weyl group is equal to the number of Weyl chambers.
A related result is this one:
:Theorem: Fix a Weyl chamber formula_43. Then for all formula_38, the Weyl-orbit of formula_45 contains exactly one point in the closure formula_46 of formula_43.

==Coxeter group structure==
===Generating set===
A key result about the Weyl group is this:
:Theorem: If formula_48 is base for formula_1, then the Weyl group is generated by the reflections formula_4 with formula_5 in formula_48.
That is to say, the group generated by the reflections formula_53 is the same as the group generated by the reflections formula_41.

===Relations===
Meanwhile, if formula_5 and formula_56 are in formula_48, then the Dynkin diagram for formula_1 relative to the base formula_48 tells us something about how the pair formula_60 behaves. Specifically, suppose formula_45 and formula_62 are the corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. Then we have the following results:
*If there is no bond between formula_45 and formula_62, then formula_4 and formula_66 commute. Since formula_4 and formula_66 each have order two, this is equivalent to saying that formula_69.
*If there is one bond between formula_45 and formula_62, then formula_72.
*If there are two bonds between formula_45 and formula_62, then formula_75.
*If there are three bonds between formula_45 and formula_62, then formula_78.
The preceding claim is not hard to verify, if we simply remember what the Dynkin diagram tells us about the angle between each pair of roots. If, for example, there is no bond between the two vertices, then formula_5 and formula_56 are orthogonal, from which it follows easily that the corresponding reflections commute. More generally, the number of bonds determines the angle formula_81 between the roots. The product of the two reflections is then a rotation by angle formula_82 in the plane spanned by formula_5 and formula_56, as the reader may verify, from which the above claim follows easily.

===As a Coxeter group===
Weyl groups are examples of finite reflection groups, as they are generated by reflections; the abstract groups (not considered as subgroups of a linear group) are accordingly finite Coxeter groups, which allows them to be classified by their Coxeter–Dynkin diagram. Being a Coxeter group means that a Weyl group has a special kind of presentation in which each generator &quot;xi&quot; is of order two, and the relations other than &quot;xi2=1&quot; are of the form (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;)&quot;m&quot;&quot;ij&quot;=1. The generators are the reflections given by simple roots, and &quot;mij&quot; is 2, 3, 4, or 6 depending on whether roots &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; make an angle of 90, 120, 135, or 150 degrees, i.e., whether in the Dynkin diagram they are unconnected, connected by a simple edge, connected by a double edge, or connected by a triple edge. We have already noted these relations in the bullet points above, but to say that formula_9 is a Coxeter group, we are saying that those are the &quot;only&quot; relations in formula_9.

Weyl groups have a Bruhat order and length function in terms of this presentation: the &quot;length&quot; of a Weyl group element is the length of the shortest word representing that element in terms of these standard generators. There is a unique longest element of a Coxeter group, which is opposite to the identity in the Bruhat order.

==Weyl groups in algebraic, group-theoretic, and geometric settings==
Above, the Weyl group was defined as a subgroup of the isometry group of a root system. There are also various definitions of Weyl groups specific to various group-theoretic and geometric contexts (Lie algebra, Lie group, symmetric space, etc.). For each of these ways of defining Weyl groups, it is a (usually nontrivial) theorem that it is a Weyl group in the sense of the definition at the top of this article, namely the Weyl group of some root system associated with the object. A concrete realization of such a Weyl group usually depends on a choice – e.g. of Cartan subalgebra for a Lie algebra, of maximal torus for a Lie group.

===The Weyl group of a connected compact Lie group===
Let formula_87 be a connected compact Lie group and let formula_88 be a maximal torus in formula_87. We then introduce the normalizer of formula_88 in formula_87, denoted formula_92 and defined as
:formula_93.
We also define the centralizer of formula_88 in formula_87, denoted formula_96 and defined as
:formula_97.
The Weyl group formula_9 of formula_87 (relative to the given maximal torus formula_88) is then defined initially as
:formula_101.
Eventually, one proves that formula_102, at which point one has an alternative description of the Weyl group as
:formula_103.

Now, one can define a root system formula_1 associated to the pair formula_105; the roots are the nonzero weights of the adjoint action of formula_88 on the Lie algebra of formula_87. For each formula_3, one can construct an element formula_109 of formula_92 whose action on formula_88 has the form of reflection. With a bit more effort, one can show that these reflections generate all of formula_112. Thus, in the end, the Weyl group as defined as formula_113 or formula_112 is isomorphic to the Weyl group of the root system formula_1.

===In other settings===

For a complex semisimple Lie algebra, the Weyl group is simply &quot;defined&quot; as the reflection group generated by reflections in the roots – the specific realization of the root system depending on a choice of Cartan subalgebra.

For a Lie group &quot;G&quot; satisfying certain conditions, given a torus &quot;T&quot; &lt; &quot;G&quot; (which need not be maximal), the Weyl group &quot;with respect to&quot; that torus is defined as the quotient of the normalizer of the torus &quot;N&quot; = &quot;N&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = &quot;NG&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) by the centralizer of the torus &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = &quot;ZG&quot;(&quot;T&quot;),

:formula_116

The group &quot;W&quot; is finite – &quot;Z&quot; is of finite index in &quot;N&quot;. If &quot;T&quot; = &quot;T&quot;0 is a maximal torus (so it equals its own centralizer: formula_117) then the resulting quotient &quot;N&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/&quot;T&quot; is called &quot;the&quot; Weyl group of &quot;G&quot;, and denoted &quot;W&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). Note that the specific quotient set depends on a choice of maximal torus, but the resulting groups are all isomorphic (by an inner automorphism of &quot;G&quot;), since maximal tori are conjugate.

If &quot;G&quot; is compact and connected, and &quot;T&quot; is a &quot;maximal&quot; torus, then the Weyl group of &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the Weyl group of its Lie algebra, as discussed above.

For example, for the general linear group &quot;GL,&quot; a maximal torus is the subgroup &quot;D&quot; of invertible diagonal matrices, whose normalizer is the generalized permutation matrices (matrices in the form of permutation matrices, but with any non-zero numbers in place of the &#x27;1&#x27;s), and whose Weyl group is the symmetric group. In this case the quotient map &quot;N&quot; → &quot;N&quot;/&quot;T&quot; splits (via the permutation matrices), so the normalizer &quot;N&quot; is a semidirect product of the torus and the Weyl group, and the Weyl group can be expressed as a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. In general this is not always the case – the quotient does not always split, the normalizer &quot;N&quot; is not always the semidirect product of &quot;W&quot; and &quot;Z,&quot; and the Weyl group cannot always be realized as a subgroup of &quot;G.&quot;

==Bruhat decomposition==
If &quot;B&quot; is a Borel subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, i.e., a maximal connected solvable subgroup and a maximal torus &quot;T&quot; = &quot;T&quot;0 is chosen to lie in &quot;B&quot;, then we obtain the Bruhat decomposition

:formula_118

which gives rise to the decomposition of the flag variety &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; into Schubert cells (see Grassmannian).

The structure of the Hasse diagram of the group is related geometrically to the cohomology of the manifold (rather, of the real and complex forms of the group), which is constrained by Poincaré duality. Thus algebraic properties of the Weyl group correspond to general topological properties of manifolds. For instance, Poincaré duality gives a pairing between cells in dimension &quot;k&quot; and in dimension &quot;n&quot; - &quot;k&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of a manifold): the bottom (0) dimensional cell corresponds to the identity element of the Weyl group, and the dual top-dimensional cell corresponds to the longest element of a Coxeter group.

==Analogy with algebraic groups==
There are a number of analogies between algebraic groups and Weyl groups – for instance, the number of elements of the symmetric group is &quot;n&quot;!, and the number of elements of the general linear group over a finite field is related to the &quot;q&quot;-factorial formula_119; thus the symmetric group behaves as though it were a linear group over &quot;the field with one element&quot;. This is formalized by the field with one element, which considers Weyl groups to be simple algebraic groups over the field with one element.

==Cohomology==
For a non-abelian connected compact Lie group &quot;G,&quot; the first group cohomology of the Weyl group &quot;W&quot; with coefficients in the maximal torus &quot;T&quot; used to define it, is related to the outer automorphism group of the normalizer formula_120 as:
:formula_121
The outer automorphisms of the group Out(&quot;G&quot;) are essentially the diagram automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram, while the group cohomology is computed in and is a finite elementary abelian 2-group (formula_122); for simple Lie groups it has order 1, 2, or 4. The 0th and 2nd group cohomology are also closely related to the normalizer.
