<text>Princess Catherine Dolgorukova (; 15 February 1922) was a Russian aristocrat and the daughter of Prince Michael Dolgorukov and his wife, Vera Vishnevskaya.

Catherine was a long-time mistress of Tsar Alexander II and later, as his morganatic wife, was given the title of &quot;Princess Yurievskaya&quot; ().

Alexander and Catherine already had three children when they formed a morganatic marriage on , after the death of the Emperor&#x27;s wife, Marie of Hesse and by Rhine, on . A fourth child had died in infancy. Catherine became a widow with the assassination of Alexander II on by members of Narodnaya Volya.

==Background==

Catherine was the elder daughter of Prince Michael Mikhailovich Dolgorukov (1816-1865) and his wife, Vera Gavrilovna Vishnevskaya (1820-1867). She had one younger sister, Princess Marie Mikhailovna Dolgorukova, Countess von Berg (1850-1907). Catherine was a direct descendant of Anastasia Romanova (d. 1655), the wife of Prince Boris Mikhailovich Lykov-Obolensky (d. 1648), one of the Seven Boyars of 1610. Anastasia was the daughter of Nikita Romanovich (; born c. 1522 – 23 April 1586), also known as Nikita Romanovich Zakharyin-Yuriev, who was a prominent boyar of the Tsardom of Russia. His grandson Michael I (Tsar 1613–1645) founded the Romanov dynasty of Russian tsars. Anastasia was the paternal aunt of Tsar Michael I of Russia and the paternal niece of Tsaritsa Anastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva of Russia.

==Appearance==

One contemporary described the young Catherine as &quot;of medium height, with an elegant figure, silky ivory skin, the eyes of a frightened gazelle, a sensuous mouth, and light chestnut tresses.&quot;

Catherine&#x27;s nephew-in-law Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia wrote: &quot;[I] couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off her – I liked the sad expression of her beautiful face and the radiance of her rich blonde hair.&quot;

Some courtiers described Catherine as &quot;vulgar and ugly&quot;. Konstantin Pobedonostsev wrote that &quot;the eyes, by themselves, would be attractive, I suppose, only her gaze has no depth – the kind in which transparency and naïveté meet with lifelessness and stupidity ...&quot;

==Mistress of Alexander II==

In 1859, 10-year-old Catherine met 41-year-old Alexander II when he paid a visit to her father&#x27;s estate. On the 150th anniversary of Peter the Great&#x27;s victory over Charles XII of Sweden, he observed military maneuvers near Poltava. He later reflected: &quot;I made your acquaintance when you weren&#x27;t even eleven but you&#x27;ve only got more beautiful every year since.&quot;&quot;

After the death of her penniless father, Catherine and her sister Maria were sent to the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens in St. Petersburg, a school for well-born girls. Her mother appealed to Court Minister Count Nikolay Adlerberg, who arranged for Alexander to pay for their education and that of their four brothers.

In the fall of 1864, Alexander met the 16-year-old Catherine at the Smolny Institute on an official visit. He visited her at the school and took her for walks and on carriage rides. Catherine had liberal opinions, formed in part by her time at the school, and she discussed them with him. He later arranged for her to become a lady-in-waiting to his wife, who was suffering from tuberculosis.

Catherine liked the Emperor and enjoyed being in his company, but she did not want to become one of a series of mistresses. Though her mother and the headmistress of the Smolny Institute both urged her to seize the opportunity to better her circumstances and those of her family, Catherine and Alexander did not actually become intimate until July 1866, when she was moved by her pity for the Emperor after the death of his eldest son, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia, and after an attempt to assassinate him. Her mother had died two months before. That night, she later recalled in her memoirs, the still married Emperor told her: &quot;Now you are my secret wife. I swear that if I am ever free, I will marry you.&quot;

Alexander insisted that Catherine and their children remain nearby. He saw her three or four times a week when she was escorted by the police to a private apartment in the Winter Palace and they wrote to one another every day and sometimes several times each day, often discussing the pleasure they found in making love. In one 28-page letter, written when Catherine was pregnant, she asked the Emperor to remain faithful to her &quot;for I know you are capable in one moment when you want to make it, to forget that you desire only me, and to go and make it with another woman.&quot; Twenty nine of the previously unpublished passionate letters the couple wrote to one another were auctioned off in May 2007 for high sums. Alexander II sketched Catherine in the nude, rented her a mansion in St. Petersburg, and thought of her constantly.

Alexander II and Catherine went to great lengths to hide their relationship. They never signed their letters to one another with their real names and used the code word &quot;bingerle&quot; to refer to the sex act. When she went into labor with her third child, Boris, in February 1876, Catherine insisted on being taken to the Winter Palace, where she gave birth in the Emperor&#x27;s rooms, but the baby was taken back to Catherine&#x27;s private residence while Catherine recovered from childbirth in the Emperor&#x27;s rooms for nine days. Boris caught cold and died a few weeks later.

Alexander II&#x27;s family and court disapproved of their relationship. Catherine was accused of scheming to become Empress and influencing Alexander towards liberalism. Allegedly, she engaged with unscrupulous businessmen. On 1 March 1880, there was an explosion in the dining room of the Winter Palace. Alexander ran upstairs to Catherine&#x27;s rooms, shouting &quot;Katya, my dearest Katya!&quot; Alexander&#x27;s brother-in-law Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine was furious that he had forgotten Empress Marie, who was also in the palace and might have been injured in the assassination attempt.
Fearing that she might become the target of assassins, Alexander moved Catherine and their children to the third floor of the Winter Palace by the winter of 1880. Courtiers spread stories that Alexander&#x27;s dying wife was forced to hear the noise of Catherine&#x27;s children moving about overhead, but the rooms of Empress Marie and Catherine were far apart. Though the Emperor had been unfaithful on many occasions in the past, his relationship with Catherine began after the Empress, who had had eight children, stopped having intercourse with her husband on the advice of her doctors. After the Empress asked to meet his children with Catherine, the Emperor brought their two older children, George and Olga, to the Empress&#x27;s bedside and she kissed and blessed both children. Both the Emperor and his wife were in tears during the meeting.

==Marriage to Alexander II==

Shortly after Empress Marie died, Alexander decided to marry Catherine. When Empress Marie died on 22 May, he wrote &quot;My double life ends today. I am sorry but She [Catherine] doesn&#x27;t hide her joy. She talks immediately about legalizing our situation; this mistrust kills me. I&#x27;ll do all for her but not against the national interest.&quot; On 23 May, he decided to marry Catherine as soon as the mourning period was over. He promised to crown her as Empress on 1 August 1881. He granted her the title of Most Serene Princess Yurievskaya and legitimized their children, but he stipulated that they had no right to the throne as children of a morganatic marriage.

Alexander and Catherine&#x27;s marriage was tremendously unpopular with the Russian public. Father Bazhenov, who had witnessed Alexander&#x27;s marriage to Empress Marie, refused to witness his marriage to Catherine. His childhood friend Adlerberg tried to &quot;dissuade him by citing the unpleasant impression it would make unless he waited a year after the empress&#x27;s death.&quot; Daria Tyutcheva, once Empress Marie&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, resigned from her position in the Imperial court. She confided to Countess Alexandra Tolstaya that she resigned because &quot;I can&#x27;t promise not to make a public scene and even spit in the face of Princess Yurievskaya at the first opportunity.&quot; Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a courtier, wrote, &quot;How it irks me to see her in the place of the dear, wise, and graceful Empress!&quot;

Alexander&#x27;s family was furious over his marriage to Catherine. His only legitimate daughter and favorite child Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia wrote to him, “I pray that myself and my junior brothers, who were particularly close to Mama, would one day be able to forgive you.” His sister-in-law, Princess Cecile of Baden, declared &quot;I shall never recognize that scheming adventuress. I hate her!&quot; His daughter-in-law Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin wrote that she hoped &quot;that the Tsar&#x27;s eyes must at length be opened to the worthless of the creature who seems to have him bound as in a spell, to make him deaf and blind.&quot;

Alexander&#x27;s family refused to accept Catherine. At a Winter Palace reception in February 1881, Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna refused to kiss Catherine. Alexander II was furious and chastised his daughter-in-law: &quot;Sasha (the future Alexander III) is a good son, but you – you have no heart.&quot; Maria Feodorovna refused to allow her children to stay with Catherine and her children. Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich wrote that his father, Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia, pitied Catherine because the family treated her so coldly.

Catherine was angry about the way Alexander&#x27;s family treated her. She complained &quot;I ceded ... the honours [to Alexander&#x27;s daughters-in-law], but they shouldn&#x27;t forget I was the wife of their Sovereign.&quot; She frequently complained about &quot;the monsters in [Alexander&#x27;s] family&quot;, whom she called &quot;as heartless as they were uneducated.&quot;
Despite the criticisms, Alexander II was delighted to be married to his long-time mistress and open about their relationship. In his memoirs, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia wrote that the Emperor behaved like a teenage boy when in Catherine&#x27;s presence and she also appeared to adore him. Alexander wrote to his sister Queen Olga of Württemberg about his happiness with Catherine: &quot;She preferred to renounce all social amusements and pleasures so desired by young ladies of her age ... and has devoted her entire life to loving and caring for me. Without interfering in any affairs, despite the many attempts by those who would dishonestly use her name, she lives only for me, dedicated to bringing up our children.&quot;

There were fears that Alexander planned to make Catherine his Empress and supplant his legitimate heirs with his children by Catherine. During a family dinner, he asked the seven-year-old George, his eldest child by Catherine, if he would like to become a Grand Duke. &quot;Sasha (Alexander), for God&#x27;s sake, drop it!&quot; Catherine rebuked him, but the exchange fueled the family&#x27;s fears.

Though they were happy together, the troubled political situation and constant threats of assassination cast a shadow over their lives together. On the day that Alexander II was assassinated, Catherine pleaded with him not to go out because she had a that something would happen to him. He quieted her objections by making love to her on a table in her rooms and leaving her behind. Within hours he was mortally wounded and was brought back to the palace, broken and bleeding.

When she heard the news, Catherine ran half-dressed into the room where he lay dying and fell across his body, crying &quot;Sasha! Sasha!&quot; In his memoirs, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich recalled that the pink and white négligée she was wearing was soaked in Alexander&#x27;s blood. At his funeral, Catherine and her three children were forced to stand in an entryway of the church and received no place in the procession of the Imperial Family. They were also forced to attend a separate Funeral Mass from the rest of the family.

==Later life==

After the Emperor&#x27;s death, Catherine received a pension of approximately 3.4 million rubles and agreed to give up the right to live in the Winter Palace or any of the Imperial residences in Russia in return for a separate residence for herself and the three children. 

She settled in Paris and on the French Riviera, where she became known as a fashionable hostess and was used to having twenty servants and a private railway car, though the Romanov family continued to look upon her and her children with disdain. Alexander III had his secret police spy on her and received reports on her activities in France. Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia used illness as an excuse to avoid socializing with her in 1895. Nicholas II recalled that Catherine was offended when he refused to be the sponsor when her daughter Olga married the Count of Merenberg in the spring of 1895. His mother, the dowager empress, had been appalled by the idea, so Nicholas declined. Catherine&#x27;s son George was an abysmal failure in the Imperial Russian Navy, as Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia informed her by letter, but he was granted a place in the Cavalry School. Catherine survived her husband by forty-one years and died just as her money was running out.

==Children==

Catherine and Alexander had four children styled Prince or Princess (knyaz or knyazhna):

*Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky (12 May 1872 – 13 September 1913); married Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau, a morganatic daughter of Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg and Agripina Japaridze, Countess von Zarnekau. The pair was related, second cousins once removed, as both shared descent of Emperor Paul I of Russia.

*Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (7 November 1873 – 10 August 1925); married Georg Nikolaus, Count of Merenberg, a morganatic son of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau by his wife, Natalia Alexandrovna Pushkina, daughter of Alexander Pushkin. The pair was related, third cousins once removed, as both were descendants of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg.

*Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (23 February 1876 – 11 April 1876).

*Princess Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (9 September 1878 – 22 December 1959); married, firstly, Prince Alexander Vladimirovich Baryatinsky, to whom she was distantly related. They were seventh cousins, as both descended from Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. She married secondly, Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky, to whom she was also distantly related. They were fifth cousins, as they both descended from Prince Alexey Grigoryevich Dolgorukov.

All three of the surviving children left descendants.

==In media==

A biography of Princess Catherine was written by Princess Marthe Bibesco. This biography was the basis for two films. The English translation by Priscilla Bibesco was published in 1939.

The first film, &quot;Katia&quot;, released in 1938 and featuring Danielle Darrieux, was directed by Maurice Tourneur, and the identically named &quot;Katia&quot;, released in 1959 and featuring Romy Schneider, was directed by Robert Siodmak.

<text>A Sister Souljah moment is a politician&#x27;s calculated public repudiation of an extremist person, statement, group, or position that is perceived to have some association with the politician&#x27;s own party.

It has been described as &quot;a key moment when the candidate takes what at least appears to be a bold stand against certain extremes within their party&quot; and as &quot;a calculated denunciation of an extremist position or special interest group.&quot; This act is intended to be a signal to centrist voters that the politician is not beholden to those positions or interest groups. However, such a repudiation runs the risk of alienating some of the politician&#x27;s allies and the party&#x27;s base voters. The term is named after the hip hop artist Sister Souljah.

==Origins==

The term originated in the 1992 presidential candidacy of Bill Clinton. In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview published on May 13, 1992, the hip hop MC, author, and political activist Sister Souljah was quoted as saying (in response to the question regarding black-on-white violence in the 1992 Los Angeles riots):

Speaking to Jesse Jackson Sr.&#x27;s Rainbow Coalition in June 1992, Clinton responded both to that quotation and to something Souljah had said in the music video of her song &quot;The Final Solution: Slavery&#x27;s Back in Effect&quot; (&quot;If there are any good white people, I haven&#x27;t met them&quot;). Clinton said: &quot;If you took the words &#x27;white&#x27; and &#x27;black,&#x27; and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.&quot;

Prior to his appearance, Clinton&#x27;s campaign staff had conducted an intense debate about how far he should go in distancing himself from Jesse Jackson, who was unpopular with moderate voters. When Souljah was invited to speak at the conference, Clinton&#x27;s advisors saw their chance. In an essay for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Joan Didion, who covered Clinton&#x27;s campaign, wrote, &quot;a number of reporters had apparently been told in advance by Clinton aides that Governor Clinton would use his Rainbow speech to demonstrate his ‘independence’ from Jesse Jackson, and the very quotable intemperance of Sister Souljah provided the most logical possible focus for such a demonstration.&quot; Later in the essay, Didion argued that the Sister Souljah incident had been favorably viewed by the media as &quot;a Clinton call for ‘an end to division’ that had at once served to distance him from Jackson and to demonstrate that he was ‘the guy in charge,’ capable of dominating, or ‘standing up to,’ a kind of black anger that many white voters prefer to see as the basis for this country’s racial division.&quot;

Clinton&#x27;s response was harshly criticized by Jackson, who said, &quot;Sister Souljah represents the feelings and hopes of a whole generation of people,&quot; and claimed that she had been misquoted. Clinton was also criticized by some of the Democratic Party&#x27;s other African American supporters. Souljah responded by denying she had ever made remarks promoting murder and accused Clinton of being a racist and a hypocrite because he had played golf at a country club that refused to admit black members until he decided to run for president earlier in the year. Clinton acknowledged that he was once a member of an all-white Arkansas golf club early into his presidential campaign and publicly apologized. In response to the rebuttal, Paul Greenberg, an Arkansas journalist and long-time Clinton critic who dubbed the Arkansas Governor &quot;Slick Willie&quot; during his 1980 re-election bid, criticized Souljah for lying about what she said in an earlier interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, accusing her of trying to fend off criticism &quot;with the savvy of an experienced pol.&quot; In the same article, he compared her to Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam.

==Other examples==
Well into the 21st century, there have been several instances called Sister Souljah moment(s).

===Early 2000s===
As a candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush spoke before the conservative Manhattan Institute in October 1999 saying, &quot;Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of America slouching toward Gomorrah&quot;, quoting the title of a book by conservative jurist Robert Bork. Bush&#x27;s comments were seen as a repudiation of the religious right and an attempt to appeal to moderate voters; commentator Charles Krauthammer called it &quot;an ever so subtle Sister Souljah on Robert Bork.&quot;

In the same campaign for the Republican nomination, Arizona Senator John McCain stated, &quot;Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left or Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the right.&quot; This was similarly seen as a repudiation of the religious right; columnist Jacob Weisberg called it &quot;a pungent Sister Souljah moment.&quot;

During the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama received much criticism for his association with his longtime pastor, Jeremiah Wright, and Wright&#x27;s pattern of controversial statements. On April 29, Senator Obama distanced himself, in a well-received speech on racism, calling some of Wright&#x27;s statements &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;a bunch of rants that aren&#x27;t grounded in truth.&quot; South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn said of the speech, &quot;This, I think, offers Barack Obama his Sister Souljah moment&quot;; the speech was also described as &quot;more than a Sister Souljah moment&quot; by columnist Maureen Dowd.

Later in the campaign, Obama delivered a speech on Father&#x27;s Day at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the speech, he appeared to criticize absentee fathers in the African-American community, saying, &quot;if we are honest with ourselves, we’ll admit that what too many fathers also are is missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it. You and I know how true this is in the African-American community.&quot; Multiple publications called the speech a Sister Souljah moment, although Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass denied this.

On July 10, 2008, prior to a taping of the news program &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, Jesse Jackson was unwittingly caught by an open microphone whispering to a fellow interviewee, saying, in reaction to Obama&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day speech the month before, that Obama was &quot;talking down to black people&quot; and that he (Jackson) wanted &quot;to cut [Obama&#x27;s] nuts off.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s son, Illinois Congressman and co-chair of Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign Jesse Jackson Jr. publicly lambasted his father&#x27;s comments. &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Dan Balz called the comments an &quot;accidental Sister Souljah moment&quot; for Obama, since Jackson had distanced himself from the candidate without Obama having to take a stand.

===2020s===
On August 28, 2020, conservative pundits George Will and Amanda Carpenter called on Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to have a &quot;Sister Souljah moment&quot; to distance himself from the violence of the Kenosha protests, which occurred against the backdrop of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an African American man. Two days prior, Biden had already released a statement condemning violence at protests, which the commentators viewed as inadequate.

In late October 2024, just one week away from the 2024 United States presidential election, Bill Maher urged Kamala Harris to have a &quot;Sister Souljah moment&quot; by calling out an &quot;extremist&quot; from the left as a last ditch effort to win the election. Harris lost the election to Donald Trump.

<doc id="301888" wikidata="Q338869" url="?curid=301888" title="Vinyl chloride">
<text>Vinyl chloride is an organochloride with the formula H2C=CHCl. It is also called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) or chloroethene. It is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Vinyl chloride is a colourless flammable gas that has a sweet odor and is carcinogenic. Vinyl chloride monomer is among the top twenty largest petrochemicals (petroleum-derived chemicals) in world production. The United States remains the largest vinyl chloride manufacturing region because of its low-production-cost position in chlorine and ethylene raw materials. China is also a large manufacturer and one of the largest consumers of vinyl chloride. It can be formed in the environment when soil organisms break down chlorinated solvents. Vinyl chloride that is released by industries or formed by the breakdown of other chlorinated chemicals can enter the air and drinking water supplies. Vinyl chloride is a common contaminant found near landfills. Before the 1970s, vinyl chloride was used as an aerosol propellant and refrigerant.

== Uses ==

Vinyl chloride, also called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), is exclusively used as a precursor to PVC. Due to its toxic nature, vinyl chloride is not found in other products. Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is very stable, storable and not toxic.

Until 1974, vinyl chloride was used in aerosol spray propellant. Vinyl chloride was briefly used as an inhalational anaesthetic, in a similar vein to ethyl chloride, though its toxicity limited this use.

==Production==
Globally, approximately 40 million tonnes of PVC resin are produced per year, requiring a corresponding amount of vinyl chloride monomer.
===History===
Vinyl chloride was first synthesized in 1835 by Justus von Liebig and his student Henri Victor Regnault. They obtained it by treating 1,2-dichloroethane with a solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol.
===Acetylene-based routes===
In 1912, Fritz Klatte, a German chemist working for Griesheim-Elektron, patented a means to produce vinyl chloride from acetylene and hydrogen chloride using mercuric chloride as a catalyst. Acetylene reacts with hydrogen chloride over a mercuric chloride catalyst to give vinyl chloride:
:C2H2 + HCl → CH2=CHCl
The reaction is exothermic and highly selective. Product purity and yields are generally very high.

This route to vinyl chloride was common before ethylene became widely distributed. When vinyl chloride producers shifted to using the thermal cracking of EDC described below, some used byproduct HCl in conjunction with a colocated acetylene-based unit. The hazards of storing and shipping acetylene meant that the vinyl chloride facility needed to be located very close to the acetylene generating facility.

In view of mercury&#x27;s toxicity, gold- and platinum-based catalysts have been proposed.

The mercury-based technology is the main production method in China due to low price on coal from which acetylene is produced, with over 80% of national capacity as of 2018, even though the resulting PVC contains residues and is only suitable for low-end products like pipes.

===Ethylene-based routes===
In the United States and Europe, mercury-catalyzed routes widely used in the 20th century have been superseded by more economical and greener processes based on ethylene. Ethylene is made by cracking ethane. Two steps are involved, chlorination and dehydrochlorination:
:

===Possible routes from ethane===
Numerous attempts have been made to convert ethane directly to vinyl chloride. Ethane, which is even more readily available than ethylene, is a potential precursor to vinyl chloride. The conversion of ethane to vinyl chloride has been demonstrated by various routes:

High-temperature chlorination:
High-temperature oxychlorination, which uses oxygen and hydrogen chloride in place of chlorine:

High-temperature oxidative chlorination:
====Thermal decomposition of dichloroethane====
1,2-Dichloroethane, ClCH2CH2Cl (also known as ethylene dichloride, EDC), can be prepared by halogenation of ethane or ethylene, inexpensive starting materials. EDC thermally converts into vinyl chloride and anhydrous HCl. This production method has become the major route to vinyl chloride since the late 1950s.

The thermal cracking reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally carried out in a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, the yield for EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to minimize undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.

== Storage and transportation ==
Vinyl chloride is stored as a liquid. The accepted upper limit of safety as a health hazard is 500 ppm. Often, the storage containers for the product vinyl chloride are high capacity spheres. The spheres have an inside sphere and an outside sphere. Several inches of space separate the inside sphere from the outside sphere. The interstitial space between the spheres is purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen. As the nitrogen purge gas exits the interstitial space it passes through an analyzer that detects whether any vinyl chloride is leaking from the internal sphere. If vinyl chloride starts to leak from the internal sphere or if a fire is detected on the outside of the sphere then the contents of the sphere are automatically dumped into an emergency underground storage container. Containers used for handling vinyl chloride at atmospheric temperature are always under pressure. Inhibited vinyl chloride may be stored at normal atmospheric conditions in suitable pressure vessels. Uninhibited vinyl chloride may be stored either under refrigeration or at normal atmospheric temperature in the absence of air or sunlight but only for a duration of a few days. If stored for longer periods, regular checks must be made to confirm no polymerization has taken place.

In addition to its toxicity risk, transporting vinyl chloride also presents the same risks as transporting other flammable gases such as propane, butane, or natural gas. Examples of incidents in which this danger was observed include the 2023 Ohio train derailment, in which derailed tank cars dumped 100,000 gallons of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride.

==Fire and explosion hazard==
In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl chloride as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid vinyl chloride will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more than twice as heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of vinyl chloride is −78 °C (−108.4 °F). Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05% by volume in air. Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO) and trace levels of phosgene. Vinyl chloride can polymerise rapidly due to heating and under the influence of air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard. As a gas mixed with air, vinyl chloride is a fire and explosion hazard. On standing, vinyl chloride can form peroxides, which may then explode. Vinyl chloride will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture.

== Health effects ==
Since it is a gas under most ambient conditions, primary exposure is via inhalation, as opposed to the consumption of contaminated food or water, with occupational hazards being highest. Prior to 1974, workers were commonly exposed to 1,000 ppm vinyl chloride, causing &quot;vinyl chloride illness&quot; such as acroosteolysis and Raynaud&#x27;s Phenomenon. The symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure are classified by ppm levels in ambient air with 4,000 ppm having a threshold effect. The intensity of symptoms varies from acute (1,000–8,000 ppm), including dizziness, nausea, visual disturbances, headache, and ataxia, to chronic (above 12,000 ppm), including narcotic effect, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal respiratory failure. RADS (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome) may be caused by acute exposure to vinyl chloride.

Vinyl chloride is a mutagen having clastogenic effects which affect lymphocyte chromosomal structure. Vinyl chloride is a IARC group 1 Carcinogen posing elevated risks of rare angiosarcoma, brain and lung tumors, and malignant haematopoeitic lymphatic tumors. Chronic exposure leads to common forms of respiratory failure (emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) and focused hepatotoxicity (hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis). Continuous exposure can cause CNS depression including euphoria and disorientation. Decreased male libido, miscarriage, and birth defects are known major reproductive defects associated with vinyl chloride.

Vinyl chloride can have acute dermal and ocular effects. Dermal exposure effects are thickening of skin, edema, decreased elasticity, local frostbites, blistering, and irritation. The complete loss of skin elasticity expresses itself in Raynaud&#x27;s Phenomenon.

=== Liver toxicity ===
The hepatotoxicity of vinyl chloride has long been established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its early stages. In the very first study about the dangers of vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage. In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers. In 1954, B.F. Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures. Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects. They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made. In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm). Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, &quot;every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous...various changes were found in bone and liver. Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes. The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures.&quot; In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he &quot;should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer.&quot;
Vinyl chloride was first reported to induce angiosarcoma of the liver in 1974 and further research has demonstrated the carcinogenicity of VC to other organs and at lower concentrations, with evidence now extending to jobs associated with poly(vinyl chloride) exposure, indicating the need for prudent control of PVC dust in the industrial setting.

Vinyl chloride is now an IARC group 1 carcinogen known to cause hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) in highly exposed industrial workers. Vinyl chloride monomer, a component in the production of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) resins, is a halogenated hydrocarbon with acute toxic effects, as well as chronic carcinogenic effects.

=== Cancerous tumors ===
Animals exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors. Studies on vinyl chloride workers were a &quot;red flag&quot; to B.F. Goodrich and the industry. In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day.

In 1997 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s &quot;almost completely eliminated worker exposures&quot; and that &quot;new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated.&quot;

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; claimed in 1998 that the vinyl industry manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and hid extensive and severe chemical spills in local communities.

=== Environment pollution ===
According to the U.S. EPA, &quot;vinyl chloride emissions from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver.&quot; EPA&#x27;s 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for vinyl chloride in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA&#x27;s previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that &quot;because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies [...] and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible cancer induction in other tissues.&quot;

===Mechanism===
The carcinogenicity of VC is attributed to the action of two metabolites, chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde. The former is produced by the action of cytochrome P-450 on VC. Both chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde are alkylating agents.

==Microbial remediation==
The bacteria species &quot;Nitrosomonas europaea&quot; can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride.

<text>The Irish component of the 1918 United Kingdom general election took place on 14 December 1918. It was the final United Kingdom general election to be held throughout Ireland, as the next election would happen following Irish independence. It is a key moment in modern Irish history, seeing the overwhelming defeat of the moderate nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP), which had dominated the Irish political landscape since the 1880s, and a landslide victory for the radical Sinn Féin party. Sinn Féin had never previously stood in a general election, but had won six seats in by-elections in 1917–1918. The party had vowed in its manifesto to establish an independent Irish Republic. In Ulster, however, the Unionist Party was the most successful party.

In the aftermath of the elections, Sinn Féin&#x27;s elected members refused to attend the British Parliament in Westminster (London), and instead formed a parliament in Dublin, the First Dáil Éireann (&quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;), which declared Irish independence as a republic. The Irish War of Independence was conducted under this revolutionary government which sought international recognition, and set about the process of state-building. The other parties elected in the election were invited by Sinn Féin to join in creating the Dáil Éireann, but declined and took up their seats at Westminster.

In 1918 a system called plural voting was in place in both Britain and Ireland. Plural voting was a practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. Property and business owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. This system often resulted in one person being able to cast multiple votes. In the newly formed Irish Free State this system was ended by the Electoral Act 1923 and was abolished in the UK by the Representation of the People Act 1948. Plural voting remained in effect in Northern Ireland until 1969. 

The 1918 election was held in the aftermath of World War I, the Easter Rising and the Conscription Crisis. It was the first general election to be held after the Representation of the People Act 1918. It was thus the first election in which women over the age of 30, and all men over the age of 21, could vote. Previously, all women and most working-class men had been excluded from voting.

==Background==

In 1918 the whole of Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and was represented in the British Parliament by 105 Members of Parliament (MPs). Whereas in Great Britain most elected politicians were members of either the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party, from the early 1880s most Irish MPs were Irish nationalists, who sat together in the British House of Commons as the Irish Parliamentary Party.

The IPP strove for Home Rule, that is, limited self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom, and had been supported by most Irish people, especially the Catholic majority. Home Rule was opposed by most Protestants in Ireland, who formed a majority of the population in parts of the northern province of Ulster but a minority in the rest of Ireland, and favoured maintenance of the Union with Great Britain (and were therefore called Unionists).

The Unionists were supported by the Conservative Party, whereas from 1885 the Liberal Party was committed to enacting some form of Home Rule. Unionists eventually formed their own representation, first the Irish Unionist Party then the Ulster Unionist Party. Home Rule appeared to have been finally achieved with the passing of the Home Rule Act 1914. However, the implementation of the Act was temporarily postponed with the outbreak of World War I due to determined Ulster Unionists&#x27; resistance to the Act. As the war prolonged and with the failure to make any progress on the issue, the more radical Sinn Féin began to grow in strength.

===Rise of Sinn Féin===
Sinn Féin was founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905. He believed that Irish nationalists should emulate the of Hungarian nationalists who, in the 19th century under Ferenc Deák, had chosen to boycott the imperial parliament in Vienna and unilaterally established their own legislature in Budapest.

Griffith had favoured a peaceful solution based on &#x27;dual monarchy&#x27; with Britain, that is two separate states with a single head of state and a limited central government to control matters of common concern only. However, by 1918, under its new leader Éamon de Valera, Sinn Féin had come to favour achieving separation from Britain by means of an armed uprising if necessary and the establishment of an independent republic.

In the aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising the party&#x27;s ranks were swelled by participants and supporters of the rebellion as they were freed from British prisons and internment camps, and at its 1917 Ard Fheis (annual conference) de Valera was elected leader and the new, more radical policy adopted.

Prior to 1916, Sinn Féin had been a fringe movement having a limited cooperative alliance with William O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s All-for-Ireland League and enjoyed little electoral success. However, between the Easter Rising of that year and the 1918 general election, the party&#x27;s popularity increased dramatically. This was due to the failure to have the Home Rule Bill implemented when the IPP resisted the partition of Ireland demanded by Ulster Unionists in 1914, 1916 and 1917, but also popular antagonism towards the British authorities created by the execution of most of the leaders of the 1916 rebels and by their botched attempt to introduce Home Rule on the conclusion of the Irish Convention linked with military conscription in Ireland (see Conscription Crisis of 1918).

Sinn Féin demonstrated its new electoral capability in four by-election successes in 1917 in which Count Plunkett, Joseph McGuinness, de Valera and W. T. Cosgrave were each elected, although it lost three by-elections in early 1918 before winning two more with Patrick McCartan and Arthur Griffith. In one case there were unproven allegations of electoral fraud. The party had benefitted from a number of factors in the 1918 elections, including demographic changes and political factors.

===Changes in the electorate===
The Irish electorate in 1918, as with the entire electorate throughout the United Kingdom, had changed in two major ways since the preceding general election. Firstly, there was a &quot;generational&quot; change because of the First World War, which meant that the British general election due in 1915 had not taken place. As a result, no election took place between 1910 and 1918, the longest gap in modern British and Irish constitutional history until then (it was superseded in Britain in 1935–45). Thus the 1918 election saw, in particular:
* All voters between the age of 21 and 29 were first time general election voters. They had no history of past voter loyalty to the IPP to fall back on, and had begun their political awareness in the period of 8 years that had seen a bitter world war, the home rule controversy and the Easter Rising and its aftermath.
* A generation of older voters, most of them IPP supporters, had died in that eight-year period.
* Emigration (except to Britain) had been almost impossible during the war because of the dangerous sea lanes, which meant that tens of thousands of young people were in Ireland who in normal times would have been abroad.
* As Ireland had not had conscription, Unionists and moderate Nationalists had predominantly made up the volunteers for the duration of the war. Consequently, there was a large loss in the age range of young Unionists and moderate Nationalists, which did not occur amongst Republicans who had not volunteered.

Secondly, the franchise had been greatly extended by the Representation of the People Act 1918. This granted voting rights to women (albeit only those over 30) for the first time, and gave all men over 21 and military servicemen over 19 a vote in parliamentary elections without property qualifications. The Irish electorate increased from around 700,000 to about two million.

Overall, a new generation of young voters, and the sudden influx of women over thirty, meant that vast numbers of new voters of unknown voter affiliation existed, changing dramatically the composition of the Irish electorate.

===Political factors===
*Since the previous general election in December 1910, the formerly-dominant Irish Parliamentary Party, unchallenged for nearly a decade, was largely of an older generation. Its local organisation had atrophied, making defence of its seats difficult. The party&#x27;s votes in parliament had been decisive in passing the 1914 Home Rule Act but, due to the outbreak of the War, it was never put into effect. The party&#x27;s policy was to achieve All-Ireland self-government constitutionally, within the framework of the United Kingdom, as opposed to using separatist physical force.
*The electorate had become enamoured with Sinn Féin, particularly due to the harsh response of the authorities to the Easter Rising. Sinn Féin had been falsely blamed for the Rising even though it had taken no part in it. The party also took most of the credit for the successful campaign to prevent the introduction of conscription in 1918.
*Whereas the IPP had conceded a temporary form of partition in 1914 and 1916, as a measure to pacify Ulster loyalist. Sinn Féin felt that that would worsen and prolong any differences between north and south.
*In contrast to the IPP, Sinn Féin were seen as a young and radical force. Its leaders, such as Michael Collins (28) and de Valera (36), were young militant politicians, like most of the new voters and their imprisoned republican candidates.
*IPP leaders such as John Dillon, who had been in public office since the 1880s, were largely older, moderate politicians, and had campaigned for All-Ireland Home Rule since the time of Charles Stewart Parnell, and continued to press for the implementation of the 1914 Act, and a constitutional solution to have Ulster included in the jurisdiction of a Dublin parliament.
* On the other hand, Sinn Féin promoted a radical new policy of achieving Irish self-government outside of the UK, and many of its volunteer wing were ready to defend a republic with physical force. By 1918, Sinn Féin followers had come to see the gradual acquisition of All-Ireland Home Rule as an idea whose time had come and gone.
*The Irish population had been radicalised during World War I. In addition to the heavy losses suffered by Irish regiments, the conscription threat and British military measures, there was rapid inflation that sparked off a wave of strikes and industrial disputes. The 1918 election also occurred at a time of revolution across Europe.
*Unionist fear of Home Rule, or worse, separation, solidified after the Rising, and the Unionist vote was enhanced in Ulster by the increased electorate. It was the first election since the Ulster Covenant, the formation of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), and the Battle of the Somme.
*Sinn Féin&#x27;s policy was outlined in its election manifesto, which aimed for Irish representation at any post-war peace conference. By contrast, IPP policy was to leave negotiation to the British government.
*Nearly a year earlier, in January 1918, Woodrow Wilson had issued his Fourteen Points policy, which seemed to promise that self-government and self-determination would become the norm in international relations.
*The Ulster Unionists&#x27; resistance to All-Ireland self-government remained unresolved, and little account was taken of Unionist reservations about what they contended would be Catholic rule from Dublin.

==Retiring incumbents==
Forty-four outgoing members of the 30th Parliament did not seek re-election:
==MPs standing under a different political affiliation==
Six MPs stood under a different political affiliation from the December 1910 general election.
One MP stood under a different political affiliation from their by-election victory. 
==The election==

Voting in most Irish constituencies occurred on Saturday, 14 December 1918. While the rest of the United Kingdom fought the &#x27;Khaki election&#x27; on other issues involving the British parties, in Ireland four major political parties had national appeal. These were the IPP, Sinn Féin, the Irish Unionist Party and the Irish Labour Party. The Labour Party, however, decided not to participate in the election, fearing that it would be caught in the political crossfire between the IPP and Sinn Féin; it thought it better to let the people make up their minds on the issue of Home Rule versus a Republic by having a clear two-way choice between the two nationalist parties. The Unionist Party favoured continuance of the union with Britain (along with its subordinate, the Ulster Unionist Labour Association, who fought as Labour Unionists). A number of other small nationalist parties also took part.

Ireland had 105 seats elected from 103 constituencies. Ninety-nine seats were elected from single-seat geographical constituencies under the first-past-the-post voting system. There were two two-seat constituencies: Dublin University (Trinity College) elected two MPs under the single transferable vote and Cork City elected two MPs under the bloc voting system.

In addition to ordinary geographical constituencies there were three university constituencies: the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (which returned a Unionist), Dublin University (which returned two Unionists) and the National University (which returned a member of Sinn Féin).

Of the 105 seats, 25 were uncontested, with a Sinn Féin candidate winning unopposed. Seventeen of these seats were in Munster. In some cases it was because there was a certain winner in Sinn Féin.

===Seats summary===
===MPs who lost their seats===

===First time MPs===
In this election, 75 candidates who had never previously been elected to Parliament were elected.

===Analysis===

Sinn Féin candidates won 73 seats out of 105, but four party candidates (Arthur Griffith, Éamon de Valera, Eoin MacNeill and Liam Mellows) were elected for two constituencies and so the total number of individual Sinn Féin MPs elected was 69. Despite the isolated allegations of intimidation and electoral fraud on the part of both republicans and unionists, the election was seen as a landslide victory for Sinn Féin.

Sinn Féin received 46.9% of votes island-wide, and 65% of votes in the area that became the Irish Free State. However, the 46.9% is not the total result of the overall success of Sinn Féin. That figure only accounts for 48 seats that they won because in 25 of the other constituencies the other parties did not contest them, and Sinn Féin won them unopposed. Most of these constituencies were Sinn Féin strongholds. It has been estimated that, had the 25 seats been contested, Sinn Féin would have received at least 53% of the vote island-wide. However, this is a conservative estimate and the percentage would likely have been higher. Sinn Féin also did not contest four seats due to a deal with the IPP (see below). Labour, who had pulled out in the south under instructions to &#x27;wait&#x27;, polled better in Belfast than Sinn Féin. Within the 26 counties that became the Irish Free State, Sinn Féin achieved 400,269 votes in the contested seats out of 606,117 total votes cast which amounted to a huge landslide of 66.0% in the vote and winning 70 out of the 75 constituencies.

The Irish Unionist Party won 22 seats and 25.3% of the vote island-wide (29.2% when Labour Unionist candidates are included), becoming the second-largest party in terms of MPs. The success of the unionists, who won 26 seats overall, was largely limited to Ulster. Otherwise, southern unionists were elected only in the constituencies of Rathmines and Dublin University which returned two. In the 26 counties that later became the Irish Free State and then the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Unionist Alliance polled 37,218 votes from 101,839 total votes cast for other parties in the constituencies that they stood a candidate. However, if all of the total votes in the contested seats where the Irish Unionist Alliance did not stand are included there was a total of 606,117 votes cast, which converts the Irish Unionist Alliance share of the vote in the 26 counties to just 6.1%. With the one Independent Unionist being elected for Dublin University adding 0.1% in total with 793 votes to give 6.2% across the 26 counties and only 3 seats won by the Unionists.

The IPP suffered a catastrophic defeat including the loss of its leader, John Dillon. It won only six seats in Ireland, its losses exaggerated by the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system which gave it a share of seats far short of its much larger share of the vote (21.7%) and the number of seats it would have won under a &quot;proportional representation&quot; ballot system. All but one of its seats were in Ulster. The exception was Waterford City, the seat previously held by John Redmond, who had died earlier in the year, and retained by his son Captain William Redmond. Four of their Ulster seats were part of the deal to avoid unionist victories which saved some for the party but may have cost it the support of Protestant voters elsewhere. The IPP came close to winning other seats in County Louth and Wexford South, and in general their support held up better in the north and east of the island. The party was represented in Westminster by seven MPs because T. P. O&#x27;Connor won the Liverpool Scotland seat he had held since the 1885 election due to Irish emigrant votes. The remnants of the IPP in time became the Nationalist Party of Northern Ireland under the leadership of Joseph Devlin. In the 26 counties that became the Irish Free State, the Irish Parliamentary Party won 181,320 votes out of 606,117 total votes cast in the contested seats, amounting to a 26.0% vote share. If the Independent Home Rule Nationalists are included there were 11,162 votes which comes to 1.8% and a vote share of 27.8% for the Nationalists. The Irish Parliamentary Party held on to just 2 seats in the 26 counties that became Southern Ireland and then the Irish Free State.

====Ulster====
In Ulster (nine counties), Unionists won 23 out of the 38 seats with Sinn Féin gaining ten and the Irish Parliamentary Party five. There was a limited electoral pact brokered by Roman Catholic Cardinal Michael Logue in December between Sinn Féin and the Nationalist IPP in eight seats. However, it only concluded after nominations closed.

Sinn Féin instructed its supporters to vote IPP in Armagh South, despite no Unionist candidate (79 SF votes), Down South (33 SF votes for Éamon de Valera), Tyrone North-East (56 SF votes) and Donegal East (46 SF votes). The IPP instructed its supporters to vote Sinn Féin in Fermanagh South (132 IPP votes) which had no Unionist candidate, Londonderry City (120 IPP votes) where Eoin MacNeill narrowly beat the Unionist, and Tyrone North-West also against a Unionist but where no IPP candidate was nominated.

The discipline of voters, when faced with two rival nationalist candidates and with only a post-nomination pact, was impressive. The pact only broke down in Down East where a Unionist won as the IPP candidate refused to participate, thus splitting the Catholic nationalist vote.

There was no pact in Belfast Falls which Joe Devlin (IPP) won with 8,488 votes against 3,245 for Éamon de Valera (SF) although no Unionist stood. The only other Belfast seat contested by both nationalist parties was Duncairn against Edward Carson; otherwise, Sinn Féin stood alone in seven seats reaching double figures in two.
Monaghan North was won by Sinn Féin&#x27;s Ernest Blythe in a three-cornered fight against both IPP and Unionist candidates.

In the Monaghan South, and Donegal North, South and West seats, despite no Unionist standing, Sinn Féin won all four against IPP candidates.

Sinn Féin took the two (uncontested) Cavan seats with Arthur Griffith taking his second in Cavan East as well as that of Tyrone North West.

In six contested seats no Unionist stood.

Unionists won a clear majority of the 38 Ulster seats including eight of the nine in Belfast. 
In the six Ulster counties which formed the future Northern Ireland, Unionists won 23 of the 30 seats. The vote totals were:

==Aftermath and legacy==

On 21 January 1919, 27 (out of 101 elected) members representing thirty constituencies answered the roll of Dáil Éireann—the Irish for &quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;. Invitations to attend the Dáil had been sent to all 100 men and one woman who had been elected on 14 December 1918. Eoin MacNeill had been elected for both Londonderry City and the National University of Ireland. Thirty-three republicans were unable to attend as they were in prison, most of them without trial since 17 May 1918. Pierce McCan (of Tipperary East), who died in prison, would have brought the total to thirty-four. Of the 69 republicans elected, most had fought in the Easter Rising.

In accordance with the Sinn Féin manifesto, their elected members refused to attend Westminster, having instead formed their own parliament. Dáil Éireann was, according to John Patrick McCarthy, the revolutionary government under which the Irish War of Independence was fought and which sought international recognition. Maryann Gialanella Valiulis says that having justified its existence, the Dáil provided itself with a theoretical framework and set about the process of state-building.

After having dominated Irish politics for four decades, the IPP was so decimated by its massive defeat that it dissolved soon after the election. As mentioned above, its remains became the Northern Ireland-based Nationalist Party, which survived in Northern Ireland until 1969.

The British administration and unionists refused to recognise the Dáil. At its first meeting attended by 27 deputies (others were still imprisoned or impaired) on 21 January 1919 the Dáil issued a Declaration of Independence and proclaimed itself the parliament of a new state, the Irish Republic.

On the same day, in unconnected circumstances, two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary guarding gelignite were killed in the Soloheadbeg Ambush by members of the Irish Volunteers. Although it had not ordered this incident, the course of events soon drove the Dáil to recognise the Volunteers as the army of the Irish Republic and the ambush as an act of war against Great Britain. The Volunteers therefore changed their name, in August, to the Irish Republican Army. In this way the 1918 elections led to the outbreak of the Anglo-Irish War, giving the impression that the election sanctioned the war.

The train of events set in motion by the elections would eventually bring about the creation of the Irish Free State as a British dominion in 1922. That state became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state in 1931, when the Statute of Westminster removed virtually all of the UK Parliament&#x27;s remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. The Free State eventually evolved into the modern Republic of Ireland. The leaders of the Sinn Féin candidates elected in 1918, such as de Valera, Michael Collins and W. T. Cosgrave, came to dominate Irish politics. De Valera, for example, would hold some form of elected office from his first election as an MP in a by-election in 1917 until 1973. The two major parties in the Republic of Ireland today, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, are both descendants of Sinn Féin, which first enjoyed substantial electoral success in 1918.

<text>A progressive tax is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. The term &quot;progressive&quot; refers to the way the tax rate progresses from low to high, with the result that a taxpayer&#x27;s average tax rate is less than the person&#x27;s marginal tax rate. The term can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole. Progressive taxes are imposed in an attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower , as such taxes shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax, such as a sales tax, where the poor pay a larger proportion of their income compared to the rich (for example, spending on groceries and food staples varies little against income, so poor pay similar to rich even while latter has much higher income).

The term is frequently applied in reference to personal income taxes, in which people with lower income pay a lower percentage of that income in tax than do those with higher income. It can also apply to adjustments of the tax base by using tax exemptions, tax credits, or selective taxation that creates progressive distribution effects. For example, a wealth or property tax, a sales tax on luxury goods, or the exemption of sales taxes on basic necessities, may be described as having progressive effects as it increases the tax burden of higher income families and reduces it on lower income families.

Progressive taxation is often suggested as a way to mitigate the societal ills associated with higher income inequality, as the tax structure reduces inequality; economists disagree on the tax policy&#x27;s economic and long-term effects. One study suggests progressive taxation is positively associated with subjective well-being, while overall tax rates and government spending are not.

==Early examples==
In the early days of the Roman Republic, public taxes consisted of assessments on owned wealth and property. For Roman citizens, the tax rate under normal circumstances was 1% of property value, and could sometimes climb as high as 3% in situations such as war. These taxes were levied against land, homes and other real estate, slaves, animals, personal items and monetary wealth. By 167 BC, Rome no longer needed to levy a tax against its citizens in the Italian peninsula, due to the riches acquired from conquered provinces. After considerable Roman expansion in the 1st century, Augustus Caesar introduced a wealth tax of about 1% and a flat poll tax on each adult; this made the tax system less progressive, as it no longer only taxed wealth. In India under the Mughal Empire, the Dahsala system was introduced in A.D. 1580 under the reign of Akbar. This system was introduced by Akbar&#x27;s finance minister, Raja Todar Mal, who was appointed in A.D. 1573 in Gujarat. The Dahsala system is a land-revenue system (system of taxation) which helped to make the collecting system be organised on the basis of land fertility.

===Modern era===
The first modern income tax was introduced in Great Britain by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in his budget of December 1798, to pay for weapons and equipment for the French Revolutionary War. Pitt&#x27;s new graduated (progressive) income tax began at a levy of 2 old pence in the pound ( or 0.83%) on annual incomes over £60 and increased up to a maximum of 2 shillings (10%) on incomes of over £200. Pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise £10 million, but actual receipts for 1799 totalled just over £6 million.

Pitt&#x27;s progressive income tax was levied from 1799 to 1802 when it was abolished by Henry Addington during the Peace of Amiens. Addington had taken over as prime minister in 1801, after Pitt&#x27;s resignation over Catholic emancipation. The income tax was reintroduced by Addington in 1803 when hostilities recommenced, but it was again abolished in 1816, one year after the Battle of Waterloo.

The present form of income tax in the United Kingdom was reintroduced by Sir Robert Peel in the Income Tax Act 1842. Peel, as a Conservative, had opposed income tax in the 1841 general election, but a growing budget deficit required a new source of funds. The new income tax, based on Addington&#x27;s model, was imposed on incomes above £150. Although this measure was initially intended to be temporary, it soon became a fixture of the British taxation system. A committee was formed in 1851 under Joseph Hume to investigate the matter but failed to reach a clear recommendation. Despite the vociferous objection, William Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1852, kept the progressive income tax, and extended it to cover the costs of the Crimean War. By the 1860s, the progressive tax had become a grudgingly accepted element of the English fiscal system.

In the United States, the first progressive income tax was established by the Revenue Act of 1862. The act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln, and replaced the Revenue Act of 1861, which had imposed a flat income tax of 3% on annual incomes above $800. The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1913, permitted Congress to levy all income taxes without any apportionment requirement. By the mid-20th century, most countries had implemented some form of progressive income tax.

Both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels supported a progressive income tax.

=== Negative Income Tax ===
The idea of Negative Income Tax (NIT) was stumbled upon and discussed by various thinkers and is most commonly attributed to Milton Friedman, who made it more prominent in his 1962 work ‘Capitalism and Freedom’. The theory places itself as an alternative to the contemporary progressive tax systems which are deemed too bureaucratic and inefficient, it’s emphasized for its lower administrative costs and unitary system of providing welfare and support without discrediting the beneficiaries. It also eliminates unnecessary processes and institutions by directly providing to the substandard.

NIT is a system where the flow of the tax payment is inverted for salaries falling a specified threshold; Individuals surpassing the given level have to contribute money to the state, while those below are recipients of said funds. Theoretical framework of this idea could be referred back to William Petty, Vilferdo Pareto, and Paul Samuelson among others.

The adjustability of subsidies given to the poor households by the system eliminates the welfare trap issue faced by other proposals (i.e. means-test). The ‘wage subsidy’ is best demonstrated by the gap between ones salary, base pay, and real income post-subsidy. Once the minimal criteria defined by the according government is met, the recipient becomes the payer. 

Milton provides five other advantages to NIT. It allows households and families to sustain themselves directly from their income without having to rely on other programs or plans. Secondly, it provides cash to the recipient, which is perceived as the most superior means of support. Thirdly, Milton claims that negative income tax could replace all other supporting programs and work as the universal program on its own. Fourthly, lower administration costs associated with NIT compared to other systems. Lastly, it should not, in theory, interfere with market mechanisms unlike other government interventionist laws (i.e. minimum wage).

A survey conducted in 1995 established that the majority of American economists advocated for the addition of a negative income tax into the welfare system. The United States federal government took a key interest on the matter and between 1968 and 1982 sponsored four experiments across various states to see the effects of NIT on labor supply, income, and substitution effects. As part of the result, most participants reduced their labor supply, especially the youth by as much as four weeks. These responses may seem imminent from a generous system like NIT. 

NIT saw extensive use under President Nixon&#x27;s Family Assistance Plan in 1969. It was also implemented in 1975 for the working poor through the earned income tax credit. The system is still in power today, but differs from the original theories of Milton and his supporters.

== Measuring progressivity ==
Indices such as the Suits index, Gini coefficient, Kakwani index, Theil index, Atkinson index, and Hoover index have been created to measure the progressivity of taxation, using measures derived from income distribution and wealth distribution.

===Marginal and effective tax rates===

The rate of tax can be expressed in two different ways; the &quot;marginal rate&quot; expressed as the rate on each additional unit of income or expenditure (or last dollar spent) and the &quot;effective (average) rate&quot; expressed as the total tax paid divided by total income or expenditure. In most progressive tax systems, both rates will rise as the amount subject to taxation rises, though there may be ranges where the marginal rate will be constant. Usually, the average tax rate of a taxpayer will be lower than the marginal tax rate. In a system with refundable tax credits, or income-tested welfare benefits, it is possible for marginal rates to fall as income rises, at lower levels of income.

===Inflation and tax brackets===
Tax laws might not be accurately indexed to inflation. For example, some tax laws may ignore inflation completely. In a progressive tax system, failure to index the brackets to inflation will eventually result in effective tax increases (if inflation is sustained), as inflation in wages will increase individual income and move individuals into higher tax brackets with higher percentage rates. This phenomenon is known as &quot;bracket creep&quot; and can cause fiscal drag.

==Economic effects==
There is debate between politicians and economists over the role of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality and the effects on economic growth.

===Income equality===
Progressive taxation has a direct effect on decreasing income inequality. This is especially true if taxation is used to fund progressive government spending such as transfer payments and social safety nets. However, the effect may be muted if the higher rates cause increased tax evasion. When income inequality is low, aggregate demand will be relatively high, because more people who want ordinary consumer goods and services will be able to afford them, while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy. 
High levels of income inequality can have negative effects on long-term economic growth, employment, and class conflict. Progressive taxation is often suggested as a way to mitigate the societal ills associated with higher income inequality. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.

The economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez wrote that decreased progressiveness in US tax policy in the post World War II era has increased income inequality by enabling the wealthy greater access to capital.

According to economist Robert H. Frank, tax cuts for the wealthy are largely spent on positional goods such as larger houses and more expensive cars. Frank argues that these funds could instead pay for things like improving public education and conducting medical research, and suggests progressive taxation as an instrument for attacking positional externalities.

===Economic growth===
A report published by the OECD in 2008 presented empirical research showing a weak negative relationship between the progressivity of personal income taxes and economic growth. Describing the research, William McBride, a staff writer with the conservative Tax Foundation, stated that progressivity of income taxes can undermine investment, risk-taking, entrepreneurship, and productivity because high-income earners tend to do much of the saving, investing, risk-taking, and high-productivity labor. In contrast, according to the IMF, some advanced economies could increase progressivity in taxation for tackling inequality, without hampering growth, as long as progressivity is not excessive. The IMF also states that the average top income tax rate for OECD member countries fell from 62 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 2015, and that in addition, tax systems are less progressive than indicated by the statutory rates, because wealthy individuals have more access to tax relief.

== Educational attainment ==
Economist Gary Becker has described educational attainment as the root of economic mobility. Progressive tax rates, while raising taxes on high income, have the goal and corresponding effect of reducing the burden on low income, improving income equality. Educational attainment is often conditional on cost and family income, which for the poor, reduces their opportunity for educational attainment. Increases in income for the poor and economic equality reduces the inequality of educational attainment. Tax policy can also include progressive features that provide tax incentives for education, such as tax credits and tax exemptions for scholarships and grants.

A potentially adverse effect of progressive tax schedules is that they may reduce the incentives for educational attainment. By reducing the after-tax income of highly educated workers, progressive taxes can reduce the incentives for citizens to attain education, thereby lowering the overall level of human capital in an economy. However, this effect can be mitigated by an education subsidy funded by the progressive tax. Theoretically, public support for government spending on higher education increases when taxation is progressive, especially when income distribution is unequal.

== Opposition and criticism ==

=== Hayek&#x27;s argumentation ===
Friedrich Hayek viewed the implementation of progressive tax systems as incompatible with the principles of an open and liberal society. He argued that the imposition of higher taxes on higher incomes creates a bias against economic wealth and negatively impacts the incentives of the working age. His thought stems from philosophical and moral theories. Hayek believed that fiscal problems are partly to its foundations in moral philosophy practiced by society. Progressive tax prohibits the incentives of free market competition, whilst the wealth is subordinated to the democratic vote of a majority. This results in illegitimate transfers of political power.

Hayek believed the sweeping rise of progressive tax has risen from deceptive justifications which in reality didn&#x27;t bring fruit. He claims the historical and methodological conditions gave way to the imposition of the system. The system was established from ludicrous premises and failed to attain its redistributive goals. The progressive tax failed to benefit the poor, instead the benefit fell to the middle class who comprised the majority of voters, a majority which may push for tax changes.

Hayek advocated for a flat (or proportional) tax rate. Estonia was one of the first countries in Europe to adapt such a tax system.

=== Nozick&#x27;s argumentation ===
Robert Nozick in his famous work &quot;&#x27;Anarchy, State and Utopia&#x27;&quot; made the widely known statement: &quot;Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor&quot;. He acknowledged the difference between the previous forms of slavery, but holds the belief that it is just as immoral regardless. Nozick believed that the government should have limited role in most sectors, including the economy. He advocates for what&#x27;s known as the &#x27;minimal state&#x27;, hence the government should not enforce &#x27;redistribution&#x27; as it would minimize the rewards given by the free market forces. Whatever revenue is generated by taxes is to be spent on basic maintenance (i.e. road repairs).

== Loopholes ==

The current tax code has been criticized by many who believe that the nation&#x27;s wealthiest are not paying their share. This is because the current tax system charges the individual based on wages and not investment income, an area where the upper-class make most of their money. Prominent investor Warren Buffett has been a strong voice in support of taxing the rich proportional to investment income as well as wages. Buffett famously pointed out that if you analyzed every employee in his office including himself, he is quoted saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll probably be the lowest paying taxpayer in the office.&quot; This support ultimately led to the proposal of &quot;The Buffett Rule&quot; by President Barack Obama which proposed a 30% minimum tax on people making more than $1 million a year. The aim of the Buffett Rule was to ensure that investment income would constitute as a taxable income instead of simply wages. Ultimately, the rule was rejected by congress in March 2012. President Joe Biden attempted to do what President Obama could not and introduced the &quot;Paying a Fair Share Act&quot; which followed the Buffett&#x27;s Rule philosophy. As of August 2023, the bill has not picked up steam in congress. Those that take advantage of these tax codes in the United States include some of the most wealthy and prominent. It is said that &quot;Bezos reportedly paid no federal income taxes at all in 2007 and 2011, while Musk paid none in 2018.&quot;

==Psychological factors==
A 2011 study psychologists Shigehiro Oishi, Ulrich Schimmack, and Ed Diener, using data from 54 countries, found that progressive taxation was positively associated with the subjective well-being, while overall tax rates and government spending were not. The authors added, &quot;We found that the association between more-progressive taxation and higher levels of subjective well-being was mediated by citizens&#x27; satisfaction with public goods, such as education and public transportation.&quot; Tax law professor Thomas D. Griffith, summarizing research on human happiness, has argued that because inequality in a society significantly reduces happiness, a progressive tax structure which redistributes income would increase welfare and happiness in a society. Since progressive taxation reduces the income of high earners and is often used as a method to fund government social programs for low income earners, calls for increasing tax progressivity have sometimes been labeled as envy or class warfare, while others may describe such actions as fair or a form of social justice.

Even with studies that conclude that a progressive tax can be positively associated with the increased well-being of certain individuals, experts point out that many wealthy democracies are often hesitant to enforce progressive taxes. A study conducted by Yale political scientist Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage of New York University published in the Comparative Political Studies journal helps explains why that is. Their research findings concluded that voters hold the belief that all citizens should be treated equally with regards to taxation regardless of the income that they bring in. The authors point to this reasoning as one of the main reasons certain countries refuse to raise taxes on the wealthier despite rising inequality. Kenneth Scheve is quoted saying, “Progressive taxation is a powerful policy tool for responding to rising inequality, but we found that wealthy democracies don’t resort to it very often.” The study results result from studies conducted in the United Kingdom, United States, and Germany. Contrary to a progressive tax, some voters argue that a fair tax system should take into account whether individuals earned their wealth through hard work compared to others. This perspective emphasizes equal-treatment fairness norms, which suggest that all citizens should be treated equally in areas such as voting rights and legal protections. Accordingly, these voters believe that everyone should pay the same tax rate, mirroring the concept of equal treatment. While progressive tax policies may address income inequality in certain countries, there is a significant segment of the population that opposes them based on this notion of political equality. This opposition may hinder the formation of a consensus to address inequality by raising taxes on higher incomes and wealth.

==Computation==

There are two common ways of computing a progressive tax, corresponding to point–slope form and slope–intercept form of the equation for the applicable bracket. These compute the tax either as the tax on the bottom amount of the bracket &quot;plus&quot; the tax on the marginal amount &quot;within&quot; the bracket; or the tax on the entire amount (&quot;at&quot; the marginal rate), &quot;minus&quot; the amount that this overstates tax on the bottom end of the bracket.

For example, suppose there are tax brackets of 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from ; the 20% rate applies to income from ; and the 30% rate applies to all income above . In that case the tax on of income (computed by adding up tax in each bracket) is formula_1. The tax on $25,000 of income could then be computed two ways. Using point–slope form (tax on bottom amount plus tax on marginal amount) yields:
formula_2
Geometrically, the line for tax on the top bracket passes through the point formula_3 and has a slope of 0.3 (30%).

Alternatively, 30% tax on $20,000 yields formula_4, which overstates tax on the bottom end of the top bracket by formula_5, so using slope–intercept form yields:
formula_6
Geometrically, the line for tax on the top bracket intercepts the &quot;y&quot;-axis at −$3,000 – it passes through the point formula_7 – and has a slope of 0.3 (30%).

In the United States, the first form was used through 2003, for example (for the 2003 15% Single bracket):
* If the amount on Form 1040, line 40 [Taxable Income], is: &quot;Over—&quot; 7,000
* &quot;But not over—&quot; 28,400
* Enter on Form 1040, line 41 [Tax] $700.00 + 15%
* &quot;of the amount over—&quot; 7,000
From 2004, this changed to the second form, for example (for the 2004 28% Single bracket):
* Taxable income. If line 42 is— At least but not over 
* (a) Enter the amount from line 42
* (b) Multiplication amount × 28% (.28)
* (c) Multiply (a) by (b)
* (d) Subtraction amount 
* Tax. Subtract (d) from (c). Enter the result here and on Form 1040, line 43

==Examples==


Most systems around the world contain progressive aspects. When taxable income falls within a particular tax bracket, the individual pays the listed percentage of tax &quot;on each dollar that falls within that monetary range&quot;. For example, a person in the U.S. who earned US of taxable income (income after adjustments, deductions, and exemptions) would be liable for 10% of each dollar earned from the 1st dollar to the 7,550th dollar, and then for 15% of each dollar earned from the 7,551st dollar to the 10,000th dollar, for a total of .50.

In the United States, there are seven income tax brackets ranging from 10% to 39.6% above an untaxed level of income based on the personal exemption and usually various other tax exemptions, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and home mortgage payments. The federal tax rates for individual taxpayers in the United States for the tax year 2021 are as follows: 10% from $0 to ; 12% from to ; 22% from to ; 24% from to ; 32% from to ; 35% from to ; and 37% from and over. The US federal tax system also includes deductions for state and local taxes for lower income households which mitigates what are sometimes regressive taxes, particularly property taxes. Higher income households are subject to the alternative minimum tax that limits deductions and sets a flat tax rate of 26% to 28% with the higher rate commencing at in income. There are also deduction phaseouts starting at for single filers. The net effect is increased progressivity that completely limits deductions for state and local taxes and certain other credits for individuals earning more than . In order to counteract regressive state and local taxes, many US states implement progressive income taxes. 32 states and the District of Columbia have graduated-rate income taxes. The brackets differ across states.

There has been a hefty decline in progressivity of the United States federal tax system since the 1960s. The two periods with the largest tax progressivity reductions occurred under the Reagan administration in the 1980s and the Bush administration in the 2000s. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 implemented by President Trump greatly affected the United States tax system. The act took steps to dramatically lower taxes for high-income households, open deduction loopholes for businesses, and cut the federal corporate tax rate down to 21 percent. It maintained the structure of seven tax brackets for personal income but lowered five of the seven by one percent or more. For example, after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was implemented, in 2017, a married couple with a total income of $250,000 after deductions would have faced a tax rate of 33%.

<text>Young Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of creationism which holds as a central that the Earth and its lifeforms were created by supernatural acts of the Abrahamic God between about 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, contradicting established scientific data for the age of Earth putting it at around 4.54 billion years. In its most widespread version, YEC is based on a religious belief in the inerrancy of certain literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis. Its primary adherents are Christians and Jews who believe that God created the Earth in six literal days.

This is in contrast with old Earth creationism (OEC), which holds that literal interpretations of Genesis are compatible with the scientifically determined ages of the Earth and universe, and theistic evolution, which posits that the scientific principles of evolution, the Big Bang, abiogenesis, solar nebular theory, age of the universe, and age of Earth are compatible with a metaphorical interpretation of the Genesis creation account.

Since the mid-20th century, young Earth creationists—starting with Henry Morris (1918–2006)—have developed and promoted a pseudoscientific explanation called creation science as a basis for a religious belief in a supernatural, geologically recent creation, in response to the scientific acceptance of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, which was developed over the previous century. Contemporary YEC movements arose in protest to the scientific consensus, established by numerous scientific disciplines, which demonstrates that the age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, the formation of the Earth and Solar System happened around 4.6 billion years ago, and the origin of life occurred roughly 4 billion years ago.

A 2017 Gallup creationism survey found that 38 percent of adults in the United States held the view that &quot;God created humans in their present form at some time within the last 10,000 years or so&quot; when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years. It was suggested that the level of support could be lower when poll results are adjusted after comparison with other polls with questions that more specifically account for uncertainty and ambivalence. Gallup found that, when asking a similar question in 2019, 40 percent of US adults held the view that &quot;God created [human beings] in their present form within roughly the past 10,000 years.&quot;

Among the biggest young Earth creationist organizations are Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research and Creation Ministries International.

==Background and history==

===Biblical dates for creation===
Young Earth creationists have claimed that their view has its earliest roots in ancient Judaism, citing, for example, the commentary on Genesis by Ibn Ezra (c. 1089–1164). That said, Shai Cherry of Vanderbilt University notes that modern Jewish theologians have generally rejected such literal interpretations of the written text, and that even Jewish commentators who oppose some aspects of science generally accept scientific evidence that the Earth is much older. Some controversy has arisen among Ultra-Orthodox Jews, some of whom accept the age and some of whom reject it. Several early Jewish scholars, including Philo, followed an allegorical interpretation of Genesis.

The most accepted and popular date of creation among young Earth creationists is 4004 BC because this specific date appears in the Ussher chronology. This chronology was included in many Bibles from 1701 onwards, including the authorized King James Version. The youngest ever recorded date of creation within the historic Jewish or Christian traditions is 3616 BC, by Yom-Tov Lipmann-Muhlhausen. Some proponents of young Earth creationism have proposed dates that are several thousands of years earlier by theorizing significant gaps in the genealogies in chapters 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis, such as 6984 BC by Alfonso X of Castile, Harold Camping with 11,013 BC, and Christian Charles Josias Bunsen in the 19th century suggesting 20,000 BC.

The Protestant reformation hermeneutic inclined some of the Reformers, including John Calvin and Martin Luther, and later Protestants toward a literal reading of the Bible as translated. This means they believed that the &quot;days&quot; referred to in Genesis correspond to ordinary days, in contrast to reading the &quot;days&quot; as standing in for a longer period of time.

Famous poets and playwrights of the Early Modern Period (1500–1800) referenced an Earth that was few thousands of years old. For example William Shakespeare:

===Scientific Revolution and the old Earth===
Beginning in the 18th century, support for a young Earth declined among scientists and philosophers as new knowledge including discoveries of the Scientific Revolution and philosophies of the Age of Enlightenment. In particular, discoveries in geology required an Earth that was much older than thousands of years, and proposals such as Abraham Gottlob Werner&#x27;s Neptunism attempted to incorporate what was understood from geological investigations into a coherent description of the Earth&#x27;s natural history. James Hutton, now regarded as the father of modern geology, went further and opened up the concept of deep time for scientific inquiry. Rather than assuming that the Earth was deteriorating from a primal state, he maintained that the Earth was infinitely old. Hutton stated that:

Hutton&#x27;s main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but much older than the young Earth of less than 10,000 years in which Biblical literalists believed.

Hutton&#x27;s ideas, called uniformitarianism or gradualism, were popularized by Sir Charles Lyell in the early 19th century. The energetic advocacy and rhetoric of Lyell led to the public and scientific communities largely accepting an ancient Earth. By this time, the Reverends William Buckland, Adam Sedgwick and other early geologists had abandoned their earlier ideas of catastrophism related to a biblical flood and confined their explanations to local floods. By the 1830s, the scientific consensus had abandoned a young Earth as a serious hypothesis.

John H. Mears was one of several scholars proposing Biblical interpretations ranging from a series of long or indefinite periods interspersed with moments of creation to a day-age theory of indefinite &#x27;days&#x27;. He subscribed to the latter theory (indefinite days) and found support from the side of Yale professor James Dwight Dana, one of the fathers of mineralogy, who wrote a paper consisting of four articles named &#x27;Science and the Bible&#x27; on the topic. As many biblical scholars reinterpreted Genesis 1 in the light of Lyell&#x27;s geological results with the support of a number of renowned (Christian) scientific scholars, Developmentalism, a form of theistic evolution based on Darwin&#x27;s Natural selection, grew in acceptance.

This 19th century trend was contested. The scriptural geologists and later the founders of the Victoria Institute opposed the decline of support for a biblically literal young Earth.

===Christian fundamentalism and belief in a young Earth===
The rise of fundamentalist Christianity early in the 20th century brought rejection of evolution among fundamentalists who explained an ancient Earth through belief in the gap or in the day-age interpretation of Genesis. In 1923, George McCready Price, a Seventh-day Adventist, wrote &quot;The New Geology&quot;, a book partly inspired by the book &quot;Patriarchs and Prophets&quot; in which Seventh-day Adventist prophet Ellen G. White described the impact of the Great Flood on the shape of the Earth. Although not an accredited geologist, Price&#x27;s writings, which were based on reading geological texts and documents rather than field or laboratory work, provide an explicitly fundamentalist perspective on geology. The book attracted a small following, with its advocates almost all being Lutheran pastors and Seventh-day Adventists in North America. Price became popular with fundamentalists for his opposition to evolution, though they continued to believe in an ancient Earth.

In the 1950s, Price&#x27;s work came under severe criticism, particularly by Bernard Ramm in his book &quot;The Christian View of Science and Scripture&quot;. Together with J. Laurence Kulp, a geologist and in fellowship with the Plymouth Brethren, and other scientists, Ramm influenced Christian organizations such as the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) in not supporting flood geology.

Price&#x27;s work was subsequently adapted and updated by Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb Jr. in their book &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; in 1961. Morris and Whitcomb argued that the Earth was geologically recent and that the Great Flood had laid down most of the geological strata in the space of a single year, reviving pre-uniformitarian arguments. Given this history, they argued, &quot;the last refuge of the case for evolution immediately vanishes away, and the record of the rocks becomes a tremendous witness... to the holiness and justice and power of the living God of Creation!&quot;

This became the foundation of a new generation of young Earth creationist believers, who organized themselves around Morris&#x27; Institute for Creation Research. Sister organizations such as the Creation Research Society have sought to re-interpret geological formations within a young Earth creationist viewpoint. Langdon Gilkey writes:

===Impact===
A 2006 joint statement of InterAcademy Panel on International Issues (IAP) by 68 national and international science academies enumerated the many scientific facts that young Earth creationism contradicts, in particular that the universe, the Earth, and life are billions of years old, that each has undergone continual change over those billions of years, and that life on Earth has evolved from a common primordial origin into the diverse forms observed in the fossil record and present today. Evolutionary theory remains the only explanation that fully accounts for all the observations, measurements, data, and evidence discovered in the fields of biology, ecology, anatomy, physiology, zoology, paleontology, molecular biology, genetics, anthropology, and others.

As such, young Earth creationism is dismissed by the academic and the scientific communities. One 1987 estimate found that &quot;700 scientists ... (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) ... give credence to creation-science&quot;. An expert in the evolution-creationism controversy, professor and author Brian Alters, states that &quot;99.9% of scientists accept evolution&quot;. A 1991 Gallup poll found that about 5 per cent of American scientists (including those with training outside biology) identified themselves as creationists. For their part, young Earth creationists say that the lack of support for their beliefs by the scientific community is due to discrimination and censorship by professional science journals and professional science organizations. This viewpoint was explicitly rejected in the rulings from the 1981 United States District Court case &quot;McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education&quot; as no witness was able to produce any articles that had been refused publication and the judge could not conceive how &quot;a loose knit group of independent thinkers in all the varied fields of science could, or would, so effectively censor new scientific thought&quot;. A 1985 study also found that only 18 out of 135,000 submissions to scientific journals advocated creationism.

Morris&#x27; ideas had a considerable impact on creationism and fundamentalist Christianity. Armed with the backing of conservative organizations and individuals, his brand of &quot;creation science&quot; was widely promoted throughout the United States and overseas, with his books being translated into at least ten different languages. The inauguration of so-called &quot;young Earth creationism&quot; as a religious position has, on occasion, impacted science education in the United States, where periodic controversies have raged over the appropriateness of teaching YEC doctrine and creation science in public schools (see Teach the Controversy) alongside or in replacement of the theory of evolution. Young Earth creationism has not had as large an impact in the less literalist circles of Christianity. Some churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches, accede to the possibility of theistic evolution; though some individual church members support young Earth creationism and do so without those churches&#x27; explicit condemnation.

Adherence to young Earth creationism and rejection of evolution is higher in the U.S. than in most of the rest of the Western world. A 2012 Gallup survey reported that 46 per cent of Americans believed in the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years, a statistic which has remained essentially the same since 1982; for those with a postgraduate education, only 25 per cent believed in the creationist viewpoint. About one third of Americans believed that humans evolved with God&#x27;s guidance and 15 per cent said humans evolved, but that God had no part in the process. A 2009 poll by Harris Interactive found that 39 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement that &quot;God created the universe, the earth, the sun, moon, stars, plants, animals, and the first two people within the past 10,000 years&quot;, yet only 18 per cent of the Americans polled agreed with the statement &quot;The earth is less than 10,000 years old&quot;. A 2017 Gallup creationism survey found that 38 per cent of adults in the United States inclined to the view that &quot;God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years&quot; when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years.

Reasons for the higher rejection of evolution in the U.S. include the abundance of fundamentalist Christians compared to Europe. A 2011 Gallup survey reported that 30 per cent of Americans said the Bible is the actual word of God and should be interpreted literally, a statistic which had fallen slightly from the late 1970s. Some 54 per cent of those who attended church weekly and 46 per cent of those with a high school education or less took the Bible literally.

==Characteristics and beliefs==
The common belief of young Earth creationists is that the Earth and life were created in six 24-hour periods, 6,000–10,000 years ago. However, there are different approaches to how this is possible given the geological evidence for much longer timescales. The Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College has identified two major types of YEC belief systems:

*Believers in flood geology attach great importance to the biblical story of Noah&#x27;s Flood in explaining the fossil record and geological strata. Major American YEC organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research and Answers in Genesis support this approach with detailed argumentation and references to scientific evidence, though often framed with pseudoscientific misconceptions.
*A less-visible form of YEC not seen as often on the internet is one which claims that there has been essentially no development of the Universe, Earth, or life whatsoever since creation—that creation has been in a steady state since the beginning without major changes. According to Ronald Numbers, this belief, which does not necessarily try to explain scientific evidence through appeal to a global flood, has not been promoted as much as the former example given. Such YECs believe that fossils are not real and that major extinctions never occurred, so dinosaurs, trilobites, and other examples of extinct organisms found in the fossil record would have to either be hoaxes or simply secular lies, promoted perhaps by the devil.

===View of the Bible===

Young Earth creationists regard the Bible as a historically accurate, factually inerrant record of natural history. As Henry Morris, a leading young Earth creationist, explained it, &quot;Christians who flirt with less-than-literal readings of biblical texts are also flirting with theological disaster.&quot; According to Morris, Christians must &quot;either ... believe God&#x27;s Word all the way, or not at all.&quot; Young Earth creationists consider the account of creation given in Genesis to be a factual record of the origin of the Earth and life, and that Bible-believing Christians must therefore regard Genesis 1–11 as historically accurate.

====Interpretations of Genesis====

Young Earth creationists interpret the text of Genesis as strictly literal. Young Earth creationists reject allegorical readings of Genesis and further argue that if there was not a literal Fall of Man, Noah&#x27;s Ark, or Tower of Babel this would undermine core Christian doctrines like the birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The genealogies of Genesis record the line of descent from Adam through Noah to Abraham. Young Earth creationists interpret these genealogies literally, including the old ages of the men. For example, Methuselah lived 969 years according to the genealogy. Differences of opinion exist regarding whether the genealogies should be taken as complete or abbreviated, hence the 6,000 to 10,000 year range usually quoted for the Earth&#x27;s age. In contrast, Old Earth Creationists tend to interpret the genealogies as incomplete, and usually interpret the days of Genesis 1 figuratively as long periods of time.

Young Earth creationists believe that the flood described in Genesis 6–9 did occur, was global in extent, and submerged all dry land on Earth. Some young Earth creationists go further and advocate a kind of flood geology which relies on the appropriation of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century arguments in favor of catastrophism made by such scientists as Georges Cuvier and Richard Kirwan. This approach which was replaced by the mid-nineteenth century almost entirely by uniformitarianism was adopted most famously by George McCready Price and this legacy is reflected in the most prominent YEC organizations today. YEC ideas to accommodate the massive amount of water necessary for a flood that was global in scale included inventing such constructs as an orbiting vapor canopy which would have collapsed and generated the necessary extreme rainfall or a rapid movement of tectonic plates causing underground aquifers or tsunamis from underwater volcanic steam to inundate the planet.

===Age of the Earth===

The young Earth creationist belief that the age of the Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old conflicts with the age of 4.54 billion years measured using independently cross-validated geochronological methods including radiometric dating. Creationists dispute these and all other methods which demonstrate the timescale of geologic history in spite of the lack of scientific evidence that there are any inconsistencies or errors in the measurement of the Earth&#x27;s age.

Between 1997 and 2005, a team of scientists at the Institute for Creation Research conducted an eight-year research project entitled RATE (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) to assess the validity and accuracy of radiometric dating techniques. While they concluded that there was overwhelming evidence for over 500 million years&#x27; worth of radioactive decay, they claimed to have found other scientific evidence to prove a young Earth. They therefore proposed that nuclear decay rates were accelerated by a factor of one billion during the Creation week and at the time of the Flood. However, when subjected to independent scrutiny by non-affiliated experts, their analyses were shown to be flawed.

===Human history===

Young Earth creationists reject almost all of the results of physical anthropology and human evolution and instead insist that Adam and Eve were the universal ancestors of every human to have ever lived. Noah&#x27;s flood as reported in the book of Genesis is said to have killed all humans on Earth with the exception of Noah and his sons and their wives, so young Earth creationists also argue that all humans alive today are descended from this single family.

The literal belief that the world&#x27;s linguistic variety originated with the tower of Babel is pseudoscientific, sometimes called pseudolinguistics, and it is contrary to what is known about the origin and history of languages.

===Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs===

Young Earth creationists reject the geologic evidence that the stratigraphic sequence of fossils proves the Earth is billions of years old. In his &quot;Illogical Geology&quot;, expanded in 1913 as &quot;The Fundamentals of Geology&quot;, George McCready Price argued that the occasionally out-of-order sequence of fossils that are shown to be due to thrust faults made it impossible to prove any one fossil was older than any other. His &quot;law&quot; that fossils could be found in any order implied that strata could not be dated sequentially. He instead proposed that essentially all fossils were buried during the flood and thus inaugurated flood geology. In numerous books and articles he promoted this concept, focusing his attack on the sequence of the geologic time scale as &quot;the devil&#x27;s counterfeit of the six days of Creation as recorded in the first chapter of Genesis.&quot; Today, many young Earth creationists still contend that the fossil record can be explained by the global flood.

In &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; (1961) Henry M. Morris reiterated Price&#x27;s arguments, and wrote that because there had been no death before the Fall of Man, he felt &quot;compelled to date all the rock strata which contain fossils of once-living creatures as subsequent to Adam&#x27;s fall&quot;, attributing most to the flood. He added that humans and dinosaurs had lived together, quoting Clifford L. Burdick for the report that dinosaur tracks had supposedly been found overlapping a human track in the Paluxy River bed Glen Rose Formation. He was subsequently advised that he might have been misled, and Burdick wrote to Morris in September 1962 that &quot;you kind of stuck your neck out in publishing those Glen Rose tracks.&quot; In the third printing of the book this section was removed.

Following in this vein, many young Earth creationists, especially those associated with the more visible organizations, do not deny the existence of dinosaurs and other extinct animals present in the fossil record. Usually, they claim that the fossils represent the remains of animals that perished in the flood. A number of creationist organizations further propose that Noah took the dinosaurs with him in the ark, and that they only began to disappear as a result of a different post-flood environment. The Creation Museum in Kentucky portrays humans and dinosaurs coexisting before the Flood while the California roadside attraction Cabazon Dinosaurs describes dinosaurs as being created the same day as Adam and Eve. The Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas, has a &quot;hyperbaric biosphere&quot; intended to reproduce the atmospheric conditions before the Flood which could grow dinosaurs. The proprietor Carl Baugh says that these conditions made creatures grow larger and live longer, so that humans of that time were giants.

As the term &quot;dinosaur&quot; was coined by Richard Owen in 1842, the Bible does not use the word &quot;dinosaur&quot;. Some creationist organizations propose that the Hebrew word &#x27; (תנין, ), mentioned nearly thirty times in the Old Testament, should be considered a synonym. In English translations, &#x27; has been translated as &quot;sea monster&quot; or &quot;serpent&quot;, but most often it is translated as &quot;dragon&quot;. Additionally, in the Book of Job, a &quot;behemoth&quot; () is described as a creature that &quot;moves his tail like a cedar&quot;; the behemoth is described as ranking &quot;first among the works of God&quot; and as impossible to capture (vs. 24). Biblical scholars have alternatively identified the behemoth as either an elephant, a hippopotamus, or a bull, but some creationists have identified the behemoth with sauropod dinosaurs, often specifically the &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; according to their interpretation of the verse &quot;He is the chief of the ways of God&quot; implying that the behemoth is the largest animal God created. The leviathan is another creature referred to in the Bible&#x27;s Old Testament that some creationists argue is actually a dinosaur. Alternatively, more mainstream scholars have identified the Leviathan () with the Nile crocodile or, because Ugarit texts describe it as having seven heads, a purely mythical beast similar to the Lernaean Hydra.

A subset of adherents of the pseudoscience of cryptozoology promote young Earth creationism, particularly in the context of so-called &quot;living dinosaurs&quot;. Science writer Sharon A. Hill observes that the young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is &quot;well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution.&quot; Anthropologist Jeb J. Card says that &quot;Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution.&quot; Young Earth creationists occasionally claim that dinosaurs survived in Australia, and that Aboriginal legends of reptilian monsters are evidence of this, referring to what is known as &quot;Megalania&quot; (&quot;Varanus priscus&quot;). However, &quot;Megalania&quot; was a gigantic species of monitor lizard, and not a dinosaur, as its discoverer, Richard Owen, realized that the skeletal remains were that of a lizard, and not an archosaur. Some creationists believe that Mokele-mbembe, a cryptid said to dwell deep in the Congo rainforest, may be a living sauropod, though the scientific consensus is that this is extremely unlikely.

In a 2019 issue of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; science author Philip J. Senter details many 16th and 17th century hoaxes who constructed composite dragons which Senter calls the &quot;Piltdown Men of Creationism&quot; stating that many young Earth creationists believe these hoaxes even though &quot;the fakes don&#x27;t even resemble the very animals the creationist authors claim they are&quot;. Other more recent hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant, the Silverbell artifacts, the Burdick tracks and the Acámbaro figures are still being cited as proof of a young earth even though some of the hoaxers confessed. Young Earth creationists according to Senter are quick to point out the embarrassing forgeries that some scientists believed for years, such as the Piltdown Man. Senter continues &quot;But it is also somewhat hypocritical, for the YEC literature is replete with cases in which its own authors have fallen for taxidermic &#x27;dragon&#x27; hoaxes&quot;.

===Attitude towards science===

Young Earth creationism is most famous for an opposition to the theory of evolution, but believers also are on record opposing many measurements, facts, and principles in the fields of physics and chemistry, dating methods including radiometric dating, geology, astronomy, cosmology, and paleontology. Young Earth creationists do not accept any explanation for natural phenomena which deviates from the veracity of a plain reading of the Bible, whether it be the origins of biological diversity, the origins of life, the geological, atmospheric, and oceanic history of Earth, the origins of the Solar System and Earth, formation of the earliest chemical elements or the origins of the universe itself. This has led some young Earth creationists to criticize other creationist proposals such as intelligent design, for not taking a strong stand on the age of the Earth, special creation, or even the identity of the designer.

Young Earth creationists disagree with the methodological naturalism that is part of the scientific method. Instead, they assert the actions of God as described in the Bible occurred as written and therefore only scientific evidence that points to the Bible being correct can be accepted. See Creation–evolution controversy for a more complete discussion.

==Compared to other forms of creationism==

As a position that developed out of the explicitly anti-intellectual side of the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy in the early parts of the twentieth century, there is no single unified nor consistent consensus on how creationism as a belief system ought to reconcile its adherents&#x27; acceptance of biblical inerrancy with empirical facts of the Universe. Although young Earth creationism is one of the most stridently literalist positions taken among professed creationists, there are also examples of biblical literalist adherents to both geocentrism and a flat Earth. Conflicts between different kinds of creationists are rather common, but three in particular are of particular relevance to YEC: Old Earth Creationism, Gap creationism, and the Omphalos hypothesis.

===Old Earth creationism===

Young Earth creationists reject old Earth creationism and day-age creationism on textual and theological grounds. In addition, they claim that the scientific data in geology and astronomy point to a young Earth, against the consensus of the general scientific community.

Young Earth creationists generally hold that, when Genesis describes the creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24-hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for &quot;day&quot; (&quot;yôm&quot;) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the &quot;specific context of Genesis 1&quot;, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as &quot;evening and morning&quot;, this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to a long period of time in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).

Hebrew scholars reject the rule that &quot;yôm&quot; with a number or an &quot;evening and morning&quot; construct can only refer to 24-hour days. Hugh Ross has pointed out that the earliest reference to this rule dates back to young Earth creationist literature in the 1970s and that no reference to it exists independent of the young Earth movement.

===Gap creationism===

The &quot;gap theory&quot; acknowledges a vast age for the universe, including the Earth and solar system, while asserting that life was created recently in six 24-hour days by divine fiat. Genesis 1 is thus interpreted literally, with an indefinite &quot;gap&quot; of time inserted between the first two verses. (Some gap theorists insert a &quot;primordial creation&quot; and Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion into the gap.) Young Earth creationist organizations argue that the gap theory is unscriptural, unscientific, and not necessary, in its various forms.

===Omphalos hypothesis===

Many young Earth creationists distinguish their own hypotheses from the &quot;Omphalos hypothesis&quot;, today more commonly referred to as the apparent age concept, put forth by the naturalist and science writer Philip Henry Gosse. &quot;Omphalos&quot; was an unsuccessful mid-19th century attempt to reconcile creationism with geology. Gosse proposed that just as Adam had a navel (&quot;omphalos&quot; is Greek for navel), evidence of a gestation he never experienced, so also the Earth was created &quot;ex nihilo&quot; complete with evidence of a prehistoric past that never actually occurred. The Omphalos hypothesis allows for a young Earth without giving rise to any predictions that would contradict scientific findings of an old Earth. Although both logically unassailable and consistent with a literal reading of scripture, Omphalos was rejected at the time by scientists on the grounds that it was completely unfalsifiable and by theologians because it implied to them a deceitful God, which they found theologically unacceptable.

Today, in contrast to Gosse, young Earth creationists posit that not only is the Earth young but that the scientific data supports that view. However, the apparent age concept is still used in young Earth creationist literature. There are examples of young Earth creationists arguing that Adam did &quot;not&quot; have a navel.

==Criticism==
Young Earth creationists adhere strongly to a concept of biblical inerrancy, and regard the Bible as divinely inspired and &quot;infallible and completely authoritative on all matters with which they deal, free from error of any sort, scientific and historical as well as moral and theological&quot;. Young Earth creationists also suggest that supporters of modern scientific understanding with which they disagree are primarily motivated by atheism. Critics reject this claim by pointing out that many supporters of evolutionary theory are religious believers, and that major religious groups, such as the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion and mainline Protestant churches, believe that concepts such as physical cosmology, chemical origins of life, biological evolution, and geological fossil records do not imply a rejection of the scriptures. Critics also point out that workers in fields related to biology, chemistry, physics, or geosciences are not required to sign statements of belief in contemporary science comparable to the biblical inerrancy pledges required by creationist organizations, contrary to the creationist claim that scientists operate on an &quot;a priori&quot; disbelief in biblical principles.

Creationists also discount certain modern Christian theological positions, like those of French Jesuit priest, geologist and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who saw that his work with evolutionary sciences actually confirmed and inspired his faith in the cosmic Christ; or those of Thomas Berry, a cultural historian and ecotheologian, that the cosmological 13-billion-year &quot;Universe Story&quot; provides all faiths and all traditions with a single account by which the divine has made its presence in the world.

Proponents of young Earth creationism are regularly accused of quote mining, the practice of isolating passages from academic texts that appear to support their claims, while deliberately excluding context and conclusions to the contrary. For example, scientists acknowledge that there are indeed a number of mysteries about the Universe left to be solved, and scientists actively working in the fields who identify inconsistencies or problems with extant models, when pressed, explicitly reject creationist interpretations. Theologians and philosophers have also criticized this &quot;God of the gaps&quot; viewpoint.

In defending against young Earth creationist attacks on &quot;evolutionism&quot; and &quot;Darwinism&quot;, scientists and skeptics have offered rejoinders that every challenge made by proponents of YEC is either made in an unscientific fashion, or is readily explainable by science.

===Theological considerations===

Few modern theologians take the Genesis account of creation literally. Even many Christian evangelicals who reject the notion of purely naturalistic Darwinian evolution often treat the story as a nonliteral saga, as poetry, or as liturgical literature.

Genesis contains two accounts of the Creation: in chapter 1 man was created after the animals (), while in chapter 2 man was created () before the animals (). Proponents of the Documentary hypothesis suggest that Genesis 1 was a litany from the &quot;Priestly&quot; source (possibly from an early Jewish liturgy), while Genesis 2 was assembled from older &quot;Jahwist&quot; material, holding that, for both stories to be a single account, Adam would have named all the animals, and God would have created Eve from his rib as a suitable mate, all within a single 24 hour period. Creationists responding to this point attribute the view to misunderstanding having arisen from poor translation of the tenses in Genesis 2 in contemporary translations of the Bible (e.g. compare &quot;planted&quot; and &quot;had planted&quot; in the King James Version and New International Version).

Some Christians assert that the Bible is free from error only in religious and moral matters, and that, where scientific or historic questions are concerned, the Bible should not be read literally. This position is held by a number of major denominations. For instance, in a publication entitled &quot;The Gift of Scripture&quot;, the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales comments that, &quot;We should not expect to find in Scripture full scientific accuracy or complete historical precision&quot;. The Bible is held to be true in passages relating to human salvation, but, &quot;We should not expect total accuracy from the Bible in other, secular matters&quot;. While the Catholic Church teaches that the Bible&#x27;s message is without error, it does not consider it always to be literal. By contrast, young Earth creationists contend that moral and spiritual matters in the Bible are intimately connected with its historical accuracy; in their view, the Bible stands or falls as a single indivisible block of knowledge.

Christian and Jewish theology actually has a long story of not interpreting the Genesis creation narrative literally: already in the 2nd century CE, Christian theologian and apologist Origen wrote that it was inconceivable to consider Genesis literal history, while Augustine of Hippo (4th century CE) argued that God created everything in the universe in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require; even earlier, 1st-century CE Jewish scholar Philo wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days or in any determinate amount of time.

Aside from the theological doubts voiced by other Christians, young Earth creationism also stands in opposition to the creation mythologies of other religions (both and extinct). Many of these make claims regarding the origin of the Universe and humanity that are completely incompatible with those of Christian creationists (and with one another). Marshaling support for the Judeo-Christian creation myth versus other creation myths after having rejected much of the scientific evidence is largely, then, done on the basis of accepting on faith the veracity of the biblical account rather than the alternative.

===Scientific refutation===
The vast majority of scientists reject young Earth creationism. Around the start of the 19th century mainstream science abandoned the concept that the Earth was younger than millions of years. Measurements of archeological, astrophysical, biological, chemical, cosmological, and geological timescales differ from YEC&#x27;s estimates of the Earth&#x27;s age by up to five orders of magnitude (that is, by a factor of a hundred thousand times). Scientific estimates of the age of the earliest pottery discovered at 20,000 BCE, the oldest known trees before 9,400 BCE, ice cores up to 800,000 years old, and layers of silt deposit in Lake Suigetsu at 52,800 years old, are all significantly older than YEC estimate of the Earth&#x27;s age. YEC&#x27;s theories are further contradicted by scientists&#x27; ability to observe galaxies billions of light years away.

The scientific community generally regards claims that YEC has a scientific basis to be religiously motivated pseudoscience, because young Earth creationists only look for evidence to support their preexisting belief that the Bible is a literal description of the development of the universe. In 1997, a poll by the Gallup organization showed that 5 per cent of U.S. adults with professional degrees in science took a young Earth creationist view. In the same poll, 40 per cent of the same group said they believed that life, including humans, had evolved over millions of years, but that God guided this process, a view described as theistic evolution, while 55 per cent held a view of &quot;naturalistic evolution&quot; in which no God took part in this process. Some scientists (such as Hugh Ross and Gerald Schroeder) who believe in creationism are known to subscribe to other forms, such as day-age creationism and progressive creationism, which posit an act of creation that took place millions or billions of years ago, with variations on the timing of the creation of mankind.

Chemist Paul Braterman has argued that young Earth creationism &quot;bears all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory&quot; by &quot;offering a complete parallel universe with its own organisations and rules of evidence, and claims that the scientific establishment promoting evolution is an arrogant and morally corrupt elite&quot;, adding that &quot;This so-called elite supposedly conspires to monopolise academic employment and research grants. Its alleged objective is to deny divine authority, and the ultimate beneficiary and prime mover is Satan.&quot;

<text>Robert W. Floyd (born Robert Willoughby Floyd; June 8, 1936 – September 25, 2001) was an American computer scientist. His contributions include the design of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm (independently of Stephen Warshall), which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a graph and his work on parsing; Floyd&#x27;s cycle-finding algorithm for detecting cycles in a sequence was attributed to him as well. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called Floyd–Steinberg dithering (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion). He pioneered in the field of program verification using logical assertions with the 1967 paper &quot;Assigning Meanings to Programs&quot;. This was a contribution to what later became Hoare logic. Floyd received the Turing Award in 1978.

== Life ==
Born in New York City, Floyd finished high school at age 14. At the University of Chicago, he received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in liberal arts in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1958. Floyd was a college roommate of Carl Sagan.

Floyd became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation (now IIT Research Institute) at Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1950s. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing many papers, including on compilers (particularly parsing). He was a pioneer of operator-precedence grammars, and is credited with initiating the field of programming language semantics in . He was appointed an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at Stanford University six years later. He obtained this position without a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree.

He was a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974.

He received the Turing Award in 1978 &quot;for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms&quot;.

Floyd worked closely with Donald Knuth, in particular as the major reviewer for Knuth&#x27;s seminal book &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, and is the person most cited in that work. He was co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook &quot;The Language of Machines: an Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages&quot;. Floyd supervised seven Ph.D. graduates.

Floyd married and divorced twice, first with Jana M. Mason and then computer scientist Christiane Floyd, and he had four children. In his last years he suffered from Pick&#x27;s disease, a neurodegenerative disease, and thus retired early in 1994.

His hobbies included hiking, and he was an avid backgammon player:

<doc id="301903" wikidata="Q1203436" url="?curid=301903" title="Old Earth creationism">
<text>Old Earth Creationism (OEC) is an umbrella of theological views encompassing certain varieties of creationism which may or can include day-age creationism, gap creationism, progressive creationism, and sometimes theistic evolution.

Broadly speaking, OEC usually occupies a middle ground between young Earth creationism (YEC) and theistic evolution (TE). In contrast to YEC, it is typically more compatible with the scientific consensus on the issues of physics, chemistry, geology, and the age of the Earth. However, like YEC and in contrast with TE, some forms of it reject macroevolution, claiming it is biologically untenable and not supported by the fossil record, and the concept of universal descent from a last universal common ancestor.

For a long time Evangelical creationists generally subscribed to Old Earth Creationism until 1960 when John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris published the book &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;, which caused the Young Earth creationist view to become prominent.

== History ==
Augustine postulated an instantaneous creation and interpreted the days of Genesis allegorically, whose view also influenced Gregory the Great, Bede and Isodor of Seville. Augustine was not alone in viewing the days of Genesis as allegorical, others include: Didumyus the Blind, possibly Basil the Great, Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Athanasius, who interpreted the days of the Genesis narrative allegorically. However, this should not be understood as rejecting the literal interpretation, which patristic commentators believed could stand side by side with the allegorical.

Cyprian argued that each of the days of Genesis symbolically represented 1000 years of the world’s history, believing the world would endure for 7000 years. Irenaeus and Justin Martyr also suggested that the days of Genesis could prefigure 6000 years of earth history, quoting Psalm 90:4 and perhaps 2 Peter. 

According to Hugh Ross, Thomas Aquinas supposedly denied the Genesis account as being literal with six 24 hour days.

Thomas Chalmers popularized gap creationism, which is a form of Old Earth Creationism. Additionally it was advocated by the Scofield Reference bible, which caused the theory to survive longer.

Probably the most famous day-age creationist was American politician, anti-evolution campaigner and Scopes Trial prosecutor William Jennings Bryan. Unlike many of his conservative followers, Bryan was not a strict biblical literalist, and had no objection to &quot;evolution before man but for the fact that a concession as to the truth of evolution up to man furnishes our opponents with an argument which they are quick to use, namely, if evolution accounts for all the species up to man, does it not raise a presumption in behalf of evolution to include man?&quot; He considered defining the days in Genesis 1 to be twenty-four hours to be a pro-evolution straw man argument to make attacking creationists easier, and admitted under questioning at the Scopes trial that the world was far older than six thousand years, and that the days of creation were probably longer than twenty-four hours each.

American Baptist preacher and anti-evolution campaigner William Bell Riley, &quot;The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism&quot;, founder of the World Christian Fundamentals Association and of the Anti-Evolution League of America was another prominent day-age creationist in the first half of the 20th century, who defended this position in a famous debate with friend and prominent young Earth creationist Harry Rimmer.

==Types==

===Gap creationism===

Gap creationism is a form of old Earth creationism which posits the belief that the six-&quot;yom&quot; creation period, as described in the Book of Genesis, involved six literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and second verses of Genesis, which the theory states explains many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth. This view was popularized in 1909 by the Scofield Reference Bible.

===Progressive creationism===

Progressive creationism is the religious belief that God created new forms of life gradually over a period of hundreds of millions of years. As a form of Old Earth creationism, it accepts mainstream geological and cosmological estimates for the age of the Earth and age of the Universe, some tenets of biology such as microevolution as well as archaeology to make its case. In this view creation occurred in rapid bursts in which all &quot;kinds&quot; of plants and animals appear in stages lasting millions of years. The bursts are followed by periods of stasis or equilibrium to accommodate new arrivals. These bursts represent instances of God creating new types of organisms by divine intervention. As viewed from the archaeological record, progressive creationism holds that &quot;species do not gradually appear by the steady transformation of its ancestors; [but] appear all at once and &quot;fully formed.&quot; Thus the evidence for macroevolution is claimed to be false, but microevolution is accepted as a genetic parameter designed by the Creator into the fabric of genetics to allow for environmental adaptations and survival. Generally, it is viewed by proponents as a middle ground between literal creationism and evolution.

==Approaches to Genesis 1==
Old Earth Christian creationists may approach the creation accounts of Genesis in a number of different ways.

=== Framework interpretation ===
The framework interpretation (or framework hypothesis) notes that there is a pattern or &quot;framework&quot; present in the Genesis account and that, because of this, the account may not have been intended as a strict chronological record of creation. Instead, the creative events may be presented in a topical order. This view is broad enough that proponents of other old earth views (such as many Day-Age creationists) have no problem with many of the key points put forward by the hypothesis, though they might believe that there &quot;is&quot; a certain degree of chronology present.

===Day-age creationism===

Day-age creationism is an effort to reconcile the literal Genesis account of creation with modern scientific theories on the age of the universe, the Earth, life, and humans. It holds that the six days referred to in the Genesis account of creation are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather are much longer periods (of thousands or millions of years). The Genesis account is then interpreted as an account of the process of cosmic evolution, providing a broad base on which any number of theories and interpretations are built. Proponents of the day-age theory can be found among theistic evolutionists and progressive creationists.

The day-age theory tries to reconcile these views by arguing that the creation &quot;days&quot; were not ordinary 24-hour days, but actually lasted for long periods of time—or as the theory&#x27;s name implies: the &quot;days&quot; each lasted an age. Most advocates of old Earth creationism hold that the six days referred to in the creation account given in Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, as the Hebrew word for &quot;day&quot; (&quot;yom&quot;) can be interpreted in this context to mean a long period of time (thousands or millions of years) rather than a 24-hour day. According to this view, the sequence and duration of the creation &quot;days&quot; is representative or symbolic of the sequence and duration of events that scientists theorize to have happened, such that Genesis can be read as a summary of modern science, simplified for the benefit of pre-scientific humans.

===Cosmic time===
Gerald Schroeder puts forth a view which reconciles 24-hour creation days with an age of billions of years for the universe by noting, as creationist Phillip E. Johnson summarizes in his article &quot;What Would Newton Do?&quot;: &quot;the Bible speaks of time from the viewpoint of the universe as a whole, which Schroeder interprets to mean at the moment of &#x27;quark confinement,&#x27; when stable matter formed from energy early in the first second of the big bang.&quot; Schroeder calculates that a period of six days under the conditions of quark confinement, when the universe was approximately a trillion times smaller and hotter than it is today is equal to fifteen billion years of earth time today. This is all due to space expansion after quark confinement. Thus Genesis and modern physics are reconciled. Schroeder, though, states in an earlier book, &quot;Genesis and the Big Bang&quot;, that the Earth and solar system is some &quot;4.5 to 5 billion years&quot; old and also states in a later book, &quot;The Science of God&quot;, that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old.

== The Biblical Flood ==

Some old Earth creationists reject flood geology, a position which leaves them open to accusations that they thereby reject the infallibility of scripture (which states that the Genesis flood covered the whole of the earth). In response, old Earth creationists cite verses in the Bible where the words &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;all&quot; clearly require a contextual interpretation. Old Earth creationists generally believe that the human race was localised around the Middle East at the time of the Genesis flood, a position which is in conflict with the Out of Africa theory.

<text>Thomas Jefferson Terral (December 21, 1882 – March 9, 1946) was an American attorney and the 27th governor of Arkansas, serving one term from 1925 to 1927.

==Early life==
Terral was born in Union Parish in northern Louisiana. He attended the University of Kentucky at Lexington, Kentucky and transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville from which he graduated in 1910. He was admitted to the bar in 1910 and established a private law practice in Little Rock. He also worked as a school teacher.

==Career==
From 1911 to 1915, Terral worked as an assistant secretary of the Arkansas Senate where he learned the mechanics of state politics. In addition to the Senate position, Terral served as deputy state superintendent of public instruction from 1912 to 1916. These dual positions allowed Terral to assemble a range of statewide political contacts.

===State politics===
In 1916, Terral was elected Arkansas Secretary of State and served two two-year terms from 1917 to 1921. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in the 1920 Democratic primary, having lost to Thomas Chipman McRae.

Preparing to run again for governor in 1924, Terral joined the Ku Klux Klan in Morehouse Parish, which adjoins his native Union Parish. Apparently, he was rejected for Klan membership by various chapters in Arkansas but wanted to show his commitment to the organization as he mounted his gubernatorial race. In the Democratic primary, prior to the institution of runoff elections in Arkansas, Terral defeated several opponents, including future Lieutenant Governor William Lee Cazort of Johnson County, the original choice of the Ku Klux Klan hierarchy. Terral also defeated John Ellis Martineau, who came back in 1926 to unseat Terral in the primary. In the general election held that year in October 1924, Terral defeated Republican John W. Grabiel, an Ohio native and an attorney from Fayetteville who had also run unsuccessfully against Governor McRae in 1922. Terral received 99,598 votes (79.8 percent) to Grabiel&#x27;s 25,152 (20.2 percent). Terral served as governor from 1925 to 1927.

During Terral&#x27;s term the first state park was opened at Petit Jean Mountain. Construction of the state hospital was commenced during his tenure and the post of Commissioner of Insurance and Revenue was created. After one term, Terral was unseated in the Democratic primary by Martineau, who accused him of having previously taken kickbacks from publishers in developing the state-approved list of public school textbooks. Terral would become the first of three Arkansas governors denied second terms. The others were Francis Cherry, and Frank White.

==Death==
After his term as governor, Terral made three unsuccessful comeback bids for Governor and returned to his private law practice in Little Rock, where he died in 1946. Terral is interred at Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Little Rock. He and his wife, Eula Terral (same maiden and married names), originally from Pine Bluff in Jefferson County, had no children.

<text>Tiwa ( ) (Spanish &quot;Tigua&quot;, also &quot;E-nagh-magh&quot;) is a group of two, possibly three, related Tanoan languages spoken by the Tiwa Pueblo, and possibly Piro Pueblo, in the U.S. state of New Mexico.

==Subfamily members and relations==

Southern Tiwa is spoken in by around 1,600 people in Isleta Pueblo, Sandia Pueblo, and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (Tigua Pueblo).

The remaining two languages form a subgrouping known as &quot;Northern Tiwa&quot;. Northern Tiwa consists of Taos spoken by 800 people in Taos Pueblo and Picuris spoken by around 220 people in Picuris Pueblo.

The extinct language of Piro Pueblo may also have been a Tiwan language, but this is uncertain (see Piro Pueblo language).

==History==

After the Pueblo Revolt against the Spanish conquistadors in 1680, some of the Tigua and Piro peoples fled south with the Spanish to El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez, Mexico). There they founded Ysleta del Sur, Texas; Socorro, Texas; and Senecú del Sur, Mexico. Their descendants continued to live in these communities as late as 1996.

<doc id="301910" wikidata="Q149560" url="?curid=301910" title="Battle of Stallupönen">
<text>The Battle of Stallupönen, fought between Russian and German armies on August 17, 1914, was the opening battle of World War I on the Eastern Front. The Germans under the command of Hermann von François conducted a successful counterattack against four Russian infantry divisions from different infantry corps, which heavily outnumbered them but were separated from each other, creating a gap between the 27th Infantry Division and the 40th Infantry Division, and had little coordination with each other. The Germans retreated to Gumbinnen thereafter.

==Prelude==
According to Prit Buttar: The Dual Alliance and Franco-Russian Treaty, and the obligations contained within them, would prove to be major mechanisms in the outbreak of war in 1914. The obligations of interlocking treaties now imposed themselves upon the plans and intentions of the military commanders. Russia had mobilised with a view to attacking Austria-Hungary in support of Serbia, but as German mobilisation would result in a major attack on France, the Russians had to devote the main strength of their regular army to launching an early attack on East Prussia in an attempt to draw off German troops from the Western Front.Germany&#x27;s attack on France followed the Schlieffen Plan, a flanking advance through Belgium, with limited forces opposing Russia until a rapid victory over France freed up troops for the Eastern Front. France was counting on an early Russian attack on Germany, forcing the German redeployment of troops from the Western Front. Likewise, Russia was optimistic a quick attack on East Prussia to the Vistula would be decisive, allowing Russia to attack Galicia.

Russia deployed the First Army, commanded by Paul von Rennenkampf, and the Second Army, commanded by Alexander Samsonov, for the attack. Combined Russian forces consisted of 208 infantry battalions, and over nine cavalry divisions with 192 squadrons. The First Army would attack north of the Masurian Lakes, while the Second Army attacked from the south. Germany defended East Prussia with the Eighth Army, commanded by Maximilian von Prittwitz, consisting of 100 battalions, supported by reserve and &quot;Landwehr&quot; formations. German defenses included fortifications along the Masurian Lakes, the Königsberg fortifications, and the Toruń Fortress.

Anticipating that the Russians would attack north of the Rominter Heath, then west along the Pregel Valley, Prittwitz ordered Hermann von François&#x27; First Corps to take up positions along the Angerapp river. However, François advocated a forward defense, and by 13 August, had advanced his corps along a line from Goldap to Stallupönen, 32 km east of his orders. On 15 August Rennenkampf crossed the border with six infantry divisions, intending to follow the railway through Stallupönen and Gumbinnen.

==Battle==
On 15 August, François&#x27; men encountered First Army&#x27;s reconnaissance units northeast of Stallupönen, and captured Eydtkuhnen that night as the Russians withdrew. On 16 August, Prittwitz ordered François back to Gumbinnen as he moved the Eighth Army to the Angerapp, after his &quot;Flieger Abteilung 16&quot; reconnaissance flight spotted the Second Army concentrating. However, François kept his 1st Division at Stallupönen, and his 2nd Division divided between Galdap and Tollmingkehmen.

On 17 August, Rennenkampf advanced with all three of his infantry corps, but in an uncoordinated fashion. His cavalry was to the north, while the 20th Army Corps, with the 28th and 29th infantry divisions, north of the road, and the 3rd Army Corps, with the 25th and 27th infantry divisions on the road and south of it. The 4th Army Corps, with the 40th and 30th infantry divisions were advancing on the Rominte Heath further south. François called up General Adalbert von Falk&#x27;s 2nd Division in Tollmingkehmen, and his howitzers in Gumbinnen, to reinforce his position in Stallupönen as the battle intensified by mid-day. At 1:00 pm, Prittwitz&#x27;s envoy arrived, and ordered François to retreat to Gumbinnen. François&#x27; reply was to Tell General von Prittwitz that General von François will break off the engagement when the Russians are defeated.As Falk advanced, he was able to attack the flank of the Russian 27th Infantry Division near Göritten, when a gap formed between the Russian 27th and 40th infantry divisions.

A furious frontal attack broke the Russian division, which fled eastward, losing 3,000 casualties and 5,000 prisoners, including almost the entirety of the Russian 105th Regiment. 25th divisions achieved some success to the north of Stallupönen and captured several captives and guns, they could not change the outcome of the battle. But the actions of the 29th division had a decisive result, its counterattack to the rear of Francois created a threat of encirclement and the Germans were forced to stop the battle.

==Aftermath==
The Germans did not use their success, besides, the Russians continued to put pressure, realizing that he could not withstand further battle he instead ordered a withdrawal to Gumbinnen as ordered. Prittwitz, capitalizing on François&#x27; success, moved his forces forward, while François held Gumbinnen.

<doc id="301913" wikidata="Q158857" url="?curid=301913" title="Biblical inerrancy">
<text>Biblical inerrancy is the belief that the Bible &quot;is without error or fault in all its teaching&quot;; or, at least, that &quot;Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact&quot;. 

The belief in Biblical inerrancy is of particular significance within parts of evangelicalism, where it is formulated in the &quot;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy&quot;. Inerrancy has been much more of an issue in American evangelicalism than in British evangelicalism: according to Stephen R. Holmes, it &quot;plays almost no role in British evangelical life&quot;. Some groups equate inerrancy with biblical infallibility or with the necessary clarity of scripture; others do not.

The Catholic Church also holds a limited belief in biblical inerrancy for the original writings in the original language including the Deuterocanonicals, particularly in relating to the goal of salvation: that &quot;since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of our salvation.&quot; However, descriptions of natural phenomena are not to be taken as inspired and inerrant scientific assertions, but reflect the language and contemporary understanding of the writers.

== Terms and positions ==





===Positions===
* Judaism: according to H. Chaim Schimmel, Judaism had never promulgated a belief in the literal word of the Hebrew Bible, hence the co-existence of the Oral Torah. The significance of most phrases, their parts, grammar, and occasionally individual words, letters and even pronunciation in the Hebrew Bible are the subject of many rabbinic discussions in the Talmud.
* Catholic Church: the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) authoritatively expressed the Catholic Church&#x27;s view on biblical inerrancy. 
** Citing earlier declarations, it stated: &quot;Since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation.&quot; But theologians disagree as to whether the words &quot;for the sake of our salvation&quot; in that sentence represent a shift from complete to limited inerrancy. 
** The Council did not endorse the necessary clarity of scripture: &quot;Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.&quot;
** The Church interprets the Scripture as part of the Deposit of Faith with Sacred Tradition, and not in an apostolic vacuum: interpretations of Scripture which contradict magisterial teaching to that extent fail to capture the inerrant meaning. 
* Evangelical Christianity: Evangelicals generally affirm that the Bible, and the Bible alone, is inspired by God and is the final authority on matters of faith and practice. However, there is an ongoing debate between two primary factions:
#The inerrant view - the Bible is absolutely inerrant on all matters that it affirms.
#The infallible but not inerrant view - while the Bible is infallible in that it does not fail believers when trusted to do what God inspired it to do, it is not absolutely inerrant in all matters it affirms, especially in some of its tangential scientific and historical statements.

== History ==
According to Coleman (1975), &quot;[t]here have been long periods in the history of the church when biblical inerrancy has not been a critical question. It has in fact been noted that only in the last two centuries can we legitimately speak of a formal doctrine of inerrancy.&quot; The first formulations of the doctrine of inerrancy were not established according to the authority of a council, creed, or church, until the post-Reformation period.

=== Early Church ===
Origen of Alexandria thought there were minor discrepancies between the accounts of the Gospels but dismissed them due to their lack of theological importance, writing &quot;let these four [Gospels] agree with each other concerning certain things revealed to them by the Spirit and let them disagree a little concerning other things&quot; (&quot;Commentary on John&quot; 10.4).

Later, John Chrysostom was also unconcerned with the notion that the scriptures were in congruence with all matters of history unimportant to matters of faith:

John D. Woodbridge disputes this claim about Chrysostom writing, &quot;In fact, Chrysostom apparently believed in biblical infallibility extended to every detail. He does not set forth a comprehensive discussion of the subject, but scholars who have surveyed the corpus of his work usually affirm that this is case.&quot;

In his &quot;Commentary on Galatians&quot;, Jerome also argued that Paul&#x27;s rebuke of Peter in Galatians 2:11–14 for acting like a Jew around the Jewish faction of the early Church was an insincere &quot;white lie&quot; as Paul himself had done the same thing. In response, Augustine rebuked Jerome&#x27;s interpretation and affirmed that the scriptures contained no mistakes in them, and that admitting a single mistake would shed doubt on the entire scripture:

However, John D. Hannah argues that Jerome did indeed affirm the historical nature of the Bible. For example, Jerome believed in the historicity of the book of Jonah. He further argues that while Origen resorted to allegorical interpretation, he held a high view of inerrancy.

Biblical inerrancy adherents say that the Early Church Fathers did hold to biblical inerrancy, even if it was not articulated that way. In particular, Shawn Nelson cites Clement of Rome, Papias, Ignatius of Antioch, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Didache, and the Epistle to Diognetus as examples of those whom held to inerrancy.

Clement of Rome said to his readers:

=== Medieval era ===

The medieval church fathers held to the divine origin of scripture and most believed there could not be any error in scripture as interpreted by the Church. The most prominent theologian of the Medieval era was Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas wrote:

Another theologian, Hugh of St. Victor, is known for stressing the importance of the historical and literal senses of the Bible in the face of the strong allegorizing tendency of the age. He wrote:

Philosopher John Wycliff proposed an extreme version of inerrancy, that meant that even parables must have been factually true, in the book &quot;&quot; (On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture, c.1378). Wycliffe&#x27;s dictum says that all truths necessary to faith are found clearly and expressly in the Bible, and the more necessary, the more expressly. This later influenced Martin Luther.

Scholar Erasmus of Rotterdam, who published the first Latin-Greek New Testament in print, believed not only that translation between languages was always imperfect, that transmission errors had occurred by scribes, and that Scripture was sometimes deliberately obscure, but also that &quot;the sayings of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke) were slightly different in each. He suggested that the Holy Spirit had not bothered to correct the faulty memories of the evangelists.&quot;

=== Reformation era ===
By the time of the Reformation, there was still no official doctrine of inerrancy. Although the term was not used, some scholars argue the Reformers did believe in the concept of inerrancy.

For Martin Luther (1483–1546), for example, &quot;inspiration did not insure inerrancy in all details. Luther recognizes mistakes and inconsistencies in Scripture and treated them with lofty indifference because they did not touch the heart of the Gospel.&quot; When Matthew appears to confuse Jeremiah with Zechariah in Matthew 27:9, Luther wrote that &quot;Such points do not bother me particularly.&quot; However, other Luther scholars have pointed out that Luther, in other places, said the Scripture cannot contradict itself. Luther said in regards to whether the Bible had errors or not, &quot;the Scriptures cannot err.&quot; Other statements made by Luther seem to contradict that, e.g. he stated that he found numerous errors in the Bible, and lambasted a couple of books of the Protestant Bible as worthless; he also stated that his idea of Christ trumps the letter of the Scripture, especially when the Scripture is cited in order to give the lie to his idea.

The Christian humanist and one of the leading scholars of the northern Renaissance, Erasmus (1466–1536), was also unconcerned with minor errors not impacting theology, and at one point, thought that Matthew mistook one word for another. In a letter to Johannes Eck, Erasmus wrote that &quot;Nor, in my view, would the authority of the whole of Scripture be instantly imperiled, as you suggest, if an evangelist by a slip of memory did put one name for another, Isaiah for instance instead of Jeremiah, for this is not a point on which anything turns.&quot;

The same point of view held true for John Calvin (1509–1564), who wrote that &quot;It is well known that the Evangelists were not very concerned with observing the time sequences.&quot; However, Calvin also said that Scripture is the &quot;certain and unerring rule.&quot; Calvin scholars are divided on whether Calvin actually held to inerrancy or not. Some scholars such as Jack B. Rogers and Donald McKim said Calvin &quot;was unconcerned with normal, human inaccuracies in minor matters&quot; in Scripture. Other scholars such as John D. Woodbridge and J.I. Packer said Calvin did adhere to a position equivalent to biblical inerrancy.

The doctrine of inerrancy, however, began to develop as a response to these Protestant attitudes. Whereas the Council of Trent only held that the Bible&#x27;s authority was &quot;in matters of faith and morals&quot;, Jesuit cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542–1621) argued in his 1586 , the first volume of his multi-volume that &quot;There can be no error in Scripture, whether it deals with faith or whether it deals with morals/mores, or whether it states something general and common to the whole Church, or something particular and pertaining to only one person.&quot; Bellarmine&#x27;s views were extremely important in his condemnation of Galileo and in Catholic–Protestant debate, as the Protestant response was to also affirm his heightened understanding of inerrancy.

=== Post-Reformation ===
In the 17th century, Quaker apologist Robert Barclay took a step away from Biblical Inerrancy while continuing to affirm Biblical inspiration and the Bible&#x27;s place in Christian doctrine. Barclay said that &quot;errors [in the Bible] may be supposed by the injury of the times to have slipped in&quot;, but that because of inspiration from the Holy Spirit, all necessities remained.

During the 18th and 19th centuries and in the aftermath of the Enlightenment critique of religion, various episodes of the Bible (for example the Noahide worldwide flood, the creation in six days, and the creation of women from a man&#x27;s rib) began increasingly to be seen as legendary rather than as literally true. This led to further questioning of the veracity of biblical texts.

== Modern Protestant discussion ==
The Fuller Theological Seminary formally adopted inerrancy restricted to theological matters (what some authors now call &quot;infallibility&quot;). It explained:

A more comprehensive position was espoused particularly in the magazine &quot;Christianity Today&quot; and the book entitled &quot;The Battle for the Bible&quot; by Harold Lindsell. Lindsell asserted that losing the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture was the thread that would unravel the church and conservative Christians rallied behind this idea.

=== Arguments in favour of inerrancy ===
Norman Geisler and William Nix (1986) write that scriptural inerrancy is typically argued by a number of observations and processes, which include:

* The alleged historical accuracy of the Bible
* The Bible&#x27;s alleged claims of its own inerrancy
* General church history and tradition
* One&#x27;s individual experience with God

Daniel B. Wallace, Professor of New Testament at Dallas Theological Seminary, divides the various evidences into two approaches: deductive and inductive approaches.

==== Deductive justifications ====
The first deductive justification is that the Bible says it is inspired by God (for instance &quot;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness&quot;, 2 Timothy 3:16) and because God is perfect, the Bible must also be perfect and, hence, free from error. For instance, the statement of faith of the Evangelical Theological Society says, &quot;The Bible alone, and the Bible in its entirety, is the Word of God written and is therefore inerrant in the autographs&quot;.

Supportive of this is the idea that God cannot lie. W. J. Mcrea writes:

Stanley Grenz states that:

Also, from Geisler:

A second reason offered is that Jesus and the apostles used the Old Testament in a way that assumes it is inerrant. For instance, in Galatians 3:16, Paul bases his argument on the fact that the word &quot;seed&quot; in the Genesis reference to &quot;Abraham and his seed&quot; is singular rather than plural. This (as stated) sets a precedent for inerrant interpretation down to the individual letters of the words.
Similarly, Jesus said that every minute detail of the Old Testament Law must be fulfilled, indicating (it is stated) that every detail must be correct:
Although in these verses, Jesus and the apostles are only referring to the Old Testament, the argument is considered by some to extend to the New Testament writings, because 2 Peter 3:16 accords the status of scripture to New Testament writings also: &quot;He (Paul) writes the same way in all his letters...which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other scriptures&quot;.

==== Inductive justifications ====
Wallace describes the inductive approach by enlisting the Presbyterian theologian Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield:

=====Inspiration=====
In the Nicene Creed, Christians confess their belief that the Holy Spirit &quot;has spoken through the prophets&quot;. This creed has been normative for Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, Lutherans and all mainline Protestant denominations except for those descended from the non-credal Stone-Campbell movement. As stated by Alister E. McGrath, &quot;An important element in any discussion of the manner in which scripture is inspired, and the significance which is attached to this, is 2 Timothy 3:16–17, which speaks of scripture as &#x27;God-breathed&#x27; ()&quot;. According to McGrath, &quot;the reformers did not see the issue of inspiration as linked with the absolute historical reliability or factual inerrancy of the biblical texts&quot;. He says, &quot;The development of ideas of &#x27;biblical infallibility&#x27; or &#x27;inerrancy&#x27; within Protestantism can be traced to the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century&quot;.

People who believe in total inerrancy think that the Bible does not merely contain the Word of God, but every word of it is, because of verbal inspiration, the direct, immediate word of God. The Lutheran Apology of the Augsburg Confession identifies Holy Scripture with the Word of God and calls the Holy Spirit the author of the Bible. Because of this, Lutherans confess in the Formula of Concord, &quot;we receive and embrace with our whole heart the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of Israel&quot;. Lutherans (and other Protestants) believe apocryphal books are neither inspired nor written by prophets, and that they contain errors and were never included in the &quot;Palestinian Canon&quot; that Jesus and the Apostles are said to have used, and therefore are not a part of Holy Scripture. The prophetic and apostolic scriptures are authentic as written by the prophets and apostles. A correct translation of their writings is God&#x27;s Word because it has the same meaning as the original Hebrew and Greek. A mistranslation is not God&#x27;s word, and no human authority can invest it with divine authority.

However, the 19th-century Anglican biblical scholar S. R. Driver held a contrary view, saying that, &quot;as inspiration does not suppress the individuality of the biblical writers, so it does not altogether neutralise their human infirmities or confer upon them immunity from error&quot;. Similarly, J. K. Mozley, an early 20th-century Anglican theologian has argued:
=====Divine authority=====
For a believer in total (or &quot;plenary&quot;) biblical inerrancy, Holy Scripture is the Word of God, and carries the full authority of God. Every single statement of the Bible calls for instant and unqualified acceptance. Every doctrine of the Bible is the teaching of God and therefore requires full agreement. Every promise of the Bible calls for unshakable trust in its fulfillment. Every command of the Bible is the directive of God himself and therefore demands willing observance.

=====Sufficiency=====
According to some believers, the Bible contains everything that they need to know to obtain salvation and live a Christian life, and there are no deficiencies in scripture that need to be filled with tradition, pronouncements of the Pope, new revelations, or present-day development of doctrine.

====Clarifications====
=====Accuracy vs. truth=====
Harold Lindsell points out that it is a &quot;gross distortion&quot; to state that people who believe in inerrancy suppose every statement made in the Bible is true (as opposed to accurate). He says there are expressly false statements in the Bible, but they are reported accurately. He notes that &quot;All the Bible does, for example in the case of Satan, is to report what Satan actually said. Whether what he said was true or false is another matter. Christ stated that the devil is a liar&quot;.

=====Inerrancy vs. infallibility=====
Many who believe in the &quot;inspiration&quot; of scripture teach that it is infallible but not inerrant. Those who subscribe to infallibility believe that what the scriptures say regarding matters of faith and Christian practice are wholly useful and true. Some denominations that teach infallibility hold that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Those who believe in total or plenary inerrancy hold that the scientific, geographic, and historic details of the scriptural texts in their original manuscripts are completely true and without error, though the scientific claims of scripture must be interpreted in the light of its phenomenological nature, not just with strict, clinical literality, which was foreign to historical narratives.

=====Metaphor and literalism=====
Even if the Bible is inerrant, it may need to be interpreted to distinguish between what statements are metaphorical, and which are literally true. Jeffrey Russell writes that &quot;Metaphor is a valid way to interpret reality. The &#x27;literal&#x27; meaning of words – which I call the overt reading – is insufficient for understanding reality because it never exhausts reality.&quot; He adds:

Figures such as Scot McKnight have also argued that the Bible clearly transcends multiple genres and Hebrew prose poems cannot be evaluated by a reader the same as a science textbook.

=== Criticism ===
==== Theological criticism ====
Proponents of Biblical inerrancy often cite 2 Timothy 3:16 as evidence that scripture is inerrant. For this argument, they prefer translations that render the verse as &quot;All scripture is given by inspiration of God,&quot; and they interpret this to mean that the whole Bible must therefore be in some way inerrant. However, critics of this doctrine think that the Bible makes no direct claim to be inerrant or infallible. C. H. Dodd argues the same sentence can also be translated &quot;Every inspired scripture is also useful&quot;, nor does the verse define the Biblical canon to which &quot;scripture&quot; refers. In addition, Michael T. Griffith, the Mormon apologist, writes:

The Catholic New Jerusalem Bible also has a note that this passage refers only to the Old Testament writings understood to be scripture at the time it was written. Furthermore, the Catholic Veritas Bible website says that &quot;Rather than characterizing the Old Testament scriptures as required reading, Paul is simply promoting them as something useful or advantageous to learn.[...] it falls far short of a salvational requirement or theological system. Moreover, the four purposes (to teach, correct, etc.) for which scripture is declared to be &#x27;profitable&#x27; are solely the functions of the ministry. After all, Paul is addressing one of his new bishops (the &#x27;man of God&#x27;). Not a word addresses the use of scripture by the laity.&quot; Another note in the Bible suggests that there are indications that Paul&#x27;s writings were being considered, at least by the author of the Second Epistle of Peter, as comparable to the Old Testament.

The view that total Biblical inerrancy can be justified by an appeal to prooftexts that refer to its divine inspiration has been criticized as circular reasoning, because these statements are only considered to be true if the Bible is already thought to be inerrant.

In the introduction to his book &quot;Credible Christianity&quot;, Anglican Bishop Hugh Montefiore, comments:

=====Liberal Christianity=====
In general, liberal Christianity has no problem with the thought that the Bible has errors and contradictions. Liberal Christians reject the dogma of inerrancy or infallibility of the Bible, which they see as the idolatry (fetishism) of the Bible. Martin Luther emphatically declared: &quot;if our opponents allege Scripture against Christ, we allege Christ against Scripture.&quot;

William John Lyons quoted William Wrede and Hermann Gunkel, who affirmed: &quot;Like every other real science, New Testament Theology has its goal simply in itself, and is totally indifferent to all dogma and Systematic Theology[...] the spirit of historical investigation has now taken the place of a traditional doctrine of inspiration&quot;.

John Shelby Spong, author and former bishop of the Episcopal Church who was well-known for his post-theistic theology, declared that the literal interpretation of the Bible is heresy.

=====Meaning of &quot;Word of God&quot;=====
Much debate over the kind of authority that should be accorded biblical texts centers on what is meant by the &quot;Word of God&quot;. The term can refer to Christ himself as well as to the proclamation of his ministry as kerygma. However, total biblical inerrancy differs from this orthodoxy in viewing the Word of God to mean the entire text of the Bible when interpreted didactically as God&#x27;s teaching. The idea of the Bible itself as the Word of God, as being itself God&#x27;s revelation, is criticized in neo-orthodoxy. Here the Bible is seen as a unique witness to the people and deeds that do make up the Word of God. However, it is a wholly human witness. All books of the Bible were written by human beings. Thus, whether the Bible is—in whole or in part—the Word of God is not clear. However, some argue that the Bible can still be construed as the &quot;Word of God&quot; in the sense that these authors&#x27; statements may have been representative of, and perhaps even directly influenced by, God&#x27;s own knowledge.

There is only one instance in the Bible where the phrase &quot;the Word of God&quot; refers to something written. The reference is to the Decalogue. However, most other references are to reported speech preserved in the Bible. The New Testament also contains a number of statements that refer to passages from the Old Testament as God&#x27;s words, for instance Romans 3:2, d (which says that the Jews have been &quot;entrusted with the very words of God&quot;), or the book of Hebrews, which often prefaces Old Testament quotations with words such as &quot;God says&quot;. The Bible also contains words spoken by human beings &quot;about&quot; God, such as Eliphaz (Job 42:7) and the prayers and songs of the Psalter. That these are God&#x27;s words addressed to humanity was at the root of a lively medieval controversy. The idea of the word of God is more that God is encountered in scripture, than that every line of scripture is a statement made by God.

While the phrase &quot;the Word of God&quot; is never applied to the modern Bible within the Bible itself, supporters of total inerrancy argue that this is because the Biblical canon was not closed. In 1 Thessalonians 2:23 the apostle Paul wrote to the church in Thessalonica, &quot;When you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God.&quot;

==== Translation ====

Translation has given rise to a number of issues, as the original languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. Some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the King James Only movement. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because some of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult-to-translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.

=== Autographic texts and modern versions ===
Those who hold the total inerrancy of the Bible have a variety of views as to whether inerrancy refers to modern Bibles or only to the original, autographic texts. There are also disagreements about whether, because the autographic texts no longer survive, modern texts can be said to be inerrant. Article X of the Chicago statement agrees that the inspiration for the words of the Bible can only strictly be applied to the autographs. However, the same article asserts that the original text &quot;can be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy&quot;, so that the lack of the originals does not affect the claim of biblical inerrancy of such recovered, modern texts. Robert Saucy, for instance, reports that writers have argued that &quot;99 percent of the original words in the New Testament are recoverable with a high degree of certainty.&quot;

For the Catholic church, the Latin Vulgate translation has been declared &quot;authentic&quot;, meaning that where the Latin Vulgate diverges from the original languages, for example by translator or scribal error, it is either not significant for faith or morals or is true in its own right.

==== Textual tradition of the New Testament ====
Most of these manuscripts date to the Middle Ages. The oldest complete copy of the New Testament, the Codex Sinaiticus, which includes two other books (the Epistle of Barnabas and The Shepherd of Hermas) not now included in the accepted NT canon, dates to the 4th century. The earliest fragment of a New Testament book is the Rylands Library Papyrus P52 which dates from 125–175 AD, recent research pointing to a date nearer to 200 AD.

The average NT manuscript is about 200 pages, and in all, there are about 1.3 million pages of text. No two manuscripts are identical, except in the smallest fragments, and the many manuscripts that preserve New Testament texts differ among themselves in many respects, with some estimates of 200,000 to 300,000 differences among the various manuscripts. According to Bart Ehrman:

In the 2008 Greer-Heard debate series, New Testament scholars Bart Ehrman and Daniel B. Wallace discussed these variances in detail. Wallace mentioned that understanding the meaning of the number of variances is not as simple as looking at the number of variances, but one must consider also the number of manuscripts, the types of errors, and among the more serious discrepancies, what impact they do or do not have.

For hundreds of years, Biblical and textual scholars have examined the manuscripts extensively. Since the eighteenth century, they have employed the techniques of textual criticism to reconstruct how the extant manuscripts of the New Testament texts might have descended, and to recover earlier recensions of the texts. However, King James Version (KJV)-only inerrantists often prefer the traditional texts (i.e., , which is the basis of KJV) used in their churches to modern attempts of reconstruction (i.e., Nestle-Aland Greek Text, which is the basis of modern translations), arguing that the Holy Spirit is just as active in the preservation of the scriptures as in their creation.

KJV-only inerrantist Jack Moorman says that at least 356 doctrinal passages are affected by the differences between the and the Nestle-Aland Greek Text.

Some modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate areas where there is disagreement between source documents. Bible commentaries offer discussions of these.

==== Inerrantist response ====
Evangelical Christians generally accept the findings of textual criticism, and nearly all modern translations, including the New Testament of the New International Version, are based on &quot;the widely accepted principles of[...] textual criticism&quot;.

Since textual criticism suggests that the manuscript copies are not perfect, strict inerrancy is only applied to the original autographs (the manuscripts written by the original authors) rather than the copies. However total inerrantists usually claim that imperfect manuscripts have a negligible effect on our ability to know what the autographs said. For example, evangelical theologian Wayne Grudem writes:

The &quot;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy&quot; says, &quot;We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic text of Scripture&quot;. However, it also reads: &quot;We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the assertion of biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.&quot;

Less commonly, more conservative views are held by some groups.
 
A minority of total biblical inerrantists go further than the Chicago Statement, arguing that the original text has been perfectly preserved and passed down through time. This is sometimes called &quot; Onlyism&quot;, as it is believed the Greek text by this name (Latin for received text) is a perfect and inspired copy of the original and supersedes earlier manuscript copies. This position is based on the idea that only the original language God spoke in is inspired, and that God was pleased to preserve that text throughout history by the hands of various scribes and copyists. Thus the acts as the inerrant source text for translations to modern languages. For example, in Spanish-speaking cultures the commonly accepted &quot;KJV-equivalent&quot; is the Reina-Valera 1909 revision (with different groups accepting, in addition to the 1909 or in its place, the revisions of 1862 or 1960). The New King James Version was also translated from the .

=====King James Only inerrantists=====
A faction of those in the &quot;King James Only movement&quot; rejects the whole discipline of textual criticism and holds that the translators of the King James Version English Bible were guided by God and that the KJV thus is to be taken as the authoritative English Bible. One of its most vocal, prominent and thorough proponents was Peter Ruckman.

=====Michael Licona=====
In 2010, Michael Licona published a book defending the resurrection of Jesus called, &quot;The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach&quot;. In one part of the book, Licona raised questions about the literal interpretation of the resurrection of the saints in Matthew 27:51-53. He suggests the passage of scripture is an apocalyptic genre. Scholars such as Norman Geisler accused Licona of denying the full inerrancy of the Bible in general and the Gospel narratives in particular. As a result, Licona resigned from his position as research professor of New Testament at Southern Evangelical Seminary and apologetics coordinator for the North American Mission Board.

== Modern Catholic discussion ==
In Catholic discussion, the Bible is not inerrant or infallible as a document interpreted independently of teaching of the Church on matters of faith and morals. 

=== Before Vatican II ===
St. John Henry Newman, writing in 1884, acknowledged the &quot;human side&quot; of biblical inspiration which &quot;manifests itself in language, style, tone of thought, character, intellectual peculiarities, and such infirmities, not sinful, as belong to our nature, and which in unimportant matters may issue in what in doctrinal definitions is called an obiter dictum (said in passing).” In this view, the Bible contains many statements of a historical nature that have no salvific content in themselves and so need not be inerrant. Often called the “absent father of Vatican II” (absent because he died 72 years before it began), the wording of Dei Verbum recalls Newman’s position. The theologians who wrote it knew and positively appreciated his views.

Pope Leo XIII, in his 1893 encyclical , addressed attacks on the inerrancy of the Bible regarding descriptions of physical phenomena. He explained that descriptions of physical events in the Bible are meant to manifest religious truths, and not to describe the physical events themselves. He also explained that the inspiration that the Holy Spirit gave to the hagiographers did not extend to the explanations of natural phenomena; hence, the hagiographers wrote about natural phenomena as they were commonly observed and in terms of everyday language. He also explained that the hagiographers sometimes described natural phenomena using metaphors. He also explained that there could not be real conflict between biblical descriptions of natural phenomena and science, because the hagiographers did not intend to describe natural phenomena scientifically, and because God is the author of the Bible.

Another controversy with regard to the inerrancy of the Bible was regarding historicity of the events narrated in it.

Some of the theories proposed regarding the inerrancy of the Bible with regard to the historicity of events narrated in it are the theory of &quot;history according to appearances&quot;, which posits that the Bible describes events according to popular versions of them; and the &quot;theory of implicit quotations&quot;, which posits that in writing the Bible, the hagiographers were only quoting what they thought somebody else said. These theories are contrary to the Catholic teaching that the events narrated in the Bible are truly historical.

=== Vatican II ===
After several years discussion and numerous drafts, on 18 November 1965 the Vatican II Council adopted the &quot;Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation&quot;, known as from its first Latin words. The document&#x27;s teaching on inerrancy is found in a single sentence:

Since Vatican II, there has been no official pronouncement on the meaning of this phrase. Article 107 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992) simply quotes the sentence from without any further explanation:

=== Present-day Catholic teaching ===
Some theologians and apologists defend the view that total inerrancy is still the Church&#x27;s teaching. For instance, articles defending this position can be found in the 2011 collection &quot;For the Sake of Our Salvation&quot;. On a more popular level, on the apologetic website &quot;Catholic Answers&quot; there is no lack of articles defending the same position.

For instance, Raymond E. Brown, &quot;perhaps the foremost English-speaking Catholic Biblical scholar&quot;, writes:

And also:

Similarly, Scripture scholar R. A. F. MacKenzie, in his commentary on , said:

In a speech to German bishops during the Second Vatican Council, the future Pope Benedict XVI described inerrancy as referring to everything which scripture intended to affirm, but not necessarily in how it is expressed, saying:

And that:
These views are shared by many Church officials and as a result are taken for granted in some Church documents. For instance:
* An official report (1999) on theological conversations between the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Southern Baptist Convention, to be found on the website of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops:
* A 2005 &quot;teaching document&quot; issued by the Bishops&#x27; Conferences of England and Wales, and of Scotland, entitled &quot;The Gift of Scripture&quot;:
* The (working paper) for the 2008 Synod of Bishops on the Word of God:

== Secular Criticism ==

=== Incompatibility with the Scientific Method ===
Secular and science-using critiques of total biblical inerrancy sometimes focus on its incompatibility with the idealized scientific method, which relies on empirical evidence, testable hypotheses, and the falsifiability of claims. Total biblical inerrancy, the belief that the Bible is free from error in all its teachings, including historical and scientific assertions, is seen as incompatible with these principles due to its reliance on faith and dogmatic authority.

The view that scientific knowledge is the only true knowledge is called Scientism. The view that God is not susceptible to science, not being part of the cosmos, is a traditional Christian belief (see, e.g., &quot;analogia entis&quot;.)

==== Empirical Evidence and Testability ====
Critics argue that total biblical inerrancy undermines the empirical basis of science by treating ancient religious texts as authoritative on natural phenomena, even when these texts conflict with observable evidence. For example, the creation narrative in Genesis, which suggests a young Earth created in six days (Genesis 1:1–31), is inconsistent with the scientific consensus on the age of the Earth (approximately 4.54 billion years) and the process of evolution through natural selection. These discrepancies have led scholars like Richard Dawkins to criticize biblical inerrancy as being &quot;indifferent to the evidence&quot;

==== Falsifiability ====
Scientific theories must be falsifiable, meaning they can be proven wrong through observation or experimentation. Total biblical inerrancy, by contrast, often relies on supernatural explanations, which are inherently unfalsifiable. Critics such as Carl Sagan have pointed out that unfalsifiable claims are not scientifically meaningful and fall outside the realm of empirical inquiry.

==== Historical and Scientific Errors ====
Many secular scholars highlight apparent scientific and historical inaccuracies in the Bible as evidence against its inerrancy. For instance, the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark (Genesis 6:9–9:17) describes a global flood, which lacks geological evidence and contradicts known principles of hydrology and biology. The lack of supporting evidence for other events described as historical in the Bible, such as the Exodus, further calls into question the claim of total inerrancy.

==== Resistance to Revision ====
Another point of contention is the resistance of biblical inerrancy to revision, which is at odds with the self-correcting nature of the idealized scientific process. While science progresses through the refinement of theories based on new evidence, total biblical inerrancy maintains that the (original) text is immutable, preventing reinterpretation in light of new discoveries. Philosopher Daniel Dennett has criticized this rigidity, suggesting that it hampers intellectual progress and fosters dogmatism.

According to some, by framing the Bible as infallible, proponents of inerrancy place religious doctrine in direct opposition to scientific methods, leading to ongoing debates about the role of faith in understanding the natural world.

<text>Thomas Chipman McRae (December 21, 1851June 2, 1929) was an American attorney and politician from Arkansas. He served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives (1885 to 1903) and the 26th Governor of Arkansas, from 1921 to 1925.

==Biography==
Thomas Chipman McRae, the eldest of five siblings, was born to Duncan L. and Mary Ann (Chipman) McRae on December 21, 1851, at Mount Holly in Union County, Arkansas. He attended Soule Business College in New Orleans, Louisiana and graduated with a law degree from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He passed the Arkansas bar in 1873, and began his practice at Rosston in Nevada County, Arkansas. He married Amelia Ann White in December 1874, with whom he would go on to have six daughters and three sons. On May 19, 1877, Nevada County voters elected to move the county seat from Rosston, and construct a new courthouse in the newly created railroad town of Prescott. McRae relocated his family there to be closer to his center of business.

In 1874, McRae was appointed to the post of Election Commissioner in Arkansas. From 1877 to 1879, he served in the Arkansas House of Representatives and was a presidential elector in 1880. In 1884, 1896, and 1900, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and served as president of the convention twice. From 1888 to 1902 he was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. From 1885 to 1903, McRae served in the United States House of Representatives.

In 1902, McRae donated land for an African American school in Prescott, Arkansas. McRae&#x27;s Elementary, Middle, and High School were integrated with the Prescott School District in 1969.

In 1917 and 1918, McRae was president of the Arkansas Bar Association; in the latter year he took part in the Arkansas Constitutional Convention.

In 1920, McRae was elected to his first term as Governor of Arkansas. In the election, McRae represented the Democratic Party, receiving 123,637 votes (66.6 percent). Wallace Townsend represented the Republican Party, receiving 46,350 votes (25 percent), and Josiah H. Blount represented the Independent Party, receiving 15,627 votes (8.4 percent). Blount, an African American school superintendent from Forest City, was the leader of a splinter GOP faction called the &quot;Black-and-Tan Republicans,&quot; who protested the &quot;lily-white&quot; stand of its new leaders that included gubernatorial nominee Townsend. Blount was the first of his race to seek election as Arkansas&#x27;s chief executive.

McRae was elected to his second term in 1922. In that election, McRae received 99,987 votes (78.1 percent), and Republican John W. Grabiel received 28,055 votes (21.9 percent).

During his tenure, the Arkansas Railroad Commission was re-established, the Arkansas Corporation Commission was abolished, and the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanitarium for Negroes was established. A severance tax was passed with its revenue funding public schools, the Arkansas Office of State Geologist was created, and a personal income tax law was enacted.

Upon the end of his governorship, McRae was appointed special Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court. He was elected a life member of the Arkansas Democratic State Convention in 1926. After serving four years as Governor of Arkansas, McRae returned to Prescott to be with his family. He resumed his law practice and he engaged in banking activities until his death on June 2, 1929. McRae is buried in the historic section of the De Ann Cemetery in Prescott.

McRae was a cousin of Thomas Banks Cabaniss, a U.S. Representative from Georgia. He was also the grandfather of Thomas C. &quot;Tom&quot; McRae, III, longtime President of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation who challenged Bill Clinton for the Democratic Gubernatorial Nomination in 1990.

<text>John Cocke (May 30, 1925 – July 16, 2002) was an American computer scientist at IBM and recognized for his large contribution to computer architecture and optimizing compiler design. He is considered by many to be &quot;the father of RISC architecture.&quot;

==Biography==
He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, US. He attended Duke University, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1946 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1956. Cocke spent his entire career as an industrial researcher for IBM, from 1956 to 1992.

Perhaps the project where his innovations were most noted was in the IBM 801 minicomputer, where his realization that matching the design of the architecture&#x27;s instruction set to the relatively simple instructions actually emitted by compilers could allow high performance at a low cost.

He is one of the inventors of the CYK algorithm (C for Cocke). He was also involved in the pioneering speech recognition and machine translation work at IBM in the 1970s and 1980s, and is credited by Frederick Jelinek with originating the idea of using a trigram language model for speech recognition.

Cocke was appointed IBM Fellow in 1972. He won the Eckert–Mauchly Award in 1985, ACM Turing Award in 1987, the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and the National Medal of Science in 1994, IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 1984, The Franklin Institute&#x27;s Certificate of Merit in 1996, the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award in 1999, and The Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2000. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the National Academy of Sciences.

In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his development and implementation of reduced instruction set computer architecture and program optimization technology.&quot;

He died in Valhalla, New York, US.

<text>A telethon (a portmanteau of &quot;television&quot; and &quot;marathon&quot;) is a televised fundraising event that lasts many hours or days, the purpose of which is to raise money for a charitable, political or other cause.

Most telethons feature heavy solicitations for pledges (promises to donate funds at a later time) by masters of ceremonies or hosts, who are often local celebrities or media personalities combined with variety show style entertainment such as singers, bands and instrumentalists. In some cases, telethons feature content related to the cause being supported, such as interviews with charitable beneficiaries, tours of charity-supported projects, or pre-taped sequences. The equivalent term for a radio broadcast is a radiothon; most radiothons do not include live entertainment.

In the United States, the first telethon used for political outreach occurred in 1960.

The highest donating telethon per capita in the world is the Channel Seven Perth Telethon in Perth, Western Australia. It has raised over AU$650 million since 1968, and raised $83.2 million in 2024.

==History==

===United States===
On April 9, 1949, Milton Berle hosted the first-ever telethon, raising $1,100,000 for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation over the course of 16 hours. The first published appearance of the word &quot;telethon&quot; was in the prior day&#x27;s newspapers.

One of the first continuing annual telethons in the United States was the United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) telethon. Television executive Leonard Goldenson and his wife had a daughter with cerebral palsy, and with the help of other affected parents, launched the UCP Telethon in 1950, with early television personality Dennis James as host. He continued to host New York-based segments on the telethon through the 1980s. The telethon is now defunct, as UCP raises funds through other means, including its website. By 1955 televised telethons had become a familiar enough part of American culture to be parodied that year in the film noir &quot;Tight Spot&quot; as comic relief.

The oldest continuing annual telethon in the United States on the same channel is Green Bay, Wisconsin, station WBAY-TV (channel 2)&#x27;s local Cerebral Palsy telethon, which helps provide financial support for equipment for Cerebral Palsy, Inc., that began broadcasting as a 22-hour event on the first weekend of March 1954. As of 2016, WBAY has presented the telethon for 62 years.

Close behind the Green Bay telethon in longevity is the WHAS Crusade for Children in Louisville, Kentucky, which began in October 1954 on WHAS-TV (channel 11) and WHAS radio (840 AM). It is still broadcast on the two WHAS stations despite their being owned by different entities for three decades, and has expanded to radio and TV stations in other parts of Kentucky and Indiana, as well as a live stream on the internet. The Crusade is famous for the legions of firefighters who collect money at intersections throughout the area each May and June.

The most-broadcast telethon to date was January 22, 2010, &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon, to aid the victims of the January 10th earthquake. Viewers were able to text donations on cell phones, and it raised a reported $58 million by the next day. It was designed to show viewers a stark divide between them and the people surviving this catastrophic event.

===Australia===
Melbourne&#x27;s Good Friday Appeal, which began in 1931, started its telethon in 1957 after the Seven Network joined as a sponsor.

Adelaide&#x27;s first telethon was held at the Tynte Street, North Adelaide, studios of NWS9 in December 1960. One fundraiser was Barry Jones, then famous as a quiz champion. Viewers could, for a fee, attempt to &quot;stump&quot; him with their favorite question.

Prior to the establishment of their annual telethon in 1968, Perth station TVW broadcast one-off telethons for bushfire relief in 1961, and to raise funds for Christmas care packages sent to Western Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967.

==Examples==

===The Americas===

====United States====
In the United States, telethons are held for various charitable organizations; as of 2014, however, no national telethons currently exist.

The longest-running national telethon in the United States was &quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;, which was staged for over 21 hours each Labor Day to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association between 1966 and 2010. From 2011 to 2013 it was trimmed down to six hours, then to three, and then to two hours. From 2012 it no longer served as a telethon in the traditional sense. It was discontinued in 2014. Other prior charities such as the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, Easter Seals, Arthritis Foundation, and the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network had produced telethons on a nationwide or regional basis.

Some radio stations produce annual pledge drives which are similar in format to telethons, but instead, use brief breaks between regular programs to appeal for funds.

Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), a religious television network, hosts non-stop, week-long, semi-annual telethons called &quot;Praise-a-Thons&quot;. The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN; producers of the long-running syndicated program &quot;The 700 Club&quot;) stages a modified form of a telethon thrice yearly, which runs for approximately one week but is shown for only an hour or so each day. In its early days, CBN&#x27;s telethons were of the more traditional round-the-clock form; this format ended when the Pat Robertson-founded ministry sold The Family Channel (now Freeform), which no longer gave it access to a round-the-clock outlet for such telethons. However, on the Sunday before the Super Bowl, CBN continues to produce a 12-hour telethon which airs on Freeform and is syndicated to various television stations; the broadcast of the program on the cable channel was a condition inserted in a 1998 deal by International Family Entertainment (which acquired the channel from CBN in 1990) to sell The Family Channel to News Corporation, and remained in place after the channel&#x27;s 2001 sale to The Walt Disney Company. Other religious stations and networks hold telethons as well, including West Coast Chabad Lubavitch since 1980.

For a brief time in the early 1970s, beginning in 1972, the Democratic Party even held annual telethons (two were called &quot;America Goes Public&quot; and &quot;Answer, America!&quot;) to help it erase a multi-million dollar debt (this may have provided the inspiration for the 1979 comedy film &quot;Americathon&quot;, where a telethon is held to prevent national bankruptcy). The telethon idea was created and promoted by John Y. Brown, Jr., the businessman who built Kentucky Fried Chicken into a worldwide chain and later became Governor of Kentucky.

Local telethons, once a common fixture in nearly every major city in the United States, are now rare but still found in a handful of cities, including Louisville, Kentucky (WHAS Crusade for Children), Buffalo, New York (the &quot;Variety Club Telethon&quot;, held each winter for Variety, the Children&#x27;s Charity; it began on what is now WGRZ in 1962 before spending most of its run on WKBW-TV from 1963 to 2019 and then moving back to WGRZ in 2020, with WBBZ-TV added as a broadcast partner that year); Green Bay, Wisconsin (WBAY-TV&#x27;s annual March telethon for the locally based Cerebral Palsy Center); and Erie, Pennsylvania (the &quot;Community for Kanzius Telethon&quot; on WICU and WSEE for the Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation). New York City also features a telethon of sorts; the &quot;WFAN Radiothon&quot;, by virtue of its two drive time shows being simulcast on cable television, has portions covered on television. Since 2010, this has included the portion covering &quot;Boomer and Carton in the Morning&quot; on CBS Sports Network and &quot;Mike&#x27;s On&quot; on Fox Sports 1/2. From 2002 to 2007, the shows in question were &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; on MSNBC and &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; on YES; Imus revived the practice of hosting radiothons on his most recent radio broadcast homes, WABC and Fox Business Network.

Garden City High School in Garden City, Kansas, holds annual telethons to help fund the school&#x27;s broadcasting, debate and forensics teams.

On December 14, 2012, Univision introduced the first ever Spanish-language telethon in the United States, &quot;Teletón USA&quot;, which is hosted by longtime &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; host Mario Kreutzberger, known by his stage name Don Francisco. The total donation in the first edition was $8,150,625, 16.44% more than the intended goal of $7,000,000. For its 2013 edition, the goal went up to $15,215,029 and the total donation is now $15,313,525, a $98,496 increase.

====Canada====
There are no annual national telethons in Canada, although as in the U.S., many local children&#x27;s hospitals operate regional telethons in collaboration with Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals in early June. In addition, due to the proliferation of cable television piping in signals from the United States, a number of American telethons, such as the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon, attracted donations from Canada due to being broadcast there.

Notable regional telethons (outside of those produced by Children&#x27;s Miracle Network) include:
* &quot;Telemiracle&quot; (March) in Saskatchewan benefiting the Kinsmen Foundation and currently seen on CTV stations in Saskatchewan. Since its inception in 1977, Telemiracle has raised over $100 million, including the record $7.1 million in the 2018 edition, held in Regina.
* &quot;Christmas Daddies&quot; (December), benefiting underprivileged children in Atlantic Canada and broadcast on CTV Atlantic stations.
* &quot;Show of Hearts&quot; (February) in British Columbia, supporting Variety, the Children&#x27;s Charity and seen on CHAN-DT in Vancouver.
*&quot;CTV-Lion&#x27;s Club Children&#x27;s Christmas Telethon&quot; (December), buys Christmas presents for underprivileged children in Northern Ontario. The telethon is broadcast on CTV Northern Ontario stations and features local musical talent.

====Chile====

Since 1978, the major Chilean television networks hold an annual telethon called Teletón to raise funds to help children with developmental disabilities (most commonly cerebral palsy) in Instituto de Rehabilitación Infantil (&quot;Infant Rehabilitation Institute&quot;) centers. Mario Kreutzberger, who is the symbol of &quot;La Teletón&quot; in Chile, has served as the telethon&#x27;s host since its inception. The telethon is an event of national unity and is proportionally, the most widely watched and most donated telethon in the world, surpassing Australia&#x27;s Telethon.

There is also a local telethon running, the &quot;Days for the Disabled Magellanic Children&quot; (&quot;Jornadas por el Niño Impedido Magallánico&quot;), to raise funds to help disabled children of the Magallanes and Última Esperanza provinces, in an effort led by the local Lions Club. The 2006 Days broadcast raised US$515,000.

During March 2010, a special telethon called &quot;Chile ayuda a Chile&quot; (&quot;Chile helps Chile&quot;) was broadcast to raise money to help those affected by a devastating earthquake that struck the southern part of central Chile on February 27 of that year. The aim was to raise $15,000,000,000 Chilean Pesos for the construction of 30 thousand emergency homes in the disaster area. In the end, that amount tripled, having been gathered over 46 billion Chilean pesos ($90 million), the biggest amount of money collected from a Telethon in history.

====Honduras====
Since 1987, all television networks in Honduras hold a 27-hour telethon every December to raise funds to help children with disabilities in support of &quot;Fundación Teleton&quot; (Telethon Foundation), a charity under the leadership of businessman Rafael Ferrari. Many international artists, television presenters and journalists participate in the event. TACA Airlines provides free transportation for international invitees. Local banks are open around-the-clock during the Telethon, to enable viewers to donate through their local banks.

====Mexico====

Like Chile and Honduras in December of every year since 1997 the Mexican television network Televisa, in conjunction with other networks, both public and private (except rivals Azteca and Imagen, the latter since 2016), hold a 24-hour telethon with the purpose to raise funds to help children with disabilities. The event is organized by the &quot;Fundación Teletón&quot;.

During the transmission of the event especially in the television broadcasting many Mexican media personalities shows testimonies of children and their families who overcame their disabilities. The final act with the Telethon is a concert in the Estadio Azteca with the performance of many national and international artists and singers. Because Televisa programming also airs in the United States on Univision and border city Televisa stations, some additional contributions and pledges come from American viewers.

====Brazil====
The marathon broadcast under the name &quot;Teleton&quot; by SBT was conceived by Décio Goldfarb, Clovis Scripilliti and Hebe Camargo who asked the owner of SBT, Silvio Santos, to broadcast the program. The collections are passed on to &quot;Associação de Assistência à Criança Deficiente&quot; (AACD) – Portuguese for Association for Assistance to Disabled Children.

The first edition was held between 17 and 18 May 1998, and since then, 14 rehabilitation centers, a home school and a hospital for rehabilitation operations and exams are created. Another rehabilitation center was in construction but the same was canceled due to the financial crisis Brazil had been suffering since 2015, also two rehabilitation centers have closed and another three were municipalized, making the total of centers down to nine.

The edition of 2019 was held on 25 and 26 October. It had a goal of R$30 million, and raised R$32 450 054 (US$8,106,231) after almost 26 hours of broadcast, making a new record total. In 2018, AACD helped over 8,000 people with physical disabilities.

====Haiti====
&quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; was a telethon based in the United States. It was organized as a humanitarian relief effort in response to the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.

===Europe===

====Austria====

&quot;Licht ins Dunkel&quot; (literally: &quot;light in the dark&quot;) is an annual telethon held in Austria to help disabled persons.

====Spain====
In Catalonia, public television broadcaster Televisió de Catalunya broadcasts an annual telethon (La Marató de TV3) for several diseases. In 2018, it raised €15,068,252 for cancer research. €197,340,632 have been collected since the first edition in 1992.

====France====
In France, since 1987, an annual &quot;Téléthon&quot;, for the muscular dystrophy charity in France (see also Decrypthon), &quot;L&#x27;Association française contre les myopathies&quot;, is held by France 2 on the first or second weekend in December, with the support of France 3 and France 5, and the public radio networks (France Inter, France Info, France Bleu). Several events are organized all around France. Donations are made by telephone or at the Téléthon&#x27;s website, or on mobile web portals, as well as through SMS messaging (and also Minitel in the past). The 2007 edition earned €96,228,136 (US$141,089,693) during the program and €102.3 million after final collection.

====Ireland====
In Ireland, the RTÉ People in Need Telethon was held roughly every two years in May, from 1989 to 2007, although there was no Telethon in 2003 due to Special Olympics and the sponsorship/volunteering needed, and it was moved to October 26 in 2007. During the 2004 telethon, over 4,000 fundraising events were organised by people nationwide, and proceeds were subsequently distributed to almost 760 projects in the 26 counties.

Since its inception, over €35 million has been raised by the People in Need through the RTÉ People in Need Telethon, supporting a wide variety of charitable organizations nationwide. Eight telethons have been held to date and over €35 million has been distributed in grants, ranging from €150 to €50,000, to thousands of organisations throughout Ireland. Grant applications are assessed by advisory committees in each region before final approval by the Board of Directors of the Trust. Money raised in each county stays in each county.

====Italy====
In Italy, since 1990, Telethon is also held by RAI in December, and in 2006 (when the event was held from December 15–17) donors had raised €30,740,000 for research into cures for genetic diseases. By 2009, a total of €284,000,000 have been collected since 1990.

The creators of the Italian version are Susanna Agnelli and the Italian Union for the fight against muscular dystrophy.

====Netherlands====
The first nationwide telethon in the Netherlands was &quot;Open Het Dorp&quot; (&quot;Open The Village&quot;), which was classic in format, broadcasting for 23 hours on television and radio from 26 to 27 November 1962. Funds were raised to build and open a special village/community for disabled people.

In 1984 for the first time a number of Dutch humanitarian aid organisations collaborated with a combination of broadcasters, to raise funds through a unified effort: &quot;Eén voor Afrika&quot; (One for Africa). With a combination of 10 hours of television and 18 hours of radio broadcast, €44 million was raised. After another such action in 1987, the organisations decided to sign a permanent cooperation agreement as the Samenwerkende Hulporganisaties (or SHO, meaning Cooperating Aid Organizations). Although the campaigns gradually moved away from classic telethons over the years, the SHO raised some €700 million in forty nationwide efforts since it started.

Starting in 2004 an annual multi-day radiothon called Serious Request is hosted by national pop music station 3FM in the week before Christmas. Three popular radio DJs are locked up for six days in a small temporary radio studio (the &quot;Glass House&quot;), placed in a main square of a Dutch city. Living on a juice-only fast, the DJs make an interactive, themed broadcast around the clock, to raise funds and awareness for International Red Cross initiatives. Regular programming on the station is suspended — instead 3FM and its website are completely dedicated to the event, which is also transmitted as a continuous audio and video live-stream. Additionally there is television coverage, integration with social media, and a dedicated mobile app. All totalled the eleven editions have raised €76.8 million.

&quot;Serious Request&quot; spin-off projects have since been adopted in Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Kenya, South Korea, Austria, Latvia and Portugal.

====Norway====

TV-aksjonen (English: &quot;The TV Campaign/Auction&quot;) is an annual national Norwegian charity fund raising event that since 1974 has been run by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK in conjunction with selected organizations. The fundraiser is the world&#x27;s largest, measured in terms of donated value per capita and number of participants. The event is central to Norwegian society inasmuch as it is viewed as the most famous and trusted charity fundraiser in the country. The campaign is held on a Sunday in October each year, and on the selected day NRK devotes most of its airtime to informing the public about the organization and that year&#x27;s special cause.

Contributions are collected in a number of ways. Central to the campaign is the door-to-door campaign of approximately 100,000 volunteers servicing all 1.8million Norwegian households, as well as donations accepted via telephone or by funds transfer to the campaign&#x27;s bank account. NRK also hosts a live auction of various items and experiences, with proceeds also going to that year&#x27;s selected charity. Several organizations donate considerable amounts, as does the government of Norway on behalf of the Norwegian people.

====Ukraine====
Since the start of the invasion in the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, most Ukrainian television channels switched over to the signal of Rada TV. The channel was made state-owned at the end of 2021. Following February 26, 2022, the four biggest broadcasters including the TV channels 1+1, 2+2, 24 Kanal, and TRC Ukraina began broadcasting a 24/7 united newscast called &quot;United News&quot; (&quot;Єдині новини&quot;) that is produced in turn by the various channels and amended with official information by governmental agencies to &quot;objectively and promptly provide comprehensive information from different regions of the country 24/7&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, the ITV Telethons were three charity telethons organised and televised in the UK by the ITV network. The broadcasts took place in 1988, 1990 and 1992. Each lasted for 27 hours and all were hosted by Michael Aspel.

Regular telethons are held for charitable groups such as Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day and &quot;Sport Relief&quot;, and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot;. Some of these occur every year, with millions of pounds raised to support various charities. These usually include music artists, sketches, and other various segments, often with videos in between each segment or song to promote the charity that money is being raised for, usually children in either Africa or the United Kingdom. In 2012/2013, &quot;Children in Need&quot; raised £26 million and Comic Relief £75 million; a combined total of £101 million ($151 million). Children in Need is well known for its nationwide link-up performances such as the choir that has been running since 2011 featuring over 1500 children in choirs of about 150 singing one song in unison from about 10 locations around the UK. This is usually the point where the telethon receives the most donations.

From 2011 to 2015, ITV held their &quot;Text Santa&quot; telethon in the buildup to Christmas. The telethon lasted for three hours and was hosted by three ITV presenting duos, Ant &amp; Dec, Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley, and Paddy McGuinness and Alesha Dixon, each duo hosting an hour each. Text Santa supported six UK charities; these were Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Marie Curie, Teenage Cancer Trust, Together for Short Lives and WellChild.

Since 2012, Channel 4 has hosted &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot;. The inaugural telethon was presented by Channel 4 faces Davina McCall, Alan Carr and Christian Jessen. All three returned to present the next telethon in 2014, which also had segments hosted by &quot;The Last Leg&quot; presenters Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker. The 2014 telethon came live from Westminster&#x27;s Methodist Central Hall.

Started in 1978, its objective is to raise funds for various charities that aid the sick, the handicapped, victims of war and natural disasters around the world and environmental programmes. Every year, during the live broadcast, a popular television personality attempts to run a 100 km marathon for this worthy cause. Despite its title, the telethon runs for approximately 27 hours.

The 2011 telethon&#x27;s funds were donated to organizations to help rebuild the prefectures that were damaged in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

===== Perth =====
The annual Channel Seven Perth Telethon is run by Perth-based Seven Network station TVW and the Channel 7 Telethon Trust and is broadcast throughout Western Australia on the Seven Network. Starting in 1968, the annual 26-hour continuous broadcast runs on a weekend, usually in October, commencing at 7.00pm on Saturday night. The two major beneficiaries of Telethon are Perth Children&#x27;s Hospital (and previously Princess Margaret Hospital for Children) and the Telethon Kids Institute along with numerous other additional beneficiaries (in 2021, there were 65 beneficiaries).

In 2017, TVW held its 50th Telethon, raising a then-record A$36.4 million ($10 million more than the previous year), which amounted to $13.94 per head of population in WA. The largest amount raised on Perth&#x27;s Telethon was set in 2024, which saw A$83.2 million donated. Since 1968, Perth&#x27;s Telethon has raised over A$650 million in total.

A number of international celebrities have visited Perth to appear on the Telethon, such as Michael Jackson, Celine Dion, Harry Connick, Jr., Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis Jr., Tina Turner, Julian Lennon, Whitney Houston, Def Leppard, and Elton John (who performed live for the event from the opening night of Perth Arena in 2012). A number of Australian television personalities and actors also fly across the country for the weekend, including stars from Seven Network programs such as &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

During the 1970s and 1980s, TVW&#x27;s rival station, the Nine Network&#x27;s STW also broadcast its own telethon, known as Appealathon.

===== Melbourne =====
HSV7 in Melbourne holds the Good Friday Appeal telethon, which benefits the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital in Melbourne on Good Friday every year. It airs across Victoria all day on Seven Network station HSV and Prime Television. It also has a print and radio component via Melbourne&#x27;s Herald Sun newspaper as well as radio station Mix 101.1. In 2007, the radio partner was Southern Cross Broadcasting. The event has become an annual part of Melbourne culture, and continues to bring in record fundraising efforts across the entire state. In 2015, the appeal raised A$17.1 million.

===== Adelaide =====
NWS9 in Adelaide aired Telethon broadcasts throughout the 1960s and 1970s including raising money for &quot;The House Of Hope&quot; a home that would be built each year for Telethon. Local television stars from all channels would visit channel 9 across the live broadcast weekend to participate in the Telethon. Musicians from interstate would also travel to Adelaide for the round-the-clock marathon broadcast. It was the only time of the year that an Adelaide television station continued to broadcast during the overnight hours.

In the 1970s, SAS10 created the Children&#x27;s Medical Research Foundation and the &quot;Channel 10 Christmas Appeal&quot; with stars from the network flying into Adelaide for the weekend live broadcast from SAS10 studios in Gilberton. Stars participating in the broadcast included actors from the popular SAS10 programmes &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;. Game show host Garry Meadows was the anchor for most years. It is this event where the tune &quot;Thank You Very Much for Your Kind Donation&quot; originated, which would be played whenever a major donation was announced during the broadcast with members of the cast forming a conga line and dancing around the studio.

===== Newcastle =====
NBN Television in Newcastle, New South Wales regularly held telethons every two years throughout the 1970s and 1980s for local charities such as children&#x27;s hospitals and cancer units. However, with aggregation and the station being affiliated in the early 1990s, these went by the wayside but a few have still been held since, the last occurring in 2002.

===== Sydney =====
In Sydney, Nine Network station TCN broadcasts the Gold Week Telethon on the second Monday of June (the Queen&#x27;s Birthday), in benefit for the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital. Established in 2010, the telethon serves as a finale for a week of fundraising for the hospital, known as &quot;Gold Week&quot;, which generally runs the first week of June.

The sixth telethon in 2015 was hosted by presenters of the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, with various network celebrities including Darryl Brohman and Miranda Tapsell manning the phone lines; the telethon also featured various music performers. A total of $5.2mn was raised for the hospital, breaking expectations and creating a new record.

===== One-off telethons ===== 
Throughout Australia, there have been several national telethons during the 2000s. One was held to aid victims of the 2004 tsunami that hit parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, which killed over 200,000 people. This telethon was simulcast by all three commercial networks, Seven, Nine and Ten. There were other telethons around the world raising money for that event.

On February 12, 2009, the Nine Network held a special telethon to benefit the victims of the 2009 Victorian bushfires, through the Australian Red Cross. Titled &quot;Australia Unites – The Victorian Bushfire Appeal&quot;, the event was hosted by Nine Network personality Eddie McGuire, and accompanied by many celebrities, athletes and entertainers. Some of the celebrities to have appeared included Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban, Orlando Bloom, Hugh Jackman, Anthony La Paglia, Rachel Griffiths and Simon Baker. Rove McManus from rival Ten Network made a special guest appearance. The telethon raised about A$20.5 million from pledges.

On January 9, 2011, the &quot;Flood Relief Appeal: Australia Unites&quot; telethon, in response to the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, was broadcast by the Nine Network from Brisbane&#x27;s Suncorp Piazza raised more than A$10 million in pledged aid.

====New Zealand====
Telethons were run nationwide in New Zealand in 1975 to 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990 and 1991 by TVNZ, and in 1993 and 2009 by TV3. As with the Australian telethons, the theme song, &quot;Thank You Very Much for Your Kind Donation&quot; (a cover of &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; by The Scaffold) was played whenever a large donation was announced.

TV2, which launched on Monday 30 June 1975, held the first 24-hour telethon on its opening weekend (5-6 July 1975), which raised over $585,000 for St. John Ambulance. It was hosted by the then NZBC studios of the four main centres, though only broadcast in Auckland and Christchurch as TV2 was yet to be transmitted in other centres. In 1979, telethon was hosted by TV2 (then named South Pacific Television) but was simulcast on TV One between midnight and 11:00am while TV One was off air for the benefit of those who couldn&#x27;t yet receive TV2. Telethon was broadcast on TV One in 1981, 1983 and 1985, and on TV2 in 1988 and 1990.

After the first telethon, the rest were hosted in large exhibition halls and indoor stadiums as the public soon arrived by the thousands to be seen on television and to watch the entertainment live. Notable international guests from TV shows and films, in alphabetical order, have included:

* 1981: Basil Brush, Kamahl, Kenny Everett and Bill Oddie
* 1985: Michael Bentine, Sorrell Booke, Johnny Briggs, Alan Dale, Becky Hobbs, Ernie Hudson, Kamahl, Chris King, Valerie Landsburg, Victoria Nicholls, Deborah Raffin, James B. Sikking, Bruce Weitz and Ernie Wise
* 1988: Letitia Dean, Alix Elias, Pat Evison, Max Gail, Estelle Getty, Leeza Gibbons, Kim Lewis, Antonia Murphy, Su Pollard, Christopher Quinten, Ian Rawlings, Mike Smith, Susan Tully, Blair Underwood and Helen Worth
* 1990: Alan Dale, John Farnham, Anne Haddy, Jon Iles, Kevin Kennedy, Barbara Knox, Ari Meyers, Bryan Mosley, Thaao Penghlis, Barbara Thorn and Ernie Wise

Each telethon outdid the previous total for several years, peaking in 1985 with over $6 million, and a mere one month later TVNZ participated in the international LiveAid concert bringing in $1.8 million for New Zealand&#x27;s contribution. The largest undertaking including smaller regional centres with host locations was 1988. However the economic climate at the time saw money raised drop in 1988 ($5 million) and 1990 ($4 million) while hosting costs soared.

In 1991, an emergency fundraising 16-hour telethon was hurriedly arranged after a devastating cyclone flattened most of Western Samoa. The total raised was just over $1.5 million with the Government of New Zealand matching the dollar amount, bringing the total to just over $3 million.

In 1993, TV3 hosted a 22-hour telethon to raise funds for the Starship Children&#x27;s Hospital. Events focused on the two main venues at Auckland&#x27;s Aotea Centre and Wellington&#x27;s Shed 6, with roving crews based in Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton and the rest of the country. The event raised just over $3.5 million.

TV3 broadcast a 23-hour telethon &quot;The Big Night In&quot; to support KidsCan, which aired on August 8 and 9, 2009. The event raised $1,944,225.

In collaboration with the New Zealand Government, Three, Māori Television, TVNZ 2 and various online platforms simulcast an eight-hour telethon on 16 October 2021, known as the &#x27;Vaxathon&#x27;, to support the country&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination effort.

Some regional stations have also operated their own local telethons to fund local facilities and other organizations.

===Worldwide===
For nine years, Armenia Fund held an annual international telethon that was broadcast to all major U.S. cities and across the globe. The 12-hour live program is able to raise millions for humanitarian and infrastructure development programs in Armenia and Karabakh. The annual telethon is held on Thanksgiving every year. During Armenia Fund&#x27;s 10th International Telethon, held on November 22, 2007, the event raised a record-breaking $15.3 million. The program aired from the Hollywood studios of Los Angeles television station KCET and was broadcast in the United States, as well as internationally.

The 2004 Asian tsunami also led to telethons being held in countries such as Canada (CTV and Omni Television), United States (NBC) and Australia (a joint telecast between the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten).

In 2014, TWiT.tv held an online telethon entitled &quot;24 Hours of 2015&quot; celebrating New Year in every time zone to raise money for UNICEF. Founder and host Leo Laporte streamed live for much of the 24 hours, raising over $58,000.

==Other types==
Similar to telethons, but considerably shorter, are nationally televised benefit concerts following major disasters such as the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. These are generally three-time broadcasts meant to spur immediate humanitarian contributions, not part of the annual donation drives of the charities involved. Typically a phone number or website will appear on screen during the entire concert for donors to make pledges, though there may not necessarily be a live host announcing.

<text>Roseola, also known as sixth disease, is an infectious disease caused by certain types of human herpes viruses. Most infections occur before the age of three. Symptoms vary from absent to the classic presentation of a fever of rapid onset followed by a rash. The fever generally lasts for three to five days, while the rash is generally pink and lasts for less than three days. Complications may include febrile seizures, with serious complications being rare.
It is caused by &quot;human herpesvirus 6&quot; (HHV-6A, HHV-6B) or &quot;human herpesvirus 7&quot; (HHV-7). Spread is usually through the saliva of those who are otherwise healthy. However, it may also spread from the mother to the baby during pregnancy. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and does not need to be confirmed with blood tests (PCR or antigen). Low numbers of white blood cells may also be present.
Treatment includes sufficient fluids and medications to treat the fever. Nearly all people are infected at some point. Males and females are affected equally often. The disease may reactivate in those with a weakened immune system and may result in significant health problems.

The disease was first described in 1910 while the causal virus was isolated in 1988. The name &quot;sixth disease&quot; comes from its place on the standard list of rash-causing childhood diseases, which also includes measles (first), scarlet fever (second), rubella (third), Dukes&#x27; disease (fourth, but is no longer widely accepted as distinct from scarlet fever), and erythema infectiosum (fifth).

==Signs and symptoms==

=== Fever ===
Symptoms begin with a three to six-day febrile illness. During this time, temperatures can peak above 40 °C and children can experience increased irritability with general malaise. Many children in the febrile phase feel well, engaged, and alert. For these patients, fever is usually diagnosed incidentally.

The most common complication (10-15% of children between 6 and 18 months) and most common cause of hospitalization in children with primary infection of HHV-6B is febrile seizures which can precipitate status epilepticus due to the sudden rise in body temperature.

=== Rash ===
Once the febrile phase subsides, a rash develops. The rash sometimes presents one or two days after the fever resolves. The rash is classically described as an erythematous morbilliform exanthem and presents as a distribution of soft pink, discrete, and slightly raised lesions each with a 2-5mm diameter. It classically begins on the trunk (torso) and spreads outward to the neck, extremities, and face. This pattern is referred to as a centrifugal spread. Usually, peeling and itching are not characteristic of this rash. This phase can last anywhere from several hours to 2 days.

=== Other symptoms ===
A small percentage of children acquire HHV-6 with few signs or symptoms of the disease. Children with HHV-6 infection can also present with myringitis (inflammation of the tympanic membranes), upper respiratory symptoms, diarrhea, and a bulging fontanelle. In addition, children can experience pharyngitis with lymphoid hyperplasia seen on the soft palate and swelling of the eyelids. These symptoms usually present during the febrile phase of roseola. Cervical and postoccipital lymphadenopathy can also be seen, but this generally presents 2–4 days after the onset of the febrile phase.

In rare cases, HHV-6 can become active in an adult previously infected during childhood and can show signs of mononucleosis.

==Cause==

There are nine known human herpesviruses. Of these, roseola has been linked to two: &quot;human herpesvirus 6&quot; (HHV-6) and &quot;human herpesvirus 7&quot; (HHV-7), which are sometimes referred to collectively as Roseolovirus. These viruses are of the Herpesviridae family and the &quot;Betaherpesvirinae&quot; subfamily, under which Cytomegalovirus is also classified. HHV-6 has been further classified into HHV-6A and HHV-6B, two &quot;distinct&quot; viruses that share 88% of the same DNA makeup, with HHV-6B the most common cause of roseola.

After infection, these viruses enter a latent phase. Roseola caused by HHV-7 has been linked to the ability of HHV-7 infection to reactivate latent HHV-6.

=== Spread ===
After exposure to roseola, the causative virus becomes latent in its host but is still present in saliva, skin, and lungs. HHV-6 is thought to be transmitted from previously exposed or infected adults to young children by shedding the virus through saliva. Even so, most cases of roseola are transmitted without known exposure.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of roseola is made clinically based on the presence of the two phases: fever and rash. Laboratory testing is seldom used as the results do not alter the management of the disease. An exception is in people who are immunocompromised in whom serologic tests with viral identification can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Roseola should be differentiated based on symptoms from other similar-appearing illnesses, such as rubella, measles, fifth disease, scarlet fever, and drug reactions.

==Prevention==
Many viruses can cause roseola and are shed by carriers without symptoms. Because of this and the fact that most children with the disease are not seriously ill, there is no particular method of prevention. Proper hygienic measures, like regular handwashing, can be implemented as a routine prevention method. Those exposed or infected have been shown to shed the virus for the rest of their lives. No current guidelines exist regarding children staying home or away from child care when infected.

==Treatment==
Most cases of HHV-6 infection improve on their own. Because of this, supportive care is the mainstay treatment. 

The febrile phase can be managed using acetaminophen to control fever and prevent spikes in temperature which can lead to febrile seizures. In the case of febrile seizures, medical advice should be sought, and treatment aggressively pursued. Antiepileptic drugs are not recommended for patients who develop seizures from roseola. 

Once children have entered the rash phase, reassurance is important as this indicates the resolution of the infection.

If encephalitis occurs in immunocompromised children, ganciclovir or foscarnet have inconsistently shown usefulness in treatment. Treatment of children who are immunocompromised centers around decreasing their levels of immunosuppression as much as possible.

== Prognosis ==
Children infected with roseola generally have a good prognosis. Most recover without intervention or long-term effects.

== Epidemiology ==
Between the two human herpesvirus 6 types, HHV-6B has been detected much more frequently in hosts. HHV-6B has been shown to affect about 90% of children before the age of 3. Out of these, 20% develop symptoms of roseola, also known as exanthem subitum.

Roseola affects girls and boys equally worldwide year-round. Roseola typically affects children between six months and two years of age, with peak prevalence in children between 7 and 13 months old. This correlates with the decrease in maternal antibodies, thus virus protection, that occurs at the age of 6 months. Out of all emergency department visits for children between ages 6 months and 12 months who have a fever, twenty percent of these are due to HHV-6.

Many children exposed and infected can present without symptoms, which makes determining the incidence within the population difficult.

==History==
John Zahorsky MD wrote extensively on this disease in the early 20th century, his first formal presentation was to the St Louis Pediatric Society in 1909 where he described 15 young children with the illness. In a JAMA article published on Oct 18, 1913, he noted that &quot;the name &#x27;Roseola infantilis&#x27; had an important place in the medical terminology of writers on skin diseases&quot; but that descriptions of the disease by previous writers tended to confuse it with many other diseases that produce febrile rashes. In this JAMA article, Zahorsky reports on 29 more children with roseola and notes that the only condition that should seriously be considered in the differential diagnosis is German measles (rubella) but notes that the fever of rubella only lasts a few hours whereas the prodromal fever of roseola lasts three to five days and disappears with the formation of a morbilliform rash.

<doc id="301922" wikidata="Q17118760" url="?curid=301922" title="Tote board">
<text>A tote board (or totalisator/totalizator) is a numeric or alphanumeric display used to convey information, typically at a race track (to display the odds or payoffs for each horse) or at a telethon (to display the total amount donated to the charitable organization sponsoring the event).

The term &quot;tote board&quot; comes from the colloquialism for &quot;totalizator&quot; (or &quot;totalisator&quot;), the name for the automated system which runs parimutuel betting, calculating payoff odds, displaying them, and producing tickets based on incoming bets.

==History==
Parimutuel systems had used totalisator boards since the 1860s, and they were often housed in substantial buildings. However, the manual systems often resulted in substantial delays in calculations of clients&#x27; payouts.

The first all-mechanical totalisator was invented by George Julius. Julius was a consulting engineer, based in Sydney. His father, Churchill Julius, an Anglican Bishop, had campaigned, in the early years of the twentieth century, against the iniquities of gambling using totalisators and its damage to New Zealand society. That attitude had changed by late 1907 when he argued that the totalisator removed much of the evil of gambling with bookmakers. Bishop Churchill was himself an amateur mechanic, with a reputation for fixing clocks and organs in parishes he visited.

Initially, George Julius was attempting to develop a voting calculating machine for the Australian government, to automatically reduce the instances of voter fraud and create a cheat-free political environment. He went on to present his unique invention, only to have his design rejected as it was deemed to be excessive.

The first all-mechanical machine was installed at Ellerslie Racecourse in New Zealand in 1913 (first used on the Holy Saturday races on 22 March 1913), and the second was installed at Gloucester Park Racetrack in Western Australia in 1917. George Julius founded Automatic Totalisators Limited (ATL) in 1917, which supplied the &quot;Premier Totalisator: now including electrical components&quot;. The first totalisators installed in the United States were at Hialeah Park, Florida, in 1932 (by ATL), and at Arlington Park racecourse, Chicago, in 1933 by American Totalisator. The first entirely electronic totalisator was developed in 1966.

Totalisators have been superseded by general purpose computers running specialised wagering software such as Autotote. In many cases beyond older systems, telethon tote boards have either been replaced by LCD displays showing totals, or scoreboards adapted to display dollar amounts.

==Automatic totalisators==
An automatic totalisator is a device to add up the bets in a pari-mutuel betting system. The whole of the pot (the stakes on all competitors) is divided &quot;pro rata&quot; to the stakes placed on the winning competitor, and those tickets are paid out. Essentially, it implements a system of starting price (SP) betting.

In particular, it refers to the invention of George Julius, the English-born, New Zealand educated, Australian inventor, engineer and businessman, though there have been other claimants, notably engineer Joseph G. Nash.

The term automatic refers to the fact that the bets were automatically summed and a ticket issued when a bet was registered on the issuing machines, and it provided a safe and virtually fraud-free method of betting, replacing the earlier jam-pot totes, which used either paper transactions or some method of counting bets like steel ball bearings. The machine did not actually calculate the payout.

The method was widely used in the Australian, New Zealand and American horse-racing industries and for greyhound racing in the UK, although there were other installations in countries as diverse as France, Venezuela and Singapore.

<text>A race track (racetrack, racing track or racing circuit) is a facility built for racing of vehicles, athletes, or animals (e.g. horse racing or greyhound racing). A race track also may feature grandstands or concourses. Race tracks are also used in the study of animal locomotion.

A &quot;racetrack&quot; is a permanent facility or building. &quot;Racecourse&quot; is an alternate term for a horse racing track, found in countries such as the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates. Race tracks built for bicycles are known as &quot;velodromes&quot;. &quot;Circuit&quot; is a common alternate term for race track, given the circuit configuration of most race tracks, allowing races to occur over several laps. Some race tracks may also be known as &quot;speedways&quot;, or &quot;raceways&quot;.

A &quot;race course&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;racecourse&quot;, is a nonpermanent track for sports, particularly road running, water sports, road racing, or rallying. Many sports usually held on race tracks also can occur on temporary tracks, such as the Monaco and Singapore Grands Prix in Formula One.

==History==
Some evidence remains of racetracks being developed in several ancient civilizations. The most developed ancient race tracks were the hippodromes of the Ancient Greeks and the circuses (&quot;circi&quot;) of the Roman Empire. Both of these structures were designed for horse and chariot racing. The stadium of the Circus Maximus in Ancient Rome could hold 200,000 spectators.

Racing facilities existed during the Middle Ages, and records exist of a public racecourse being opened at Newmarket, in London, in 1174. In 1780, the Earl of Derby created a horse-racing course on his estate at Epsom; the English Derby continues to be held there today. Racecourses in the British Isles are based on grass, known as turf tracks. In the United States, the race tracks are soil.
With the advent of the automobile in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, race tracks were designed to suit the nature of powered machines. The earliest tracks were modified horse-racing courses. Racing automobiles in such facilities began in September 1896, at Narragansett Park in Cranston, Rhode Island. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway was opened in August 1909.

Beginning in the early 1900s, motorcycle races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called board tracks. During the 1920s, many of the races on the AAA Championship circuit were run on such board tracks.
Modern racetracks are designed with spectator safety being paramount, following incidents of spectator and track marshals fatalities. These often involve run-off areas, barriers, and high fencing.

==Sports==


Racetracks are used for:

===Animal sports===

* Camel racing
* Greyhound racing
* Harness racing
* Horse racing

===Human sports===
* Bobsleigh
* Cycle sport
* Skeleton (sport)
* Track and field

===Motor sports===
* Auto racing
* Drag racing
* Kart racing
* Motorcycle racing
* Stock car racing
* Track racing (motorcycles)
* Truck racing
* Drift racing

==Configurations==
Some racetracks offer little in the way of permanent infrastructure other than the track; others incorporate spectator facilities such as grandstands, hospitality or facilities for competitors, such as pit lanes and garages, paddocks and stables. Several racetracks are incorporated into larger venues or complexes, incorporating golf courses, museums, hotels, and conference centres. Some racetracks are small enough to be contained indoors, for sports such as motocross, track cycling, and athletics.

Many racetracks are multi-use, allowing different types of sport on the same track, or incorporating many tracks in one venue. Commonly, running tracks are incorporated within general use or soccer stadiums, either permanently visible or covered by stands or pitches.

Many horse and motorsport tracks are configurable, allowing different routes or sections. Some venues contain smaller tracks inside larger ones, with access tunnels and bridges for spectators. Some racetracks incorporate a short course and a longer course which uses part of the shorter one, usually the main straight, such as Brands Hatch. The Le Mans road race venue is centred on a smaller permanent circuit within its complex.

==Surfaces==
Surfaces include:

* All-weather running track (Tartan) (athletics)
* Artificial turf (electric radio controlled off-road racing)
* Asphalt/tarmac (motorsports, athletics, cycling)
* Carpet (electric radio controlled racing)
* Concrete (motorsports)
* Dirt (horses, greyhounds, automobiles, motorbikes (track racing), stock cars, radio controlled off-road racing, cycling)
* Grass (horses, amateur motorsports, cross country running)
* Ice (speed skating – when on dirt tracks, bobsleighs, speed skating, ice motor racing)
* Sand (horses, camels, greyhounds, rally raid)
* Wood (cycling) (board track racing – now defunct)

==Motorsport==

Race tracks are primarily designed for road racing competition through speed, featuring defined start-finish lines or posts, and sometimes even a series of defined timing points that divide the track into time sectors. A racetrack for cars (i.e. a car track) is a closed circuit, instead of a street circuit utilizing temporarily closed public roads.

Race tracks can host individual or team sports. Racetracks can feature rolling starts, or fixed starts, with associated equipment (starting blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a pit lane, and usually timing equipment.

===Track layout===
Some car tracks are of an oval shape, and can be banked, which allows almost universal spectator views or high speed racing (cycling, stock cars). A famous one is Nardò where high-speed manufacturer testing often takes place, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Some oval tracks are variations on an oval shape, for practical reasons or to introduce varying difficulties such as Talladega (a tri-oval). Most race tracks have meandering circuits with many curves, chicanes and changes in height, to allow for a challenge in skill to the competitors, notably motocross and touring car racing – these tend to predominate throughout most of the world, but especially in Europe.

===Road circuits===

Flatter meandering motorsport courses are sometimes called &#x27;road circuits&#x27;, originating in the fact that the earliest road racing circuits were simply closed-off public roads. Some car racetracks are specifically configured in a long straight, namely drag racing.

True road circuits are still in use, e.g. the Australian GP has been run in Adelaide and continues to be in Melbourne on regular city streets. The most famous of these are the Monaco GP, and the Circuit de la Sarthe circuit in Le Mans, France. These are not permanent facilities built for racing (although parts of the Circuit de la Sarthe are purpose-built, and closed to the public).

===Converted airfields===
After World War II, many wartime airfields, particularly in Great Britain, were left without further use. This coincided with a post-war boom in motorsport, and many airfields were converted to race tracks, where the circuit layout usually combined parts of the runways and the surrounding perimeter taxiways. The famous British track at Silverstone is a former 
Class A airfield, as are Castle Combe and Goodwood. The long runways were perfect for drag strips such as at Santa Pod Raceway. This type of track also appears on the popular motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, which is filmed at Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, United kingdom

<doc id="301928" wikidata="Q2087545" url="?curid=301928" title="Lumped-element model">
<text>The lumped-element model (also called lumped-parameter model, or lumped-component model) is a simplified representation of a physical system or circuit that assumes all components are concentrated at a single point and their behavior can be described by idealized mathematical models. The lumped-element model simplifies the system or circuit behavior description into a topology. It is useful in electrical systems (including electronics), mechanical multibody systems, heat transfer, acoustics, etc. This is in contrast to distributed parameter systems or models in which the behaviour is distributed spatially and cannot be considered as localized into discrete entities.

The simplification reduces the state space of the system to a finite dimension, and the partial differential equations (PDEs) of the continuous (infinite-dimensional) time and space model of the physical system into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a finite number of parameters.

== Electrical systems ==
=== Lumped-matter discipline ===
The lumped-matter discipline is a set of imposed assumptions in electrical engineering that provides the foundation for lumped-circuit abstraction used in network analysis. The self-imposed constraints are:
# The change of the magnetic flux in time outside a conductor is zero. formula_1
# The change of the charge in time inside conducting elements is zero. formula_2
# Signal timescales of interest are much larger than propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across the lumped element.

The first two assumptions result in Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws when applied to Maxwell&#x27;s equations and are only applicable when the circuit is in steady state. The third assumption is the basis of the lumped-element model used in network analysis. Less severe assumptions result in the distributed-element model, while still not requiring the direct application of the full Maxwell equations.

=== Lumped-element model ===
The lumped-element model of electronic circuits makes the simplifying assumption that the attributes of the circuit, resistance, capacitance, inductance, and gain, are concentrated into idealized electrical components; resistors, capacitors, and inductors, etc. joined by a network of perfectly conducting wires.

The lumped-element model is valid whenever formula_3, where formula_4 denotes the circuit&#x27;s characteristic length, and formula_5 denotes the circuit&#x27;s operating wavelength. Otherwise, when the circuit length is on the order of a wavelength, we must consider more general models, such as the distributed-element model (including transmission lines), whose dynamic behaviour is described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Another way of viewing the validity of the lumped-element model is to note that this model ignores the finite time it takes signals to propagate around a circuit. Whenever this propagation time is not significant to the application the lumped-element model can be used. This is the case when the propagation time is much less than the period of the signal involved. However, with increasing propagation time there will be an increasing error between the assumed and actual phase of the signal which in turn results in an error in the assumed amplitude of the signal. The exact point at which the lumped-element model can no longer be used depends to a certain extent on how accurately the signal needs to be known in a given application.

Real-world components exhibit non-ideal characteristics which are, in reality, distributed elements but are often represented to a first-order approximation by lumped elements. To account for leakage in capacitors for example, we can model the non-ideal capacitor as having a large lumped resistor connected in parallel even though the leakage is, in reality distributed throughout the dielectric. Similarly a wire-wound resistor has significant inductance as well as resistance distributed along its length but we can model this as a lumped inductor in series with the ideal resistor.

== Thermal systems ==
A lumped-capacitance model, also called lumped system analysis, reduces a thermal system to a number of discrete “lumps” and assumes that the temperature difference inside each lump is negligible. This approximation is useful to simplify otherwise complex differential heat equations. It was developed as a mathematical analog of electrical capacitance, although it also includes thermal analogs of electrical resistance as well.

The lumped-capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction, which may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat transfer across the boundary of the object. The method of approximation then suitably reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system (spatial temperature variation within the object) to a more mathematically tractable form (that is, it is assumed that the temperature within the object is completely uniform in space, although this spatially uniform temperature value changes over time). The rising uniform temperature within the object or part of a system, can then be treated like a capacitative reservoir which absorbs heat until it reaches a steady thermal state in time (after which temperature does not change within it).

An early-discovered example of a lumped-capacitance system which exhibits mathematically simple behavior due to such physical simplifications, are systems which conform to &quot;Newton&#x27;s law of cooling&quot;. This law simply states that the temperature of a hot (or cold) object progresses toward the temperature of its environment in a simple exponential fashion. Objects follow this law strictly only if the rate of heat conduction within them is much larger than the heat flow into or out of them. In such cases it makes sense to talk of a single &quot;object temperature&quot; at any given time (since there is no spatial temperature variation within the object) and also the uniform temperatures within the object allow its total thermal energy excess or deficit to vary proportionally to its surface temperature, thus setting up the Newton&#x27;s law of cooling requirement that the rate of temperature decrease is proportional to difference between the object and the environment. This in turn leads to simple exponential heating or cooling behavior (details below).

=== Method ===
To determine the number of lumps, the Biot number (Bi), a dimensionless parameter of the system, is used. Bi is defined as the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object&#x27;s boundary with a uniform bath of different temperature. When the thermal resistance to heat transferred into the object is larger than the resistance to heat being diffused completely within the object, the Biot number is less than 1. In this case, particularly for Biot numbers which are even smaller, the approximation of &quot;spatially uniform temperature within the object&quot; can begin to be used, since it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.

If the Biot number is less than 0.1 for a solid object, then the entire material will be nearly the same temperature, with the dominant temperature difference being at the surface. It may be regarded as being &quot;thermally thin&quot;. The Biot number must generally be less than 0.1 for usefully accurate approximation and heat transfer analysis. The mathematical solution to the lumped-system approximation gives Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.

A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a &quot;thermally thick&quot; substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated heat transfer equations for &quot;transient heat conduction&quot; will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body.

The single capacitance approach can be expanded to involve many resistive and capacitive elements, with Bi &lt; 0.1 for each lump. As the Biot number is calculated based upon a characteristic length of the system, the system can often be broken into a sufficient number of sections, or lumps, so that the Biot number is acceptably small.

Some characteristic lengths of thermal systems are:
* Plate: thickness
* Fin: thickness/2
* Long cylinder: diameter/4
* Sphere: diameter/6

For arbitrary shapes, it may be useful to consider the characteristic length to be volume / surface area.

==== Thermal purely resistive circuits ====

A useful concept used in heat transfer applications once the condition of steady state heat conduction has been reached, is the representation of thermal transfer by what is known as thermal circuits. A thermal circuit is the representation of the resistance to heat flow in each element of a circuit, as though it were an electrical resistor. The heat transferred is analogous to the electric current and the thermal resistance is analogous to the electrical resistor. The values of the thermal resistance for the different modes of heat transfer are then calculated as the denominators of the developed equations. The thermal resistances of the different modes of heat transfer are used in analyzing combined modes of heat transfer. The lack of &quot;capacitative&quot; elements in the following purely resistive example, means that no section of the circuit is absorbing energy or changing in distribution of temperature. This is equivalent to demanding that a state of steady state heat conduction (or transfer, as in radiation) has already been established.

The equations describing the three heat transfer modes and their thermal resistances in steady state conditions, as discussed previously, are summarized in the table below:

In cases where there is heat transfer through different media (for example, through a composite material), the equivalent resistance is the sum of the resistances of the components that make up the composite. Likely, in cases where there are different heat transfer modes, the total resistance is the sum of the resistances of the different modes. Using the thermal circuit concept, the amount of heat transferred through any medium is the quotient of the temperature change and the total thermal resistance of the medium.

As an example, consider a composite wall of cross-sectional area formula_6. The composite is made of an formula_7 long cement plaster with a thermal coefficient formula_8 and formula_9 long paper faced fiber glass, with thermal coefficient formula_10. The left surface of the wall is at formula_11 and exposed to air with a convective coefficient of formula_12. The right surface of the wall is at formula_13 and exposed to air with convective coefficient formula_14.

Using the thermal resistance concept, heat flow through the composite is as follows:
formula_15
where formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, and formula_19

==== Newton&#x27;s law of cooling ====
Newton&#x27;s law of cooling is an empirical relationship attributed to English physicist Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727). This law stated in non-mathematical form is the following:

Or, using symbols:
formula_20

An object at a different temperature from its surroundings will ultimately come to a common temperature with its surroundings. A relatively hot object cools as it warms its surroundings; a cool object is warmed by its surroundings. When considering how quickly (or slowly) something cools, we speak of its &quot;rate&quot; of cooling – how many degrees&#x27; change in temperature per unit of time.

The rate of cooling of an object depends on how much hotter the object is than its surroundings. The temperature change per minute of a hot apple pie will be more if the pie is put in a cold freezer than if it is placed on the kitchen table. When the pie cools in the freezer, the temperature difference between it and its surroundings is greater. On a cold day, a warm home will leak heat to the outside at a greater rate when there is a large difference between the inside and outside temperatures. Keeping the inside of a home at high temperature on a cold day is thus more costly than keeping it at a lower temperature. If the temperature difference is kept small, the rate of cooling will be correspondingly low.

As Newton&#x27;s law of cooling states, the rate of cooling of an object – whether by conduction, convection, or radiation – is approximately proportional to the temperature difference Δ&quot;T&quot;. Frozen food will warm up faster in a warm room than in a cold room. Note that the rate of cooling experienced on a cold day can be increased by the added convection effect of the wind. This is referred to as wind chill. For example, a wind chill of -20 °C means that heat is being lost at the same rate as if the temperature were -20 °C without wind.

==== Applicable situations ====
This law describes many situations in which an object has a large thermal capacity and large conductivity, and is suddenly immersed in a uniform bath which conducts heat relatively poorly. It is an example of a thermal circuit with one resistive and one capacitative element. For the law to be correct, the temperatures at all points inside the body must be approximately the same at each time point, including the temperature at its surface. Thus, the temperature difference between the body and surroundings does not depend on which part of the body is chosen, since all parts of the body have effectively the same temperature. In these situations, the material of the body does not act to &quot;insulate&quot; other parts of the body from heat flow, and all of the significant insulation (or &quot;thermal resistance&quot;) controlling the rate of heat flow in the situation resides in the area of contact between the body and its surroundings. Across this boundary, the temperature-value jumps in a discontinuous fashion.

In such situations, heat can be transferred from the exterior to the interior of a body, across the insulating boundary, by convection, conduction, or diffusion, so long as the boundary serves as a relatively poor conductor with regard to the object&#x27;s interior. The presence of a physical insulator is not required, so long as the process which serves to pass heat across the boundary is &quot;slow&quot; in comparison to the conductive transfer of heat inside the body (or inside the region of interest—the &quot;lump&quot; described above).

In such a situation, the object acts as the &quot;capacitative&quot; circuit element, and the resistance of the thermal contact at the boundary acts as the (single) thermal resistor. In electrical circuits, such a combination would charge or discharge toward the input voltage, according to a simple exponential law in time. In the thermal circuit, this configuration results in the same behavior in temperature: an exponential approach of the object temperature to the bath temperature.

==== Mathematical statement ====
Newton&#x27;s law is mathematically stated by the simple first-order differential equation:
formula_21
where
*&quot;Q&quot; is thermal energy in joules
*&quot;h&quot; is the heat transfer coefficient between the surface and the fluid
*&quot;A&quot; is the surface area of the heat being transferred
*&quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the object&#x27;s surface and interior (since these are the same in this approximation)
*&quot;T&quot;env is the temperature of the environment
*Δ&quot;T&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;T&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) − &quot;T&quot;env is the time-dependent thermal gradient between environment and object

Putting heat transfers into this form is sometimes not a very good approximation, depending on ratios of heat conductances in the system. If the differences are not large, an accurate formulation of heat transfers in the system may require analysis of heat flow based on the (transient) heat transfer equation in nonhomogeneous or poorly conductive media.

==== Solution in terms of object heat capacity ====

If the entire body is treated as lumped-capacitance heat reservoir, with total heat content which is proportional to simple total heat capacity formula_22, and formula_23, the temperature of the body, or formula_24. It is expected that the system will experience exponential decay with time in the temperature of a body.

From the definition of heat capacity formula_22 comes the relation formula_26. Differentiating this equation with regard to time gives the identity (valid so long as temperatures in the object are uniform at any given time): formula_27. This expression may be used to replace formula_28 in the first equation which begins this section, above. Then, if formula_29 is the temperature of such a body at time formula_30, and formula_31 is the temperature of the environment around the body:
formula_32
where formula_33 is a positive constant characteristic of the system, which must be in units of formula_34, and is therefore sometimes expressed in terms of a characteristic time constant formula_35 given by: formula_36. Thus, in thermal systems, formula_37. (The total heat capacity formula_22 of a system may be further represented by its mass-specific heat capacity formula_39 multiplied by its mass formula_40, so that the time constant formula_35 is also given by formula_42).

The solution of this differential equation, by standard methods of integration and substitution of boundary conditions, gives:
formula_43

If:

: formula_44 is defined as : formula_45 where formula_46 is the initial temperature difference at time 0,

then the Newtonian solution is written as:
formula_47

This same solution is almost immediately apparent if the initial differential equation is written in terms of formula_48, as the single function to be solved for.
formula_49

=== Applications ===
This mode of analysis has been applied to forensic sciences to analyze the time of death of humans. Also, it can be applied to HVAC (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning, which can be referred to as &quot;building climate control&quot;), to ensure more nearly instantaneous effects of a change in comfort level setting.

== Mechanical systems ==
The simplifying assumptions in this domain are:
* all objects are rigid bodies;
* all interactions between rigid bodies take place via kinematic pairs (&quot;joints&quot;), springs and dampers.

== Acoustics ==
In this context, the lumped-component model extends the distributed concepts of acoustic theory subject to approximation. In the acoustical lumped-component model, certain physical components with acoustical properties may be approximated as behaving similarly to standard electronic components or simple combinations of components.

*A rigid-walled cavity containing air (or similar compressible fluid) may be approximated as a capacitor whose value is proportional to the volume of the cavity. The validity of this approximation relies on the shortest wavelength of interest being significantly (much) larger than the longest dimension of the cavity.
*A reflex port may be approximated as an inductor whose value is proportional to the effective length of the port divided by its cross-sectional area. The effective length is the actual length plus an end correction. This approximation relies on the shortest wavelength of interest being significantly larger than the longest dimension of the port.
*Certain types of damping material can be approximated as a resistor. The value depends on the properties and dimensions of the material. The approximation relies in the wavelengths being long enough and on the properties of the material itself.
*A loudspeaker drive unit (typically a woofer or subwoofer drive unit) may be approximated as a series connection of a zero-impedance voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor. The values depend on the specifications of the unit and the wavelength of interest.

== Heat transfer for buildings ==
A simplifying assumption in this domain is that all heat transfer mechanisms are linear, implying that radiation and convection are linearised for each problem.

Several publications can be found that describe how to generate lumped-element models of buildings. In most cases, the building is considered a single thermal zone and in this case, turning multi-layered walls into lumped elements can be one of the most complicated tasks in the creation of the model. The dominant-layer method is one simple and reasonably accurate method. In this method, one of the layers is selected as the dominant layer in the whole construction, this layer is chosen considering the most relevant frequencies of the problem.

Lumped-element models of buildings have also been used to evaluate the efficiency of domestic energy systems, by running many simulations under different future weather scenarios.

== Fluid systems ==
Fluid systems can be described by means of lumped-element cardiovascular models by using voltage to represent pressure and current to represent flow; identical equations from the electrical circuit representation are valid after substituting these two variables. Such applications can, for example, study the response of the human cardiovascular system to ventricular assist device implantation.

<text>Fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum and slapped cheek syndrome, is a common and contagious disease caused by infection with parvovirus B19. This virus was discovered in 1975 and can cause other diseases besides fifth disease. Fifth disease typically presents as a rash and is most common in children. While parvovirus B19 can affect people of all ages, only two out of ten individuals will present with symptoms.

== Pathogenicity ==
Parvovirus B19 is the only virus within the &quot;Parvoviridae&quot; family to cause disease in humans, especially in children. The most common disease derived from parvovirus B19 is fifth disease. This disease is spread in close contact through respiratory droplets, which can be from the nose, mouth, or direct contact with an infected person. Fifth disease is most commonly spread in the winter and spring seasons in children aged six to fourteen years old. Parvovirus B19 will start replicating from anywhere for four to eighteen days. Infected children will be most contagious during this time and before they develop the most notable sign, a red rash on their cheeks, and other symptoms.

Since parvovirus B19 is a single stranded DNA virus, replication can only occur in dividing cells. This is also why other populations besides children can become infected with parvovirus B19, develop fifth disease, and have complications. Certain populations are at a higher risk if they have more dividing cells or a weakened immune system than the typical person. These populations include pregnant women, fetuses, adults, and immunocompromised. Over the last few years, first-time infections in pregnant women have been increasing throughout the world. About 1-5% of pregnant women can become infected. Typically, having the virus will not impact the outcome of the pregnancy, and 90% of cases of infected fetuses do not lead to any serious outcomes. However, complications can still occur in both the fetus and mother. For example, if fetuses contract parvovirus B19, possible complications can include miscarriage or intrauterine fetal death. Additionally, infected adults have been documented to develop arthralgias, or joint pain. Also, a specific group of immunocompromised people with bone marrow failure and infected with parvovirus B19 have been shown to develop aplastic crisis. Other notable complications caused by infection from parvovirus B19 can include gloves and sock syndrome.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The symptoms of fifth disease are usually mild and may start as a fever, headache or a runny nose. These symptoms pass, then a few days later, the rash appears. The bright red rash most commonly appears in the face, particularly the cheeks. Children infected typically go through 3 stages; first when the rash appears on the face. This is a defining symptom of the infection in children (hence the name &quot;slapped cheek disease&quot;). In addition to red cheeks, the second stage consists of children developing a red, lacy rash on the rest of the body, with the upper arms, torso, and legs being the most common locations. The rash typically lasts a few days and may itch; some cases have been known to last for several weeks. People are usually no longer infectious once the rash has appeared. Lastly the third stage consists of recurring rashes due to hot showers, sun exposure, or minor injuries lasting about 11 days.

In children, the risk of Parvovirus B19-related arthralgia (joint-stiffness) is less than 10%, but 19% of those with new-onset arthritis may have developed the B19 infection within the previous 10 weeks. Teenagers and adults may present with joint pain or swelling, out of which 60% infected females and 30% of infected males reported these symptoms. Out of these, 20% of the females may experience continuous joint stiffness for several months or years. Symptoms can persist up to 3 weeks since onset. Sometimes, fifth disease can also cause serious complications, especially if the person is pregnant, has anemia, or is immunocompromised; affecting the blood system, joints or nerves. Adults with fifth disease may have difficulty in walking and in bending joints such as wrists, knees, ankles, fingers, and shoulders.

The disease is usually mild, but in certain risk groups and rare circumstances, it can have serious consequences:

* In pregnancy, infection in the first trimester is considered more detrimental for the mother but contraction of the infection in the second trimester has been linked to hydrops fetalis, a condition causing excessive build up of fluid in the fetus&#x27; tissues and organs causing edema, and thus causing spontaneous miscarriage.
* Those who are immunocompromised (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy) may be at risk for complications if exposed.
* In less than 5% of women with parvovirus B19 infection, a baby may develop severe anemia leading to miscarriage. This occurs most often during the first half of pregnancy.

== Causes ==
Fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum, is caused by parvovirus B19, which only infects humans. Infection by parvovirus B19 can lead to multiple clinical manifestations, but the most common is fifth disease.

Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a small, single-stranded, non-enveloped DNA virus. Binding of B19V capsid to the cellular receptor globoside (Gb4Cer) results in a cascade of structural changes and subsequent signal transduction processes facilitating the entry of parvovirus B19 into the host cell. After gaining access to the host cell, B19V binds to glycosphingolipid globoside (blood group P antigen) targeting erythroid lineage in the bone marrow. Replication of viral genome and release of virus from infected cells lead to various complex effects on host&#x27;s cellular environment such as induction of DNA damage, hijack of cell cycle and apoptosis (killing of infected cells).

B19V DNA has been found in a wide range of tissues in healthy and diseased individuals indicates the persistence of B19V infection. According to a clinical microbiology review published by Jianming Qiu &quot;Persistence of viral DNA has been detected in up to 50% of biopsy specimens of the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, liver, heart, synovial tissues, skin, brain, and testes, for decades after infection.&quot;

Recovery from parvovirus B19 infection is achieved by production of IgM antibodies which are specific for virus and are generated 10–12 days after infection. After day 16, when signs of fifth disease (red rashes) and arthralgia (pain in joints) becomes apparent, specific anti B19 IgG is produced by immune cells. Production of serum anti B19 IgG keeps infection under control and facilitates the recovery of erythroid cell production in erythroid lineage cells that were targeted by parvovirus B19.

== Transmission ==
Fifth disease is transmitted primarily by respiratory droplets such as sneezing, coughing, etc.; by direct contact through the saliva or mucus, but can also be spread by contact with infected blood either directly or through blood transfusions. The incubation period (the time between exposure to an infection and the onset of symptoms) is usually between 4 and 21 days. Viremia (a condition which occurs when viruses enter the bloodstream and eventually spread to the rest of the body) occurs within 5 to 10 days from exposure to Parvovirus B19, and the person remains contagious 5 days following Viremia. Typically, school children, day-care workers, teachers, and parents are most likely to be exposed to the virus making them high risk population. Rates of transmission of Parvovirus B19 is highest in household settings with people living with infected persons, leading to almost 50%, moderate among adults with a 40% transmission rate, and variable in people working at daycare centers and schools with about 10-60% of transmission risk. The most common time for infection to spread in children causing fifth disease is during late winters and early spring, with outbreaks occurring every 3–4 years. Vertical transmission from maternal infection may also occur, which can lead to hydrops fetalis, a human disease of the fetuses due to the infection&#x27;s detrimental effects on red blood cell production.

Parvovirus B19 can also be transmitted through blood products such as frozen plasma or cellular blood components (Red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, as the virus is resistant to the common mechanism of solvent detergent techniques that is used to inactivate pathogens in these blood products.

== Diagnosis ==
The most common manifestation of Fifth Disease is marked by a red, &quot;slapped cheek&quot; look on the face and a lace-like rash on the body and limbs. The &quot;slapped cheek&quot; appearance of the rash can be suggestive of fifth disease, however, the rash can be mistaken with other skin related disease or infections. Many other viral rashes, like measles, rubella, roseola, and scarlet fever, can look similar to erythema infectiosum. In adults, for example, joint pain caused by parvovirus B19 infection might make doctor consider conditions like the flu and mononucleosis during initial diagnosis. Doctors may also look consider ruling out non-infectious causes like drug allergies and certain types of arthritis; which can present with similar symptoms as fifth disease. For this reason, blood samples testing can be definitive in confirming the diagnosis of Fifth Disease. These blood tests are commonly referred to as &quot;diagnostic assays&quot;. An antibody assay uses antibodies designed to detect parvovirus antigen or protein in blood circulation. For example, anti-parvovirus B19 IgM antibody serum assay is often the preferred method to detect previous infection. The assay can result positive one week after initial infection. Negative assay results may prompt retesting in the future to rule out early sampling of blood serum. A positive assay result can also be indicative of an infection within the previous two to six months. People acquire lifetime immunity if IgG antibodies are produced in response to parvovirus B19 exposure. Infection by parvovirus B19 can also be confirmed by isolation of viral DNA detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or direct hybridization. PCR tests are considered significantly more sensitive to detecting the viral antigen parvovirus B19 compared direct DNA hybridization. In order to diagnose Fifth Disease in a fetus, a PCR test is done using a sample taken from the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby (otherwise known as &quot;amniocentesis&quot;). A DNA hybridization assay can better detect variants of the parvovirus B19. There exists 3 biological similar genotypes of parvovirus B19, numbered one through three. The most common genotype circulating is genotype one. Laboratory tests can indicate complications of infection, including anemia, liver damage, and low platelet count.

Aside from diagnosing Fifth Disease with laboratory tests, it is crucial to monitor fetal blood flow in the brain. This involves looking for signs of moderate to severe anemia using an ultrasound.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for Fifth Disease is primarily symptomatic and supportive as the infection is frequently self-limiting. A self-limiting infection typically does not require treatment, such as medication, and will heal independently. While there is currently no specific therapy recommendation for Fifth Disease, symptom management can be attempted with over-the-counter medications. Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, are commonly used to reduce fevers. In cases of joint disease, such as those with arthritis or arthralgia, treatment options can include medications that reduce inflammation, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID); or other anti-inflammatories can be used. It is essential to never give children aspirin for any of their symptoms due to the risk of Reye&#x27;s syndrome. Conservative treatment targeted to relieve people with symptoms of joint disease caused by Fifth Disease has also utilized acupuncture, physical therapy exercises, and chiropractic care along with pharmacologic management. Other forms of treatment include plenty of rest, increased daily fluids, nutritious daily meal intake, medication adherence and overall wellbeing.

The rash usually does not itch but can be mildly painful. The rash itself is not considered contagious. The infection generally lasts about 5 to 10 days. Stress, hot temperatures, exercise, and exposure to sunlight can contribute to recurrence within months of the initial infection. Upon resolution, immunity is considered life-long. Populations at greater risk of complications (see below) may need referral to a specialist. Anemia is a more severe complication that could result from parvovirus B19 infection and requires a blood transfusion as part of therapy.

== Prevention ==
Since there is no specific treatment for Fifth Disease, prevention is an important factor. Although fifth disease primarily occurs in children and will typically resolve on its own, similar to the cold, vulnerable populations such as those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or people with anemia are more at risk of developing complications from the disease due to their bodies compromised state making it harder for the body to fight off the virus. Therefore, prevention of fifth disease is an important factor in decreasing the number of people who become sick from the B19 virus resulting in Fifth Disease.

Primary prevention aims to prevent the virus from infecting the host&#x27;s body and ultimately stop the disease from happening. In contrast, secondary prevention aims to detect the disease early on in its course and stop its progression. An example of a primary prevention strategy is the use of vaccines. There currently are no approved vaccinations for Fifth Disease. More research needs to be done to develop of a safe, productive, and efficacious vaccine. However, clinical studies have shown that vaccinations for B19 carry possible additional benefits to high-risk people, such as those who are pregnant, immunocompromised, have had organ transplants, and children with anemia.

The abbreviation NPI stands for non-pharmaceutical interventions. As discussed in the &#x27;Transmission&#x27; content above, Fifth Disease can be spread from human to human through blood respiratory particles, and from mother to baby during pregnancy. Since somebody can spread Fifth Disease through respiratory particles, similar to the transmission of COVID-19, the CDC recommends following the general recommendations for respiratory viruses. Thus, much of the same NPI utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used as preventive strategies for Fifth Disease, such as practice good hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing into the elbow, proper mask etiquette, and isolating when sick/contagious.

=== High risk/vulnerable population prevention ===
One of the populations that is at high risk for severe complications from contracting Fifth Disease, as discussed in the complications section, is pregnant women and their fetuses. The primary prevention for pregnant women is to reduce the exposure or contact with Fifth Disease. Prevention strategies for pregnant women, due to the increased risk of severe complications both for them and the fetus, include increased awareness about the virus/disease to provide them with the knowledge and resources they need to take care of their health effectively, those who are at high-risk for complications should also be advised on the transmission of the virus and educated on what other safety measures they could practice to avoid areas where transmission of the disease is typically high such as childcare centers, close contact with school-age children or even close contact with someone who works with school-aged children such as teachers, and healthcare settings such as hospitals.

== Outcomes ==
In Fifth Disease, parvovirus B19 has the potential to affect various parts of the body, including the skin, heart, brain, joints, liver and more. Thus, complications of Fifth Disease can be present in various populations with different conditions such as pregnancy, fetal development, neurological conditions, autoimmune disorders, etc. While parvovirus B19 is typically transmitted via respiratory secretions or hand to mouth contact, it has also been known to be passed from pregnant women to fetuses. Notably, there are some known complications associated with Fifth Disease relating to pregnant women and fetuses that can range from mild to moderate, and in some cases, severe complications can affect both pregnant women and fetuses. Roughly 50-75% of all pregnant women are immune to parvovirus B19 while the remainder of women are susceptible to mild illness. In a 2024 review of parvovirus b19 infection and pregnancy, it is found that pregnant women who do not have immunity to parvovirus B19 are at higher risk of passing the infection to their baby, especially if they contract it during the first trimester or second trimester; which can lead to more serious complications. Although the potential consequences of erythema infectiosum can be quite serious in pregnancy, pregnant women can be tested for immunity via the presence of IgG antibodies and IgM antibodies. A majority of fetuses who do contract parvovirus B19 show either no significant symptoms or complete resolution of the virus. However, the following serious complications are rare but possible: miscarriage, stillbirth, fetal anemia, hepatic failure, and abnormal neurodevelopment outcome. In some cases, fetuses would develop hydrops fetalis due to congenital parvovirus B19. This condition was studied as a determinant of later fetal outcomes, such as miscarriage or perinatal death, in 2016 systematic review. The review showed that those born with parvovirus B19 that caused hydrops fetalis did have an association with higher mortality risk and higher risk of complications.

In addition to fetuses, parvovirus B19 infection and its effects has been studied in adults as well. The parvovirus B19 infection has also been associated with the fetal development of neurological complications, as identified in a systematic review in 2014. This analysis included a total of 89 studies covering complications in both the central and nervous system such as encephalitis, meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. However, the specific pathophysiology of these complications has yet to be discovered but the review does encourage the use of antibody testing to determine a patient&#x27;s risk. Infection of this virus is not limited to the nervous system. Parvovirus B19 has also been linked to cases of cardiac inflammation that can cause structural damage to the heart over time. If the damage progresses and is significant, cardiac cell death may occur.

In people with weakened immune systems, parvovirus B19 infection often causes low blood cell counts and can lead to chronic infection. Sometimes, an acute parvovirus B19 infection can mimic or even trigger autoimmune disease because it can cause the body to produce antibodies against itself. Individuals that are living with HIV are also susceptible to complications if infected due to being immunocompromised. This happens due to processes like molecular mimicry, cell death, and enzyme activation. While relatively rare, those who live with both HIV and parvovirus B19 infection will be unable to fight off the B19 virus. This can result in substantial loss of red blood cells and cause anemia.

Recent research has found that children and adults who are infected with Parvovirus B19 may develop acute arthritis, and in some cases, chronic joint problems. Studies have detected the presence of the Virus&#x27; DNA in the synovial tissue of people with rheumatoid arthritis, but other studies show mixed results.

In some cases, parvovirus B19 can mainly affect the bone marrow due to the virus&#x27;s strong attraction to bone marrow receptors, often causing bone marrow function to decrease. This is why viral infection by parvovirus B19 can be particularly harmful to people with hemolytic anemia or blood cancers, leading to a condition called pure red cell aplasia.

== Epidemiology ==
Fifth disease is also known as human parvovirus B19V found all throughout the world, primarily during childhood. This virus spreads by breathing in the viral particles or in the womb during fetal development. The illness is very common and self-limiting. The modes of transmission include respiratory droplets, blood, or mother to fetus. Fifth Disease is most prevalent in children aged 5 to 15 years old. Fifth disease occurs at lower rates in adults. The virus spreads easily and once contracted, the body will begin developing lasting immunity to reinfection. The prevalence of antibodies is 50% in children and 70% to 85% in adults. The virus affects both men and women equally. During the spring and winter, epidemic outbreaks are most likely to occur. In the summer and fall, sporadic cases and outbreaks occur. The outbreaks most commonly occur in daycares and schools. The periodicity of the outbreak cycle is three-to-seven years. The risk of acquiring the viral illness increases when exposed to an infected person or contaminated blood. Individuals who have an occupation that requires close contact with infected people such as healthcare workers and teachers are at an increased risk of acquiring the viral illness. Another risk factor of fifth disease are immunocompromised individuals, those with anemia are at a higher risk of developing complications. Pregnant women are at risk for acquiring viral illness, especially during the first half of pregnancy. Though, complications are very rare and less than 5% of these cases will experience serious complications. The most common complication among pregnant women is anemia. In rare cases, severe anemia can occur, and a buildup of fluid can develop. A buildup of fluid can cause congestive heart failure or death. A blood infusion or induction may be necessary. No vaccine is available for human parvovirus B19, though attempts have been made to develop one.

===Vulnerable populations===
Parvovirus B19 can cause serious complications in certain groups of people:

# Pregnant women - B19 infection in this population can lead to detrimental effects on the fetus, causing hydrops fetalis, as mentioned previously. The risk of fetal infection and harm to the fetus is not high, but if the child is infected, the outcome is not adverse. According to a study, pregnant women infected with Parvovirus B19 carry a 30% chance of infecting the fetus with only 9% of them experiencing adverse outcomes.
# Immunocompromised people are also at risk of being infected and having poor outcomes from the virus. These people with a weakened immune system either due to HIV, transplants or congenital immunodeficiencies, may be seen experiencing chronic anemia as their bodies are unable to fight the virus effectively. This can cause prolonged anemia in the affected individuals.
# In people with sickle-cell disease or other forms of chronic hemolytic anemia, a blood disorder, the infection can precipitate an aplastic crisis, wherein the bone marrow of the individual will suddenly stop producing red blood cells.

A 2019 systematic review examined the rates of parvovirus B19 infection among daycare workers. Since transmission typically occurs through respiratory secretions, it was thought that daycare workers would be at an increased risk of infection because young children can spread saliva through drool. The systematic review indicates that daycare workers are at an increased risk for infection. Another review also supports the finding that daycare workers have an increased risk of contracting parvovirus B19 infection. A 2019 meta-analysis examined rates of parvovirus B19 infection among those with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) using IgG and IgM antibody detection. Pooled data from Africa, Asia, and the Americas revealed a 48.8% parvovirus B19 infection prevalence among persons with Sickle Cell Disease. Prevalence of infection was also determined by geographic location, where areas with reduced access to adequate housing had higher prevalence (Africa was 55.5%). A 2020 literature review also supports the finding that persons with SCD, as well as those with the blood disorder beta thalassemia, are at a higher risk of parvovirus B19 infection.

== History ==

=== Parvovirus B19 ===
Fifth disease is caused by a virus known as Parvovirus B19. This virus was officially discovered in 1975 by Yvonne Cossart and research group. They accidentally discovered the virus while analyzing hepatitis B virus surface antigen panels. The name, B19, comes from its label among a panel in row B and number 19. The group used electron microscopy and found viral particles with similar size and shape to parvoviruses that infect only animals. Soon after, a Japanese research group also found a parvovirus B19 and named it &quot;Nakatani virus.&quot; This virus turned out to be the same one discovered by Cossart&#x27;s team. Throughout this process, the virus was labeled &quot;serum parvovirus-like particle.&quot; This changed in 1985, after confirmation of the similarity between the two research groups&#x27; findings, to B19. Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus and part of the &quot;Parvoviridae&quot; family, which includes &quot;Parvoviridae&quot; family &quot;Parvovirinae&quot; and &quot;Densovirinae&quot;. The &quot;Parvoviridae&quot; family is named after the Latin word &quot;parvum,&quot; which means small. This is because before technological advancements, these viruses were considered to be one of the smallest viruses to infect mammals. However, these viruses are known to also infect invertebrates as well. So, additional genera were created depending on how the viruses replicate. These include &quot;Parvovirus&quot;, &quot;Dependovirus&quot;, and &quot;Erythrovirus&quot;. Parvovirus B19 used to be part of the &quot;Parvovirus&quot; genus since it does not need assistance to replicate, like the viruses of the &quot;Dependovirus&quot; do. However, parvovirus B19 only infects erythroid cells, so it is now part of the &quot;Erythrovirus&quot; genus. One well-known &quot;Parvovirus&quot; includes &quot;Canine parvovirus&quot;, which is known to infect dogs and cause inflammation of the small intestine and heart muscle. While all of these viruses are known to cause diseases, only parvovirus infects humans. Specifically, parvovirus B19 attacks the P-antigen on human stem cells that eventually develop into red blood cells.

===Name===

Fifth disease&#x27;s name comes from its numerical position after the top four childhood rash-causing diseases. The first four include measles, scarlet fever, rubella, and Duke&#x27;s disease. Fifth disease can also be known as &quot;slapped cheek disease&quot; due to the red rash that spreads on the cheeks after several days of infection with parvovirus B19.

<text>Kraft Dinner (marketed as KD) in Canada, Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Mac and Cheese in the United Kingdom and internationally, is a nonperishable, packaged macaroni and cheese mix. It is made by Kraft Foods Group (or former parent company Mondelez internationally) and traditionally cardboard-boxed with dried macaroni pasta and a packet of processed cheese powder. It was introduced under the &quot;Kraft Dinner&quot; name simultaneously in both Canada and the U.S. in 1937. The brand is particularly popular with Canadians, who consume 55% more boxes per capita than Americans.

There are now many similar products, including private label, of nonperishable boxed macaroni and cheese. Commercially, the line has evolved, with deluxe varieties marketed with liquid processed cheese and microwavable frozen mac-and-cheese meals. The product by Kraft has developed into many flavour variations and formulations, including Easy Mac (a product that has since been renamed Mac &amp; Cheese Dinner Cups), a single-serving product specifically designed for microwave ovens.

The product&#x27;s innovation, at the time of the Great Depression, was to conveniently market nonperishable dried macaroni noodles together with a processed cheese powder. The product is prepared by cooking the pasta and adding the cheese powder along with butter (or margarine) and milk.

==History==
The prerequisite to a shelf-stable packaged macaroni and cheese product was the invention of processed cheese, where emulsifying salts help stabilize the product, giving it a longer life. While living in Chicago, James Lewis Kraft of Fort Erie, Ontario, began to build his cheese business after winning a patent for one such method in 1916.

During the Great Depression, a St. Louis, Missouri, salesman, Grant Leslie of Dundee, Scotland, had the idea to sell macaroni pasta and cheese together as a package, so he began attaching grated cheese to boxes of pasta with a rubber band. In 1937, Kraft introduced the product in the U.S. and Canada. The timing of the product&#x27;s launch had much to do with its success: during World War II, the rationing of milk and dairy products, increased reliance on meatless meals, and more women working outside the home created a large market for the product, which was considered a hearty meal for families. Its shelf life of ten months was attractive at a time when many Canadian homes did not have refrigerators. Also, consumers could receive, for one food ration stamp, two boxes. The original box was primarily yellow. 50 million boxes were sold during the war. The box&#x27;s primary colour changed to blue in 1954, later used in an advertising campaign where children were encouraged to ask for &quot;The Blue Box&quot;.

Marye Dahnke, Kraft’s resident chef, suggested reviving macaroni and cheese after Kraft was facing competition from Miracle Whip.

A version with spiral-shaped noodles debuted in 1975, while Velveeta Shells &amp; Cheese were introduced in 1984. A single-serving variation requiring only water for preparation was introduced as Easy Mac in 1999. In 2006, the cheddar and white cheddar versions switched to organic macaroni, while Easy Mac Cups were introduced the same year. In 2007, the noodles switched to 50 percent whole grain.

Macaroni &amp; Cheese Crackers also debuted in 2007. The crackers were discontinued in 2008, as they did not meet company targets. A sub-line, Homestyle Deluxe, was added in 2010 in three flavours: cheddar, four-cheese sauce, and Old World Italian.

Kraft Macaroni and Cheese sold in the United States used to include Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 to make the food a brighter colour. In Europe, food that contains Yellow 5 requires a warning label saying, &quot;This product may have adverse effect on activity and attention in children.&quot; In 2014, none of the European varieties were made with artificial dyes.

In November 2013, Kraft announced that new pasta shape varieties for children in the U.S. would no longer include Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, the sodium and saturated fat content would decrease, and there would be six more grams of whole grains.

In April 2015, it was announced that those changes, including the elimination of artificial preservatives, would be extended throughout the line after January 2016. Paprika, annatto and turmeric are used for colouring. According to Kraft, the changes were a response to consumer feedback.

In 2018, Kraft-Heinz introduced the KD Shaker, which was a plastic bottle of Kraft Mac and Cheese Dinner&#x27;s powdered cheese, allowing one to use the cheese powder as they wish, without needing to worry about unused pasta. The product is similar to shelf-stable Parmesan cheese powder bottle cans.

==In Canadian culture==

Kraft Dinner has been called a de facto national dish of Canada. Packaged in Quebec with Canadian wheat and milk, and other ingredients from Canada and the US, Canadians purchase 1.7 million of the 7 million boxes sold globally each week and eat an average of 3.2 boxes of Kraft Dinner each year, 55% more than Americans. The meal is the most popular grocery item in the country, where &quot;Kraft Dinner&quot; has an iconic status and has become a generic trademark of sorts for macaroni and cheese. It is often simply referred to, and (as of 2023) is now marketed by the initials K.D. As Kraft Dinner has a different name in Canada from the United States and other markets, the Canadian marketing and advertising platform is a made-in-Canada effort that cannot be easily adapted to the US market.

Pundit Rex Murphy wrote that &quot;Kraft Dinner revolves in that all-but-unobtainable orbit of the Tim Hortons doughnut and the A&amp;W Teen Burger. It is one of that great trinity of quick digestibles that have been enrolled as genuine Canadian cultural icons.&quot; Douglas Coupland wrote that &quot;cheese plays a weirdly large dietary role in the lives of Canadians, who have a more intimate and intense relationship with Kraft food products than the citizens of any other country. This is not a shameless product plug – for some reason, Canadians and Kraft products have bonded the way Australians have bonded with Marmite [sic, recte:Vegemite], or the English with Heinz baked beans. In particular, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, known simply as Kraft Dinner, is the biggie, probably because it so precisely laser-targets the favoured Canadian food groups: fat, sugar, starch and salt.&quot; Immigrants often mention Kraft Dinner when surveys ask for examples of Canadian food. As a measure of the product&#x27;s Canadian popularity, its Facebook page, KD Battle Zone, attracted 270,000 fans, despite there being no prizes for the contest.

Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies refer to the product in their popular song &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;, indicating that they would continue to eat the inexpensive foodstuff even if they were millionaires. This has often prompted fans at live concerts to throw boxes of Kraft Dinner onto the stage when the line is sung; the band has discouraged this and has urged fans to donate the boxes to their local food bank instead.

On similar note, Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator celebrated Kraft Dinner in their song &quot;Kraf dinner&quot; (sic) on their 1990 album &quot;Never, Neverland&quot;, and Canadian alternative country singer-songwriter Boy Golden in &quot;KD and Lunch Meat&quot; on his 2021 album &quot;Church of Better Daze&quot;.

Former Prime Minister Paul Martin regularly referred to it as his favourite food, though he also confessed that he was unable to prepare it. During the same election former Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that &quot;I&#x27;ll never be able to give my kids a billion-dollar company, but Laureen and I are saving for their education. And I have actually cooked them Kraft Dinner—I like to add wieners.&quot; Most Canadians ignore the instructions and use alternate methods of preparing the food, like adding wieners or cheese. Additional ingredients are not always necessary; simply adjusting the cooking time and the amount of milk or butter/margarine can produce a dish ranging from soft noodles in a creamy sauce to firm noodles in a thin, milky sauce.

In the September 2012 issue of &quot;The Walrus&quot; magazine, the story &quot;Kraft Dinner is Canada&#x27;s True National Dish&quot; by Sasha Chapman details the history of the Canadian cheese industry and Kraft&#x27;s impact on it. She notably draws attention to Canada being unique in favouring a manufactured food product (made by a foreign company) as its national dish at the expense of local cheeses. Chapman&#x27;s article is structured around this question, from the first page:But what does it mean if a national dish is manufactured, formulated by scientists in a laboratory in Glenview, Illinois, and sold back to us by the second-largest food company in the world?Kraft Dinner is a frequent staple of Canadian university student diets. Consequently, university students protesting government funding cuts and tuition hikes have often used Kraft Dinner as a prop to draw attention to their plight.

==Nutrition==
Prepared Kraft Dinner is 71% carbohydrates, 11% protein, and 5% fat (table). In a reference serving, Kraft Dinner supplies 382 calories and rich contents (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of sodium (56% DV) and iron (25% DV), with calcium in moderate content (15% DV) (table).

== Preparation ==
The box describes a simple three-step process (the &quot;cooking instructions&quot;) for preparing the dinner. The 1-2-3 directions include &quot;Boil,&quot; &quot;Drain,&quot; and &quot;Add.&quot; &quot;Boiling&quot; is further defined as boiling water and adding the pasta, with no reference to added salt or covering of the pan. The directions indicate the pasta cooking time, usually as a range. The &quot;Drain&quot; step shows a colander being used. The last step, &quot;Add,&quot; says to add all the ingredients back to the pot (with no reference to whether to leave the pot on the stove or turn off the burner) and mix thoroughly.

Although many people have their personal preferences for quantities of added ingredients, the box has a &quot;classic prep&quot; list that says to use 6 cups water, 1 Tbsp. Margarine and 1/3 cup skim milk. People may also vary the &quot;cooking instructions&quot; to their preferences, including adding salt to the water or omitting ingredients like milk. 

==Variations==
New product lines using different flavours and pasta shapes have been introduced over the decades, and shelf life has increased at various times. Kraft Dinner is seen as an inexpensive, easy-to-make comfort food, with marketing that highlights its value and convenience.

The product is now available in a variety of compositions:

* The Original Recipe of dry macaroni pasta (roughly 172 grams) and 70 ml (approximately 42 grams) of powdered processed cheese. This category includes additional flavours of powdered cheese sauce (see Flavours and shapes).
* The Deluxe form, with the powdered processed cheese replaced with a prepared, processed cheese sauce that comes in a foil pouch (cheese sauce formerly came in a can). This allows the cheese to be applied directly to the cooked pasta without additional preparation or ingredients. The pasta also differs; elbow macaroni replaces the thin, straight macaroni supplied as part of the &quot;Original Recipe.&quot;
* The Homestyle form is the newest form of Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. It is similar to the &quot;Deluxe&quot; form, though it provides a large size and includes seasoned breadcrumbs to apply to the macaroni and cheese. It has three flavours: cheddar cheese, four-cheese, and Old World Italian. It is marketed as being a &quot;more premium option&quot; for those who would not eat the &quot;Original Recipe&quot;. This version also has the prepared, processed cheese sauce in a foil pouch. Due to the breadcrumb topping, this form has more sodium than the &quot;Deluxe&quot; or &quot;Original Recipe&quot; forms. As of 2015, this variant has been discontinued due to a lack of demand.
* Dinner Cups, formerly Kraft Easy Mac, which makes single-serving portions. This formulation is prepared in a microwave oven and is popular among college students.
* A commercial version is manufactured for restaurant distribution and is a frozen, fully prepared product designed to be heated in a microwave. The product can be found at Burger King and Applebee&#x27;s restaurants.
* In the summer of 2021, Kraft Heinz released a selection of stir-in flavour boosters in the Canadian market. There are six different Kraft Dinner Flavour Boosts in the following flavours: Jalapeño, Butter Chicken, Poutine, Buffalo Wings, Ghost Pepper, and Cotton Candy. These packets are added to a prepared pot of Kraft Dinner and are designed to enhance the experience by providing a new flavour variation for the eater.

===Kraft Dinner Smart===
Kraft Dinner Smart (also known as KD Smart) launched as a healthy &quot;sub-brand&quot; of the Kraft Dinner brand. It represents a line of Kraft macaroni and cheese products with no artificial flavours, colours, or preservatives and added ingredients like cauliflower, oats, or flax seed blended into the noodles. It comes in four varieties:

Kraft Dinner Smart launched in Canada in March 2010 with two vegetable varieties. In June 2011, the line-up was re-launched with new packaging graphics and two new varieties (Flax Omega-3 and High Fibre).

The product is made with real Kraft cheddar and is manufactured in Mount Royal, Quebec.

==Marketing==
The product was marketed as Kraft Dinner with the slogan &quot;a meal for four in nine minutes for an everyday price of 19 cents.&quot; It was re-branded to Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese in the United States and other countries, although the word &quot;Dinner&quot; still appeared in small type on the U.S. version until the 2022 rebrand, and is referred to as the “Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese Dinner” in the product webpage for the American variant. In several markets, it goes by different names; in the United Kingdom, it is also marketed as &quot;Cheesey Pasta&quot;.

The product is heavily promoted to children in the United States on television. When advertising to younger children, the television advertisement encourages the children to ask for &quot;The Blue Box.&quot; In 2010, Kraft launched a $50 million multi-media marketing campaign with a nostalgia theme aimed at adults to promote all varieties of Kraft Dinner. In Canada, Kraft has advertising programs intended to make the meal appealing to newly arrived immigrant groups.

There are regular promotional tie-in versions of the Kraft Dinner aimed at kids. Packages have come with pasta in the shapes of various characters popular with children, such as Looney Tunes, Super Mario Bros., and Star Wars. Kraft Foods has also released many products under the product banner. These include other versions of macaroni and cheese with differently shaped pasta and different flavours, but it has also included completely different dishes, such as spaghetti, in several different flavours.

In promotion of the introduction of its &quot;Cheddar Explosion&quot; variety of Kraft Dinner, Kraft sponsored the demolition of Texas Stadium on April 11, 2010. In its last act of 2009, the Irving, Texas city council made Kraft Macaroni and Cheese the official sponsor of the demolition. Kraft paid $75,000 to local charities and donated another $75,000 in Kraft products. A national essay contest directed at children who &quot;have made a difference in their community&quot; was held with the winner allowed to push the button initiating the controlled demolition. The winning essayist was 11-year-old Casey Rogers of Terrell, Texas, founder of a charity serving the homeless.

<text>Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG (, ) is a German audio equipment manufacturer headquartered in Wedemark. Sennheiser specializes in equipment for both the consumer and professional audio markets, including microphones, headphones, and loudspeakers.

Founded in 1945 by Fritz Sennheiser, the company&#x27;s professional media division has been under the leadership of third-generation co-CEOs Daniel Sennheiser and Andreas Sennheiser since 2013. The Sennheiser Group has over 2,800 employees worldwide, and reported total sales of €756.7 million in 2019. Sennheiser&#x27;s consumer audio division was acquired by Sonova Holding AG in May 2021.

==History==

The company was founded in 1945 shortly after the end of World War II by Fritz Sennheiser and seven fellow University of Hannover engineers. Originally named Laboratorium Wennebostel (shortened as &quot;Labor W&quot;), named after the village of Wennebostel in the municipality of Wedemark, where it had been relocated during the war, the company&#x27;s first product was a voltmeter.
In 1946, the company began building microphones designed for broadcast reporting, beginning with its first original design, the DM 2, soon followed up by the DM 3 and DM 4. In 1953 the company introduced the MD 21 dynamic microphone, which became established as the standard microphone for radio and television reporting.
By 1955 the company had 250 employees and had begun production of many products, including geophysical equipment, noise-compensated microphones, microphone transformers, mixers, and miniature magnetic headphones, and introduced the MD 82, one of the world&#x27;s first commercially-produced shotgun microphones, in 1956. The following year, the company introduced &quot;Microport,&quot; a wireless microphone system for television production.

In 1958 Labor W was renamed Sennheiser electronic. In 1960, Sennheiser introduced the cardioid successor to its popular MD 21, the MD 421; this microphone was also quickly adopted for professional broadcasting applications, music recording studios, and live concert performances. Still in production more than 60 years after its introduction, the MD 421 is considered an industry standard, with more than 500,000 units having been produced. In the early 1960s, Fritz Sennheiser tasked Thomas Schillinger with establishing the company&#x27;s presence in the United States, and the distribution company Sennheiser Electronics Corp. was founded in 1963. 

In 1968, the company introduced the world&#x27;s first open-back headphones, the HD 414, and in 1971, Sennheiser introduced the MD 441. Sennheiser transformed into a limited partnership (KG) in 1973. 

In 1980, the company entered the aviation market, supplying Lufthansa with aviation headsets. The company began producing modern wireless microphones in 1982, the same year founder Fritz Sennheiser handed the management of the company over to his son, Jörg Sennheiser.

In 1987 at the 59th Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Sennheiser with a Scientific and Engineering Award for the industry-standard MKH 816 shotgun microphone.

In 1991, Sennheiser Electronic GmbH acquired studio microphone manufacturer Georg Neumann GmbH, and moved Neumann microphone production into a newly-built level 100 cleanroom factory in Wedemark, while maintaining Neumann&#x27;s official headquarters in Berlin.

In 2003, Sennheiser entered into a joint venture with Danish company, William-Demant-Holding, a specialist in hearing aids, diagnostic technology, and personal communication, establishing Sennheiser Communications A/S. In 2005, Sennheiser acquired speaker manufacturer Klein + Hummel.
Daniel Sennheiser, grandson of the founder, joined the company in 2008, as did his brother Andreas Sennheiser two years later. Both are company shareholders. On 1 July 2013 Daniel and Andreas Sennheiser were promoted to the position of co-CEO, responsible for Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG.

In 2014, Sennheiser founded the new subsidiary Sennheiser Streaming Technology GmbH (SST), which develops streaming solutions for software and hardware. In March of the same year, Sennheiser assumed sponsorship of Shanghai Concert Hall, which was renamed Sennheiser Shanghai Concert Hall. At the same time, the company launched the Sennheiser Media record label with the release of A Bu&#x27;s first album. Sponsorship of the concert hall continued until August 2017.

In 2019, Sennheiser acquired a majority stake in Dear Reality, a company that specializes in spatial audio algorithms and VR/AR audio software.

In May 2021, Sonova Holding AG, a Swiss cochlear implant and hearing aid manufacturer, acquired Sennheiser&#x27;s consumer audio division, which produces a range of headphones and home entertainment speakers, for €200 million.

Sennheiser&#x27;s professional audio division continues to produce for live music, studio, broadcast, video, and film production, as well as spatial audio audio and AR/VR/XR. The professional audio division also produces solutions for business communication, such as presentations, conferences, meetings, visitor guidance, hearing support, and the education sector. The company manufactures wireless microphones; aviation, multimedia and gaming headsets; micro-Hifi systems; conferencing systems; speakers; amplifiers, and high-end audiophile headphones like the HD 800 S and Orpheus.

In 2022, Sennheiser acquired Merging Technologies.

==Production and locations==

Sennheiser has research and development sites in Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Singapore, and the United States. In addition, the Innovation Campus in Wennebostel opened in 2015 with 7,000 m2 of space. The company invested 60.5 million euros in research and development in 2018.

The company has factories in Wennebostel (Wedemark, near Hannover); Tullamore, Ireland (since 1990); Albuquerque, New Mexico (since 2000), and Brașov, Romania (since 2019). The factory at its Wennebostel headquarters focuses on products for the high-end consumer and professional audio markets. The Tullamore facility manufactures acoustic transducers for headphones and headsets. The Albuquerque facility manufacturers wireless systems and components for the US market, and the Brasov facility is focused on the assembly of products for both the professional and consumer markets. Some consumer products are made in China.

The company opened its first Sennheiser store in 2016. Sennheiser now has seven stores in Berlin, San Francisco, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Mexico City, and Sydney and at its headquarters in Wedemark. In 2016, a temporary store was located in New York City.

==Ambeo 3D Audio==

Ambeo is a family of Sennheiser products dealing in 3D audio technologies. Sennheiser has been recording 9.1 music since 2010 and has developed an upmix algorithm that generates 9.1 music from conventional stereo recordings. The AMBEO Music Blueprints provide information about the recording, mixing, and playback of live music in 3D audio. The first AMBEO product to be introduced in 2016 was the AMBEO VR Mic for professional VR/AR/XR sound recording. Sennheiser created the first augmented audio listening accessory for Magic Leap’s AR/VR goggles, the AMBEO AR One.

In July 2022, the company began collaborating with Netflix to produce &quot;spatial audio&quot; tracks for its original productions, downmixed to stereo from the original multi-channel versions. In February 2023, Netflix expanded this support to over 700 films and television series.

<text>The Battles of Khalkhin Gol (; ) were the decisive engagements of the undeclared Soviet–Japanese border conflicts involving the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Japan and Manchukuo in 1939. The conflict was named after the river Khalkhin Gol, which passes through the battlefield. In Japan, the decisive battle of the conflict is known as the after Nomonhan, a nearby village on the border between Mongolia and Manchuria. The battles resulted in the defeat of the Japanese Sixth Army.

==Background==

After the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931, Japan turned its military interests to Soviet territories that bordered those areas. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of Mongolia signed an Mutual Assistance Pact in March 1936, allowing the former to send troops to Mongolia. In the same year, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in response. Following Japan&#x27;s full invasion of China in July 1937, the Soviet Union sent the 57th Special Corps led by Ivan Konev to Mongolia. On 13 June, Genrikh Lyushkov, a Soviet NKVD major general who knew Stalin personally, defected to Japan for fear of the Great Purge. He took with him a large number of secret documents that allegedly revealed the dire situation of the Soviet army in the Far East. The first major Soviet-Japanese border incident, the Battle of Lake Khasan, occurred in 1938 in Primorye. Clashes between Japanese and Soviet forces occurred frequently along the border of Manchuria.

In 1939, Manchuria was a puppet state of Japan known as Manchukuo, and Mongolia was a communist state allied with the Soviet Union, known as the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. The Japanese maintained that the border between Manchukuo and Mongolia was the Khalkhin Gol (English &quot;Khalkha River&quot;) which flows into Lake Buir. In contrast, the Mongolians and their Soviet allies maintained that the border ran some east of the river, just east of Nomonhan village.

The principal occupying army of Manchukuo was the Kwantung Army of Japan, consisting of some of the best Japanese units in 1939. However, the western region of Manchukuo was garrisoned by the relatively newly formed 23rd Infantry Division at Hailar under General Michitarō Komatsubara and included several Manchu army and border guard units all under the direct command of the Sixth Army. The 23rd was the newest and least experienced division in the entire Kwantung Army. In addition to this, the 23rd Division was equipped with outdated equipment. Japanese army experts rated the combat capability of the 23rd Division as &quot;below medium&quot;, comparable to a garrison division on occupation duty in China.

The Soviet forces consisted of the 57th Special Corps, deployed from the Transbaikal Military District. They were responsible for defending the border between Siberia and Manchuria. The Mongolian troops mainly consisted of cavalry brigades and light artillery units, and proved to be effective and agile, but lacked armor and manpower in sufficient numbers.

From May 1938, the commander of the Soviet forces and of the Far East Front was Komandarm Grigori Shtern.

On 2 June 1939, Comcor Georgy Zhukov was told by Commissar of Defence Kliment Voroshilov that Stalin was dissatisfied with the local commander and he was to go to Mongolia, take command of the 57th Special Corps and eliminate Japanese provocations by inflicting a decisive reverse on the Imperial Japanese Army. (When summoned to Moscow on 1 June, Zhukov had feared he was to be arrested and interrogated by the NKVD.)

In 1939, the Japanese Cabinet sent instructions to the Kwantung Army to strengthen and fortify Manchukuo&#x27;s borders with Mongolia and the Soviet Union. Additionally, the Kwantung Army, which had long been stationed in Manchuria far from the Japanese Home Islands, had become largely autonomous and tended to act without approval from, or even against the direction of, the Japanese government.

==Battles==

===May: Skirmishes===

The battles began on 11 May 1939. A Mongolian cavalry unit of some 70 to 90 men had entered the disputed area in search of grazing for their horses. On that day, Manchu cavalry attacked the Mongolians and drove them back across the river Khalkhin Gol. On 13 May, the Mongolian force returned in greater numbers and the Manchukoans failed to dislodge them.

On 14 May, Lt. Col. Yaozo Azuma led the reconnaissance regiment of the 23rd Infantry Division, supported by the 64th Infantry Regiment of the same division, under Colonel Takemitsu Yamagata, into the territory and the Mongolians withdrew. Soviet and Mongolian troops returned to the disputed region, however, and Azuma&#x27;s force again moved to evict them, but the Soviet-Mongolian forces surrounded Azuma&#x27;s force on 28 May and destroyed it. The Azuma force suffered eight officers and 97 men killed and one officer and 33 men wounded, for 63% total casualties.

===June: Escalation===
Both sides increased their forces in the area. On 5 June, Zhukov, the new corps commander, arrived, and brought more motorized and armored forces (I Army Group) to the combat zone. Accompanying Zhukov was Comcor Yakov Smushkevich with his aviation unit. Zhamyangiyn Lhagvasuren, Corps Commissar of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army, was appointed Zhukov&#x27;s deputy.

On 27 June the Japanese Army Air Force&#x27;s 2nd Air Brigade struck the Soviet airbase at Tamsak-Bulak in Mongolia. The Japanese won this engagement, but the strike had been ordered by the Kwantung Army without obtaining permission from Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) headquarters in Tokyo. In an effort to prevent the incident from escalating, Tokyo promptly ordered the JAAF not to conduct any more air-strikes against Soviet airbases.



Throughout June there were reports of Soviet and Mongolian activity on both sides of the river near Nomonhan and small-scale attacks on isolated Manchukoan units. At the end of the month, the commander of the 23rd Japanese Infantry Division, Lt. Gen. Michitarō Komatsubara, received permission to &quot;expel the invaders&quot;.

===July: Japanese assault===
The Japanese planned a two-pronged assault. The first attack would be made by three regiments plus part of a fourth: the 71st and the 72nd Infantry Regiment (23rd Division), a battalion of the 64th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Shinichiro Sumi (7th Infantry Division). This force would advance across the Khalkin Gol, destroy Soviet forces on Baintsagan Hill on the west bank, then make a left turn and advance south to the Kawatama Bridge. The second prong of the attack would be the task of the IJA 1st Tank Corps (1st TC) (Yasuoka Detachment), consisting of the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments, plus a part of the 64th Infantry Regiment, a battalion from the 28th Infantry Regiment, detached from the 7th Infantry, 24th Engineer Regiment, and a battalion from the 13th Field-Artillery Regiment, all under the overall command of Lieutenant General Yasuoka Masaomi. This force would attack Soviet troops on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol and north of the Holsten River. The two Japanese thrusts were to join on the wings. The order of battle was thus:
* Lt. Gen. Yasuoka Masaomi, IJA, Commanding Officer, 1st Tank Corps
** 3rd Tank Regiment
*** Type 89 I-Go medium tanks – 26
*** Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks – 4
*** Type 94 tankettes – 7
*** Type 97 Te-Ke tankettes – 4
** 4th Tank Regiment
*** Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks – 35
*** Type 89 I-Go medium tanks – 8
*** Type 94 tankettes – 3
The northern task force succeeded in crossing the Khalkhin Gol, driving the Soviets from Baintsagan Hill, and advancing south along the west bank. However, Zhukov, perceiving the threat, launched a counterattack with 450 tanks and armored cars. The tanks consisted of primarily BT tanks with a handful of T-26s, while the armored cars were BA-10s and BA-3/6s, which were similar in armor () and armament (main: gun 20K mod, secondary: two machine guns) to the Soviet light tanks.

The Soviet armored force, despite being unsupported by infantry, attacked the Japanese on three sides and nearly encircled them. The Japanese force, further handicapped by having only one pontoon bridge across the river for supplies, was forced to withdraw, recrossing the river on 5 July.

Meanwhile, the 1st Tank Corps of the Yasuoka Detachment (the southern task force) attacked on the night of 2 July, moving in the darkness to avoid the Soviet artillery on the high ground of the river&#x27;s west bank. A pitched battle ensued in which the Yasuoka Detachment lost over half its armor, but still could not break through the Soviet forces on the east bank and reach the Kawatama Bridge. After a Soviet counterattack on 9 July threw the battered, depleted Yasuoka Detachment back, it was dissolved and Yasuoka was relieved.
The two armies continued to spar with each other over the next two weeks along a front running along the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol to its junction with the Holsten River. Zhukov, whose army was away from its base of supply, assembled a fleet of 2,600 trucks to supply his troops, while the Japanese suffered severe supply problems due to a lack of similar motor transport. In early July the Japanese had only 600 trucks, rising to 1,000 by the end of the month, of which only 75% were operable. By 20 August the Japanese managed to accumulate 2,000 trucks delivering 1,500 tons of supply daily, but even this fell below the Red Army&#x27;s capabilities.

On 23 July, the Japanese launched another large-scale assault, sending the 64th and 72nd Infantry Regiments against Soviet forces defending the Kawatama Bridge. Over a period of two days, Japanese artillery supported the attack with a massive barrage that consumed more than half of their ammunition stores. The attack made some progress but failed to break through Soviet lines and reach the bridge. The Japanese disengaged from the attack on 25 July due to mounting casualties and depleted artillery stores. By this point they had suffered over 5,000 casualties between late May and 25 July, with Soviet losses being much higher but more easily replaced. The battle drifted into a stalemate.

===August: Soviet counterattack===

With war apparently imminent in Europe, and to avoid fighting a two front war, Zhukov planned a major offensive on 20 August 1939 to clear the Japanese from the Khalkhin Gol region and to end the fighting. Zhukov, using a fleet of at least 4,000 trucks (IJA officers, with hindsight, disputed this, saying he instead used 10,000 to 20,000 motor vehicles) transporting supplies from the nearest base in Chita ( away) assembled a powerful armored force of three tank brigades (the 4th, 6th and 11th), and two mechanized brigades (the 7th and 8th, which were armored car units with attached infantry support). This force was allocated to the Soviet left and right wings. The entire Soviet force consisted of three rifle divisions, two tank divisions and two more tank brigades (in all, some 498 BT-5 and BT-7 tanks), two motorized infantry divisions, and over 550 fighters and bombers. The Mongolians committed two cavalry divisions.
In comparison, at the point of contact, the Kwantung Army had only the 23rd Infantry Division, which with various attached forces was equivalent to two light infantry divisions. Its headquarters had been at Hailar, over from the fighting. Japanese intelligence, despite demonstrating an ability to track the build-up of Zhukov&#x27;s force, failed to precipitate an appropriate response from below. Thus, when the Soviets finally did launch their offensive, Komatsubara was caught off-guard.

To test the Japanese defenses prior to their main assault on 20 August, the Soviets launched three aggressive probing assaults, one on 3 August and the others on 7/8 August. All three were disastrously thrown back, with around 1,000 combined dead and several tanks knocked out on the Soviet side compared to just 85 Japanese casualties. The Japanese counterattacked and routed elements of the Mongolian 8th Cavalry Division, seizing a hilly sector of the battlefront.

Despite the fact that no more major fighting would take place until 20 August, Japanese casualties continued to mount at a rate of 40 wounded per day. Kwantung Army staff officers were becoming increasingly worried over the disorganized state of the 6th Army headquarters and supply elements. The growing casualty count meant that the green 23rd Division would have to take, train and assimilate new replacements &quot;on the job&quot;. By contrast, Tokyo&#x27;s oft-stated desire that it would not escalate the fighting at Khalkhin Gol proved immensely relieving to the Soviets, freed to hand-pick select units from across the military to be concentrated for a local offensive without fear of Japanese retaliation elsewhere.
Zhukov decided it was time to break the stalemate. At 05:45 on 20 August 1939, Soviet artillery and 557 aircraft attacked Japanese positions, the first fighter-bomber offensive in Soviet Air Force history. Approximately 50,000 Soviet and Mongolian soldiers of the 57th Special Corps attacked the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol. Three infantry divisions and a tank brigade crossed the river, supported by massed artillery and by the Soviet Air Force.

Once the Japanese were pinned down by the attack of Soviet center units, Soviet armored units swept around the flanks and attacked the Japanese in the rear, achieving a classic double envelopment. When the Soviet wings linked up at Nomonhan village on 25 August, they trapped the Japanese 23rd Infantry Division. On 26 August, a Japanese counterattack to relieve the 23rd Division failed. On 27 August the 23rd Division attempted to break out of the encirclement but failed. When the surrounded forces refused to surrender, they were again hit with artillery and air attacks. By 31 August, Japanese forces on the Mongolian side of the border were destroyed, leaving remnants of the 23rd Division on the Manchurian side. The Soviets had achieved their objective.

The Soviet Union and Japan agreed to a cease-fire on 15 September; it took effect the following day at 1:10 pm.

==Casualties==
Japanese military records reported approximately 20,000 battle and non-battle casualties, 162 aircraft lost in combat, and 42 tanks disabled (of which 29 were later repaired and redeployed). Roughly 500 to 600 Japanese and Manchus were taken prisoner. Due to a military doctrine that prohibited surrender, most of these men were listed as killed in action for the benefit of their families. The Soviets initially claimed to have inflicted 29,085 casualties on the Japanese, but later increased this to 52–55,000 and then 61,000 for their official histories. Based on Soviet and Russian estimates, some sources put Japanese casualties at 45,000, with Soviet casualties of at least 17,000.

According to the Sixth Army&#x27;s medical data, Japanese casualties amounted to 7,696 killed, 8,647 wounded, 1,021 missing, and 2,350 sick, for a total of 19,714 personnel losses. The Kwantung Army headquarters and their internal records gave a slightly different figure of 8,629 killed and 9,087 injured, excluding sick. In November 1939 the American consulate in Harbin claimed to possess &quot;authoritative&quot; information that Japanese casualties reached 30,000, while Agricultural Minister Yukio Sakurauchi reported in October that casualties reached 35–36,000 out of 40,000 participants. In September 1942 the Japanese dedicated a monument to the fallen in the Manchurian theater; of these, 9,471 Japanese and 202 Manchus were attributed to the Nomonhan campaign, an increase of approximately 10 percent over previous totals.

;IJA battle casualties for selected periods, Nomonhan campaign

Zhukov reported Soviet casualties during the final offensive (beginning 20 August) as 9,284, including 1,701 dead &amp; missing and 7,583 wounded. In 1993, Grigoriy Krivosheev cited totals of 7,974 killed and 15,251 wounded for the entire campaign. In the 2001 edition of Krivosheev&#x27;s work, revised figures of 9,703 dead &amp; missing, 15,251 wounded, and 701 sick are given, for a total of 25,655. Of the dead, 6,472 were killed in action or died of wounds during evacuation, 1,152 died of wounds in hospitals, eight died of disease, 2,028 were missing, and 43 died from non-combat causes. Historian Boris Sokolov has cited a higher number of sick, 2,225, writing that the lower number of 701 only reflects patients who were treated in the Trans-Baikal Military district.

In addition to their personnel losses, the Soviets lost a large amount of equipment including 253 tanks, 250 aircraft (including 208 in combat), 96 artillery pieces, and 133 armored cars. Of the Soviet tank losses, 75–80% were destroyed by anti-tank guns, 15–20% by field artillery, 5–10% by infantry-thrown incendiary bombs, 2–3% by aircraft, and 2–3% by hand grenades and mines. The large number of Soviet armor casualties are reflected in the manpower losses for Soviet tank crews. A total of 1,559 Soviet &quot;Tank Troops&quot; were killed or wounded during the battles.
Mongolian casualties were 556–990, including 280 killed and 710 wounded. At least 11 armored cars were destroyed and 1,921 horses and camels were lost.

Nomonhan was the first use of airpower on a massive scale in a high-intensity battle to obtain a specific military objective. The combatants remained at peace until August 1945, when the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchukuo and other territories after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

===Aircraft losses summary and notes===
Combat losses include aircraft shot down during aerial combat, written off due to combat damage or destroyed on the ground.

Non-combat losses include aircraft that were lost due to accidents, as well as write-offs of warplanes due to the end of their service life. Thus Soviet combat losses amount to 163 fighters, 44 bombers, and a reconnaissance aircraft, with further 385 fighters and 51 bombers requiring repairs due to combat damage. VVS (Soviet Air Forces) personnel losses were 88 killed in aerial combat, 11 killed by anti-aircraft artillery, 65 missing, six killed in air-strikes and four died of wounds (174 total) and 113 wounded. The Japanese combat losses were 97 fighters, 25 bombers and 41 other (mostly reconnaissance), while 128 fighters, 54 bombers and 38 other required repairs due to combat damage. The Japanese Air Force suffered 152 dead and 66 severely wounded.

===Aircraft ordnance expenditures===
USSR: Bomber sorties 2,015, fighter sorties 18,509; 7.62 mm machine gun rounds fired 1,065,323; cannon rounds expended 57,979; bombs dropped 78,360 (1,200 tons).

Japan: Fighter/bomber sorties 10,000 (estimated); machine gun rounds fired 1.6 million; bombs dropped 970 tons.

==Summary==

While this engagement is little known in the West, it played an important part in subsequent Japanese conduct in World War II. The battle earned the Kwantung Army the displeasure of officials in Tokyo, not so much due to its defeat, but because battles were initiated and escalated without direct authorization from the Japanese government. This defeat combined with the Chinese resistance in the Second Sino-Japanese War, together with the signing of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact (which deprived the Army of the basis of its war policy against the USSR), moved the Imperial General Staff in Tokyo away from the policy of the North Strike Group favored by the Army, which wanted to seize Siberia for its resources as far as Lake Baikal.

Instead, support shifted to the South Strike Group, favored by the Navy, which wanted to seize the resources of Southeast Asia, especially the petroleum and mineral-rich Dutch East Indies. Masanobu Tsuji, the Japanese colonel who had helped instigate the Nomonhan incident, was one of the strongest proponents of the attack on Pearl Harbor. General Ryūkichi Tanaka, Chief of the Army Ministry&#x27;s Military Service Bureau in 1941, testified after the war that &quot;the most determined single protagonist in favor of war with the United States was Tsuji Masanobu&quot;. Tsuji later wrote that his experience of Soviet fire-power at Nomonhan convinced him not to attack the Soviet Union in 1941.

On 24 June 1941, two days after the war on the Eastern Front broke out, the Japanese army and navy leaders adopted a resolution &quot;not intervening in German Soviet war for the time being&quot;. In August 1941, Japan and the Soviet Union reaffirmed their neutrality pact. The United States and Britain had imposed an oil embargo on Japan, threatening to stop the Japanese war effort, but the European colonial powers were weakening and suffering early defeats in the war with Germany; only the US Pacific Fleet stood in the way of seizing the oil-rich Dutch East Indies. Because of this, Japan&#x27;s focus was ultimately directed to the south, leading to its decision to launch the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December of that year.

Despite plans being made for a potential war against the USSR (particularly contingent on German advances towards Moscow), the Japanese never launched an offensive against the Soviet Union. In 1941, the two countries signed agreements respecting the borders of Mongolia and Manchukuo and pledging neutrality towards each other. In the closing months of World War II, the Soviet Union annulled the Neutrality Pact and invade the Japanese territories in Manchuria, northern Korea, and the southern part of Sakhalin island.

===Soviet assessment===
Following the battle, the Soviets generally found the results unsatisfactory, despite their victory. Though the Soviet forces in the Far East in 1939 were not plagued by fundamental issues to the same extent as those in Europe during the 1941 campaigns, their generals were still unimpressed by their army&#x27;s performance. As noted by Pyotr Grigorenko, the Red Army went in with a very large advantage in technology, numbers and firepower, yet still suffered huge losses, which Grigorenko blamed on poor leadership.

The battle was the first victory for the soon-to-be-famous Soviet general Zhukov, earning him the first of his four Hero of the Soviet Union awards. The two other generals, Grigori Shtern and Yakov Smushkevich, had important roles and were also awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union. They would, however, both be executed in the 1941 Purges. Zhukov himself was promoted and transferred west to the Kiev district.

The battle experience gained by Zhukov was put to good use in December 1941 at the Battle of Moscow. Zhukov used his experience to launch the first successful Soviet counteroffensive against the German invasion. Many units of the Siberian and other trans-Ural armies were part of this attack, and the decision to move these divisions from Siberia was aided by the Soviet spy Richard Sorge in Tokyo, who alerted the Soviet government that the Japanese were looking south and were unlikely to launch another attack against Siberia in the immediate future.

A year after defending Moscow against the advancing Germans, Zhukov planned and executed the Red Army&#x27;s offensive, i.e. Operation Uranus, at the Battle of Stalingrad, using a technique very similar to Khalkhin Gol, in which the Soviet forces held the enemy fixed in the center, built up an undetected mass force in the immediate rear area, and launched a pincer attack on the wings to trap the German army.

Although their victory and the subsequent negotiation of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact secured the Far East for the duration of the Soviet-German War, the Red Army always remained cautious about the possibility of another, larger Japanese incursion as late as early 1944. In December 1943, when the American military mission proposed a logistics base be set up east of Lake Baikal, the Red Army authorities, were according to Coox, &quot;shocked by the idea and literally turned white&quot;.

The Red Army kept a large force in the Far East even during the bleakest days of the war in Europe. For example, on 1 July 1942, Soviet forces in the Far East consisted of 1,446,012 troops, 11,759 artillery pieces, 2,589 tanks and self-propelled guns, and 3,178 combat aircraft. Despite this, the Soviet operations chief of the Far Eastern Front, General A. K. Kazakovtsev, was not confident in his army group&#x27;s ability to stop an invasion if the Japanese committed to it (at least in 1941–1942), commenting: &quot;If the Japanese enter the war on Hitler&#x27;s side ... our cause is hopeless.&quot;

===Japanese assessment and reforms===
The Japanese similarly considered the result not a failing of tactics, but one that simply highlighted a need to address the material disparity between themselves and their neighbours. They made several reforms as a result of this battle: Tank production was increased from 500 annually to 1,200 in 1939. A mechanized headquarters was established in early 1941, and the new Type 1 47 mm anti-tank gun was introduced as a response to the Soviet 45 mm. These cannons were mounted on Type 97 Chi-Ha tanks, resulting in the Type 97 ShinHoTo Chi-Ha (&quot;New Turret&quot;) variant, which became the IJA&#x27;s standard medium tank by 1942.

IGHQ also dispatched General Tomoyuki Yamashita to Germany in order to learn more about tank tactics, following the crushingly one-sided Battle of France and the signing of the Tripartite Pact. He returned with a report where he stressed the need for mechanization and more medium tanks. Accordingly, plans were put underway for the formation of 10 new armoured divisions in the near future.

Despite all of the above, Japanese industry was not productive enough to keep up with either the United States or the Soviet Union, and Yamashita warned against going to war with them for this reason. His recommendations were not taken to heart, and Japanese militarists eventually successfully pushed for war with the United States. In spite of their recent experience and military improvements, the Japanese generally continued to underestimate their adversaries, emphasizing the courage and determination of the individual soldier as a way to make up for their lack of numbers and smaller industrial base. To varying degrees, the basic problems that faced them at Khalkhin Gol would haunt them again when the Americans and British recovered from their defeats of late 1941 and early 1942 and turned to the conquest of the Japanese Empire.

Also, events exposed a severe lack of procedures for emergency stanching of bleeding. The original Japanese doctrine explicitly forbade first aid to fellow soldiers without prior orders from an officer, and first-aid training was lacking. As a result, a large proportion of Japanese dead was due to hemorrhaging from untreated wounds. Furthermore, up to 30% of the total casualties were due to dysentery, which the Japanese believed was delivered by Soviet biological-warfare aerial bombs. To reduce susceptibility to diseases, future Japanese divisions commonly included specialized Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Departments. Finally, the Japanese food rations were found to be unsatisfactory, both in packing and in nutritional value.

==Legacy==
After the Second World War, at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, fourteen Japanese were charged by delegates of the conquering Soviet Union, with having &quot;initiated a war of aggression ... against the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic in the area of the Khalkhin-Gol River&quot; and also with having waged a war &quot;in violation of international law&quot; against the USSR. Kenji Doihara, Hiranuma Kiichirō and Seishirō Itagaki were convicted on these charges.

=== Commemoration ===
The anniversary of the battle was first celebrated in the Soviet Union in 1969, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. After its 50th anniversary, in 1989, it dwindled in importance, going down to the level of academic debates and lectures. Only recently has the anniversary made a resurgence as an important event in Mongolian history.

The Mongolian town of Choibalsan, in the Dornod Province, where the battle was fought, is the location of the &quot;G. K. Zhukov Museum&quot;, dedicated to Zhukov and the 1939 battle. Ulaanbaatar also has a &quot;G. K. Zhukov Museum&quot; with information about the battle. The latter museum was opened on 19 August 1979 in the presence of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal and Zhukov&#x27;s three daughters. During the 70th, 75th 80th, and 85th anniversaries of the battle in 2009, 2014, 2019, and 2024, respectively, the President of Russia took part in the celebrations alongside the President of Mongolia and Soviet and Mongolian veterans, with the celebration often coinciding with a state visit.

On the 80th anniversary, in 2019, a military parade was held in Choibalsan on Independence Square, which featured tactical formations of the Russian Armed Forces&#x27; Eastern Military District and the Mongolian Armed Forces, all of whom were participants in the joint Russian-Mongolian military exercises &quot;Selenga-2019&quot; the previous month. Parades were held in the federal subjects of Russia that surround and have a close relationship with Mongolia, such as Buryatia, Yakutia and the Altai Republic. In the Buryat capital of Ulan-Ude, a parade was held in the capital. In addition, a concert on Sükhbaatar Square took place on 28 August, during which the Russian Alexandrov Ensemble together with the Mongolian singers gave a performance.

<doc id="301940" wikidata="Q319881" url="?curid=301940" title="Republic of Formosa">
<text>The Republic of Formosa was a short-lived republic that existed on the island of Taiwan in 1895 between the formal cession of Taiwan by the Qing dynasty of China to the Empire of Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki and its being taken over by Japanese troops. The Republic lasted 151 days; it was proclaimed on 23 May 1895 and extinguished on 21 October, when the Republican capital Tainan was taken over by the Japanese.

== Etymology ==
The name Formosa dates from 1542 when Portuguese sailors sighted an uncharted island and noted it on their maps as &quot;Ilha Formosa&quot; (&quot;beautiful island&quot;). The name &quot;Formosa&quot; eventually &quot;replaced all others in European literature&quot; and remained in common use among English speakers into the 20th century.

The term was an early Chinese translation of the English word &quot;republic&quot;, pioneered by William Alexander Parsons Martin with his Chinese translation of Henry Wheaton&#x27;s &quot;Elements of International Law&quot;. The Japanese equivalent during this time was , which became the standard translation for &quot;republic&quot; in East Asia, while &quot;mínzhǔguó&quot; came to mean &quot;democratic country&quot; instead. There was also a similar alternative, , pioneered by Sun Yat-sen (see Republic of China (1912–1949)#Name).

== Background ==
In 1894, China and Japan went to war. In a few months, the Japanese defeated China&#x27;s Beiyang fleet, routed the Chinese armies in Manchuria, and captured Port Arthur and Weihaiwei. Although nearly all the fighting took place in northern China, Japan had important territorial ambitions in southern China. As the war approached its end, the Japanese took steps to ensure that Taiwan would be ceded to Japan under the eventual peace treaty and that they were well placed militarily to occupy the island. In March 1895 peace negotiations between Japan and China opened in the Japanese city of Shimonoseki. Although hostilities in northern China were suspended during these negotiations, Taiwan and the Pescadores were specifically excluded from the scope of the armistice. This exclusion allowed the Japanese to mount a military operation against the Pescadores Islands in March 1895. The Pescadores, lying midway between mainland China and Taiwan, were the key to a successful occupation of Taiwan. In a swift campaign in the last week of March the Japanese captured the islands, preventing further Chinese reinforcements from being sent across the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan. This brisk &quot;fait accompli&quot; influenced the peace negotiations, and the ensuing Treaty of Shimonoseki, concluded on 17 April 1895, duly provided for the cession by China of Taiwan to Japan. On 10 May, Admiral Kabayama Sukenori was appointed the first Japanese governor-general of Taiwan.

== Proclamation of the Republic ==
When the news of the treaty&#x27;s contents reached Taiwan, a number of notables from central Taiwan led by Qiu Fengjia decided to resist the transfer of Taiwan to Japanese rule. On 23 May, in Taipei, these men declared independence, proclaiming the establishment of a free and democratic Republic of Formosa. Tang Jingsong, the Qing governor-general of Taiwan, was prevailed upon to become the republic&#x27;s first President, and his old friend Liu Yongfu, the retired Black Flag Army commander who had become a national hero in China for his victories against the French in northern Vietnam a decade earlier, was invited to serve as Grand General of the Army. Qiu was appointed Grand Commander of Militia, with the power to raise local militia units throughout the island to resist the Japanese. On the Chinese mainland Zhang Zhidong, the powerful governor-general of Liangkiang, tacitly supported the Formosan resistance movement, and the Republicans also appointed Chen Jitong, a disgraced Chinese diplomat who understood European ways of thinking, as the Republic&#x27;s foreign minister. His job would be to sell the Republic abroad.

== Declaration of Independence ==
The declaration has not been preserved in its original Chinese version, although an English version of it was recorded by the American war correspondent James Wheeler Davidson, who was in Taipei when it was issued. Davidson&#x27;s version reads as follows:

Official Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Formosa.

The Japanese have affronted China by annexing our territory of Formosa, and the supplications of us, the People of Formosa, at the portals of the Throne have been made in vain. We now learn that the Japanese slaves are about to arrive.

If we suffer this, the land of our hearths and homes will become the land of savages and barbarians, but if we do not suffer it, our condition of comparative weakness will certainly not endure long. Frequent conferences have been held with the Foreign Powers, who all aver that the People of Formosa must establish their independence before the Powers will assist them.

Now, therefore, we, the People of Formosa, are irrevocably resolved to die before we will serve the enemy. And we have in Council determined to convert the whole island of Formosa into a Republican state, and that the administration of all our State affairs shall be organized and carried on by the deliberations and decisions of Officers publicly elected by us the People. But as in this new enterprise there is needed, as well for the resistance of Japanese aggression as for the organization of the new administration, a man to have chief control, in whom authority shall centre, and by whom the peace of our homesteads shall be assured—therefore, in view of the respect and admiration in which we have long held the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Tang Ching Sung, we have in Council determined to raise him to the position of President of the Republic.

An official seal has been cut, and on the second day of fifth moon, at the &quot;ssu&quot; hour [9 a.m. 25 May], it will be publicly presented with all respect by the notables and people of the whole of Formosa. At early dawn on that day, all of us, notables and people, farmers and merchants, artizans and tradesmen, must assemble at the Tuan Fang Meeting House, that we may in grave and solemn manner inaugurate this undertaking

Let there be neither delay nor mistake.
A Declaration of the whole of Formosa.
[Seal in red as follows] An announcement by the whole of Formosa.
== International recognition ==
Since the island had already been ceded to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Western powers were not in a position to recognize the Republic of Formosa as a legitimate government. Acting under the authority of the new Republic, Chinese troops would be able to resist the Japanese in Taiwan without technically breaching the terms of the treaty, and if they were successful Taiwan could return to Chinese rule at some future date. (In this respect, it was significant that the nominally independent Republic acknowledged the suzerainty of China.) There was therefore little sympathy in Europe for the Republic, despite its impeccably &#x27;Parisian&#x27; manifesto.
Although there was considerable unofficial support for the Formosan resistance movement in Beijing, the Qing government&#x27;s official stance was one of punctilious adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, as considerable diplomatic efforts were then underway to persuade Japan to relinquish the Liaodong Peninsula, which had also been ceded to Japan under the treaty. Japan&#x27;s rapacity had aroused concern in Europe, and in a diplomatic demarche known as the Triple Intervention, Russia, France and Germany put pressure on the Japanese government in late April 1895 to restore the peninsula to China. On 5 May the Japanese agreed to retrocede the Liaodong Peninsula to China in return for an increased indemnity, but it took until December 1895 to negotiate the necessary treaty amendments, and while the negotiations were in progress Japanese troops remained in place. During this period the empress dowager and her officials were anxious not to offend Japan, and the Qing court therefore formally disavowed the Republican resistance movement in Taiwan. Shortly before the proclamation of the Republic of Formosa, the Qing court ordered Li Jingfang, the nephew and adopted son of China&#x27;s elder statesman Li Hongzhang, to proceed to Taiwan and transfer sovereignty over the island from China to Japan. It also cabled an imperial edict to Taipei on 20 May, directing Tang Jingsong to order all Qing civil officials and all officers and soldiers to leave Taiwan. Tang himself was ordered to return to Beijing.
Spurned by European public opinion and officially disavowed by China, the Republic of Formosa enjoyed only one week of uninterrupted existence. During this time it decked itself out with the conventional trappings of sovereignty. The Republicans adopted a national flag with a yellow tiger on a blue background, ordered a large silver state seal to be made, and began to issue paper money and postage stamps in the name of the Republic. The foreign minister Chen Jitong, who had lived in France for many years, was responsible for crafting much of this republican symbolism.

==Administrative organisation==
Premises were found for the republican parliament and the republican ministries in the yamens of the former Qing administration in Taipei. Tang Jingsong, the president of the republic, remained in the palatial Government House he had previously occupied as the Qing governor-general of Formosa. Tang&#x27;s cabinet included the heads of the four great ministries of state (war, the navy, home affairs and foreign affairs), who ran their ministries from the large yamens that had previously been the premises of the provincial treasury. The yamens previously used as the headquarters of the Defense Board became Parliament House. The navy department was housed in the old military secretariat.

==Defense==
Knowing that a Japanese landing was imminent, the Republican leaders did what little they could in the short time given to them to prepare the island&#x27;s defenses against invasion. Taiwan in May 1895 was not short of soldiers. Tang Jingsong, in order to raise morale, exaggerated their numbers considerably, claiming that he had under his command 150,000 soldiers, regulars and volunteers. Judicious observers believed that this figure should be halved. In all, they calculated, there were 75,000 soldiers scattered throughout the island, of whom 50,000 were in the northern half and 25,000 in the southern half. These troops included the regular soldiers of the Qing garrison, local volunteers, and Hakka militia units hastily raised on the orders of Qiu Fengjia.

The Qing garrison of Formosa amounted to around 50,000 soldiers, armed for the most part with modern repeating rifles. Liu Yongfu commanded around 20,000 men down in the south, around Tainan, while Qiu Fengjia commanded the central garrisons, perhaps another 10,000 men. The 30,000 men of the northern garrisons were under the command of a Chinese admiral named Yang. Local volunteer and Hakka militia units seem to have accounted for a further 25,000 men.

==Collapse==

The Republic of Formosa survived for only five months. The Japanese landed near Keelung on the northern coast of Taiwan on 29 May 1895, and in a five-month campaign swept southwards to Tainan. During the night of 4 June, on the news that the Japanese had captured Keelung, President Tang and General Qiu fled to Tamsui, and from there sailed for the mainland on the evening of 6 June. The Japanese entered Taipei shortly afterwards.

Following Tang&#x27;s flight, Liu Yongfu assumed the mantle of leadership of the Republic in Tainan. He refused to serve as president, however, and stressed instead his role as commander-in-chief of the resistance against the Japanese. The capture of Tainan now became both a political and a military imperative for the Japanese. During the next three months, although their advance was slowed by guerilla activity, the Japanese defeated the Formosan forces whenever they attempted to make a stand. The Japanese victory at Baguashan on 27 August, the largest battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil, doomed the Formosan resistance to an early defeat. The fall of Tainan on 21 October ended organised resistance to Japanese occupation, and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule in Taiwan.

One of the republic&#x27;s resistance fighters was Lin Sen, future President of the Republic of China. During World War II, Lin urged the return of Taiwan be included in the Allies&#x27; war aims which was accomplished shortly after his death with the Cairo Declaration. There are roads named after him throughout the island.

== Historical significance ==
In spite of the similarities between their names, modern supporters of Taiwan independence who call for the establishment of a Republic of Taiwan are wary of claiming that their own movement owes anything to the example of the 1895 Republic. The reason for this is that Tang Jingsong and his adherents continued to recognise Chinese suzerainty, while modern advocates of a Republic of Taiwan seek complete independence.
Nitobe Inazō wrote, &quot;Mr. Tang was elected president and the Republic of Formosa lasted three or four months, leaving behind nothing but some post-stamps valuable for collectors.&quot;

<doc id="301945" wikidata="Q1497116" url="?curid=301945" title="Holy day of obligation">
<text>In the Catholic Church, holy days of obligation or precepts are days on which Catholic Christians are expected to attend Mass, and engage in rest from work and recreation (i.e., they are to refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship owed to God), according to the third commandment.

The expectation is attached to the holy day, even if transferred to another date, as sometimes happens in the Roman Rite. However, in some countries a dispensation is granted in such circumstances.

==Latin Church==
The holy days of obligation for Latin Church Catholics are indicated in canon 1246 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law:
Placed in the order of the liturgical calendar, the ten days (apart from Sundays) that this canon mentions are:
*8 December: Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*25 December: Solemnity of the Nativity of the Lord (Christmas)
*1 January: Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God
*6 January: Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord
*19 March: Solemnity of Saint Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*Thursday of the sixth week of Eastertide: Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord
*Thursday after Trinity Sunday: Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus Christi)
*29 June: Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, Apostles
*15 August: Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*1 November: Solemnity of All Saints

There used to be many more holy days of obligation. With the &quot;motu proprio&quot; of 2 July 1911, &quot;Supremi disciplinae&quot;, Pope Pius X reduced the number of such non-Sunday holy days from 36 to 8: the above 10 dates (1 January was then the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ) minus the feasts the Body and Blood of Christ, and Saint Joseph. The present list was established in canon 1247 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, now canon 1246 of the current Code of Canon Law.

Even before the time of Pius X, the bishops in many countries had obtained the Holy See&#x27;s approval to diminish the number of non-Sunday holy days of obligation, making the total fewer than 36. Today too, episcopal conferences have availed themselves of the authority granted to them to reduce such days to the ten mentioned above.

Non-Sunday holy days of obligation all have the rank of solemnity. Accordingly, if in Ordinary Time one of them falls on a Sunday, the Sunday celebration gives way to it; but the Sundays of Advent, Lent and Eastertide take precedence over all other solemnities, which are then transferred to another day, along with the precept to attend Mass. Occasionally, the Feast of the Sacred Heart may fall on Ss. Peter and Paul&#x27;s feast day, in which case it takes precedence over the Solemnity of Ss. Peter and Paul; the precept then applies to the feast of the Sacred Heart.

===Working holy days===
While episcopal conferences may suppress holy days of obligation or transfer them to a Sunday, some of them have maintained as holy days of obligation some days that are not public holidays. For most people, such days are normal working days, and they therefore cannot observe the obligation &quot;to abstain from those works and affairs which hinder the worship to be rendered to God, the joy proper to the Lord&#x27;s day, or the suitable relaxation of mind and body&quot;. However, the faithful remain bound by the obligation to participate in Mass. For these days, colloquially referred to as &quot;working holy days&quot;, churches may have a special schedule, with Mass available outside the normal working hours or on the preceding evening. In times past, holy days would often be referred to as days of single or double precept, with those of double precept requiring the faithful to both attend Mass and to abstain from servile works, whereas days of single precept would permit servile work.

In Ireland, the only holy days of obligation that are also public holidays are Christmas and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Thus, there are five working holy days. Similarly, Slovakia has four holy days of obligation that are also public holidays: Christmas, Solemnity of Mary Mother of God, Epiphany, and All Saints&#x27;, leaving it with five working holy days. In the Netherlands, the bishops conference decreed that, with effect from 1 January 1991, the feasts of the Assumption and All Saints, each of which it had previously decided to celebrate on the following Sunday, were to be of obligation as regards Mass, but not for abstaining from work.

===Observance by country===
In Vatican City, but not in the rest of the Diocese of Rome, Sundays and all 10 days listed in canon 1246 are observed as holy days of obligation. This is also the case in the Diocese of Lugano (covering the Swiss canton of Ticino), but perhaps nowhere else.

Some countries have as holy days of obligation feasts that are not among those listed in canon 1246. Ireland has Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Germany and Hungary have Saint Stephen on the &quot;Second Christmas Day&quot; (26 December), Easter Monday, and Pentecost Monday (Whit Monday).

In countries where they are not holy days of obligation, three of the ten feast days listed above are assigned to a Sunday as their proper day:
*The Feast of the Epiphany to the Sunday that falls between 2 and 8 January; if 6 January falls on Sunday there is no B date,
*The Feast of the Ascension of Our Lord, which always falls on a Thursday, to the following Sunday;
*The Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ to the following Sunday.
If they are thus assigned to a Sunday, they are not included in the following national lists of holy days of obligation, since &quot;in every country all Sundays are holy days of obligation&quot;.

====Argentina====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Assumption of the Virgin Mary
*Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary
*Christmas

====Australia====
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*Christmas

====Austria====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Epiphany
*Feast of the Ascension
*The Body and Blood of Christ
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*All Saints&#x27; Day
*Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*Christmas

====Bahrain====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*St Thomas
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*Birth of our Lady
*Christmas

====Belgium====
*Feast of the Ascension
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*All Saints&#x27; Day
*Christmas

No formal legislative norm of the Episcopal Conference of Belgium exists in which the holy days of obligation are listed. However, the four days mentioned above have been Belgium&#x27;s holy days of obligation since the concordat of 1801 (which itself is not recognized as legally binding in Belgium since independence). Therefore, the current system is in force because of canon 5 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law.

====Brazil====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*The Body and Blood of Christ
*Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary
*Christmas

====Brunei====
*Feast of the Ascension
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*All Saints&#x27; Day
*Christmas

====Canada====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Christmas

====Chile====
* Assumption of the Virgin Mary
* All Saint&#x27;s Day
* Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary
* Christmas
====China====
Since the 1950s, China has not had a bishops&#x27; conference recognized by the Holy See. The current bishops&#x27; conference of China does not include all of the bishops of the country, as &#x27;underground&#x27; bishops without state approval are not included. Possessing a recognized bishops&#x27; conference is a prerequisite in canon law for moving feast days or removing their obligation on a permanent basis, as the bishops&#x27; conference must receive permission from the Holy See to do either. Otherwise bishops and pastors only have the authority to suspend an obligation on a case-by-case basis. An online source published by the Archdiocese of Beijing recites the canon law verbatim (including all 10 feast days in the general calendar) in answer to the question of &#x27;what feast days must be observed&#x27; without any mention of days that are cancelled or moved.

However, this situation only exists in mainland China. In the Diocese of Hong Kong, Christmas is the only holy day of obligation. The same seems to be true for Taiwan. In the diocese of Macau, the holy days of obligations are the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Christmas, and the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.

====Colombia====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary
*Christmas

====Croatia====
*Feast of Corpus Christi
*Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
*All Saints&#x27; Day
*Christmas

====Czech Republic====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Christmas

In Czech Republic, holy days of obligation are, by Czech Bishops&#x27; Conference, reduced to only two days, which are also public holidays in the Czech Republic&#x27; Since the other holy days of obligation mentioned in the Code of Canon Law are not public holidays, the Czech Bishops&#x27; Conference does not make attendance at Mass obligatory for Catholics, but only recommends it, as it does also on the feast days of Saints Cyril and Methodius (5 July) and Saint Wenceslas (28 September). Attendance at Mass is of course obligatory on all Sundays.

According to a 1984 decision of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales, holydays which fall on a Saturday or a Monday (with the exception of Christmas) are transferred to the adjacent Sunday. In 2006, the Epiphany, Ascension and Corpus Christi were transferred to the nearest Sunday. On 17 November 2016 meeting in Leeds, the Bishops&#x27; Conference determined that the Epiphany and the Ascension should be celebrated on their official days, or on the adjacent Sunday when 6 January is a Saturday or a Monday. This decision was approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and became effective from 3 December 2017.

There are different regulations for Scotland and for Ireland.

The solemnities of Saint Joseph, Saints Peter and Paul and the Immaculate Conception of Mary are observed nowhere in Germany as holy days of obligation – these days are also not usually transferred to a Sunday (though for Sts. Peter and Paul, this is theoretically possible). Attendance at the liturgical service on Good Friday, a public holiday, is also generally observed, although it is not a holy day of obligation.

In most of the United States, the Ascension is transferred to the following Sunday (which would otherwise be the Seventh Sunday of Easter). It is only celebrated as a holy day of obligation on Thursday in the ecclesiastical provinces of Boston, Hartford, New York, Omaha, and Philadelphia, as well as by members of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter.

According to a complementary norm issued by the USCCB, &quot;Whenever January 1, the solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, or August 15, the solemnity of the Assumption, or November 1, the solemnity of All Saints, falls on a Saturday or on a Monday, the precept to attend Mass is abrogated.&quot;

In years when December 8 falls on Sunday, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception is normally transferred to December 9, as it is outranked by the Second Sunday of Advent. In this case, as of the Vatican&#x27;s 4 September 2024 letter, the precept to attend Mass is transferred to December 9 as well. Under the 1960 Code of Rubrics, still observed by some in accordance with &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, the feast of the Immaculate Conception has precedence even over an Advent Sunday and is not transferred.

In Hawaii, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and Christmas are the only Holy Days of Obligation, as decreed by the Bishop of Honolulu in 1992, pursuant to an indult from the Holy See and as approved by the national episcopal conference.

==== Uruguay ====
* Epiphany
* Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary
* Christmas

====Venezuela====
*Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
*Christmas

====Vietnam====
The Ecclesiastical Province of Hanoi observes the following four holy days of obligation, known as the &quot;Four Seasons&quot; ():

* Christmas
* Feast of the Ascension
* Assumption of Mary into Heaven
* All Saints&#x27; Day

The Ecclesiastical Provinces of and of Ho Chi Minh City only observe one recurring holy day of obligation, Christmas. Individual dioceses may observe additional holy days of obligation on an ad hoc basis.

==Eastern Catholic Churches==
The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO) lays down the relevant norms regarding holy days of obligations for Eastern Catholic Churches. There are five holy days of obligation, beyond Sundays, specified as common to all of the Eastern Churches:

*The Solemnity of the Nativity of the Lord (Christmas)
*The Epiphany
*The Ascension
*The Holy Apostles Peter and Paul
*The Dormition of Holy Mary, the Mother of God

The CCEO provides that only the &quot;supreme authority&quot; of the Church can &quot;establish, transfer or suppress feast days and days of penance which are common to all of the Eastern Churches,&quot; although the particular law of a &quot;sui juris&quot; Church can suppress one of these days or transfer it to Sunday, provided that said particular law has been approved by the Apostolic See. The authority competent to establish the particular law of a &quot;sui iuris&quot; Church may constitute, transfer, or suppress other feast days and days of penance (i.e., ones that are not common to all the Eastern Churches), under certain conditions.

The faithful of the Eastern Catholic Churches &quot;are bound by the obligation to participate on Sundays and feast days in the Divine Liturgy or, according to the prescriptions or legitimate customs of their own Church sui iuris, in the celebration of the divine praises.&quot;

<doc id="301950" wikidata="Q17009341" url="?curid=301950" title="Distributed-element model">
<text>In electrical engineering, the distributed-element model or transmission-line model of electrical circuits assumes that the attributes of the circuit (resistance, capacitance, and inductance) are distributed continuously throughout the material of the circuit. This is in contrast to the more common lumped-element model, which assumes that these values are lumped into electrical components that are joined by perfectly conducting wires. In the distributed-element model, each circuit element is infinitesimally small, and the wires connecting elements are not assumed to be perfect conductors; that is, they have impedance. Unlike the lumped-element model, it assumes nonuniform current along each branch and nonuniform voltage along each wire. 

The distributed model is used where the wavelength becomes comparable to the physical dimensions of the circuit, making the lumped model inaccurate. This occurs at high frequencies, where the wavelength is very short, or on low-frequency, but very long, transmission lines such as overhead power lines.

==Applications==
The distributed-element model is more accurate but more complex than the lumped-element model. The use of infinitesimals will often require the application of calculus, whereas circuits analysed by the lumped-element model can be solved with linear algebra. The distributed model is consequently usually only applied when accuracy calls for its use. The location of this point is dependent on the accuracy required in a specific application, but essentially, it needs to be used in circuits where the wavelengths of the signals have become comparable to the physical dimensions of the components. An often-quoted engineering rule of thumb (not to be taken too literally because there are many exceptions) is that parts larger than one-tenth of a wavelength will usually need to be analysed as distributed elements.

===Transmission lines===
Transmission lines are a common example of the use of the distributed model. Its use is dictated because the length of the line will usually be many wavelengths of the circuit&#x27;s operating frequency. Even for the low frequencies used on power transmission lines, one-tenth of a wavelength is still only about 500 kilometres at 60 Hz. Transmission lines are usually represented in terms of the primary line constants as shown in figure 1. From this model, the behaviour of the circuit is described by the secondary line constants, which can be calculated from the primary ones.

The primary line constants are normally taken to be constant with position along the line leading to a particularly simple analysis and model. However, this is not always the case, variations in physical dimensions along the line will cause variations in the primary constants, that is, they have now to be described as functions of distance. Most often, such a situation represents an unwanted deviation from the ideal, such as a manufacturing error, however, there are a number of components where such longitudinal variations are deliberately introduced as part of the function of the component. A well-known example of this is the horn antenna.

Where reflections are present on the line, quite short lengths of line can exhibit effects that are simply not predicted by the lumped-element model. A quarter wavelength line, for instance, will transform the terminating impedance into its dual. This can be a wildly different impedance.

===High-frequency transistors===

Another example of the use of distributed elements is in the modelling of the base region of a bipolar junction transistor at high frequencies. The analysis of charge carriers crossing the base region is inaccurate when the base region is simply treated as a lumped element. A more successful model is a simplified transmission line model, which includes the base material&#x27;s distributed bulk resistance and the substrate&#x27;s distributed capacitance. This model is represented in figure 2.

===Resistivity measurements===

In many situations, it is desired to measure resistivity of bulk material by applying an electrode array at the surface. Amongst the fields that use this technique are geophysics (because it avoids having to dig into the substrate) and the semiconductor industry (for the similar reason that it is non-intrusive) for testing bulk silicon wafers. The basic arrangement is shown in figure 3, although normally, more electrodes would be used. To form a relationship between the voltage and current measured on the one hand, and the material&#x27;s resistivity on the other, it is necessary to apply the distributed-element model by considering the material to be an array of infinitesimal resistor elements. Unlike the transmission line example, the need to apply the distributed-element model arises from the geometry of the setup, and not from any wave propagation considerations.

The model used here needs to be truly 3-dimensional (transmission line models are usually described by elements of a one-dimensional line). It is also possible that the resistances of the elements will be functions of the coordinates, indeed, in the geophysical application, it may well be that regions of changed resistivity are the very things that it is desired to detect.
===Inductor windings===

Another example where a simple one-dimensional model will not suffice is the windings of an inductor. Coils of wire have capacitance between adjacent turns (and more remote turns as well, but the effect progressively diminishes). For a single-layer solenoid, the distributed capacitance will mostly lie between adjacent turns, as shown in figure 4, between turns T1 and T2, but for multiple-layer windings and more accurate models distributed capacitance to other turns must also be considered. This model is fairly difficult to deal with in simple calculations and, for the most part, is avoided. The most common approach is to roll up all the distributed capacitance into one lumped element in parallel with the inductance and resistance of the coil. This lumped model works successfully at low frequencies but falls apart at high frequencies where the usual practice is to simply measure (or specify) an overall &quot;Q&quot; for the inductor without associating a specific equivalent circuit.

<text>Veld ( or , Afrikaans and Dutch: &quot;veld&quot;, field), also spelled veldt, is a type of wide-open, rural landscape in Southern Africa. Particularly, it is a flat area covered in grass or low scrub, especially in the countries of South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. A certain subtropical woodland ecoregion of Southern Africa has been officially defined as the Bushveld by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Trees are not abundant; frost, fire, and grazing animals allow grass to grow, but prevent the build-up of dense foliage.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;veld&quot; () comes from the Afrikaans word for &quot;field&quot;.

The etymological origin is older modern Dutch &quot;veldt&quot;, a spelling that the Dutch abandoned in favour of &quot;veld&quot; during the 19th century, decades before the first Afrikaans dictionary. A cognate to the English &quot;field&quot;, it was spelt &quot;velt&quot; in Middle Dutch and &quot;felt&quot; in Old Dutch.

==Climate==

The climate of the veld is highly variable, but its general pattern is mild winters from May to September and hot or very hot summers from November to March, with moderate or considerable variations in daily temperatures and abundant sunshine. Precipitation mostly occurs in the summers in the form of high-energy thunderstorms.

Over most of the South African Highveld, the average annual rainfall is between a year, decreasing to about near the western border and increasing to nearly in some parts of the Lesotho Highlands; the South African lowveld generally receives more precipitation than the highveld. Temperature is closely related to elevation. In general, the mean July (winter) temperatures range between in the Lesotho highlands and in the lowveld. January (summer) temperatures range between .

In Zimbabwe, precipitation averages around on the highveld, dropping to less than in the lowest areas of the Lowveld. Temperatures are slightly higher than in South Africa.

Over the entire veld, seasonal and annual average rainfall variations of up to 40% are common. Damaging drought affects at least half the area about once every three or four years; it reduces plant and animal biomass to sustainable levels again. Everywhere, the average number of hours of annual sunshine varies from 60 to 80% of the total amount possible.

== Definitions==
=== Highveld and lowveld ===

==== Highveld ====

Much of the interior of Southern Africa consists of a high plateau, the higher portions of which are known as the highveld, starting at the Drakensberg escarpment, to the east of Johannesburg and sloping gradually downwards to the west and southwest, as well as to the north, through the bushveld towards the Limpopo River.
These higher, cooler areas (generally more than above sea level) are characterised by flat or gently undulating terrain, vast grasslands, and a modified tropical or subtropical climate. To the east, the highveld&#x27;s border is marked by the Great Escarpment, or the Mpumalanga Drakensberg. Still, the boundary is often arbitrary and not apparent in the other directions. The blesbok and quagga were among the large animals that once roamed on the highveld in great numbers. Nowadays, a sizeable population of springbok still occurs in some areas.Much of the area, though, is devoted to Balls farming and South Africa&#x27;s largest conurbation (Gauteng Province).

==== Lowveld ====
The lowlands, below about altitude, along South Africa&#x27;s northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe, where a 180-million-year-old failed rift valley cuts into Southern Africa&#x27;s central plateau and locally obliterates the Great Escarpment, is known as the lowveld. The Limpopo and Save Rivers run from the central African highlands via the lowveld into the Indian Ocean to the east. The Limpopo lowveld extends southwards, east of the Drakensberg Escarpment through Mpumalanga Province and ultimately into eastern Eswatini. This southern limb of the lowveld is bounded by South Africa&#x27;s border with Mozambique to the east and the northeastern part of Drakensberg to the west. This region is generally hotter and less intensely cultivated than the highveld. Until the mid-20th century, the lowveld was still infested by the tsetse fly, which transmits the sleeping sickness called &quot;nagana&quot; among the Zulus.

=== Thornveld ===
Thornveld (also thorn veld or thornveldt), often referred to as &quot;acacia thornveld&quot;, is a type of semiarid savanna in which grassland with thorny &quot;Acacia&quot; and certain species of thorny bushes predominate. The predominant plant species are usually different in the thornveld of the plains or in the hill thornveld, where, for example, species of genus &quot;Balanites&quot; are common. Some of the characteristic species in the thornveld include:
*Grasses: Grass species belonging to genera &quot;Themeda&quot; and&quot; Hyparrhenia&quot;
*Trees and bushes: Genera &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Rhus&quot;, such as &quot;Acacia afra&quot;, &quot;Acacia sieberiana&quot;, and &quot;Rhus pentheri&quot;, and other species such as &quot;Ziziphus mucronata&quot;, &quot;Ehretia rigida&quot;, and &quot;Cussonia spicata&quot;.

=== Sandveld and hardveld ===

==== Sandveld ====
Sandveld, in the general sense of the word, is a type of veld characterised by dry, sandy soil, typical of certain areas of the Southern African region. It usually absorbs all water from the seasonal rains, although aquatic habitats, largely seasonal, may be also found in specific places in the sandveld. Only certain hardy plant species thrive in the sandveld environment. These consist especially of grasses forming clumps and certain kinds of trees and shrubs. The sandveld vegetation has a particular pattern of growth, rarely covering the whole terrain, thus leaving patches of sandy soil exposed on the surface. Some of the typical sandveld species are &quot;Acacia haematoxylon&quot;, &quot;A. luederitzii&quot;, &quot;Boscia albitrunca&quot;, &quot;Terminalia sericea&quot;, &quot;Lonchocarpus nelsii&quot;, &quot;Bauhinia petersiana&quot;, and &quot;Baphia massaiensis&quot;.

==== Hardveld ====
Hardveld is a term applied to certain rocky soil areas in Botswana, mostly in the eastern part of the country. The landscape is an undulating plain with scattered rocky hill ranges. Areas of hardveld also occur in South Africa in the mountainous central Kamiesberg of the Northern Cape with hilly escarpments and deep river valleys. The soil of the hardveld is characterised by rocky outcrops and an abundance of stones and pebbles of different shapes and sizes.

The flora of the hardveld is typical of rocky savanna, with denser vegetation, so fewer denuded patches than in the sandveld, as well as taller trees. Also, a higher diversity of species is seen in the hardveld compared with the sandveld. &quot;Peltophorum africanum&quot;, &quot;Acacia nigrescens&quot;, &quot;A. tortilis&quot;, &quot;Combretum apiculatum&quot;, and &quot;Colophospermum mopane&quot; are some of the representative species of the northern hardveld.

<doc id="301953" wikidata="Q470779" url="?curid=301953" title="Kinji Fukasaku">
<text>was a Japanese film director and screenwriter. Known for his &quot;broad range and innovative filmmaking&quot;, Fukasaku worked in many different genres and styles, but was best known for his gritty yakuza films, typified by the &quot;Battles Without Honor and Humanity&quot; series (1973–1976). According to the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, &quot;his turbulent energy and at times extreme violence express a cynical critique of social conditions and genuine sympathy for those left out of Japan&#x27;s postwar prosperity.&quot; He used a &quot;cinema verite&quot;-inspired shaky camera technique in many of his films from the early 1970s.

Fukasaku wrote and directed over 60 films between 1961 and 2003. Some Western sources have associated him with the Japanese New Wave movement of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, but this belies his commercial success. His works include the Japanese portion of the Hollywood war film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), &quot;jidaigeki&quot; such as &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Samurai&quot; (1978), the space opera &quot;Message from Space&quot; (1978), the post-apocalyptic science fiction film &quot;Virus&quot; (1980), the fantasy film &quot;Samurai Reincarnation&quot; (1981), and the influential dystopian thriller &quot;Battle Royale&quot; (2000).

Fukasaku won the Japan Academy Film Prize for Director of the Year three times, out of nine total nominations. He served as President of the Directors Guild of Japan from 1996, until his death from prostate cancer in 2003. In 1997, he received the Purple Medal of Honor from the Japanese government for his work in film. His films have inspired directors such as Quentin Tarantino, William Friedkin, and John Woo.

==Early life==
Kinji Fukasaku was born in 1930 in Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture as the youngest of five children. When he was 15 years old, Fukasaku&#x27;s class was drafted, and he worked as a munitions worker during World War II. In July 1945, the class was caught in bombing. Since the children could not escape the bombs, they had to dive under each other in order to survive. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. After the war, he spent much of his time watching foreign films.

==Career==
Fukasaku studied cinema at Nihon University, in the country&#x27;s first film department, before switching to the literature department for scriptwriting his junior year. There he studied under Kogo Noda and Katsuhito Inomata. After graduating in 1953, Fukasaku became an assistant director at Toei in June 1954, where he worked under people such as Masahiro Makino and Yasushi Sasaki.

Fukasaku made his directorial debut in 1961 with the two featurettes &quot;Drifting Detective: Tragedy in the Red Valley&quot; and &quot;Drifting Detective: Black Wind in the Harbor&quot;, starring Sonny Chiba. His first feature-length film for the New Toei subsidiary was &quot;High Noon for Gangsters&quot; that same year. His first film produced in color was &quot;Gang vs. G-Men&quot; (1962). His first film for the Toei Company proper was &quot;The Proud Challenge&quot; the following year starring Kōji Tsuruta. He had his breakthrough hit in 1964 with Ken Takakura starring in &quot;Jakoman and Tetsu&quot;. From 1966 to 1971, he created several modern gang films for Toei usually starring Tsuruta, such as &quot;Ceremony of Disbanding&quot; (1967), &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Farewell&quot; (1968), and &quot;Japan Organized Crime Boss&quot; (1969).

Thanks to a non-exclusive contract, he also directed &quot;Black Lizard&quot;, based on Yukio Mishima&#x27;s stage adaptation of the Edogawa Rampo novel, and &quot;Black Rose Mansion&quot; for Shochiku both of which starred the transvestite actor Akihiro Miwa. In 1968 he directed &quot;The Green Slime&quot;, a United States-Japan science fiction co-production.

In 1970, Fukasaku was recruited to direct the Japanese portion of another US-Japan film, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, after Akira Kurosawa pulled out. Using his pay from the project, he bought the rights to adapt &quot;Under the Flag of the Rising Sun&quot;. The movie was critically acclaimed, even being selected as Japan&#x27;s entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 45th Academy Awards in 1972, although it was not accepted as a nominee. That year also saw the release of &quot;Street Mobster&quot; starring Bunta Sugawara, which resulted in Toei producer Koji Shundo selecting Fukasaku to direct a groundbreaking yakuza film. &quot;Battles Without Honor and Humanity&quot; was released in 1973. Up to this point, Japan&#x27;s many yakuza films had usually been tales of chivalry set in the pre-war period, but Fukasaku&#x27;s ultra-violent, documentary-style film took place in chaotic post-War Hiroshima. A commercial and critical success, it gave rise to seven sequels by Fukasaku and three movies that are based on the series but directed by others. After directing several more yakuza films, &quot;Graveyard of Honor&quot; (1975), &quot;Cops vs. Thugs&quot; (1975), &quot;Yakuza Graveyard&quot; (1976), and &quot;Hokuriku Proxy War&quot; (1977), Fukasaku left the genre.

He focused on historical epics; &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Samurai&quot; (1978), &quot;The Fall of Ako Castle&quot; (1978), &quot;Samurai Reincarnation&quot; (1981); and science fiction; &quot;Message from Space&quot; (1978) and &quot;Virus&quot; (1980). &quot;Virus&quot; was Japan&#x27;s most expensive production at the time, and became a financial flop. However, two years later he directed the acclaimed comedy &quot;Fall Guy&quot;, which won both the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year. Fukasaku was chosen to direct &quot;Violent Cop&quot; (1989), but a scheduling conflict caused him to pull out and Takeshi Kitano took over in his first directorial role.

In 2000, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was released. The film received positive critical praise and became a major financial success, grossing ¥3.11 billion domestically. It became a cultural phenomenon, creating the battle royale genre, a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment in which a select group of people are instructed to kill each other off until there is a triumphant survivor. Near the end of his life, Fukasaku branched out into the world of video games by serving as the director of the Capcom/Sunsoft survival horror game &quot;Clock Tower 3&quot; (2002).

Fukasaku announced he had prostate cancer in September 2002. In late December 2002, shortly after filming began on &quot;Battle Royale II: Requiem&quot;, he was hospitalized when his condition worsened. Fukasaku died at a Tokyo hospital on 12 January 2003, aged 72. Having directed only a single scene, his son, Kenta took over the film.

<doc id="301956" wikidata="Q5582789" url="?curid=301956" title="Good Morning Mr. Zip-Zip-Zip!">
<text>&quot;Good Morning Mr. Zip-Zip-Zip&quot; is a ragtime song published as sheet music in 1918 by Leo Feist Inc. of New York City. It was one of the most popular tunes with United States soldiers during the World War I era.

The song appears to salute American soldiers, although some have suggested that it has a more cynical meaning, in that it criticizes their transformation into an identical, conforming mass.

==Background and composition==

According to the sheet music, it was &quot;written around a Fort Niagara fragment&quot; by Robert Lloyd, &quot;Army song leader.&quot; Sheet music was available for piano, band, orchestra, and male quartette as well as for talking machine or player piano.

In 1918, both Victor Records (VI18510) and Columbia Records (A-2530) issued recordings of the song by Arthur Fields and the Peerless Quartet. The musical score was reprinted in a war edition.

==Lyric==

We come from ev&#x27;ry quarter,&lt;br&gt;
From North, South, East and West,&lt;br&gt;
To clear the way to freedom&lt;br&gt;
For the land we love the best.&lt;br&gt;
We&#x27;ve left our occupations&lt;br&gt;
and home, so far and dear,&lt;br&gt;
But when the going&#x27;s rather rough,&lt;br&gt;
We raise this song in cheer:

[chorus: repeat twice]&lt;br&gt;
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,&lt;br&gt;
With your hair cut just as short as mine,&lt;br&gt;
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,&lt;br&gt;
You&#x27;re surely looking fine!&lt;br&gt;
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,&lt;br&gt;
If the Camels don&#x27;t get you,&lt;br&gt;
The Fatimas must,&lt;br&gt;
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,&lt;br&gt;
With your hair cut just as short as,&lt;br&gt;
your hair cut just as short as,&lt;br&gt;
your hair cut just as short as mine.

You see them on the highway,&lt;br&gt;
You meet them down the pike,&lt;br&gt;
In olive drab and khaki&lt;br&gt;
Are soldiers on the hike;&lt;br&gt;
And as the column passes,&lt;br&gt;
The word goes down the line,&lt;br&gt;
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,&lt;br&gt;
You&#x27;re surely looking fine.

[repeat chorus twice]

<text>Superboy is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. These characters have been featured in several eponymous comic series, in addition to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and other series featuring teenage superhero groups.

From the character&#x27;s first published story in 1944 until 1992, the title &quot;Superboy&quot; was applied to versions of the adventures of Superman as a boy, teenager or young adult. The primary settings for the stories were the fictional town of Smallville, the 30th Century (where Superboy featured in time travel adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes) and universities attended by Clark Kent. In 1993, a second Superboy was introduced, a young clone of Superman who was eventually given both the name Kon-El and the secret identity of Conner Kent. In 2016, DC Comics introduced another Superboy, Jon Kent, the son of Superman and his wife Lois Lane.

Superboy was the first superhero to star in a successful solo title after World War II. During the Silver Age of Comic Books, Superboy was frequently the #2 best-selling superhero, with monthly issues of &quot;Superboy&quot; and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; regularly selling over a million combined copies. Superboy and its subsequent adaptations have been credited with popularizing the prequel as a form of entertainment.

Versions of the characters have appeared in animation, films and television series, including &quot;Superboy&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;.

== Publication history ==
=== Creation (1938–1944) ===
In November 1938, Jerry Siegel proposed to Detective Comics, Inc. (the forerunner of DC Comics) that he do stories of Superman&#x27;s childhood adventures, with the character calling himself &quot;Superboy&quot;. Detective rejected Siegel&#x27;s pitch. In December 1940, Siegel pitched the idea again with a complete script for the first story, but Detective did not respond within the contractual six weeks. An ashcan comic was produced in 1942 in order to secure the Superboy trademark.

In 1944, while Siegel was serving in the US Army in Hawaii, Detective Comics published a Superboy story in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #101 (cover dated January–February 1945), in an effort to expand the Superman franchise by presenting a version of the character to whom younger readers could easily relate. The story was partially based on the script Siegel had submitted in 1940, and was illustrated by Superman co-creator Joe Shuster. Detective had done this without informing Siegel; he learned about it in a letter from Shuster.

=== &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; (1944–1945) ===
The first Superboy stories were published as bi-monthly features in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; issues #101–107 (cover dated January–February 1945 – January–February 1946). Except for the origin story by Siegel, the issues were written by Don Cameron. Art was provided primarily by Joe Shuster and inked by Ira Yarbrough, Martin Stein, and John Sikela.

=== &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (1946–1969) ===
In early 1946, Superboy moved to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, where he debuted in issue #103 (April 1946) as the lead feature for the anthology comic, and he remained the headlining feature for over 200 issues. Notable stories appearing in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; included the introduction of Krypto the Super-Dog; the story of how his friend, the teenage scientist Lex Luthor, became his most bitter foe; and the debut of the 30th-century superhero team the Legion of Super-Heroes, initially founded as a Superboy fan club.

The popular Legion spun off from Superboy into its own feature, which debuted in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #300 (Sept. 1962). The feature soon dominated the comic, with the last standalone Superboy story appearing in #315 (Dec. 1963). Superboy continued to appear in reprinted stories and as a member of the Legion until the Legion&#x27;s final issue, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #380 (May 1969). Throughout the 1960s, issues of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; sold over 400,000 copies each, with a peak of over 480,000 in 1966.

==== &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (Volume 1) ====
In 1973, DC Comics published &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, a series that reprinted earlier Superboy and Legion stories from &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. The series was published from February–August of that year, and ended after four issues.

=== &quot;Superboy&quot; (1949–1976) ===
Four years after his debut, Superboy became only the sixth DC superhero to receive his own comic book when &quot;Superboy&quot; #1 (March–April 1949) was published. The series became the first new DC superhero title to succeed since World War II. &quot;Superboy&quot; saw the debuts of the first Superbaby story, (about Clark&#x27;s adventures as a super-powered toddler), and of Clark&#x27;s two closest friends: Lana Lang, who also serves as a romantic interest for Superboy; and Pete Ross, who later discovers and helps protect Clark&#x27;s secret identity. Other notable stories to appear in &quot;Superboy&quot; include the story of the first Bizarro and the first appearances of Legion of Super-Heroes members Mon-El and Ultra Boy.

Beginning with issue #197, magazine covers carried the subtitle &quot;Starring the Legion of Super-Heroes.&quot; Beginning with issue #222, the indicia changed to &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes,&quot; with the change becoming the official title in issue #231&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (1976–1979) ===
The series was renamed and ran as a Superboy and Legion team-up title until issue #258. In issue #259, a villain named Psycho-Warrior revealed details to Clark Kent about his parents&#x27; deaths when he caused him to crash into the Metropolis Superman Museum. (In previous stories, Superboy had avoided the museum in order to avoid learning too much about his own future.) With Saturn Girl&#x27;s prompting, Clark decided not to return to the 30th century again until adulthood. Beginning with issue #259, whose cover showed a tearful Superboy leaving the rest of the Legion, the series was retitled &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 2) and remained a Legion comic until its final issue, #354.

==== &quot;Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; ====
In 1981, DC Comics published a three-part miniseries retelling the early origins of the Legion of Super-Heroes and its benefactor R.J. Brande. The limited series was written by E. Nelson Bridwell and Paul Kupperberg.

=== &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; (1980–1984) ===
In 1980, DC Comics published &quot;Superboy Spectacular&quot;, a one-shot that was the first comic to be distributed only to comic book stores through the direct market. The issue contained reprints and one new story by E. Nelson Bridwell and Curt Swan.

Also in 1980, DC began publication of &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy.&quot; It ran for 54 issues.

=== &quot;Superman: The Secret Years&quot; (1985) ===
Written by Bob Rozakis with art by Curt Swan, Kurt Schaeffenberger, and cover art by Frank Miller, the four-issue miniseries explored Clark Kent&#x27;s transition from Superboy to Superman during his college years at Metropolis University. Rozakis had begun a backup feature called &quot;The Inbetween Years&quot; in Superman #359, but the feature was cancelled after six installments following issue #374. Originally pitched as a 12-issue series that was cut short by the publication of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the series retold the story of the day that Clark Kent left Smallville, his first meeting with Lori Lemaris, and introduced Clark&#x27;s college roommates &quot;Ducky&quot; and Billy, who ultimately met with tragedy.

=== &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; Volume 3 (1986–1987) ===
Following the erasure of Superboy&#x27;s history in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, another version of Clark Kent was created in order to salvage the Legion&#x27;s timeline. This version was created by the villain Time Trapper in a &quot;pocket universe&quot; that contained only a version of the planets Earth and Krypton. Whenever the Legionnaires traveled back in time, they were re-routed and traveled to the 20th century of the pocket universe; from birth until &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Superboy&#x27;s life was similar to the life of the original Clark Kent. When the universe-destroying &quot;Crisis&quot; struck, Superboy lacked the power to save his Earth, but the Time Trapper agreed to do so, provided that Kal-El helped him capture the Legion, and Superboy reluctantly agreed. After a battle with the New Earth Superman, Superboy realized he could not turn on his friends and instead helped the Legionnaires defeat the Trapper. Ultimately Superboy saved his Earth, but only at the cost of his own life. His dying act was to return the Legion to their century (and Earth), where he was later buried.

This Superboy first appeared in issue #23 and died in issue #38. After his death, his grieving parents revealed to the world that their son had been Superboy. 

=== &quot;Superboy&quot; Volume 2 (1988–1992) ===
Conceived as additional episodes of the &quot;Superboy&quot; TV series that began in 1988, the series followed the college adventures of Clark Kent and ran for 22 issues in 1990–1991. Originally entitled &quot;Superboy&quot; (volume 2) (as shown in the indicia), the cover logo read &quot;Superboy: The Comic Book&quot; from #1–10. After issue #10, the series was retitled &quot;The Adventures of Superboy&quot; until its cancellation. A follow-up story titled &quot;The Last Superboy&quot; was published in the one-shot &quot;Adventures of Superboy Special&quot; in 1992, with art by Curt Swan. The stories in Superboy Vol. 2 were later stated to have occurred on Earth-988, in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths: The Compendium&quot; (2005).

=== &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; (1993) ===
A new Superboy, a teenage clone of Superman created by the genetic engineering corporation Project Cadmus, was introduced during the &quot;Death of Superman&quot; storyline in the 1990s. While he possessed many of Superman&#x27;s abilities, Superboy was initially brash and impulsive.

=== &quot;Superboy&quot; Volume 4 (1994–2002) ===
This series featured the clone of Superman and his adventures as part of Project Cadmus. In &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #1 (February 1994), the new Superboy settled in Hawaii with his supporting cast, becoming Hawaii&#x27;s resident superhero for the next four years until &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #48 (February 1998). Starting in &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #56 (November 1998), Superboy returned &quot;home&quot; when he began working for Project Cadmus. In &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #59 (February 1999), Superman gave him the Kryptonian name Kon-El and his secret identity of Josh Leslie Kent, in effect making him part of the El family. After leaving Project Cadmus and living on his own for a brief time in Metropolis, at Superman&#x27;s suggestion Kon-El went to live with Martha and Jonathan Kent in Smallville, where he adopted a secret identity as their nephew (and Clark&#x27;s cousin) Conner Kent. &quot;(Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #100 (July 2002))

==== &quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; ====
&quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; was an American comic book series that ran for 19 issues, from September 1996 to March 1998. The comic book chronicled the adventures of Superboy and a group of superhumans called the Ravers.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Kal-El===
==== Clark Kent becomes Superboy ====
On his eighth birthday, Clark dons an indestructible costume woven by Martha from the Kryptonian blankets that accompanied him on his journey to Earth. He becomes the costumed hero Superboy, the first superhero of Earth-One. Around the same time as his public debut, Superboy learns of his Kryptonian origin, and several weeks later, he gives reporter Perry White the exclusive story about his alien background. Though most of Superboy&#x27;s early adventures occur in the vicinity of Smallville, he becomes famous for his superheroics around the globe. Superboy&#x27;s status as both Smallville&#x27;s hometown hero and as a national/global hero are reflected in the emergency-signal system that he establishes with Chief Parker of the Smallville Police and the President of the United States. As Superboy repeatedly ventures into interstellar space, his super-heroics also bring him fame on other worlds.

In Smallville, Superboy uses tunnels from the basement of the Kents&#x27; house and general store to make quick, concealed exits when Superboy is needed. Superboy also maintains a secret lab in the basement of the Kent house, where he builds Superboy and Clark Kent robots to cover for him when he is busy elsewhere or otherwise unavailable.

Clark&#x27;s mild-mannered character gives him few friends as a boy, and makes him the target of bullies like Bash Bashford. For years, Clark&#x27;s closest friend is his beautiful red-headed neighbor, Lana Lang. Despite their friendship, Lana is also a major nuisance in Clark&#x27;s life because of her recurring suspicion that Clark is secretly Superboy. Through clever use of his super-powers and robot duplicates of himself (in both identities), Clark is always able to avoid the traps Lana sets for him in order to determine the truth. For all that Lana&#x27;s antics annoy Clark, as a teenager, Lana becomes Superboy&#x27;s main romantic interest, and remains so through his years in high school.

As Superboy, Kal-El is the first of Earth&#x27;s superheroes. Despite the occasional appearance of heroes like Aquaboy and the Japanese hero Sunburst, Superboy is the only superhero who has a well-known public profile until after he becomes Superman. Superboy&#x27;s solitary status is reduced somewhat when he is reunited with Krypto, infant Kal-El&#x27;s pet dog on Krypton. Krypto joins Superboy in many of his subsequent adventures as his canine partner, and also has many adventures of his own. Through his discovery of the Phantom Zone, Superboy later finds out he is not the lone humanoid survivor of Krypton.

==== Superboy joins the Legion ====
Though Superboy encounters few super-powered peers on Earth, he occasionally befriends teens living on other worlds that have superpowers. Not until Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, and Lightning Lad come into the past to recruit him for the thirtieth-century Legion of Super-Heroes does Superboy find a group of super-powered friends with whom he regularly interacts. Superboy&#x27;s career in fact is the inspiration for the formation of the Legion. Throughout his teenage years, Superboy travels to the future under his own power to join the Legion in fighting threats to Earth and the United Planets, to which Earth belongs. Superboy becomes a core member of the Legion during two extended, full membership stints in the Legion, including two terms as Deputy Leader. Through the Legion, Superboy also regularly meets with his cousin Kara, Supergirl, but because of telepathic hypnotism employed by Saturn Girl, Superboy never remembers Kara, or any other information relating to his future career as Superman or the future of his family and friends, when he returns to his normal, 20th-century era.

One of the youths who becomes a member of the Legion is Lar Gand, a teenager whom Superboy first knows as Mon-El when he crash-lands on Earth in Superboy&#x27;s era. The teenager, who has powers identical to Superboy, initially has amnesia, and because he carries a message from Jor-El, Superboy believes him to be his big brother and dubs him Mon-El. When Mon-El is exposed to lead, his memory returns. He reveals that he is actually a Daxamite named Lar Gand, and for Daxamites, lead is more deadly than Kryptonite. To save his life, Superboy projects Mon-El into the Phantom Zone, where Mon-El would linger for a millennium before being freed by the Legion. In the Legion, the two teens remain close friends. The alternate Superboy from the Pocket Universe would die in Mon-El&#x27;s arms.

==== Superboy meets Lex Luthor ====
Not long after he joins the Legion, Superboy&#x27;s life is threatened when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, who also happens to be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy&#x27;s weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville&#x27;s residents; however, each invention of Lex&#x27;s winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy&#x27;s (and then Superman&#x27;s) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.

Around the time Mon-El arrives on Earth, a boy named Pete Ross moves to Smallville. He quickly befriends Clark Kent, and the two boys are soon best friends. One night on a camping trip, Pete accidentally spies Clark changing into his Superboy outfit. Vowing to keep his knowledge a secret, Pete uses his knowledge to aid Superboy and on several occasions, save his life. Not until years after they have both grown up does Pete reveal his knowledge to Clark. Through the rest of his years in high school, Pete and Lana remain Clark&#x27;s closest friends, and also share numerous adventures with Superboy both in the twentieth century and with the Legion in the thirtieth.

==== Superboy becomes Superman ====
Shortly after his graduation from high school, Superboy takes his adoptive parents on a holiday in the Caribbean where they contract a rare tropical disease. Though Superboy tries valiantly to save Martha and Jonathan, nothing cures their illness. With Clark by her side, Martha passes away. Just before he dies, Jonathan makes Clark promise to use his powers only for good. In mourning, Clark buries his parents. Shortly thereafter, Superboy leaves Smallville, though not before throwing the townsfolk a giant farewell party that he tops off with a giant cake. Separately, Clark departs for Metropolis to attend Metropolis University.

In Metropolis, Clark readily befriends the students who share his dorm suite, Tommy Lee, Dave Hammond and the alcoholic Ducky Ginsberg. Superboy soon reveals himself as the new guardian of Metropolis, ending a national guessing game about which city Superboy would call his new home. For Clark&#x27;s first two years at Metropolis University, Lana is also a classmate, before she transfers to Hudson University.

In his junior year, Superboy again feels helpless when he is not present to stop an automobile accident involving Ducky, caused by his own drunk driving. Ducky is paralyzed for life and thereafter uses a wheelchair. Ducky&#x27;s place in the dorm is taken by Billy Kramer, a Smallville boy whom Clark befriends and decides to trust with his secret. Much as Superman would later do for Jimmy Olsen, Superboy gives Billy a supersonic whistle that he can use to call Superboy for help when needed. While he is befriending Billy, Clark becomes romantically involved with a wheelchair-using student named Lori Lemaris. He eventually proposes to her, but Lori reveals she already learned his identity telepathically. She rejects his proposal because she is a mermaid from Atlantis.

Trapped in a burning building while attempting to save a life, Billy uses his supersonic whistle to call Superboy, but Superboy, preoccupied with saving a thousand people on a Pacific island from a tsunami, is unable to reach him in time. Upset by his inability to save his parents and friends, Superboy exiles himself until, three months later, Perry White, using Billy&#x27;s whistle, calls him back into action to battle Lex Luthor. After defeating Luthor, Clark makes peace with his limitations and returns to Metropolis for his final year of college. Now 21, Kal-El starts calling himself Superman, 13 years after his debut as Superboy.

==== Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ====
Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Superman did not begin his public superhero career until adulthood. However, as a teenager he joined the Legion of Super-Heroes, and used the name &quot;Superboy&quot; while visiting the 31st century. Thus, most of Kal-El&#x27;s pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; stories with the Legion were once again considered canonical. In addition, Clark wore his Superboy outfit when he works as a clandestine superhero in and around Smallville.

At the conclusion of the Doomsday Clock series, it was revealed that the original Superboy&#x27;s adventures and history were still intact, because the DC Comics&#x27; original Earth-1 had been preserved as &quot;Earth-1985.&quot; Clark&#x27;s history as Superboy was also restored in the main DC Comics universe via the intervention of Doctor Manhattan, saving the Legion of Superheroes&#x27; timeline.

===Kon-El===

In 1993, during DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;Death of Superman&quot; story, a new Superboy was introduced. Unlike previous characters bearing the name, this Superboy is a clone created to replace the seemingly dead Superman, rather than simply being an adolescent Clark Kent. His initial abilities are based on a form of telekinesis (known as &quot;tactile telekinesis&quot;) by which he could fly and simulate Superman&#x27;s strength and invulnerability. Nicknamed &quot;the Kid&quot;, Superboy is distinguished from other &quot;Supermen&quot; who appear after the death of Superman by his youth and brash character. Though he prefers to be called Superman during the Reign of the Supermen, after Superman returns from the dead the Kid accepts the name Superboy for himself and begins his own superhero career. He also learns that he is not a clone of Superman, but rather genetically engineered to be as Kryptonian as possible, although his genes originate from the human DNA of Paul Westfield, director of the government sector known as Project Cadmus that had created the Kid.

====Teen Titans====
In the course of his career, Kon-El becomes involved with several teen superhero groups, notably the Ravers, Young Justice, the Teen Titans, and the Legion of Super-Heroes, and he was featured in comic series devoted to these groups. Through his association with them in both Young Justice and the Teen Titans, Kon-El becomes the best friend of Robin the Boy Wonder, a close friend of Impulse (later Kid Flash), and becomes romantically involved with Wonder Girl.

Sometime before he joins the Teen Titans, Superboy learns that he had been actually created from the DNA of both Superman and a human. Though he had believed that human to be Paul Westfield, after he joins the Teen Titans he learns that the human is actually Superman&#x27;s archnemesis Lex Luthor. Moreover, as the clone Superboy was developing, he was brainwashed so that Luthor could have a sleeper agent among the superhero community. When Luthor unleashes Kon-El, Superboy comes close to destroying the Teen Titans, but he manages to free himself from Luthor&#x27;s control before any tragedy occurs. Shortly thereafter, Kon-El sacrifices his life to save Earth in a battle with Superboy-Prime during the Infinite Crisis. After his death, statues are erected in his honor in Metropolis and Titans Tower. Though he coerced Superboy into serving his own purposes, Luthor continues to claim that he views Kon-El as his son.

In a story published after Kon-El&#x27;s death, the alternate future Titans known as the Titans Tomorrow, including an older Conner who was cloned from the original, come back in time to the present day.

Kon-El returns in the 2019 relaunch of &quot;Young Justice&quot;.

====&quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (volume 2), &quot;Superboy&quot; (volume 4) and (volume 5)====
During the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; storyline, Brainiac 5 resurrects Conner in the 31st century after arranging for him to spend 1,000 years in the Kryptonian regeneration chamber that revived Superman after his battle with Doomsday and introducing into it a hair from Lex Luthor. In the aftermath of &quot;Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, Conner is back in the present, living with Martha Kent and Krypto in Smallville. Superboy starred in his own feature in the revival of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, which began publication in August 2009 (see Superboy of Steel/&quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #1–3 &amp; #5–8). He then moved to his own comic again, with the new series starting up in late 2010 before being canceled in August 2011 at issue #11 and relaunched from issue #1 in September as part of DC Comics&#x27; relaunch of its main DC Universe properties.

===Jon Lane Kent===

DC Comics relaunched &quot;Superboy&quot; with issue #1 in September 2011 as part of The New 52. The series involved major changes to the character, which includes a new origin in which he is cloned from Superman, Lois Lane, and their son Jon Lane Kent from an alternate New 52 timeline.

Similar to Kon-El, who possessed &quot;tactile telekinesis&quot;, Jon is a powerful telekinetic. His telekinesis allows him to levitate and manipulate items around him, and even to analyze anything he touches. This allows him to mimic some of the powers of Superman, such as flight, superhuman strength, and superhuman speed. He can also absorb information about things in his vicinity, cloak himself from sight by bending light around himself, generate force fields, propel nearby objects as a projectile attack, and interfere with nearby machines, among other things. He is also shown to be able to absorb energy from metahumans he kills. Jon&#x27;s psi powers also extend, to a limited degree, to low-level telepathy as well— sufficient to read unprotected minds, which assists him with pretending to be Kon-El even in the presence of Kon-El&#x27;s closest friends. His human-alien hybrid physiology is also a weakness; it causes him constant pain and agony.

====&quot;Superboy&quot; (volume 6)====
In an alternate New 52 future, Superman married Lois Lane and had a son, whom they named Jon Lane Kent. Jon&#x27;s hybrid Kryptonian/human physiology proved to be unstable, causing him to fall ill and die shortly before his fourth birthday. In grief, Superman and Lois retreated to the Fortress of Solitude and were never heard from again.

However, this death was not the end for Jon. A time traveler from the 30th century, the man who would later be known as Harvest, arrived and retrieved Jon&#x27;s body, recognizing his condition to be a kind of torpor rather than true death. Using future technology and chronal energy he had infused his own body with, Harvest revived Jon and took him as his own son, intending to use him as a weapon against metahumans. He trained Jon to hate all metahumans, despite being one himself, and the two lead a genocidal campaign against metahumans.

In time, Jon again succumbed to the same condition that nearly took his life before, and Harvest swore to find a way to save him. He took Jon back in time, to five years before the present day, where he retrieved genetic samples from Superman and Lois. He went on to found the organization N.O.W.H.E.R.E., and by combining the genetic samples from Superman, Lois, and Jon, created a clone, who would come to be known as Superboy and &quot;Kon-El&quot;, who he hoped to use to find a way to treat Jon&#x27;s condition.

====Forever Evil====
During the 2013–2014 &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, the Teen Titans, after a battle with the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s Johnny Quick and Atomica, are sent traveling through time, arriving in the alternate future where Jon and Harvest wage war against metahumans. Here Jon encounters his clone, Kon-El, and the two battle. Kon-El defeats his vicious progenitor, but before he can finish him off, is summoned through time by the Oracle, leading to the &quot;Krypton Returns&quot; story arc. Jon is then recovered and treated by the future versions of Beast Boy and Ravager, who present him to the Titans as Kon-El. The Titans take Jon with them as they continued time travelling.

With Kon-El apparently having been killed off in the &quot;Krypton Returns&quot; crossover storyline, Jon takes over as the lead character of the &quot;Superboy&quot; comic book with issue #26. Awakening in the year 2933, Jon meets Wonder Girl and quickly realizes the Titans (except for Raven) believe him to be Kon-El. He decided to maintain the masquerade and pose as Kon-El while secretly pursuing his anti-metahuman agenda.

Jon soon encountered a telepathic girl calling herself &quot;Schiz&quot;, who claims to be one of a group of normal humans given powers artificially. She claims they were based on Jon and created to fight the metahumans, only to be put into stasis when the humans came to fear them as well. Jon and Schiz make plans to assemble these artificial metas into an army to serve Jon&#x27;s plans to wage a genocidal war against metahumans in the present day.

Eventually, Jon encounters his future self (the genetic template for Kon-El) in the present—in stasis, dying from illness— and touching it, creates a temporal paradox which, through a lingering psychic connection to Kon-El who remains alive in the distant future, pulls them as well as Superboy Jons and Kons from across the Multiverse as well as other timelines to a pocket universe. The younger Jon teams up with Kon to fight against his older, psychotic self with help from Rose Wilson and Guardian, but find they are massively outmatched by him. The older Jon is even able to use his psionic powers to take control of the minds of the other Superboys, numbering in their hundreds, and siphon the power of a Green Lantern from one of the alternate worlds. The younger Jon heroically sacrifices himself to destroy the elder Jon, obliterating them both through his TK, sending all the other Jons and Kons back to their respective timelines, dimensions and universes. Jon isn&#x27;t erased from history, and his actions outside of the pocket universe are well remembered, but he is truly gone, leaving Kon-El once again as Superboy.

===Jonathan Kent===
In 2016, Jonathan Kent became the new Superboy in DC Comics. He was introduced as the son of Post-Crisis Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane, who were reintroduced in DC continuity in the 2015 &quot;Convergence&quot; event. Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Kent was born in &quot;Convergence: Superman&quot; #2 (July 2015). After &quot;Convergence&quot;, he and his parents relocated to the New 52 universe, where the Kent family lived in secrecy for many years.

He was officially introduced as Superboy in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 4) #6 (November 2016). Jon co-stars with Damian Wayne in the DC Rebirth comic book series &quot;Super Sons&quot; as Superboy and Robin. The series began publication in February 2017 and ended its 16-issue run in May 2018. A 12-issue limited series, &quot;Adventures of the Super Sons&quot;, which debuted in August 2018, told more of the boys&#x27; adventures together. Jon frequently appears in &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot; with his parents. He is also a member of the current version of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

==Other versions==
Several other versions of Superboy originating from different parts of the Multiverse have also appeared in DC Comics.
*Alternate versions of Kal-El:
**Karkan: In a 1972 imaginary story, infant Kal-El lands in Africa and, like Tarzan, is found and raised by gorillas. As a teen, Karkan is found by an expedition to Africa and brought to Metropolis. When he finds that he cannot adjust to &quot;civilized&quot; life, Karkan returns to the jungle. After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, these events were said to have happened on another Earth, Earth-183. In 1991, Karkan appeared alongside several other versions of Kal-L in the 2-part season finale of the live-action Superboy television series, where he was portrayed by Aaron Schnett. Karkan also appears in the &quot;Hypertension&quot; story arc (1999). 
**Superboy of &quot;Superboy&#x27;s Legion&quot;: In this Elseworlds tale, the infant Kal-El is stranded in the Asteroid Belt, and he remains there, in stasis, until found in 2987 by R. J. Brande, a thousand years after Krypton&#x27;s destruction. At the age of 14, &quot;Kal Brande&quot;, also known as Superboy, joins Cosmic Boy and Saturn Girl in forming &quot;Superboy&#x27;s Legion&quot;, later known as the Legion of Super-Heroes.
**In the &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; series of stories by John Byrne, Superman gets his start as Superboy during the 1920s.
*Alternate versions of Kon-El:
**Superboy of the &quot;Super Seven&quot;: This Elseworlds character (who resembles Kon-El) is one of the &quot;Super Seven&quot;, a group of heroes which include Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, and a Lex Luthor/Metallo hybrid, who help humans fight off &quot;The Horde&quot;, an alien race that occupies Earth.
**Black Zero: a version of Kon-El who was grown to adulthood and lived on a world where Superman did not return from the dead. He was the main villain in &quot;Hypertension&quot; and the foe of the &quot;Legion of Superboys&quot; (below).
*Other versions:
**&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;: Superboy appears alongside Supergirl with the Legion of Super-Heroes in one panel. It is unclear whether this version is Kon-El, simply young Kal-El (via time travel) or possibly his son through Lois Lane.
**&quot;Legion of Superboys&quot;: Different versions of Superboy from throughout Hypertime, including both Kon-El and Kal-El, team up in the unofficial &quot;Legion of Superboys&quot; to fight Black Zero in the &quot;Hypertension&quot; story arc. Among these Superboys are a version of Kon-El that has taken Robin&#x27;s place as Batman&#x27;s partner, a Kon-El cowboy, a Kon-El knight, Karkan, Superboy One Million and a teenage clone of Supergirl from the &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot; reality.

===Superboy-Prime===
In 1985, during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover event, another Superboy was created. This Superboy hails from the parallel Earth known as Earth-Prime, where Superman and the other DC superheroes only exist as fictional comic book characters. Brought over from his dimension by Superman to aid in the universe-spanning battle at the heart of the Crisis, Superboy helps the Earth-Two Superman (Kal-L) defeat the Anti-Monitor, the villain who spawned the Crisis. With their home dimensions destroyed, Superboy, Superman of Earth-Two, his wife Lois Lane, and Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three journey to a &quot;paradise dimension&quot;.

Published two decades later in DC&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries, Superboy, Alex, Kal-L, and Lois are retroactively revealed to have been watching the DC Universe since they entered this &quot;paradise&quot;. Unhappy with what they have been seeing, they decide to take action, and return to the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Universe. Feeling that this world&#x27;s heroes were inferior, he feels no qualms about committing wanton acts of destruction, kidnapping and murder. In the end, Superboy-Prime is pulled into the core of a red sun by both Superman of Earth-Two and Superman (Kal-El) of the main DC Universe. They crash land on Mogo, the Green Lantern that is a living planet. Under a red sun, their powers rapidly vanish. On Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats the Earth-Two Superman to death before he is defeated by Kal-El. The Green Lantern Corps put Superboy-Prime in a maximum-security prison on their home world of Oa and guard him round-the-clock. While incarcerated, he carves the &quot;S&quot;-symbol into his chest and vows to escape.

One year later, Superboy is released from his prison by the newly formed Sinestro Corps and joins them, becoming one of their heralds and wearing a Sinestro Corps uniform beneath his Anti-Monitor inspired armor. Now calling himself Superman Prime, he becomes involved in the war between the Sinestro Corps and the Green Lantern Corps and later in the events of &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;. In the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&quot; miniseries, Prime leads an expanded Legion of Super-Villains into battle against Superman and versions of the Legion of Super-Heroes from three parallel Earths in the 31st century.

===&quot;Superman: Secret Identity&quot;===
The Superboy-Prime character was the inspiration for Kurt Busiek and Stuart Immonen&#x27;s miniseries &quot;&quot;, which begins as a story about a teenage boy, named Clark Kent after the comic book character, who exists in the &quot;real world&quot; where there are no superheroes and discovers that he possesses powers similar to Superman&#x27;s. In the first press reports about Clark&#x27;s life-saving superdeeds, the press refers to Clark (whose identity is unknown) as &quot;Superboy&quot;.

=== Superboy OMAC ===
The one millionth clone of Kon-El, he lives in the 853rd century and is a member of Justice Legions S, which consists exclusively of Superboy clones, and T, a future version of Young Justice. Also known as Superboy OMAC, an acronym for &quot;One Millionth Actual Clone&quot; of Kon-El, this Superboy resembles the original OMAC (One-Man Army Corps) in appearance. He was part of 1998&#x27;s DC One Million crossover event and reappeared the following year in &quot;Hypertension&quot;.
*Quetzal: In a distant future on the colony world of Aztlan, Quetzal becomes the designated heir to Superman, who occupies a semi-divine position in this Aztec-like society. Realizing that &quot;Superman&quot; is corrupt, Superboy leads a rebellion against him.
*Superboy (presumably the original) is one of the &quot;ghosts&quot; in the empty &quot;Planet Krypton&quot; restaurant in &quot;The Kingdom: Planet Krypton&quot; #1.

===&quot;All-Star: Superman&quot;===
During an adventure in Smallville while he is still a youth, Clark Kent of &quot;All-Star Superman&quot; is aided by the time-spanning Superman Squad featuring the present Superman in disguise as the Unknown Superman, Kal Kent, and the 5th-dimension Superman. While aiding the Squad, Clark misses a chance to save the life of Jonathan Kent.

In writing about the version of Superman in their series, writer Grant Morrison said, &quot;Ma &amp; Pa Kent—one dead. We&#x27;re going with the version where Pa Kent has died. That&#x27;s the day Superboy becomes a man.&quot; Dialogue between several characters implies that young Clark is a costumed adventurer, but he is never referred to as &quot;Superboy&quot;.

==Legal status==
The Superboy character has been the subject of a legal battle between Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of DC Comics, and the estates of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

While he was stationed overseas, Detective Comics (the forerunner of DC) directed Shuster to draw a Superboy comic strip for publication in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;. No notice was given to Siegel, and no consent from him was granted. Siegel sued for copyright infringement, and won. A court-appointed special referee declared the character of Superboy unique, and not derivative from the character of Superman. But appeals by both Siegel and National Comics Publication (the new name of Detective Comics) led to a consent decree in which the parties agreed that Superboy was the sole property of National Comics.

In 1969, Siegel and Shuster sought to recover their copyright to Superman, as the original 28-year copyright for the character had expired. In &quot;Siegel v. National Periodical Publications, Inc.&quot;, 364 F. Supp. 1032 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), &quot;aff&#x27;d&quot;, 508 F.2d 909 (2nd Cir. 1974), the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that the 1948 agreement assigned not only the original 28-year copyright term but also the 28-year copyright renewal term as well to National Periodical Publications (Detective Comics&#x27; successor).

In 1976, Congress enacted a new Copyright Act. This law extended existing copyrights for 19 years and gave the creators of works the right to seek to recover their copyright when the extension expired.

===The Siegel claims===
In 1997, Joanne Siegel (Siegel&#x27;s surviving wife) and Laura Siegel Larson (Siegel&#x27;s daughter) filed a notice exercising their rights to terminate DC Comics&#x27; copyright on the Superman character. The date of termination was 1999, but DC Comics provided Joanne Siegel with certain benefits that induced the parties to keep negotiating. A tolling agreement was signed to allow negotiations to keep moving. The Siegels, Shusters, and DC Comics began drafting an agreement, and this agreement now referenced the Superboy character and some indicia as well. On October 19, 2001, Larson&#x27;s attorney issued a letter in which he claimed that the heirs &quot;accepted D.C. Comics offer of October 16, 2001, in respect of the &#x27;Superman&#x27; and &#x27;Spectre&#x27; properties.&quot; Further negotiations broke down in 2002, and the Siegel heirs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming their half of the Superboy copyright.

On March 23, 2006, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew of the District Court for the Central District of California issued a summary judgment ruling that Siegel&#x27;s heirs had successfully reclaimed the copyright to the Superboy character and related indicia as of November 17, 2004. Judge Lew&#x27;s decision left the parties in the unenviable situation of the Siegels owning the copyright to Superboy, but Time Warner owning the trademark—leaving neither party fully able to take advantage of their respective properties alone.

At a subsequent trial in October 2006, Time Warner (now the parent company of DC Comics) defended itself against a copyright infringement suit by the Siegels by arguing that Judge Lew&#x27;s summary judgment was incorrect. In &quot;Siegel v. Time Warner&quot;, 496 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (C.D.Cal. 2007), Judge Stephen G. Larson vacated Judge Lew&#x27;s summary judgment and ordered a new trial on the issues. Larson&#x27;s ruling did not determine whether Superboy was such a unique character that the character enjoyed its own copyright protection. He said it was up to future litigation to determine whether the differences between Superman and Superboy were trivial and did not create a copyrightable character. Attorney Jesse J. Kruger, however, noted that character reboots and retcons could create enough differences so that any future version of Superboy might avoid a claim by the Siegels.

The legal dispute affected DC Comics&#x27; treatment of the various incarnations of Superboy. In the &quot;Secret Origin of the Teen Titans&quot; back-up story (March 28, 2007) in the weekly &quot;52&quot; limited series, an illustration of Superboy was changed into Wonder Girl. In the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; storyline in the Green Lantern titles and in the &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; limited series, the Superboy-Prime character was referred to as Superman-Prime, a development that came about in part because of the legal dispute.

On March 26, 2008, in &quot;Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.&quot;, 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008), Judge Larson ruled again that the Superboy character was not a work for hire. Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs&#x27; claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and indicia as they appeared in &quot;Action Comics #1&quot; (but not prior to or after that). Judge Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and indicia. This included the story of Superman&#x27;s origin as a Kryptonian rocketed to Earth from a dying planet in a spaceship created by his father. DC Comics celebrated the decisions, as they restored certain retconned versions of the Superboy character to the company&#x27;s use. On June 28, 2008, DC Comics Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio said in reference to the &quot;Legion of Three Worlds&quot; comic at the Wizard World Chicago convention, &quot;We&#x27;ve got Geoff (Johns) (writer), we&#x27;ve got George (Pérez) (artist), we&#x27;ve got SuperBOY Prime (yes, we can say that again).&quot;

In January 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals returned all rights over the Superboy character and other indicia to DC Comics. The appellate court held in &quot;Larson v. Warner Bros. Entertainment&quot;, No. 11-56034, D.C. No. 2:04-cv-08400-ODW-RZ (9 Cir. January 10, 2013), that the District Court for the Central District of California erred when it said in 2008 that DC and the Siegel heirs had not reached an agreement in 2001 resolving the dispute over the copyright. The court of appeals remanded the case back to the district court with an order to find that a contract existed. Copyright attorney Dallas Kratzer said that the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling &quot;rendered moot all of the other questions in this lawsuit.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the ruling likely precludes any further attempt by the Siegel heirs to terminate DC Comics&#x27; copyright ownership of the character, although an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is not barred. The Ninth Circuit also ruled that DC Comics could move ahead with a tortious interference lawsuit against Siegel attorney Marc Toberoff, whom DC accuses of interfering with the 2001 settlement.

On remand, the District Court for the Central District of California found that the 2001 agreement had terminated the Siegel heirs&#x27; rights to Superboy. The Siegel heirs appealed, arguing that the 2001 agreement did not cover the Superboy copyrights because the rights (at that time) were not the Siegels&#x27; to grant. They also argued that the agreement alienated their copyrights contrary to law. Finally, the heirs argued that Joanne Siegel had rescinded the 2001 agreement in 2002, an action in which DC Comics had agreed. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all these arguments.

===The Shuster claims===
Joe Shuster died in 1992. After his death, DC Comics and his sister, Jean Shuster Peavy, entered into an agreement in which the company paid Shuster&#x27;s debts, made &quot;survivor payments&quot; to Shuster&#x27;s brother (Frank), and paid Jean $25,000 a year for the rest of her life. Jean Shuster Peavy and Frank Shuster agreed to turn over all copyright interest in Shuster&#x27;s Detective Comics characters to DC Comics. The agreement also barred the Shuster family from asserting these rights in the future. The agreement did not, however, specifically mention Superman or Superboy.

In 2003, the Joe Shuster estate filed suit to recover Shuster&#x27;s copyright interest in Superman, Superboy, and other characters. DC Comics counter-sued, arguing the 1992 agreement barred any such claim. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California held in &quot;DC Comics v. Pacific Pictures Corp.&quot;, No. CV 10-3633 ODW (RZx), 2012 WL 4936588 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2012), that the 1992 agreement&#x27;s broad, all-inclusive language was more than adequate to cover the Superman and Superboy copyrights in which Shuster had an interest. Thus, the estate was barred from seeking their termination under the Copyright Act. Whatever interest Shuster had in Superboy stayed with DC Comics. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the Shuster family&#x27;s appeal in October 2014, leaving the district court&#x27;s ruling intact.

<text>Original programming (also called originals or original programs, and subcategorized as &quot;original series&quot;, &quot;original movies&quot;, &quot;original documentaries&quot; and &quot;original specials&quot;) is a term used for in-house television, film or web series productions to which the exclusive domestic and, if the originating service operates non-domestic versions of the service outside of their home country, international broadcast rights are held by traditional and over-the-top content providers. The term was coined by HBO in 1983 when the premium service began producing its slate of in-house series and film productions. HBO initially branded the original series on the network under &quot;HBOriginal&quot; until 1986, and by 1993, the &quot;originals&quot; term had expanded to encompass most of its original productions. The term eventually expanded into use by various cable-originated television networks (including, among others, Disney Channel, TNT and USA Network) to identify their in-house productions. It also advertises them as being distinct from the acquired content offered to fill out the remainder of their programming schedule.

Most original made-for-cable or made-for-streaming productions are produced solely in conjunction with independent production companies that also hold day-to-day management responsibilities for the program, although some series (such as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;The Leftovers&quot; and &quot;Power&quot;) share financial interests with major television studios—such as 20th Television, Warner Bros. Television and Lionsgate Television—that may also handle distribution responsibilities for domestic and international syndication on behalf of the originating network. Television networks and digital content providers that produce original programming include Cinemax, Netflix, Showtime, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. In October 2020, CBS became the first U.S. broadcast network to identify all of its entertainment programming under the term, branding them as &quot;CBS Originals&quot;; however, the network uses the &quot;original&quot; term for both series produced by sister production company CBS Studios and series produced by third-party production companies. (ABC had previously marketed the 2016 miniseries &quot;Madoff&quot; and the 2019 made-for-TV movie &quot;Same Time, Next Christmas&quot; as &quot;ABC Originals&quot;.)

<text>Harold Pitney Brown (September 16, 1857, Janesville, Wisconsin – 1944, Volusia, Florida) was an American electrical engineer and inventor known for his activism in the late 1880s against the use of alternating current (AC) for electric lighting in New York City and around the country (during the &quot;war of the currents&quot;).

Brown was mostly self-educated, working for several companies in the fledgling electrical field before striking out on his own, working on his own inventions as well as hiring himself out as a consultant.

After several deaths were caused by the high voltages used in alternating current arc lighting systems in New York City, Brown came to prominence in June 1888, claiming in the press and then in public meetings that AC was more deadly than direct current (DC) and that the arc lighting companies were cutting corners and using AC to save money at the cost of public safety. He conducted public demonstrations (electrocuting animals with AC) then lobbied around the country trying to limit AC transmission line voltages to 300 volts, tactics which had him using the press to directly attack the country&#x27;s largest AC equipment manufacturer, Westinghouse Electric. He also pushed to have the first electric chair, which was being developed by the state of New York, be powered with AC current, provided by Westinghouse generators he had surreptitiously acquired. His involvement in these events is controversial since he was working parallel with (some documents show colluded with) the Edison Illuminating Company, showing a preference for Edison&#x27;s direct current power system and advocating for severe restrictions on AC power systems that would put Edison&#x27;s competitors at a disadvantage.

==Biography==
Harold Brown was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on September 16, 1857, the son of General Theodore F. Brown and Frances Brown. His father was in the American Civil War and received an honorary rank of brigadier general for his role in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.

Brown graduated Chicago High School in 1876 and prepared to enroll in mining engineering courses at Harvard but was unable to since the great Chicago fire of 1871 had left his family in reduced circumstances. After high school he was employed at the Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago working on development and manufacturing of electrical devices, including Edison&#x27;s electric pen duplicating machine, from 1876 to 1879. From 1879 to 1884 he worked for Brush Electric Company in charge of designing and installing their arc lighting systems. From 1884 to 1887 he operated his own electrical consulting business, Brown Electric Company, where he worked in inventing improved arc lighting equipment.

Brown moved to New York in 1887 and worked as consultant for the New York and Westchester Railroad, Edison General Electric, and consulted on the development of the electric chair with Governor David B. Hill and the State of New York. He also did consulting work for the City of Newark, Dayton Ohio Buffalo Electric Rail Line, and the Louisville Electric Rail Line. Up through 1912 he invented and manufactured a plastic rail bond electric contact alloy and went on to invent and manufactured a method of applying concrete with compressed air or steam.

Brown was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1899.

== Anti-AC crusade ==
After a series of deaths in New York caused by the tangle of pole mounted high voltage (up to 6,000 volts) alternating current lines Brown came to public prominence when he wrote a letter to the &quot;New York Post&quot; on June 5, 1888 describing the overhead lines as a public menace stating:

The only excuse for the use of the fatal alternating current is that it saves the company operating it [AC] from spending a larger sum of money for the heavier copper wires which are required by the safe incandescent systems. That is, the public must submit to constant danger from sudden death, in order that a corporation may pay a little larger dividend.

His crusade brought him to the attention of inventor Thomas Edison who was becoming engaged in a propaganda campaign against alternating current companies including Westinghouse Electric Company in what would come to be called the War of the currents. Edison lent Brown the uses of his West Orange, New Jersey, laboratory to prove his claims against alternating current.

After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College where he demonstrated that up to 1,000 volts of DC would not kill a dog while 300 volts of AC would kill. He went on to support legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system). The legislation was unsuccessful but another bill to move AC lines underground in New York City, put forward before Brown&#x27;s campaign, passed in 1889 after a further series of highly publicized deaths that year caused by alternating current.

===Involvement in the electric chair===

At the same time that Brown was campaigning against alternating current a New York state bill replacing hanging with electrocution was signed into law (June 4, 1888) and set to go into effect on January 1, 1889. A Buffalo, New York dentist named Alfred P. Southwick had been developing a method using a device similar to a dental chair, an execution device referred to as the electric chair. The law did not specify the type of current to use, or the means, so the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details. Committee head Frederick Peterson, a neurologist who had assisted in the dog electrocutions at Columbia College, enlisted Brown&#x27;s services as a consultant. Brown set up an experiment at Edison&#x27;s West Orange laboratory on December 5, 1888 with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1,000-1,500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.

Westinghouse criticized this test as a skewed self-serving demonstration by Brown, who was again accused of being in the employ of the Edison company. Brown refuted the claims and even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical &quot;duel,&quot; with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse would submit himself to the same amount of increasing AC power (first to quit loses). Westinghouse declined the offer.

Neither Edison, Westinghouse, nor Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston Electric Company, wanted their equipment to be used in an execution but Brown colluded with Edison Electric and Thomson-Houston to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators to power the first electric chair.

Brown would continually claim he had no actual association with the Edison company although an August 1889 &quot;New York Sun&quot; story published letters stolen from Brown&#x27;s office that seemed to show Brown was receiving directions from, and being paid by, the Edison company as well as Thomson-Houston, including the story on the acquisition of the Westinghouse AC generators.

<text>Fear of a Black Planet is the third studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy. It was released on April 10, 1990, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records, and produced by the group&#x27;s production team The Bomb Squad, who expanded on the sample-layered sound of Public Enemy&#x27;s previous album, &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; (1988). Having fulfilled their initial creative ambitions with that album, the group aspired to create what lead rapper Chuck D called &quot;a deep, complex album&quot;. Their songwriting was partly inspired by the controversy surrounding member Professor Griff&#x27;s anti-Semitic public comments and his consequent dismissal from the group in 1989.

Reflecting its confrontational tone, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; features elaborate sound collages that incorporate varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops. Recorded during the golden age of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources took advantage of creative freedom that existed before the emergence of a sample clearance system in the music industry. Thematically, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; explores organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. Its critiques of institutional racism, white supremacy, and the power elite were partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing&#x27;s views on color.

A commercial and critical hit, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; sold two million copies in the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named it one of the year&#x27;s best albums. Its success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre&#x27;s mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop&#x27;s greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2004, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry. In 2020, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was ranked number 176 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

== Background ==
In 1988, Public Enemy released their second album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; to critical and commercial success. Their music&#x27;s dense textures, provided by the group&#x27;s production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group&#x27;s lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group&#x27;s affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan.

&quot;It Takes a Nation&quot;″s success helped raise hip hop&#x27;s profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction at the turn of the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album&#x27;s content and the group&#x27;s rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.

In May 1989, Chuck D, Bomb Squad producer Hank Shocklee, and Def Jam executive Bill Stephney were negotiating with several labels for a production deal from a major record company, their goal since starting Public Enemy in the early 1980s. As they were in negotiations, group member Professor Griff made anti-Semitic remarks in an interview with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, in which he said that Jews were the cause of &quot;the majority of the wickedness&quot; in the world. Public Enemy received media scrutiny and criticism from religious organizations and liberal rock critics, which added to charges against the group&#x27;s politics being racist, homophobic, and misogynistic.

Amid the controversy, Chuck D was given an ultimatum by Shocklee and Stephney to dismiss Griff from the group or the production deal would fall through. He fired Griff in June, but he later rejoined and has since denied holding anti-Semitic views and apologized for the remarks. Several people who had worked with Public Enemy expressed concern about Chuck D&#x27;s leadership abilities and role as a social spokesman. Def Jam director of publicity Bill Adler later said that the controversy &quot;partly ... fueled the writing of [the album]&quot;.

To follow up &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;, the group sought to make a more thematically focused work and to condense Dr. Frances Cress Welsing&#x27;s theory of &quot;Color Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy)&quot; into an album-length recording. According to Chuck D, this involved &quot;telling people, well, color&#x27;s an issue created and concocted to take advantage of people of various characteristics with the benefit of a few&quot;. He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with &quot;Billboard:&quot; &quot;We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance.&quot; Chuck D also cited the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for &quot;Westword&quot;, he later said, &quot;We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so we set out to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would stand the test of time by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was recorded at three studios—Greene St. Recording in New York City, The Music Palace in West Hempstead, and Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead—from June to October 1989. It was produced by The Bomb Squad—Chuck D, Eric &quot;Vietnam&quot; Sadler, Keith Shocklee, and his brother Hank Shocklee—while Chuck D called Hank, their director, &quot;the Phil Spector of hip-hop&quot;. Keith, significant in composing the main tracks and music, received here his first official credit as a team member. For the album, they sought to expand on the dense, sample-layered &quot;wall of noise&quot; of Public Enemy&#x27;s prior album, &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;.

Employing an elaborate method, the Bomb Squad reconfigured and recontextualized disparate sound fragments, while expanding their repertoire of samples to radio and other sources. According to Shocklee, &quot;When you&#x27;re talking about the kind of sampling that Public Enemy did, we had to comb through thousands of records to come up with maybe five good pieces. And as we started putting together those pieces, the sound got a lot more dense.&quot; Hank Shocklee called it &quot;a production assembly line where each person had their own particular specialty ... [Shocklee] came from a DJ&#x27;s perspective. Eric [Sadler] is coming from a musician&#x27;s perspective.&quot; Sadler&#x27;s approach was more traditional and structured, while Shocklee&#x27;s was more experimental. As the main lyricist, Chuck D wanted to recontextualize the sampled material into his lyrics and create a theme.

The Bomb Squad used devices including the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler, the Akai S900 sampler, and a Macintosh computer. Chuck D remarked that &quot;95 percent of the time it sounded like mess. But there was 5 percent of magic that would happen.&quot; Shocklee compared their production to filmmaking, &quot;with different lighting effects, or film speeds, or whatever&quot;, while Chuck D analogized to an artist creating green from yellow and blue. As he had the production team improvise beats, much of the album was composed on the spot. In a 1990 interview, Chuck added, &quot;We approach every record like it was a painting. Sometimes, on the sound sheet, we have to have a separate sheet just to list the samples for each track. We used about 150, maybe 200 samples on &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;.&quot;

To synchronize the samples, the Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed parts of backing tracks, which had been inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said, &quot;Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away.&quot; Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. &quot;They&#x27;re figuring out how to &quot;jam with the samples&quot; and to create these layers of sound,&quot; Chang said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been matched since then.&quot; After the tracks were completed, the Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes. Final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, &quot;a lot of people were like, &#x27;Wow, it&#x27;s a brilliant album&#x27;. But it really shoulda been much better. If we had more time and we didn&#x27;t have to deal with the situation of nobody talking&quot;.

&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was conceived during the golden age of hip hop, a period roughly between 1987 and 1992 when artists took advantage of emerging sampling technology before record labels and lawyers took notice. Accordingly, Public Enemy were not compelled to obtain sample clearance for the album. This preceded the legal limits and clearance costs later placed on sampling, which limited hip hop production and the complexity of its musical arrangements. In an interview with &quot;Stay Free!&quot;, Chuck D said: &quot;Public Enemy&#x27;s music was affected more than anybody&#x27;s because we were taking thousands of sounds. If you separated the sounds, they wouldn&#x27;t have been anything--they were unrecognizable. The sounds were all collaged together to make a sonic wall.&quot; An analysis by law professors Peter DiCola and Kembrew McLeod estimated that under the sample clearance system that developed after the album&#x27;s release, Public Enemy were to lose at least five dollars per copy if they were to clear the album&#x27;s samples at 2010 rates, a loss of five million dollars on a platinum record.

For the track &quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot;, Chuck D dealt with clearance issues from different record labels to collaborate with rappers Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube, who had been pursuing the Bomb Squad to produce his debut album. The recording marked one of the first times in which MCs from different rap crews collaborated, and it led to the Bomb Squad working with Ice Cube on his 1990 debut album &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

For the album&#x27;s artwork, Public Enemy enlisted B.E. Johnson, a NASA illustrator. His design illustrated Chuck D&#x27;s concept of two planets, the &quot;Black&quot; planet and Earth, eclipsing. Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, said: &quot;It was so interesting to me that a black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover. At that time, black hip-hop artists, for the most part, had photos of themselves on their covers. But this was the first time someone took a chance to do something in the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll vein&quot;.

== Music ==
&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;″s music features assemblage compositions that draw on numerous sources. The production&#x27;s &quot;musique concrète&quot;-influenced approach reflects the political and confrontational tones of the group&#x27;s lyrics, with sound collages that feature varying rhythms, aliased or scratchy samples, media sound bites, and eccentric music loops. Recordings sampled for &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; include those from funk, soul, rock, and hip hop genres. Elements such as choruses, guitar sounds, or vocals from sampled recordings are reappropriated as riffs in songs on the album, while sampled dialogue from speeches is incorporated to support Chuck D&#x27;s arguments and commentary on certain songs. The Bomb Squad&#x27;s Hank Shocklee compared their produced sounds, surrounding Chuck D&#x27;s rhythmic, exhortative baritone voice, to putting &quot;the voice of God in a storm&quot;.

According to &quot;The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore&quot; (2006), &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; introduced a production style that &quot;borrowed elements from jazz, especially that of John Coltrane, to craft a soundscape that was more challenging than that of their previous two albums, but still complemented the complex social commentary&quot;. Journalist Kembrew McLeod called the music &quot;both agitprop and pop, mixing politics with the live-wire thrill of the popular music experience&quot;, adding that the Bomb Squad &quot;took sampling to the level of high art while keeping intact hip hop&#x27;s populist heart. They would graft together dozens of fragmentary samples to create a single song collage.&quot; Simon Reynolds said it was &quot;a work of unprecedented density for hip hop, its claustrophobic, backs-against-the-wall feel harking back to Sly Stone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; or even Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;On the Corner&quot;&quot;.

Some tracks used elements from Public Enemy&#x27;s previous material, which Pete Watrous of &quot;The New York Times&quot; interpreted as a dual reference to hip hop tradition and the history of the group. Watrous described the music as &quot;the sound of urban alienation, where silence doesn&#x27;t exist and sensory stimulation is oppressive and predatory&quot;, and writes that its dense textures &quot;envelop Chuck D&#x27;s voice and make his rapping sound as if it is under duress, as if he were fighting against a background intent on taking him over ... Layer after layer of sounds are placed on top of each other until the music becomes nearly tactile&quot;. Chuck D called &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; a record entirely of &quot;found sounds ... probably the most elaborate smorgasbord of sound that we did ... When we put together our music, we try to put together layers that complement each other, and then the voice tries to complement that, and the theme tries to complement that, and then the song itself tries to complement the album as a whole, fitting into the overall context.&quot; In his essay on hip hop aesthetics, Richard Schur interpreted such layering as a motif in hip hop and as &quot;the process by which ... new meanings are created and communicated, primarily to an equally knowledgeable audience&quot;, concluding that &quot;Public Enemy probably took the ideal of layering to its farthest point&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; contains themes of organization and empowerment within the African-American community, and of confrontation. Chuck D&#x27;s critical lyrics on the album, interspersed with the surrealism of Flavor Flav, also concern contemporary black life, the state of race relations, and criticisms of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite. Greg Sandow called Chuck D&#x27;s language &quot;strong and elusive, often fragmentary&quot; and &quot;embedded [with] critical, sometimes brutal thoughts&quot;. Although he viewed that &quot;some people might disagree with some of these ideas&quot;, Sandow wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to dispute the lyrics&#x27; assertion that many Whites &quot;are&quot; afraid of blacks&quot;, adding that the album &quot;touches on&quot; the idea of &quot;an age when whites understand that they&#x27;re a minority in the world&quot;. Robert Hilburn believed that the songs &quot;decried what Chuck D. saw as the consequences of white, European cultural domination in the United States and throughout much of the world&quot;. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Nick Butler observed &quot;two recurring themes – inter-racial relationships ... and the racism inherent in the American media&quot;.

In his book &quot;Somebody Scream!: Rap Music&#x27;s Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power&quot;, Marcus Reeves said that &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; &quot;was as much a musical assault on America&#x27;s racism as it was a call to blacks to effectively react to it&quot;. According to Greg Kot, the album was &quot;hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won&#x27;t screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa.&quot; Kot wrote of Chuck D&#x27;s perspective and the theme of fear, &quot;It&#x27;s fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won&#x27;t run. &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy&#x27;s terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world.&quot;

=== Songs ===
The opening track, &quot;Contract on the World Love Jam&quot;, is a sound collage made up of samples, scratch cuts, and snippets recorded by Chuck D from radio stations and sound bites of interviews and commercials. The tension-building track introduces the album&#x27;s dense, sample-based production. According to Chuck D, the song features &quot;about forty-five to fifty [sampled] voices&quot; that interweave as part of an assertive sonic collage and underscore the themes explored on subsequent tracks. &quot;Incident at 66.6 FM&quot;, another collage that segues into &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot;, contains snippets from a radio call-in show interview of Chuck D and alludes to the media persecution perceived by Public Enemy.

The controversial &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; references the murder of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and criticizes Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff&#x27;s anti-Semitic remarks. Chuck D addresses the controversy from the perspective of someone in the center of political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: &quot;Crucifixion ain&#x27;t no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus&quot;. He is also critical of Blacks and those who &quot;blame somebody else when you destroy yourself&quot;: &quot;Every brother ain&#x27;t a brother / &#x27;cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger&quot;. His lyricism features dizzying rap patterns and internal rhyme: &quot;Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya ... Sad to say I got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never to say I never knew or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin&#x27;, basin&#x27; / Traits of hate who&#x27;s celebratin&#x27; wit Satan?&quot;. Among the samples used for the song are several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot;. Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D&#x27;s rapping, such as the line &quot;come on, you can get it-get it-get it&quot; from Instant Funk&#x27;s &quot;I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush cites the track as &quot;the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.&#x27;s best rapping performances ever ... [N]one of their tracks were more musically incendiary&quot;.

&quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; assails the use of black stereotypes in movies, while &quot;Who Stole the Soul?&quot; condemns the music industry&#x27;s exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations. &quot;Revolutionary Generation&quot; celebrates the strength and endurance of black women with lyrics related to black feminism, an unfamiliar topic in contemporary hip hop. It also addresses sexism within the black community and misogyny in hip hop culture. The title track discusses racial classification and the origins of Whites fearing African Americans, particularly racist concerns by some Whites over the effect of miscegenation. In the song, Chuck D argues that they should not worry because the original man was black and &quot;white comes from black / No need to be confused&quot;. The song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist Dick Gregory saying, &quot;Black man, black woman, black baby / white man, black woman, black baby?&quot;. &quot;Pollywanacraka&quot; also concerns interracial relations, including Blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy Whites, and societal views of the matter: &quot;This system had no wisdom / The devil split us in pairs / and taught us white is good, black is bad / and black and white is &quot;still&quot; too bad&quot;. &quot;Meet the G That Killed Me&quot; features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality: &quot;Man to man / I don&#x27;t know if they can / From what I know / The parts don&#x27;t fit&quot;.

Songs such as &quot;Fight the Power&quot;, &quot;Power to the People&quot;, and &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; propose a response for African Americans to the issues criticized throughout the album. &quot;Power to the People&quot; has a tempo of approximately 125 beats per minute, fast-paced Roland TR-808 drum machine patterns, and elements of Miami bass, electro-boogie. Addressing their plight at the turn of the 1990s, &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; features cacophonic sound textures and a theme of unity among African Americans, with Chuck D preaching &quot;Brothers that try to work it out / They get mad, revolt, revise, realize / They&#x27;re superbad / Small chance a smart brother&#x27;s gonna be a victim of his own circumstance&quot;. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writes that songs such as &quot;War at 33⅓&quot; and &quot;Fight the Power&quot; &quot;may sound like a call to ohms and arms, but they are really a call to action (&#x27;turn us loose and we shall overcome&#x27;), a message to conscience and a plea for unity (&#x27;move as team, never move alone,&#x27; both cautionary advice and game plan)&quot;. &quot;War at 33⅓&quot; has a theme of resistance and a 128 bpm-tempo, cited by Chuck D as &quot;the fastest thing I&#x27;ve ever rapped to, rapping right on top of the beat&quot;.

&quot;Fight the Power&quot; features revolutionary rhetoric by Chuck D and was used by director Spike Lee as a leitmotif in his acclaimed 1989 film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, a film about racial tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Lee approached the group in 1988 after the release of &quot;It Takes a Nation&quot; with the proposition of making a song for his movie. Chuck D wrote most of the song attempting to adapt The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Fight the Power&quot; to a modernist perspective. The song&#x27;s third verse contains disparaging lyrics about popular American icons Elvis Presley and John Wayne, as Chuck D rhymes &quot;Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me&#x27; / Straight up, racist the sucker was / Simple and plain&quot;, with Flavor Flav following, &quot;Muthafuck him and John Wayne!&quot;. The lyrics, which shocked and offended many listeners at the time, express the identification of Presley with racism — either personally or symbolically — and the largely held notion among Blacks that Presley — whose musical and visual performances owed much to African-American sources — unfairly achieved the cultural acknowledgment and commercial success largely denied his black peers in rock and roll. The line regarding John Wayne refers to his controversial personal views, including racist remarks made in his 1971 interview for &quot;Playboy&quot;. &quot;Fight the Power&quot; has since become the group&#x27;s best-known song and has been named one of the best songs of all time by numerous publications.

Written by Flavor Flav, Shocklee, Sadler, &quot;911 Is a Joke&quot; features Flav as the main vocalist and criticizes the inadequacy of 9-1-1 — the emergency telephone number used in the United States — and the lack of police response to emergency calls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods. The song originated from Chuck D&#x27;s suggestion for Flavor Flav to write a song. As Flav recalled, &quot;I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went and got out of my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit &#x27;cos usually back in the days when I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything&quot;. The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in the song&#x27;s accompanying music video, which features a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo performance, &quot;Can&#x27;t Do Nuttin&#x27; for Ya Man&quot;, has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav&#x27;s experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, &quot;I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, &#x27;Yo, I can&#x27;t do nothing for ya man.&#x27; Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: &#x27;I can&#x27;t do nothing for ya man,&#x27; um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, &#x27;Record that shit man&#x27;&quot;. According to Tom Moon, on both of the album&#x27;s Flavor Flav songs, the rapper &quot;affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.&#x27;s assault&quot;.

== Marketing and sales ==
Originally intended for an October 1989 release date, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was released on April 10, 1990, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. Although &quot;It Takes a Nation&quot; garnered Public Enemy more exposure with black audiences and music journalists, urban radio outlets had mostly rejected Def Jam&#x27;s requests to include the group&#x27;s singles in their regular rotation. This incited Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons to attempt grassroots promotional tactics from his earlier years of promoting hip hop shows. In promoting &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;, he recruited young street crews to put up posters, billboards, and stickers on public surfaces, while Simmons himself met with nightclub DJs and college radio program directors to persuade them to add albums tracks such as &quot;Fight the Power&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot;, and &quot;911 Is a Joke&quot; to their playlists. As singles, they were released on July 4, 1989, in January 1990, and in April, respectively. Two more singles were later released — &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; in June and &quot;Can&#x27;t Do Nuttin&#x27; for Ya Man&quot; in October, with the latter also featured in the 1990 comedy film &quot;House Party&quot;.

&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; debuted at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart. It also charted for 10 weeks and reached number four in the United Kingdom, while in Canada, it charted for 28 weeks and reached number 15. By July 1990, it had sold 1.5 million copies in the US, where it ultimately peaked at number 10 and charted for 27 weeks on the Top Pop Albums. After 1991, when the tracking system Nielsen SoundScan began tracking domestic sales data, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; sold 561,000 additional copies by 2010.

The controversy surrounding the group and their exposure through the singles &quot;Fight the Power&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; helped &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; exceed the sales of their previous two albums, &quot;Yo! Bum Rush the Show&quot; and &quot;It Takes a Nation of Million to Hold Us Back&quot; at the time, 500,000 and 1.1 million copies, respectively. The latter single&#x27;s lyrics were initially viewed by religious groups and the media as anti-semitic upon its release. The album contributed to hip hop&#x27;s commercial breakthrough at the beginning of the 1990s, despite its limited radio airplay. Its success made Public Enemy the top-selling act, both domestically and internationally, for Def Jam Recordings at the time. Ruben Rodriguez, Columbia&#x27;s senior vice president at the time, said in one of the label&#x27;s press releases, &quot;What&#x27;s happening with Public Enemy is unbelievable. The album is selling across the board to all demographics and nationalities&quot;. In a December 1990 article, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; writer Michael Corcoran discussed Public Enemy&#x27;s commercial success with the album and remarked that &quot;more than half of the 2 million fans who bought [&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;] are white&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was met with rave reviews from critics. After asserting prior to its release that it was &quot;bound to be one of the most dissected pop collections in years&quot;, Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the album &quot;rivals the force and the power of &quot;It Takes a Nation&quot;&quot; while &quot;maintaining commercial and artistic credibility in the fast-changing rap world&quot; with original music. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen called it &quot;a masterpiece of innovation [and] challenging music&quot; that makes the group&#x27;s pro-black lyrics more interesting and plausible. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Alan Light praised Public Enemy&#x27;s self-assured and realistic lyrics, and viewed the album as a deeper, more focused version of &quot;the careening rage of &quot;Nation of Millions&quot;&quot;. Greg Sandow of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found it powerfully relevant to contemporary American culture and unparalleled by anything in popular music: &quot;It sounds like a partly African, partly postmodern collage, stitched together on tumultuous urban streets.&quot; Tom Moon of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; observed &quot;some of the genre&#x27;s most sophisticated sound designs and unconventionally agile rapping&quot; on the album and called it &quot;a major piece of work, the first hard evidence of rap&#x27;s maturity and a measure of its continuing relevance&quot;.

In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington said because &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; is a challenging listen, &quot;How it&#x27;s met depends on how it&#x27;s understood.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, felt that its &quot;brutal pace&quot; loses momentum and that the group&#x27;s lyrics are ideologically flawed, but wrote that although their &quot;rebel music&quot; is gimmicky, &quot;this is show business, and they&#x27;re still smarter and more daring than anybody else working their beat.&quot; Peter Watrous of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an essential pop album&quot; and stated, &quot;On their own, the lyrics seen functional. Taken with the music, they bloom with meaning.&quot; Simon Reynolds of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; remarked that the content epitomizes the group&#x27;s significance at the time: &quot;Public Enemy are important ... because of the angry questions that seethe in their music, in the very fabric of their sound; the bewilderment and rage that, in this case, have made for one &quot;hell&quot; of strong, scary album&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot felt that with the album, &quot;Public Enemy affirms that it is not just a great rap group, but one of the best rock bands on the planet-black or otherwise&quot;.

At the end of 1990, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; appeared in the top-10 of several critics&#x27; lists of the year&#x27;s best albums. It was voted the third best record of 1990 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, and the publication&#x27;s Robert Christgau ranked it number 10 on his own &quot;Dean&#x27;s list&quot;. It was named the second best album of the year by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the third best by &quot;USA Today&quot;, and fifth best by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Robert Hilburn, who wrote that it &quot;dissects aspects of the black experience with an energy and vision that illustrates why rap continues to be the most creative genre in pop&quot;. &quot;The State&quot; named it one of the year&#x27;s best albums and hailed it as &quot;possibly the boldest and most important rap record ever made. A sonic tour de force&quot;. &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, presented at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991.

== Legacy and influence ==
&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;″s success with critics and consumers was viewed as a significant factor to hip hop&#x27;s mainstream emergence in 1990, which &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Paul Grein said was &quot;the year that rap exploded&quot;. In a July 1990 article, Kot compared Public Enemy&#x27;s influence on hip hop with the album at the start of the 1990s to the impact of Bob Dylan, George Clinton, and Bob Marley on each of their respective genres and eras, having &quot;given it legitimacy and authority far beyond its core following&quot;. Chuck D later said of the album in retrospect, &quot;If &quot;It Takes a Nation&quot; was our &#x27;nation&#x27; record, &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was our &#x27;world&#x27; record&quot;. With respect to hip hop, the album was important in the field of sampling, as copyright lawyers took notice of The Bomb Squad&#x27;s production and such a sample-heavy work would not be cost effective in the future. Chuck D later said of its sampling issues, &quot;We got sued for everything. We knew that the door on sampling was gonna close&quot;. Subsequent use of sampled material, particularly the use of whole songs on top of a beat, by other hip hop artists prompted stricter sampling laws. &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was the group&#x27;s commercial apex, with sales dropping off for their subsequent albums. Chuck D said it was their most successful record, &quot;not because of all the hype and hysteria. It was a world record. Because of all the different feels and the different textures and the flow it had&quot;.

&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; also helped popularize political subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths at the turn of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan&#x27;s cultural nationalism on their debut album &quot;To the East, Blackwards&quot;, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded &quot;The Devil Made Me Do It&quot; by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers&#x27; debut &quot;Holy Intellect&quot;. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only &quot;the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world&quot; but also &quot;the most politically ambitious. Not even in the heyday of [the] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous &#x27;60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music.&quot; Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music. Reeves said it introduced black consciousness to the &quot;hip-hop youth&quot; of the &quot;post-black power generation&quot;, &quot;as leather African medallions made popular by rappers like P.E. replaced thick gold chains as the ultimate fashion statement ... P.E.&#x27;s million seller sat at the front of a full-blown black pride resurgence within rap&quot;.

However, this resurgence soon became commodified as a trend, while actual awareness within the African-American community was limited and ineffectual to issues such as drug dealing and the prevalence of liquor stores in such neighborhoods. Public Enemy responded to this and other deep-rooted problems of Black America on their following album, &quot;Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black&quot; (1991), which featured more critical assessments of African-Americans, denouncing Black drug dealers who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans at the onset of the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.

=== Reappraisal ===
Since &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was first released, it has been viewed by critics as one of the greatest and most important hip hop albums of all time, as well as a culturally significant work. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that &quot;as a piece of music, this is the best hip-hop has ever had to offer&quot;, calling it &quot;a remarkable piece of modern art, a record that ushered in the &#x27;90s in a hail of multi-culturalism and kaleidoscopic confusion&quot;. Alex Ross cited it as one of &quot;the most densely packed sonic assemblages in musical history&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; said it &quot;achieved the near impossible by being every bit as good as its predecessor&quot;. In the opinion of Kembrew McLeod, Public Enemy had worked with production equipment that would seem primitive decades later but still managed to invent new &quot;techniques and workarounds that electronics manufacturers never imagined&quot;. Sputnikmusic staff writer Nick Butler said the album remained an enduring and vital work in a genre that &quot;has a habit of moving at such a pace that records date in a matter of years&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 50 on their 100 Best Albums Ever list, which was voted on by a panel of various artists, critics, and DJs. The following year, it was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s 100 Best Rap Albums. In 2000, it was voted number 617 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; and named in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; as among the decade&#x27;s most essential works. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; on their &quot;Essential Recording of the &#x27;90s&quot; list, and in 2003, the magazine ranked it number 300 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 302 in a 2012 revised list, and number 176 in a 2020 revised list. The record was ranked number 21 in &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot; publication, and number 17 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot;.

In 2004, the Library of Congress added &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. According to a press release for the registry, &quot;″&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;″ brought hip-hop respect from critics, millions of new fans and passionate debate over its political content. The album signaled the coupling of a strongly political message with hip-hop music&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; named it the 96th best record ever in their all-time list.

<text>Aelia Verina (Greek: Βερίνα; died 484) was the Eastern Roman empress as the wife of Leo I. She was a sister of Emperor Basiliscus. Her daughter Ariadne also became empress. Verina was the maternal grandmother of Leo II.

==Family==
The origins of Verina and her brother Basiliscus are unknown. They are considered likely to have ancestry in the Balkans but nothing more specific is known. They are assumed to have at least one sister as a hagiography of Daniel the Stylite names a brother-in-law of Verina and Basiliscus as Zuzus.

Stefan Krautschick in his historical work &quot;Zwei Aspekte des Jahres 476&quot; (1986) advanced a theory that the two siblings were related to Odoacer, the first barbarian King of Italy. The theory relies on passage 209.1 in the fragmentary chronicle of John of Antioch, a 7th-century monk. The chronicler has been tentatively identified with John of the Sedre, Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch from 641 to 648. The passage records the assassination of Armatus by Onoulphus. Based on interpretation Odoacer was brother to either Onoulphus alone or to both men. The second interpretation was introduced by Krautschick and has gained the support of (among others) Alexander Demandt and Patrick Amory. Armatus was identified as nephew of Verina and Basiliscus in other Byzantine sources, including a hagiography of Daniel the Stylite and the Suda. The theory would make both Onoulphus and Odoacer nephews of Verina and Basiliscus.

However a counterargument to the theory is given by Penny Macgeorge in her own study &quot;Late Roman Warlords&quot; (2003), pages 284–285, based on the silence of both John Malalas and Malchus on a blood relation of Odoacer to the House of Leo. Both historians were chronologically closer to the recorded events than John of Antioch.

If accepted the theory of Krautschick would give Verina a barbarian origin. Her ancestry would still be uncertain due to contradictory accounts on the ancestry of Odoacer. Various sources have identified him as one of the Goths, the Rugians, the Sciri and the Thuringii. All four were Germanic peoples, with the Goths, Rugians and Sciri grouped by ethnologists within the East Germanic tribes. His father Edeko was leader of the Sciri but it is unclear if he was born in the tribe or married into it. Other sources identify Edeko as one of the Huns, possibly because of his service under Attila the Hun. According to Amory, the varying ethnographic identities of both men may reflect both their mixed ancestry and their political association with the various groups.

The presence of Verina in the Roman court has been attributed by Demandt to &quot;the osmosis of the late Roman and Germanic aristocracies&quot;. In other words, the practice of intermarriage between the Roman military aristocracy and the dynasties derived from it on the one hand and various Germanic families of foederati.

==Marriage==
Verina married Leo, a Thraco-Roman officer of the East Roman army. According to Jordanes and John Malalas, her husband was one of the Bessi, a tribe of Thracians. Theodorus Lector, Theophanes the Confessor, Georgios Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian report Leo born in Thrace. However the Bibliotheca of Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople quotes Candidus in placing his birthplace in Dacia.

Verina and Leo had three children. Their eldest daughter Ariadne was born prior to the death of Marcian (reigned 450–457). Ariadne had a younger sister, Leontia. Leontia was first betrothed to Julius Patricius, a son of Aspar, but their engagement was probably annulled when Aspar and another of his sons, Ardabur, were assassinated in 471. Leontia then married Marcian, a son of Anthemius and Marcia Euphemia. The couple led a failed revolt against Zeno in 478–479. They were exiled to Isauria following their defeat.

An unnamed son was born in 463. He died five months following his birth. The only sources about him are a horoscope by Rhetorius and a hagiography of Daniel the Stylite.

==Empress consort==
In January, 457 Marcian succumbed to a disease, allegedly gangrene. He was survived by his daughter Euphemia and his son-in-law Anthemius. Leo was at this point the tribune of the Mattiarii, a regiment wielding the mattea (Latin for mace) as their weapon.

Marcian had been proclaimed an &quot;Augustus&quot; while marrying Pulcheria, sister of Theodosius II. Due to the marriage, he was considered a member of the Theodosian dynasty. His only daughter was from a previous marriage and not considered heiress to the dynasty, thus with his death the dynastic succession ended. The Byzantine army and the Byzantine Senate had to elect a new Augustus. Aspar, the magister militum (&quot;Master of soldiers&quot;) of the Eastern Roman Empire, may have been unable to claim the throne for himself due to his Alanic origins and Arian religious beliefs. Though his family had served in the Roman military for generations, Aspar was still considered a barbarian and the majority of the ruling class of the Eastern Roman Empire had accepted the Nicene Creed.

Aspar used his influence in order to become a kingmaker, having earlier engineered the elevation of Marcian who had served a middler-rank officer under him. He was able to pick Leo, a candidate among his own subordinate officers, probably counting on his continued loyalty. The Senate accepted the choice. On 7 February 457, Leo was crowned by Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople, the first such coronation known to involve a Patriarch. At this point Verina became the Empress consort. She probably added &quot;Aelia&quot; to her name at her proclamation as an Augusta. The name had become standard for Augustas of the Theodosian dynasty. During her tenure as empress, she exerted influence over her husband and his court, living a life of luxurious royal comfort and peaceful.

In 461, Leo founded the Excubitors as a counterbalance to the soldiers under Aspar. He recruited the majority of its members from among the sturdy and warlike Isaurians. In 466, Tarasicodissa, an Isaurian officer of the Excubitors came forth with evidence that Ardabur, a son of Aspar, was guilty of treason. The scandal caused a rift in the relations of Leo and Aspar, leaving the former relying even more on the Excubitors.

In 467, the alliance of Leo and Tarasicodissa was sealed with the marriage of Ariadne to the officer. To make himself more acceptable to the Roman hierarchy and the native Greek-speaking population of Constantinople, the new son-in-law of the imperial couple changed his name to Zeno. Their only known son of Ariadne and Zeno, Leo II, was born within the year.

In 471, Aspar and Ardabur were murdered within the Great Palace of Constantinople by orders of Leo. Leo earned the nickname &quot;Macelles&quot; (the Butcher) for the manner of the deaths. Zeno was left by default as the main supporter of Leo within the Byzantine army.

Leo II was proclaimed Caesar in October, 473 and effectively became the designated heir to the throne by virtue of being the closest male relative of Leo I. On 18 January 474, Leo I died of dysentery. Their grandson immediately succeeded him. Verina remained at the Palace.

==Widowed empress==
Since Leo II was too young to rule himself, Verina and Ariadne prevailed upon him to crown Zeno as co-emperor, which he did on February 9, 474. When Leo became ill and died on November 17, Zeno became sole emperor with Ariadne as empress.

Verina was not content in the role of a widow. According to both Candidus and John of Antioch, she found a lover in the person of Patricius, a former Praetorian prefect. Verina had originally supported Zeno while the young emperor Leo II was still alive. Not long after her grandson&#x27;s death, Verina turned against her son-in-law. She still retained imperial status with a portion of the palace for herself, but she still harbored ambitions for her former position. John Malalas attributes her hostility to an argument between them over a request the senior empress had made on her son-in-law. Malalas does not clarify what was the request. A modern interpretation suggests that the request concerned her second marriage to Patricius. Which Zeno had reasons to refuse to prevent Patricius from emerging as a rival candidate for the throne.

Verina conspired against Zeno with her lover Patricius, her brother Basiliscus, the Isaurian general Illus, and general Theodoric Strabo, forcing Zeno to flee Constantinople in 475. Zeno fled to his native lands, bringing with him some of the Isaurians living in Constantinople, and the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was then acclaimed as &quot;Augustus&quot; on 9 January 475 at the Hebdomon palace, by the palace ministers and the Senate.

John of Antioch and the hagiography of Daniel the Stylite imply that Verina was tricked in supporting the conspiracy. Candidus and John of Antioch report that Verina was hoping to use the conspiracy to replace Zeno with Patricius, restoring herself to the position of empress in the process. However, Basiliscus was crowned as soon as Zeno had abandoned the city. According to Malalas, Verina had to crown Basiliscus herself as the only person of imperial rank present within the capital. There is some doubt whether the description of Verina&#x27;s motivation by Candidus and John of Antioch was accurate or just reflected the hostility of the chroniclers to her.

Whatever the case, Patricius served early in the new reign as the &quot;Magister Officiorum&quot;. Eventually, Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new emperor. Consequently, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, seeking revenge for her lover&#x27;s execution. According to Candidus, after the death of Patricius, Verina intrigued in favour of Zeno, but her plan was discovered by Basiliscus, and only the intercession of Armatus spared her life.

In 476, both Illus and Armatus defected to the side of Zeno, who, in August, besieged Constantinople. Theodoric the Amal (later known as Theodoric the Great), the leader of the Pannonian Goths, had allied to Zeno. Theodoric would have attacked Basiliscus and his Thracian Goth &quot;foederati&quot; led by Theodoric Strabo, receiving, in exchange, the title of &quot;magister militum&quot; held by Strabo and the payments previously given to the Thracian Goths. It has been suggested that Constantinople was defenseless during Zeno&#x27;s siege because the &quot;Magister Militum&quot; Strabo had moved north to counter this menace. The Senate opened the gates of the city to Zeno, allowing the deposed emperor to retake the throne with Ariadne as empress.

==Rivalry with Illus==
The brief reign of Basiliscus does not seem to have resulted in lasting hatred between Verina and either Zeno or Ariadne. However it did result in hatred between Verina and the turncoat general Illus. The hagiography of Daniel the Stylite considers Illus responsible for pulling Verina into the initial conspiracy while hiding its actual goals. He was, in her mind, directly or indirectly responsible for the death of Patricius.

In 477, a first assassination attempt on Illus was prevented by a slave. Though primary sources do not associate Verina with it, later historians have suggested that this was indeed the case. In 478, a second assassination attempt on Illus was prevented by Epinicus, a long-time favourite of Verina. Epinicus allowed Illus custody of the prisoner and the interrogation resulted in a confession implicating Verina.

Illus recuperated from the attack in his native Isauria and reportedly refused to return to Constantinople while Verina was still residing in the Palace. Zeno agreed to banish her from the capital and she indeed never returned during her life. According to John of Antioch, Verina was at first confined in a monastery located at Tarsus. She was then sent first to Dalisandus (two namesake cities existed in Isauria and Pamphylia) and secondly to Cherris in Isauria.

In 478–479, the revolt of Marcian, a son of Anthemius took place. He was married to Leontia, the second daughter of Leo I and Verina. His claim to the throne relied on his wife being a Porphyrogenita. In theory Leontia outranking her older sister Ariadne who was born previous to the elevation of her parents to the throne. Marcian and his brothers Procopius and Romulus launched their coup d&#x27;état in Constantinople. They were besieging the palace when Illus arrived with reinforcements from Chalcedon. John of Antioch attributes the entire revolt to Verina but the actual extent of her involvement is uncertain.

In 480, Verina was still confined in Isauria under the custody of Illus. However she was able to correspond with Ariadne and convinced her daughter to intervene on her behalf. Ariadne endeavoured to obtain her release, first from Zeno, and then from Illus, to whom the emperor referred her. Illus not only refused her request, but charged her with wishing to place another person on her husband&#x27;s throne. This irritated her; and she, like her mother, attempted to assassinate Illus. Jordanes ascribes her hatred to another cause: he says that Illus had infused jealous suspicions into Zeno&#x27;s mind which had led Zeno to try an attempt on her life, and that her knowledge of these things stimulated her to revenge. The assassin whom she employed failed to kill Illus, but cut off his ear in the attempt. The assassin was taken, and Zeno, who appears to have been privy to the affair, was unable to prevent his execution.

==Alliance with Illus==
In 483 or 484, Illus rose in rebellion against Zeno. Verina still had her imperial rank and so could still crown another Augustus. He released her from confinement and had her crown Leontius, a general, as an Augustus in Tarsus. The revolt also had religious meaning as the rebels were Chalcedonian Christians while Zeno was an adherent of Monophysitism.

John Malalas describes that Verina joined the new alliance with fervor, corresponding with various cities and trying to win their support for the revolt. However, there is some doubt over the sincerity of both her new convictions and her political &quot;friendship&quot; with her old enemy. She may in effect have still been Illus&#x27; prisoner and acted under his command to preserve her safety. She notably did not join Leontius and Illus in their campaign for Antioch but was sent to the fortress of Papyrius in Isauria.

The revolt failed to gain sufficient support and the rebels had to withdraw from Antioch back to Papyrius. Zeno sent an army including both Romans and Ostrogoths under John the Scythian which managed to defeat them. The fort was besieged from 484 to 488. Verina died early in the siege Whether her death was violent or not is uncertain. According to Malalas, when the siege ended the corpse of Verina was recovered and sent to Ariadne for burial.

==Possible descendants==
The &quot;Georgian Chronicle&quot;, a 13th-century compilation drawing from earlier sources, reports a marriage of Vakhtang I of Iberia to Princess Helena of Byzantium, identifying her as a daughter of the predecessor of Zeno. This predecessor was probably Leo I, the tale attributing a third daughter to Verina.

Cyril Toumanoff identified two children of this marriage. Mithridates of Iberia and Leo of Iberia. This younger Leo was father of Guaram I of Iberia. The accuracy of the descent is unknown.

<text>Weather-related fatalities in the United States may be caused by extreme temperatures, such as abnormal heat or cold, flooding, lightning, tornado, hurricane, wind, rip currents, and others. The National Weather Service compiles statistics on weather-related fatalities and publishes reports every year. In 2016, flooding was the number-one cause of weather-related fatalities, but over a 30-year period, on average, extreme heat is the deadliest form of weather.

The table at right represents a 6-year period and only a select type of recorded weather events. The data was tabulated by running searches on the specified weather events recorded with at least &quot;1&quot; fatality. The yearly timeframes were selected to cover &quot;January 1&quot; to &quot;December 31&quot; of each year for each event type. The table does not provide a comprehensive total of all weather-related events. It is not necessarily a weather event severity comparison, but is more of an indicator of frequency of fatal occurrences for some events. The leading cause of fatalities is in temperature extremes category, which includes heat waves as well as cold extremes.

== Heat-related deaths ==

Between 1979 and 2014, the death rate as a direct result of exposure to heat (underlying cause of death) generally hovered around 0.5 to 1 deaths per million people, with spikes in certain years. Overall, a total of more than 9,000 Americans have died from heat-related causes since 1979, according to death certificates.

== Cold-related deaths ==
Cold weather is deadly too. For example, in the US, 21 people died in a cold wave in January 2014, which also caused property damage valued at US$2.5 billion

<doc id="301999" wikidata="Q1513879" url="?curid=301999" title="Natural language generation">
<text>Natural language generation (NLG) is a software process that produces natural language output. A widely-cited survey of NLG methods describes NLG as &quot;the subfield of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics that is concerned with the construction of computer systems that can produce understandable texts in English or other human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information&quot;.

While it is widely agreed that the output of any NLG process is text, there is some disagreement about whether the inputs of an NLG system need to be non-linguistic. Common applications of NLG methods include the production of various reports, for example weather and patient reports; image captions; and chatbots like chatGPT.

Automated NLG can be compared to the process humans use when they turn ideas into writing or speech. Psycholinguists prefer the term language production for this process, which can also be described in mathematical terms, or modeled in a computer for psychological research. NLG systems can also be compared to translators of artificial computer languages, such as decompilers or transpilers, which also produce human-readable code generated from an intermediate representation. Human languages tend to be considerably more complex and allow for much more ambiguity and variety of expression than programming languages, which makes NLG more challenging.

NLG may be viewed as complementary to natural-language understanding (NLU): whereas in natural-language understanding, the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, in NLG the system needs to make decisions about how to put a representation into words. The practical considerations in building NLU vs. NLG systems are not symmetrical. NLU needs to deal with ambiguous or erroneous user input, whereas the ideas the system wants to express through NLG are generally known precisely. NLG needs to choose a specific, self-consistent textual representation from many potential representations, whereas NLU generally tries to produce a single, normalized representation of the idea expressed.

NLG has existed since ELIZA was developed in the mid 1960s, but the methods were first used commercially in the 1990s. NLG techniques range from simple template-based systems like a mail merge that generates form letters, to systems that have a complex understanding of human grammar. NLG can also be accomplished by training a statistical model using machine learning, typically on a large corpus of human-written texts.

==Example==
The &quot;Pollen Forecast for Scotland&quot; system is a simple example of a simple NLG system that could essentially be based on a template. This system takes as input six numbers, which give predicted pollen levels in different parts of Scotland. From these numbers, the system generates a short textual summary of pollen levels as its output.

For example, using the historical data for July 1, 2005, the software produces:

Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country. However, in Northern areas, pollen levels will be moderate with values of 4.

In contrast, the actual forecast (written by a human meteorologist) from this data was:

Pollen counts are expected to remain high at level 6 over most of Scotland, and even level 7 in the south east. The only relief is in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland with medium levels of pollen count.

Comparing these two illustrates some of the choices that NLG systems must make; these are further discussed below.

==Stages==
The process to generate text can be as simple as keeping a list of canned text that is copied and pasted, possibly linked with some glue text. The results may be satisfactory in simple domains such as horoscope machines or generators of personalized business letters. However, a sophisticated NLG system needs to include stages of planning and merging of information to enable the generation of text that looks natural and does not become repetitive. The typical stages of natural-language generation, as proposed by Dale and Reiter, are:

Content determination: Deciding what information to mention in the text.
For instance, in the pollen example above, deciding whether to explicitly mention that pollen
level is 7 in the southeast.

Document structuring: Overall organisation of the information to convey. For example, deciding to
describe the areas with high pollen levels first, instead of the areas with low pollen levels.

Aggregation: Merging of similar sentences to improve readability and naturalness.
For instance, merging the two following sentences:
*&quot;Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday&quot; and
*&quot;Grass pollen levels will be around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country&quot; 
into the following single sentence:
*&quot;Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country&quot;.

Lexical choice: Putting words to the concepts. For example, deciding whether &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot;
should be used when describing a pollen level of 4.

Referring expression generation: Creating referring expressions that identify objects and regions. For example, deciding to use
&quot;in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland&quot; to refer to a certain region in Scotland.
This task also includes making decisions about pronouns and other types of
anaphora.

Realization: Creating the actual text, which should be correct
according to the rules of
syntax, morphology, and orthography. For example, using &quot;will be&quot; for the future
tense of &quot;to be&quot;.

An alternative approach to NLG is to use &quot;end-to-end&quot; machine learning to build a system, without having separate stages as above. In other words, we build an NLG system by training a machine learning algorithm (often an LSTM) on a large data set of input data and corresponding (human-written) output texts. The end-to-end approach has perhaps been most successful in image captioning, that is automatically generating a textual caption for an image.

==Applications==
===Automatic report generation===

From a commercial perspective, the most successful NLG applications
have been &quot;data-to-text&quot; systems which generate textual summaries of databases and data sets; these
systems usually perform data analysis as well as text generation. Research has shown that textual summaries can be more effective than graphs and other visuals for decision support, and that computer-generated texts can be superior (from the reader&#x27;s perspective) to human-written texts.

The first commercial data-to-text systems produced weather forecasts from weather data. The earliest such system to be deployed was FoG, which was used by Environment Canada to generate weather forecasts in French and English in the early 1990s. The success of FoG triggered other work, both research and commercial. Recent applications include the UK Met Office&#x27;s text-enhanced forecast.

Data-to-text systems have since been applied in a range of settings. Following the minor earthquake near Beverly Hills, California on March 17, 2014, The Los Angeles Times reported details about the time, location and strength of the quake within 3 minutes of the event. This report was automatically generated by a &#x27;robo-journalist&#x27;, which converted the incoming data into text via a preset template. Currently there is considerable commercial interest in using NLG to summarise financial and business data. Indeed, Gartner has said that NLG will become a standard feature of 90% of modern BI and analytics platforms. NLG is also being used commercially in automated journalism, chatbots, generating product descriptions for e-commerce sites, summarising medical records, and enhancing accessibility (for example by describing graphs and data sets to blind people).

An example of an interactive use of NLG is the WYSIWYM framework. It stands for &quot;What you see is what you meant&quot; and allows users to see and manipulate the continuously rendered view (NLG output) of an underlying formal language document (NLG input), thereby editing the formal language without learning it.

Looking ahead, the current progress in data-to-text generation paves the way for tailoring texts to specific audiences. For example, data from babies in neonatal care can be converted into text differently in a clinical setting, with different levels of technical detail and explanatory language, depending on intended recipient of the text (doctor, nurse, patient). The same idea can be applied in a sports setting, with different reports generated for fans of specific teams.

===Image captioning===

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatically generating captions for images, as part of a broader endeavor to investigate the interface between vision and language. A case of data-to-text generation, the algorithm of image captioning (or automatic image description) involves taking an image, analyzing its visual content, and generating a textual description (typically a sentence) that verbalizes the most prominent aspects of the image.

An image captioning system involves two sub-tasks. In Image Analysis, features and attributes of an image are detected and labelled, before mapping these outputs to linguistic structures. Recent research utilize&quot;s&quot; deep learning approaches through features from a pre-trained convolutional neural network such as AlexNet, VGG or Caffe, where caption generators use an activation layer from the pre-trained network as their input features. Text Generation, the second task, is performed using a wide range of techniques. For example, in the Midge system, input images are represented as triples consisting of object/stuff detections, action/pose detections and spatial relations. These are subsequently mapped to &lt;noun, verb, preposition&gt; triples and realized using a tree substitution grammar.

A common method in image captioning is to use a vision model (such as a ResNet) to encode an image into a vector, then use a language model (such as an RNN) to decode the vector into a caption.

Despite advancements, challenges and opportunities remain in image capturing research. Notwithstanding the recent introduction of Flickr30K, MS COCO and other large datasets &quot;have&quot; enabled the training of more complex models such as neural networks, it has been argued that &quot;research in image captioning could benefit from larger and diversified datasets.&quot; Designing automatic measures that can mimic human judgments in evaluating the suitability of image descriptions is another need in the area. Other open challenges include visual question-answering (VQA), as well as the construction and evaluation multilingual repositories for image description.

===Chatbots===

Another area where NLG has been widely applied is automated dialogue systems, frequently in the form of chatbots. A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. While natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied in deciphering human input, NLG informs the output part of the chatbot algorithms in facilitating real-time dialogues.

Early chatbot systems, including Cleverbot created by Rollo Carpenter in 1988 and published in 1997, reply to questions by identifying how a human has responded to the same question in a conversation database using information retrieval (IR) techniques. Modern chatbot systems predominantly rely on machine learning (ML) models, such as sequence-to-sequence learning and reinforcement learning to generate natural language output. Hybrid models have also been explored. For example, the Alibaba shopping assistant first uses an IR approach to retrieve the best candidates from the knowledge base, then uses the ML-driven seq2seq model re-rank the candidate responses and generate the answer.

===Creative writing and computational humor===

Creative language generation by NLG has been hypothesized since the field&#x27;s origins. A recent pioneer in the area is Phillip Parker, who has developed an arsenal of algorithms capable of automatically generating textbooks, crossword puzzles, poems and books on topics ranging from bookbinding to cataracts. The advent of large pretrained transformer-based language models such as GPT-3 has also enabled breakthroughs, with such models demonstrating recognizable ability for creating-writing tasks.

A related area of NLG application is computational humor production.  JAPE (Joke Analysis and Production Engine) is one of the earliest large, automated humor production systems that uses a hand-coded template-based approach to create punning riddles for children. HAHAcronym creates humorous reinterpretations of any given acronym, as well as proposing new fitting acronyms given some keywords.

Despite progresses, many challenges remain in producing automated creative and humorous content that rival human output. In an experiment for generating satirical headlines, outputs of their best BERT-based model were perceived as funny 9.4% of the time (while real headlines from The Onion were 38.4%) and a GPT-2 model fine-tuned on satirical headlines achieved 6.9%.  It has been pointed out that two main issues with humor-generation systems are the lack of annotated data sets and the lack of formal evaluation methods, which could be applicable to other creative content generation. Some have argued relative to other applications, there has been a lack of attention to creative aspects of language production within NLG. NLG researchers stand to benefit from insights into what constitutes creative language production, as well as structural features of narrative that have the potential to improve NLG output even in data-to-text systems.

==Evaluation==
As in other scientific fields, NLG researchers need to test how well their systems, modules, and algorithms work. This is called &quot;evaluation&quot;. There are three basic techniques for evaluating NLG systems:
* &quot;Task-based (extrinsic) evaluation&quot;: give the generated text to a person, and assess how well it helps them perform a task (or otherwise achieves its communicative goal). For example, a system which generates summaries of medical data can be evaluated by giving these summaries to doctors, and assessing whether the summaries help doctors make better decisions.
* &quot;Human ratings&quot;: give the generated text to a person, and ask them to rate the quality and usefulness of the text.
* &quot;Metrics&quot;: compare generated texts to texts written by people from the same input data, using an automatic metric such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE and LEPOR.

An ultimate goal is how useful NLG systems are at helping people, which is the first of the above techniques. However, task-based evaluations are time-consuming and expensive, and can be difficult to carry out (especially if they require subjects with specialised expertise, such as doctors). Hence (as in other areas of NLP) task-based evaluations are the exception, not the norm.

Recently researchers are assessing how well human-ratings and metrics correlate with (predict) task-based evaluations. Work is being conducted in the context of Generation Challenges shared-task events. Initial results suggest that human ratings are much better than metrics in this regard. In other words, human ratings usually do predict task-effectiveness at least to some degree (although there are exceptions), while ratings produced by metrics often do not predict task-effectiveness well. These results are preliminary. In any case, human ratings are the most popular evaluation technique in NLG; this is contrast to machine translation, where metrics are widely used.

An AI can be graded on &quot;faithfulness&quot; to its training data or, alternatively, on &quot;factuality&quot;. A response that reflects the training data but not reality is faithful but not factual. A confident but unfaithful response is a &quot;hallucination&quot;. In Natural Language Processing, a hallucination is often defined as &quot;generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the provided source content&quot;.

<doc id="302003" wikidata="Q1138287" url="?curid=302003" title="Coxsackievirus">
<text>Coxsackieviruses are a few related enteroviruses that belong to the &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; family of nonenveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, as well as its genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot;, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecal–oral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.

Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus).

The entry of coxsackievirus into cells, especially endothelial cells, is mediated by coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor.

==Groups==
Coxsackieviruses are divided into group A and group B viruses based on early observations of their pathogenicity in neonatal mice. Group A coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a flaccid paralysis (which was caused by generalized myositis) while group B coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a spastic paralysis (due to focal muscle injury and degeneration of neuronal tissue). At least 23 serotypes (1–22, 24) of group A and six serotypes (1–6) of group B are recognized.

===A===

In general, group A coxsackieviruses tend to infect the skin and mucous membranes, causing herpangina; acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; and hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Both group A and group B coxsackieviruses can cause nonspecific febrile illnesses, rashes, upper respiratory tract disease, and aseptic meningitis.

The basic reproduction number (R0) for Coxsackievirus A16 (Cox A16) was estimated to a median of 2.50 with an interquartile range of 1.96 to 3.67.

===B===

Group B coxsackieviruses tend to infect the heart, pleura, pancreas, and liver, causing pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver not related to the hepatotropic viruses). Coxsackie B infection of the heart can lead to pericardial effusion.

The development of insulin-dependent diabetes has recently been associated with recent enteroviral infection, particularly coxsackievirus B pancreatitis. This relationship is currently being studied further.

Sjögren syndrome is also being studied in connection with coxsackievirus, .

==Taxonomy==
There were 29 species of coxsackieviruses until 1999, when two of them were abolished and the rest merged into other species.
==History==
The coxsackieviruses were discovered in 1948–49 by Gilbert Dalldorf, a scientist working at the New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York.

Dalldorf, in collaboration with Grace Sickles, had been searching for a cure for poliomyelitis. Earlier work Dalldorf had done in monkeys suggested that fluid collected from a nonpolio virus preparation could protect against the crippling effects of polio. Using newborn mice as a vehicle, Dalldorf attempted to isolate such protective viruses from the feces of polio patients. In carrying out these experiments, he discovered viruses that often mimicked mild or nonparalytic polio. The virus family he discovered was eventually given the name Coxsackie, from Coxsackie, New York, a small town on the Hudson River where Dalldorf had obtained the first fecal specimens.

Dalldorf also collaborated with Gifford on many early papers.

The coxsackieviruses subsequently were found to cause a variety of infections, including epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm disease), and were subdivided into groups A and B based on their pathology in newborn mice. (Coxsackie A virus causes paralysis and death of the mice, with extensive skeletal muscle necrosis; Coxsackie B causes less severe infection in the mice, but with damage to more organ systems, such as heart, brain, liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles.)

The use of suckling mice was not Dalldorf&#x27;s idea but was brought to his attention in a paper written by Danish scientists Orskov and Andersen in 1947, who were using such mice to study a mouse virus. The discovery of the coxsackieviruses stimulated many virologists to use this system, and ultimately resulted in the isolation of a large number of so-called &quot;enteric&quot; viruses from the gastrointestinal tract that were unrelated to poliovirus, and some of which were oncogenic (cancer-causing).

The discovery of the coxsackieviruses yielded further evidence that viruses can sometimes interfere with each other&#x27;s growth and replication within a host animal. Other researchers found this interference can be mediated by a substance produced by the host animal, a protein now known as interferon. Interferon has since become prominent in the treatment of a variety of cancers and infectious diseases.

In 2007, an outbreak of coxsackievirus occurred in eastern China. It has been reported that 22 children died. More than 800 people were affected, with 200 children hospitalized.

Cavatak, a wild-type Coxsackievirus A21, is being used in human clinical trials as an oncolytic virus. SCAR-Fc (Soluble Receptor Analogue) is an experimental prophylactic treatment against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) infections.

<doc id="302005" wikidata="Q33405242" url="?curid=302005" title="Coxsackie B virus">
<text>Coxsackie B is a group of six serotypes of coxsackievirus (CVB1-CVB6), a pathogenic enterovirus, that trigger illnesses ranging from a mild febrile rash to full-fledged pericarditis and myocarditis (coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy).

The genome of Coxsackie B virus consists of approximately 7,400 base pairs.

==Geographic distribution==
The various members of the Coxsackie B group were discovered almost entirely in the United States, appearing originally in Connecticut, Ohio, New York, and Kentucky, although a sixth member of the group has been found in the Philippines. However, all six serotypes have a global distribution and are a relatively common cause of gastrointestinal upset. The name reflects the first isolation from Coxsackie, New York.

==Transmission==
Infections are most commonly spread by the Fecal-oral route, emphasizing the importance of good hygiene, especially hand-washing. Oral-oral and respiratory droplets can also be means of transmission.

==Epidemiology==
Coxsackie B infections have been reported to account for nearly a quarter of all enterovirus infections. Nearly half of all reported cases of Coxsackie B infections occur before the age of five. For the CBV1 serotype, two-thirds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported infections in the United States were for children under one year of age.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of infection with viruses in the Coxsackie B grouping include fever, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal distress, extreme fatigue as well as chest and muscle pain. It can also lead to spasms in arms and legs. This presentation is known as pleurodynia or Bornholm disease in many areas. Patients with chest pain should see a doctor immediately—in some cases, viruses in the Coxsackie B family progress to myocarditis or pericarditis, which can result in permanent heart damage or death. Coxsackie B virus infection may also induce aseptic meningitis. As a group, they are the most common cause of unexpected sudden death, and may account for up to 50% of such cases. The incubation period for the Coxsackie B viruses ranges from 2 to 6 days, and illness may last for up to 6 months in extreme cases, but may resolve as quickly as two days. Infection usually occurs between the months of May and June, but do not show symptoms until October in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions. People should ideally spend 1 month resting during the height of infection. Another cause of this virus is from a dirty wound from an accident.

==Diagnosis==
Enterovirus infection is diagnosed mainly via serological tests such as ELISA and from cell culture. Because the same level and type of care is given regardless of type of Coxsackie B infection, it is mostly unnecessary for treatment purposes to diagnose which virus is causing the symptoms in question, though it may be epidemiologically useful.

==Pathology==
Coxsackie B infections usually do not cause serious disease, although for newborns in the first 1–2 weeks of life, Coxsackie B infections can easily be fatal. The pancreas is a frequent target, which can cause pancreatitis.

Coxsackie B3 (CB3) infections are the most common enterovirus cause of myocarditis and sudden cardiac death. CB3 infection causes ion channel pathology in the heart, leading to ventricular arrhythmia. Studies in mice suggest that CB3 enters cells by means of toll-like receptor 4. Both CB3 and CB4 exploit cellular autophagy to promote replication.

===Diabetes===

The B4 Coxsackie viruses (CB4) serotype was suggested to be a possible cause of diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1D). An autoimmune response to Coxsackie virus B infection upon the islets of Langerhans may be a cause of T1D.

Other research implicates strains B1, A4, A2 and A16 in the destruction of beta cells, with some suggestion that strains B3 and B6 may have protective effects via immunological cross-protection.

==Treatment and Prevention==
, there is no well-accepted treatment for the Coxsackie B group of viruses. Palliative care is available, however, and patients with chest pain or stiffness of the neck should be examined for signs of cardiac or central nervous system involvement, respectively. Some measure of prevention can usually be achieved by basic sanitation on the part of food-service workers, though the viruses are highly contagious. Care should be taken in washing ones hands and in cleaning the body after swimming. In the event of Coxsackie-induced myocarditis or pericarditis, anti-inflammatories can be given to reduce damage to the heart muscle.

== Persistent Coxsackie B virus (non-cytolytic infection) ==
Enteroviruses are usually only capable of acute infections that are rapidly cleared by the adaptive immune response. However, mutations which enterovirus B serotypes such as coxsackievirus B and echovirus acquire in the host during the acute phase can transform these viruses into the non-cytolytic form (also known as non-cytopathic or defective enterovirus). This form is a mutated quasispecies of enterovirus which is capable of causing persistent infection in human tissues, and such infections have been found in the pancreas in type 1 diabetes, in chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, in valvular heart disease, in myalgic encephalomyelitis, and in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. In these persistent infections, viral RNA is present at very low levels, and some researchers believe it is just a fading remnant of the acute infection although others scientists believe this persistent viral RNA may have pathological effects and cause disease.

<text>Sara Trevor Teasdale (later Filsinger; August 8, 1884January 29, 1933) was an American lyric poet. She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and used the name Filsinger after her 1914 marriage. In 1918, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection &quot;Love Songs&quot;.

==Biography==
Sara Teasdale was born on August 8, 1884. She had poor health for much of her childhood, so she was home schooled until age 9. It was at age 10 that she was well enough to begin school. She started at Mary Institute in 1898, but switched to Hosmer Hall in 1899, graduating in 1903. The Teasdale family lived at 3668 Lindell Blvd. and then 38 Kingsbury Place in St. Louis, Missouri. Both homes were designed by Sara&#x27;s mother. The house on Kingsbury Place had a private suite for Sara on the second floor. Guests entered through a separate entrance and were admitted by appointment. This suite is where Sara worked, slept, and often dined alone.

From 1904 to 1907, Teasdale was a member of The Potters, led by Lillie Rose Ernst, a group of female artists in their late teens and early twenties who published, from 1904 to 1907, &quot;The Potter&#x27;s Wheel,&quot; a monthly artistic and literary magazine in St. Louis.

Teasdale&#x27;s first poem was published in William Marion Reedy&#x27;s &quot;Reedy&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, a local newspaper, in 1907. Her first collection of poems, &quot;Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems&quot;, was published that same year.
Teasdale&#x27;s second collection, &quot;Helen of Troy and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1911. It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.

From 1911 to 1914 Teasdale was courted by several men, including the poet Vachel Lindsay, who was truly in love with her but did not feel that he could provide enough money or stability to keep her satisfied. She chose to marry Ernst Filsinger, a longtime admirer of her poetry, on December 19, 1914.

Teasdale&#x27;s third poetry collection, &quot;Rivers to the Sea&quot;, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times. In 1916 she and Filsinger moved to New York City, where they lived in an Upper West Side apartment on Central Park West.

In 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection &quot;Love Songs&quot;. It was &quot;made possible by a special grant from The Poetry Society&quot;; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (inaugurated 1922).

Filsinger&#x27;s constant business travel caused Teasdale much loneliness. In 1929, she moved interstate for three months, thereby satisfying the criterion to gain a divorce. She did not wish to inform Filsinger, only doing so at her lawyers&#x27; insistence as the divorce was going through. Filsinger was shocked. After the divorce she moved only two blocks from her old home on Central Park West. She rekindled her friendship with Vachel Lindsay, who was now married with children.

In 1933, she died by suicide, overdosing on sleeping pills. Lindsay had died by suicide two years earlier. She is interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

== Teasdale&#x27;s suicide and &quot;I Shall Not Care&quot; ==
A common urban legend surrounds Teasdale&#x27;s suicide. The poem &quot;I Shall Not Care&quot; was speculated to be her suicide note because of its depressing undertone. The legend claims that her poem &quot;I Shall Not Care&quot; (which features themes of abandonment, bitterness, and contemplation of death) was penned as a suicide note to a former lover. However, the poem was actually first published in her 1915 collection &quot;Rivers to the Sea&quot;, a full 18 years before her suicide:

;I Shall Not Care
WHEN I am dead and over me bright April
::Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
:Tho&#x27; you should lean above me broken-hearted,
:::I shall not care.

I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful
:::When rain bends down the bough,
:And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
:::Than you are now.

* In 2008, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; was included in &quot;Fallout 3&quot; alongside Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story of the same name. The poem is recited by a robot who has survived the nuclear apocalypse.
* In 2010, Teasdale&#x27;s works were for the first time published in Italy, translated by Silvio Raffo.
*In 2006, Phyllis Zimmerman composed &quot;Four Settings of Poems by Sara Teasdale&quot; for choir, which was recorded on CD.
* In 2011, Joseph Phibbs chose poems by Teasdale for his song-cycle &quot;From Shore to Shore&quot;, and the song &quot;Pierrot&quot;, and in 2013-14 he returned to her texts for his six &quot;Moon Songs&quot;. He has also acknowledged her influence in his orchestral work &quot;Rivers to the Sea&quot;.
* In 1928 and 1931, respectively, Teasdale&#x27;s poems &quot;May Night&quot; and &quot;Dusk in June&quot; were set to music by Marion Rogers Hickman.
* Tony Wright used the poem &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; as lyrics for a song of the same name. It was released as part of a double A side charity single for Help Musicians UK.
* In 2022, Christopher Tin set several of Teasdale&#x27;s poems to music as part of his album &quot;The Lost Birds&quot;.
