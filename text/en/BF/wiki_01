<text>Princess Alice of Battenberg (Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie; 25 February 1885 – 5 December 1969) was the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, mother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth II, and paternal grandmother of King Charles III. After marrying Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903, she adopted the style of her husband, becoming Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark.

A great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alice was born in Windsor Castle and grew up in the United Kingdom, Germany and Malta. A Hessian princess by birth, she was a member of the Battenberg family, a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was congenitally deaf. She lived in Greece until the exile of most of the Greek royal family in 1917. On returning to Greece a few years later, her husband was blamed in part for the country&#x27;s defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), and the family was once again forced into exile until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935.

In 1930, Princess Andrew was diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to a sanatorium in Switzerland; thereafter, she lived separately from her husband. After her recovery, she devoted most of her remaining years to charity work in Greece. She stayed in Athens during the Second World War, sheltering Jewish refugees, for which she is recognised as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; by Israel&#x27;s Holocaust memorial institution, Yad Vashem. After the war, she stayed in Greece and founded a Greek Orthodox nursing order of nuns known as the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary.

After the fall of King Constantine II of Greece and the imposition of military rule in Greece in 1967, Princess Andrew was invited by her son and daughter-in-law to live at Buckingham Palace in London, where she died two years later. In 1988, her remains were transferred from a vault in her birthplace, Windsor Castle, to the Church of Mary Magdalene at the Russian Orthodox convent of the same name on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

==Early life==
Alice was born in the Tapestry Room at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, in the presence of her great-grandmother Queen Victoria. She was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the Queen&#x27;s second daughter. Her father was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine through his morganatic marriage to Countess Julia Hauke, who was created Princess of Battenberg in 1858 by Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse. Her three younger siblings, Louise, George, and Louis, later became Queen of Sweden, Marquess of Milford Haven, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, respectively.

Alice was christened Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie in Darmstadt on 25 April 1885. She had six godparents: her three surviving grandparents, Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse, Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, and Julia, Princess of Battenberg; her maternal aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia; her paternal aunt Princess Marie of Erbach-Schönberg; and her maternal great-grandmother Queen Victoria.

Alice spent her childhood between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother noticed that she was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, she was diagnosed with congenital deafness after her grandmother, the Princess of Battenberg, identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck (later King George V and Queen Mary) in 1893. A few weeks before her 16th birthday, she attended Queen Victoria&#x27;s funeral in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.

==Marriage==

Princess Alice met Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (known as Andrea within the family), the fourth son of King George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia, while in London for King Edward VII&#x27;s coronation in 1902. They married in a civil ceremony on 6 October 1903 at Darmstadt. The following day, there were two religious marriage ceremonies; one Lutheran in the Evangelical Castle Church, and one Greek Orthodox in the Russian Chapel on the Mathildenhöhe. She adopted the style of her husband, becoming &quot;Princess Andrew&quot;. The bride and groom were closely related to the ruling houses of the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Denmark, and Greece, and their wedding was one of the great gatherings of the descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX held before World War I. Prince and Princess Andrew had five children: Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, Sophie, and Philip.

After their wedding, Prince Andrew continued his career in the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt&#x27;s new church. Later in the year, Elizabeth began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew&#x27;s resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.

==Successive life crises==
With the advent of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was reinstated in the army, and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, her brother-in-law King Constantine I of Greece followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King&#x27;s neutrality policy had become so untenable that she and other members of the Greek royal family were forced into exile when King Constantine abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.

The global war effectively ended much of the political power of Europe&#x27;s dynasties. The naval career of Princess Andrew&#x27;s father, Prince Louis of Battenberg, had collapsed at the beginning of the war in the face of anti-German sentiment in Britain. At the request of King George V, he relinquished the Hessian title Prince of Battenberg and the style of Serene Highness on 14 July 1917, and anglicized the family name to Mountbatten. The following day, the King created him Marquess of Milford Haven in the peerage of the United Kingdom. The following year, two of Princess Andrew&#x27;s aunts, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, were murdered by Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution. At the end of the war the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires had fallen, and Princess Andrew&#x27;s uncle Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, was deposed.

On Constantine&#x27;s restoration in 1920, Prince and Princess Andrew briefly returned to Greece, taking up residence on Corfu at Mon Repos (inherited by Prince Andrew on his father&#x27;s assassination in 1913). But after the defeat of the Hellenic Army in the Greco-Turkish War, a Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas seized power and forced King Constantine into exile once again. Prince Andrew, who had served as commander of the Second Army Corps during the war, was arrested. Several former ministers and generals arrested at the same time were shot following a brief trial, and British diplomats assumed that Prince Andrew was also in mortal danger. After a show trial, he was sentenced to banishment, and Prince and Princess Andrew and their children fled Greece aboard a British cruiser, , under the protection of the British naval attaché, Commander Gerald Talbot.

==Illness==
The family settled in a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece and Denmark at Saint-Cloud, on the outskirts of Paris, where Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees. She became deeply religious and, in October 1928, converted to the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated into English her husband&#x27;s defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers.

In 1930, her behaviour became increasingly erratic, and she asserted that she was in communication with the Buddha and Christ. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, first by Thomas Ross, a psychiatrist specialising in the treatment of shell shock, and subsequently by Sir Maurice Craig, who had treated the future King George VI before he had speech therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed at Ernst Simmel&#x27;s sanatorium at Tegel, Berlin. She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Ludwig Binswanger&#x27;s sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was a famous and well-respected institution with several celebrity patients, including Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet dancer and choreographer, who was there at the same time as the princess. Binswanger also diagnosed her with schizophrenia. Both he and Simmel sought advice from Sigmund Freud, who concluded that the delusions derived from sexual frustration and suggested &quot;X-raying her ovaries in order to kill off her libido.&quot; She continued to assert her sanity and made repeated efforts to leave the sanatorium.

During Princess Andrew&#x27;s long convalescence, she and Prince Andrew drifted apart, her daughters all married German princes in 1930 and 1931 (she did not attend any of the weddings), and Prince Philip went to the United Kingdom to stay with his uncles, Lord Louis Mountbatten and George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, and his grandmother, the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven.

Princess Andrew remained at Kreuzlingen for two years, but after a brief stay at a clinic in Merano in northern Italy, was released and began an itinerant, incognito existence in Central Europe. She maintained contact with her mother but broke off ties to the rest of her family until the end of 1936. In 1937, her daughter Cecilie, her son-in-law Georg, and two of her grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend; she and Prince Andrew met for the first time in six years at the funeral. (Prince Philip and Lord Louis Mountbatten also attended.) She resumed contact with her family, and in 1938 returned to Athens alone to work with the poor, while living in a two-bedroom flat near the Benaki Museum.

==World War II==
During World War II, Princess Andrew was in the difficult situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a son in the British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece, lived in Athens for the duration of the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George&#x27;s three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organise soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Crown Princess Louise. She organised two shelters for orphaned and lost children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.

The occupying forces apparently presumed Princess Andrew was pro-German, as one of her sons-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse, was a member of the NSDAP and the Waffen-SS, and another, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, had been invalided out of the German army in 1940 after an injury in France. Nonetheless, when visited by a German general who asked her if there was anything he could do for her, she replied, &quot;You can take your troops out of my country&quot;.
After the fall of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek Jews had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 out of a total population of 75,000) were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where all but 2,000 died. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the Gestapo and deportation to the death camps. In 1913, Rachel&#x27;s husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece. In return, King George had offered him any service that he could perform should Cohen ever need it. Years later, during the Nazi threat, Cohen&#x27;s son remembered this, and appealed to Princess Andrew, who, with Princess Nicholas, was one of only two remaining members of the royal family left in Greece. Princess Andrew honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.

When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and described her as &quot;living in humble, not to say somewhat squalid conditions&quot;. In a letter to her son, she admitted that in the last week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December, the situation in Athens was far from improved; Communist guerrillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When warned that she was in danger of being struck by a stray bullet, she replied, &quot;They tell me that you don&#x27;t hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?&quot;

==Widowhood==
Princess Andrew returned to the United Kingdom in April 1947 to attend the November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s engagement ring. On the day of the wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her family on the north side of Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. Princess Andrew&#x27;s daughters were not invited to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.

In January 1949, the princess founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary, modelled after the convent that her aunt, the martyr Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, had founded in Russia in 1909. She trained on the Greek island of Tinos, established a home for the order in a hamlet north of Athens, and undertook two tours of the United States in 1950 and 1952 in an effort to raise funds. Her mother was baffled by her actions, &quot;What can you say of a nun who smokes and plays canasta?&quot;, she said. Princess Andrew&#x27;s daughter-in-law became queen of the Commonwealth realms in 1952, and the princess attended the new queen&#x27;s coronation in June 1953, wearing a two-tone grey dress and wimple in the style of her nun&#x27;s habit. However, the order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.

In 1960, she visited India at the invitation of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who had been impressed by Princess Andrew&#x27;s interest in Indian religious thought, and for her own spiritual quest. The trip was cut short when she unexpectedly took ill, and her sister-in-law, Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, who happened to be passing through Delhi on her own tour, had to smooth things with the Indian hosts who were taken aback at Princess Andrew&#x27;s sudden change of plans. She later claimed she had had an out-of-body experience. Edwina continued her own tour, and died the following month.

Increasingly deaf and in failing health, Princess Andrew left Greece for the last time following the 21 April 1967 Colonels&#x27; Coup. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip invited Princess Andrew to reside permanently at Buckingham Palace in London. King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece went into exile that December after a failed royalist counter-coup.

==Death and burial==

Despite suggestions of senility in later life, Princess Andrew remained lucid but physically frail. She died at Buckingham Palace on 5 December 1969. She left no possessions, having given everything away. Initially her remains were placed in the Royal Crypt in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle on 10 December 1969, but before she died she had expressed her wish to be buried at the Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene in Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem (near her aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, a Russian Orthodox saint). When her daughter Princess George William of Hanover complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, Princess Andrew jested, &quot;Nonsense, there&#x27;s a perfectly good bus service!&quot; Her wish was realised on 3 August 1988 when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.

On 31 October 1994, Princess Andrew&#x27;s two surviving children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem to witness a ceremony honouring her as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War. Prince Philip said of his mother&#x27;s sheltering of persecuted Jews, &quot;I suspect that it never occurred to her that her action was in any way special. She was a person with a deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress.&quot; In 2010, the princess was posthumously named a Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.

<text>Joseph–François Michaud (; 19 June 1767 – 30 September 1839) was a French historian and publicist.

==Biography==
Michaud was born at either La Biolle or Albens in the Duchy of Savoy (then a part of the Holy Roman Empire and a possession of the King of Sardinia). He was educated at Bourg-en-Bresse, and afterwards engaged in literary work at Lyon, where the French Revolution first aroused the strong dislike of revolutionary principles which manifested itself throughout the rest of his life. In 1791 he went to Paris, where, at great risk to his own safety, he took part in editing several royalist journals. One of those was the &quot;Gazette universelle&quot; that he founded together with Pascal Boyer and Antoine Marie Cerisier. It was very successful until it was suppressed in August 1792 and its editors had to flee to escape arrest. In 1796 he became editor of &quot;La Quotidienne&quot;, for which he was arrested after the 13th of Vendémiaire; he evaded his captors, but was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the military council. Having resumed the editorship of his newspaper on the establishment of the French Directory, he was again proscribed on the 18th of Fructidor, but after two years returned to Paris, when the Consulate had superseded the Directory.
His Bourbon sympathies led to a brief imprisonment in 1800, and on his release he temporarily abandoned journalism, and began to write and edit books. In 1806, with his brother Louis Gabriel Michaud and two colleagues, he published &quot;Biographie moderne ou dictionnaire des hommes qui se sont fait un nom en Europe, depuis 1789&quot;, the earliest work of its kind. In 1811 published the first volume of his &quot;Histoire des Croisades&quot; (History of the Crusades) and also the first volume of his &quot;Biographie Universelle&quot;. In 1813 he was elected Academician, taking up the vacancy left by the death of Jean-François Cailhava de L&#x27;Estandoux. In 1814 he resumed the editorship of &quot;La Quotidienne&quot;. His brochure &quot;Histoire des quinze semaines ou le dernier règne de Bonaparte&quot; (1815) met with extraordinary success, passing through twenty-seven editions within a very short time.

His political services were now rewarded with the cross of an officer in the Legion of Honour and the modest post of king&#x27;s reader, of which last he was deprived in 1827 for having opposed Peyronnet&#x27;s &quot;Loi d&#x27;Amour&quot; against the freedom of the Press. In 1830-1831 he travelled in Syria and Egypt for the purpose of collecting additional materials for the &quot;Histoire des Croisades&quot;; his correspondence with a fellow explorer, Jean Joseph François Poujoulat, consisting practically of discussions and elucidations of various points in that work, was afterwards published (&quot;&quot;, 7 vols., 1833–1835). Like the &quot;Histoire&quot;, it is more interesting than exact. The &quot;Bibliothèque des croisades&quot;, in four volumes more, contained the &quot;Pièces justificatives&quot; of the &quot;Histoire&quot;. Michaud died at Passy, where his home had been since 1832.

==Works==
Michaud&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des croisades&quot; was published in its final form in six volumes in 1840 under the editorship of his friend Jean Joseph François Poujoulat. This was translated to &quot;The History of the Crusades&quot; (1852) by British author William Robson (1785–1863), with a biographical notice on Michaud by American essayist Hamilton W. Mabie. Michaud, along with Poujoulat, also edited &quot;Nouvelle collection des mémoires pour servir de l&#x27;histoire de France&quot; (32 vols., 1836–1844). See Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vol. vii.

In 1875, the famous illustrator Gustave Doré produced 100 pictures for a 2 volume medium folio edition of the &quot;Histoire&quot; which was published by Hachette and Company. A detailed discussion and critique of the &quot;Histoire des croisades&quot; was done by British historian of the Crusades Christopher Tyerman in his &quot;The Debate on the Crusades, 1099–2010&quot; (2011).

<text>The Conseil de l&#x27;Entente (&quot;Council of Accord&quot; or &quot;Council of Understanding&quot;) is a West African regional co-operation forum established in May 1959 by Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Dahomey (now Benin), and joined in 1966 by Togo.

The body grew out of the short-lived Sahel-Benin Union, which was itself created by the four original Council members as a partial successor to the dissolved French regional colonial federation of French West Africa.

Since 1966, the Council has possessed a permanent administrative Secretariat based in Abidjan, the largest city of Côte d&#x27;Ivore. A Mutual Aid and Loan Guarantee Fund exists to assist poorer members from a common pool.

<text>The red underwing (Catocala nupta) is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1767 12th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

This is a large (80 mm wingspan) nocturnal Palearctic (including Europe) species which, like most noctuids, is above and with the wings closed drably coloured to aid concealment during the day. It flies in August and September, and comes freely to both light and sugar.

==Technical description and variation==

&quot;C. nupta&quot; L. Forewing pale grey powdered with darker grey, sometimes with dark grey banded suffusion, and in some cases yellowish-tinged; sometimes the cellspace before reniform coalescent with the spot below reniform, and a space along outer line, before it above middle and beyond it below, are all whitish: inner and outer lines double, black and grey; the outer line less oblique below middle and forming two more conspicuous angles on each side of vein 2, the lower one double, then deeply indented along vein 1 median shade generally clear and produced squarely outwards beyond the reniform, which has a thick black central lunule, a curved black inner edge, and a tridentate outer one; subterminal line pale and dark grey, the paler inner portion sometimes whitish; hindwing crimson with a central black band bent on vein 5, and a thick black terminal border, the inner edge of which is waved towards abdominal margin; — in the form &quot;concubina&quot; Hbn. the red of the hindwing is brighter and the black median band more developed, being broader throughout and continued to inner margin; the lines of forewing blacker and the pale areas generally more developed; the subsp. &quot;nuptialis&quot; Stgr., from Tibet (Ili, Issyk-kul, Ala Tau) and the Altai Mts., has the forewing paler, more gaily marked, the submarginal line white, sharply edged with black; — the subsp. &quot;obscurata&quot; Oberth., from Amurland and Askold Island, is a much blacker form than the average European examples, though specimens from several localities in Europe are also dark: — ab. &quot;coerulescens&quot; Cockerell, named from a single example taken in Essex, has the hindwing blue instead of red; — ab. brunnescens ab. nov. represented by 3 rather small males captured in the neighbourhood of London, has the hindwing dark olive brown; in the ab. &quot;languescens&quot; ab. nov. the hindwing is yellowish white with a faint pink flush; a line example of this, but without locality label, exists in the Felder Collection, and a similar one is recorded by Mr. Tutt in British Noctuae, Vol. IV, p. 50; like other species with red hindwings &quot;nupta&quot; has an aberration in which that colour is supplanted by yellow, ab. &quot;flava&quot; Schultz, to which intermediate forms occur with the red only partially changed to yellow, or yellow only in one hindwing; - in ab. &quot;mutilata&quot; Schultz the black central band of hindwing is abbreviated and becomes obsolete a little below costa; — ab. &quot;fida&quot; Schultz differs from typical examples in having between the subterminal line and the termen a conspicuous dentated white line strongly edged with black; this example was from Silesia; — in the ab. &quot;dilutior&quot; Schultz the ground colour is generally paler, either brownish yellow with the dark markings slightly darker, or whitish grey with a faint yellowish intermixture; — ab. &quot;alterata&quot; ab. nov. (=ab. 6 Hmps.) has the black bands of hindwing altered to grey. — ab. &quot;rubridens&quot; ab. nov. shows the red ground colour of the hindwing running out along veins 2 and 1 in the shape of sharp wedge-shaped teeth, almost interrupting the black median band which is swollen between them into a large horseshoe-shaped blotch; the single example in the Tring Museum is unfortunately without locality; — a strange, probably accidental, aberration from Munich, figured as ab. &quot;confusa&quot; Oberth., has the whole forewing blurred dark grey, with the inner and outer lines and reniform stigma darker but diffuse on a slightly paler median area; the median band of hindwing strongly curved, its outer edge diffuse, and its lower extremity running up. narrowly to inner margin towards base; the black terminal border projecting basewards as long narrow teeth along the veins with the red ground colour running up between them. Larva pale or dark grey; only distinguishable from that of &quot;Catocala elocata&quot; by the absence of the dark dorsal and lateral bands, which are represented by lines.

==Biology==

The moths fly from mid-July to early October. At night, they fly to light sources, but they usually land slightly away from the light. The caterpillars are gray with a reddish tint and begin feeding in May and end in June. The adult feeds on nectar, the larva eat willow and poplar leaves. They pupate well hidden between spun leaves. Hibernation is as an egg. This species and other &quot;Catocala&quot; moths have brightly coloured underwings, in this case orange, red, or pink. These are not visible at rest, being hidden by the dull forewings, but they help the moth avoid predators such as birds if it is disturbed during the day. As the red underwing moth takes off, the sudden flash of colour may confuse the attacker, and when it lands and immediately closes its wings it may seem to disappear as the colour is &quot;switched off&quot;. It is also thought that the symmetrical patterned orange sections on the rear wings form the illusion of another smaller creature (butterfly), so the attacker will go for the colourful &quot;small illusive&quot; rear safe region on the main body of this red underwing moth species.

<doc id="293261" wikidata="Q701048" url="?curid=293261" title="Henri, Duke of Rohan">
<text>Henri II de Rohan (21 August 157913 April 1638), Duke of Rohan and Prince of Léon, was a Breton-French soldier, writer and leader of the Huguenots.

==Early life==
Rohan was born at the Château de Blain (now a part of Blain, Loire-Atlantique), in Brittany. His father was René II, Viscount of Rohan (1550–1586), and head of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, which was connected with many of the reigning houses of Europe. He was educated by his mother, Catherine de Parthenay, who was a woman of exceptional learning and force of character. Henri II was by birth the second son, but when his elder brother René died young he became the heir of the name. He appeared at court and in the army at the age of sixteen, and was a special favourite with Henry IV, after whom, failing the House of Condé, he might be said to be the natural chief of the French Protestants. Having served till the Peace of Vervins, he travelled for a considerable time over Europe, including England and Scotland, in the first of which countries he received the not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth I her knight.

In Scotland, Rohan saw Princess Elizabeth at Linlithgow Palace, Prince Henry at Stirling Castle, and Anne of Denmark at Dunfermline Palace. James VI appointed him a godfather to Charles I. He published an account of his travels as the &quot;Voyage Du Duc de Rohan, Faict En l&#x27;An 1600&quot;, including a passage praising Anne of Denmark and her children.

==Military career==
On his return to France, Henri was made duke and peer at the age of twenty-four. From 1593 onward, there had been negotiations of marriage between him and the Swedish princess Catherine, but in 1603, however, he married Marguerite de Béthune, the duc de Sully&#x27;s daughter, and transferred the Rohan family seat from Josselin Castle to Pontivy. He served in high command at the celebrated siege of Jülich in 1610, but soon afterwards he fell into active or passive opposition to the government over the religious disputes. For a time, however, he abstained from actual insurrection, and he endeavoured to keep on terms with Marie de&#x27; Medici; he even, despite his dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII, reappeared in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont.

It was not till the decree for the restitution of church property in the south threw the Bearnese and Gascons into open revolt that Henri appeared as a rebel. His authority and military skill were very formidable to the royalists; his constancy and firmness greatly contributed to the happy issue of the war for the Huguenots, and brought about the Treaty of Montpellier (1622). But Henri did not escape the results of the incurable factiousness which showed itself more strongly perhaps among the French Huguenots than among any other of the numerous armed oppositions of the 17th century. He was accused of luke-warmness and treachery, though he did not hesitate to renew the war when the compact of Montpellier was broken. Also during this time in the 1620s, Henri was responsible for considerable damage to the ancient Roman aqueduct bridge Pont du Gard while using it to transport his army across. To make space for his artillery, he had one side of the second row of arches of the ancient structure cut away to only two thirds of their original width, severely weakening the aqueduct bridge.

Again a hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted but a short time, and Henri undertook a third war (1627–1629), the first events of which are recounted in his celebrated &quot;Memoirs&quot;. This last war (famous for the defence of La Rochelle by Benjamin de Rohan-Soubise, Henri&#x27;s younger brother) was one of considerable danger for Henri. In spite of all efforts he had in the end to sign a peace, and after this he made his way quickly to Venice. Here he is said to have received from the Porte the offer of the sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his hosts of Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief, a design not executed owing to the Treaty of Cherasco (1631).

At Venice he wrote his &quot;Memoirs&quot;; at Padua, &quot;Le Parfait Capitaine&quot;. However, when France began to play a more conspicuous part in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Henri was again called to serve his lawful sovereign, and entrusted with the war in the Valtellina. The campaign of 1633 was completely successful, but Henri was still considered dangerous to France, and was soon again in retirement. At this time he wrote his &quot;Traité du gouvernement des treize cantons&quot;.

Henri fought another Valtelline campaign, but without the success of the first, for the motives of France were now held in suspicion. The unfortunate commander retired to Geneva and thence went to the army of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. He was wounded and captured at the Battle of Rheinfelden on 28 February 1638. Freed from captivity by Colonel Taupadel, Henri was taken to the abbey of Konigsfeld, canton Bern. There his wounds were treated and he appeared to be recovering, when on 13 April he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died. His body was buried at Geneva, and his arms were solemnly handed over to the Venetian government. With his daughter Marguerite the honours of the family of Rohan-Gié passed to the House of Chabot. His grand daughter Anne de Rohan-Chabot married into the Rohans and was princesse de Soubise in her own right.

==Writings==
Henri&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires sur les choses qui se sont passées en France&quot;, etc., rank amongst the best products of the singular talent for memoir writing which the French &quot;noblesse&quot; of the 16th and 17th centuries possessed. Alike in style, in clearness of matter and in shrewdness, they deserve very high praise. The first three books, dealing with the civil wars, appeared in 1644; the fourth, containing the narrative of the Valtelline campaigns, not till 1758. Some suspicions were expressed about the genuineness of the latter, but, it would seem, groundlessly. His famous book on the history and art of war, &quot;Le Parfait Capitaine&quot;, appeared in 1631 and subsequently in 1637 and 1693. (See also Quincy, &quot;Art de la guerre&quot;, Paris, 1741). It treats of the history and lessons of Caesar&#x27;s campaigns and their application to modern warfare, and contains appendices dealing with phalangite and legionary methods of fighting and the art of war in general. He also wrote an account of his travels, the book on Switzerland mentioned above, &quot;De l&#x27;intérêt des princes et États de la chrétienté&quot;, etc. The &quot;Memoirs&quot; may be conveniently found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, vol. 19.

Henri&#x27;s &quot;D’Linterest des Princes et des Estats de la Chrestient&quot; was published in France in 1638 (in England in 1941 as &quot;A Treatise of the Interest of the Princes and States of Christendome&quot;).

<text>Aberdeen International Airport is an international airport, located in the Dyce suburb of Aberdeen, Scotland, approximately northwest of Aberdeen city centre. As of 2023, 1.9 million people used the airport.

The airport is owned and operated by AGS Airports, which also owns and operates Glasgow and Southampton airports. It was previously owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings (formerly known as BAA). Aberdeen Airport is a base for Eastern Airways and Loganair. The airport also serves as the main heliport for the offshore North Sea oil and gas industry. With the utilisation of newer aircraft, helicopters can reach northernmost platforms on both the east and west of Shetland.

The airport has a main passenger terminal, serving all scheduled and charter holiday flights. In addition, there are four terminals dedicated to North Sea helicopter operations, used by Bristow Helicopters, CHC Helicopter, NHV and Babcock Mission Critical Services Offshore. There is also an additional small terminal adjacent to the main passenger terminal, used only for specific oil company charter flights to Sumburgh in Shetland.

==History==
===Early years===

The airport opened on 28 July 1934 as Dyce Aerodrome. It was established by Eric Gandar Dower for his enterprises including Aberdeen Flying School, Aberdeen Flying Club, and his airline, Aberdeen Airways.

During the Second World War, the airfield became a Royal Air Force station known as Royal Air Force Dyce, or more commonly RAF Dyce. It was the site of the Dyce Sector Operations Room within No. 13 Group. Although fighter aircraft were based at Dyce throughout the Battle of Britain to provide protection from German bombing raids launched from Occupied Norway, it was mainly used as a photographic reconnaissance station. Anti-shipping operations by RAF Coastal Command were carried out from RAF Dyce as well as convoy escort. The airfield was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 26 July 1940 and 27 August 1940, however no damage was reported. A decoy site (&#x27;Q&#x27; Site) was located at Harestone Moss near Whitecairns. The aim of this site was to create the impression of an active airfield during the night. The decoy worked on around four occasions, where several raids resulted in bombs being dropped on the decoy site. The decoy site had a small underground bunker that housed a generator. This was used to power a decoy &#x27;flarepath&#x27; in addition to a rotating lamp to give the impression of a taxiing aircraft. Near the airport off the A96 road, to deter German gliders landing to attack RAF Dyce, the flat areas across from Concraig Farm (between Blackurn and Kintore) had wooden poles erected as anti-glider landing poles. A Supermarine Spitfire IIa crashed at the east side of the airfield on 19 November 1941 during attack practice with a target glider being towed. Flying Officer Zaoral is buried in the old Dyce graveyard, where some German aircrew are also buried that crashed in Aberdeen in 1940. 

In May 1943, a German Junkers Ju 88 night-fighter landed at Dyce; it was flown to Scotland by its crew, who wanted to defect to the Allies. The surrender of this aircraft was of great intelligence value at the time, as it was fitted with the latest FuG 202 Liechtenstein BC A.I radar. The aircraft survives and is displayed in the Royal Air Force Museum in London.

On 17 August 1943, a de Havilland Mosquito crashed following a stall in the circuit, crashing onto 5 John Street in Dyce village; another Mosquito crashed on 10 April 1944 whilst on approach to the airfield. On 26 December 1944, a Messerschmitt Bf 109G signalling intentions to surrender, crash landed at the airfield. On 16 May 1945, two pilots were killed when a Vickers Wellington bomber crashed on landing, wrecking a goods train in Dyce railway station. During air-raids in the Second World War, aircraft were moved to East Fingask beside Oldmeldrum. One RAF building still remains at East Fingask, where aircrews waited for the &quot;All Clear&quot; before returning to Dyce airfield.

The following units have been based at Aberdeen Airport:
=== Post RAF use ===

Virtually nothing remains from the war era at the airport due to expansion and development of the industrial estates around it. The original airport terminal was located at the east side where the Bond Offshore Helicopters Terminal 2 is located, a new terminal was built along with a new control tower to handle the increase in air traffic. The airport was nationalised in 1947 and was transferred to the control of the British Airports Authority (BAA) in 1975. From 1967 and 1970 there were regular flights to Moscow and Toronto; these were later stopped due to cost related problems.

With the discovery of North Sea oil, helicopter operations began in 1967, linking the growing number of oil platforms to the mainland. As Aberdeen became the largest oil-related centre in Europe, the airport became the world&#x27;s largest commercial heliport. Today, Aberdeen Airport handles more than 37,000 rotary wing movements carrying around 468,000 passengers annually. Helicopters account for almost half of all aircraft movements at the airport.

===Development since the 2000s===

Until March 2005, aircraft were not allowed to take-off or land between 22:30 and 06:00 local time due to noise constraints. The city council overturned this curfew, however, despite some Dyce residents&#x27; objections, and the airport is now open 24 hours a day to fixed-wing aircraft with a quota count of QC4 or below, and the overnight restrictions still apply to helicopters.

General aviation flight training for private pilots licences takes place from the east side of the airport. Signature Flight Support also handles most of the private flights and corporate jets that park on the Eastside Apron. An air ambulance (fixed wing) is based on the eastside in a dedicated hangar, Gama Aviation operates the Super King-Air aircraft. There is an additional air ambulance Eurocopter EC135 helicopter based at the airport for use during daylight hours to attend emergency incidents.

Aberdeen, being a major city in the oil industry has a number of oil company charter flights, these have included flights to South America and also Korea (via Abu Dhabi). Flights from the USA are regular visitors as well as the occasional military or VVIP flight.

In May 2011, Azerbaijan Airlines commenced service to Baku, another important city in the oil industry. The carrier flew an Airbus A319 on the route. Five months later, a 124-metre extension to the main runway at the airport was opened, almost eight months ahead of schedule. Azerbaijan Airlines discontinued its flight to Baku in October 2012. On 8 January 2013, the airport was renamed Aberdeen International Airport.

In October 2014, Heathrow Airport Holdings reached an agreement to sell the airport, together with Southampton and Glasgow, to a consortium of Ferrovial and Macquarie Group for £1 billion. The airport handles around 500,000 passengers per year by helicopter for the North Sea oil fields. making it the world&#x27;s busiest heliport.

A total of just under 3.1 million passengers used the airport in 2017, an increase of 4.6% compared with 2016. The airport&#x27;s Master Plan 2013 forecast growth to 5.09 million passengers a year by 2040. A major three-year project (2016-2019) aims to transform the passenger terminal and increase space by 50%.

In 2019 the airport was ranked worst in Scotland and sixth worst in the UK by &quot;Which?&quot; magazine in a ranking of 30 airports for customer satisfaction, with a score of 50%. Edinburgh performed better on 61% while Glasgow International achieved the top rank in Scotland at 64%. In the 2023 edition of the survey Aberdeen was ranked second in Scotland with a score of 55%.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Facilities==
Aberdeen International Airport has one fixed-wing aircraft runway (16/34) which is long and surfaced with grooved asphalt. Three further runways (H14/H32 which is long, H05/H23 which is long and H36 which is long) are available for helicopter use only.

The main terminal has 19 stands adjacent to it. Remote parking is available on other aprons located around the airfield. Four offshore helicopter operators each have their own aprons and hangars, with Bristows and CHC-Scotia located on the western side of the airfield and NHV and Babcock on the eastern side.

Several hotels are situated adjacent to the airport, including Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn Express, Courtyard by Marriott, Leonardo Inn, Moxy Hotel and Jurys Inn. Other nearby hotels include the Hallmark Hotel, Hampton by Hilton, Marriott, and Premier Inn.For flight training, Airbus/Eurocopter and Bristow Helicopters both have helicopter flight simulators in buildings at the airport. Alexander Air also operate GA flight training based from Aberdeen Airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 22 May 1978, a British Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident (G-AWZU) overshot the runway ending up 200 ft into the grass at the northern end of runway 35 (now 34) due to wet weather. All 120 passengers survived with no injuries. The forward fuselage of this aircraft survives at the Jet Age Museum, Gloucester.
*On 4 July 1983, Bristow Helicopters AS332L Super Puma (G-TIGD) crashed on landing at Aberdeen. During the approach from the North Hutton offshore platform, a loud bang was heard, followed by severe vibration. A distress call was made to air traffic control by the crew. Shortly before landing control was lost and the helicopter struck the runway heavily on its side. Ten of sixteen passengers received serious injuries. A tail boom panel had become detached in flight and damaged all five tail rotor blades. The resulting imbalance to the tail rotor assembly led to the separation of this unit and subsequent loss.
*On 31 March 1992, BAe 146-300 (G-UKHP) overran runway 34 after landing during wet conditions with a high crosswind. The pilot failed to deploy the spoilers and ran off the end of the runway. The aircraft sustained only minor damage and no passengers were injured.
*On 24 December 2002, a Swearingen Metroliner III (OY-BPH) of Danish operator North Flying crashed after takeoff from Aberdeen on a positioning flight to Aalborg in Denmark. Immediately after take-off the aircraft was suspected to have suffered a major power loss in its right engine and crashed into a field just to the south of the airport. It slid along the field and through a fence onto Dyce Drive, a main road into the airport, where it hit a moving car and then came to rest. The two crew and driver of the car survived the accident, with only one crewmember sustaining minor injuries.
*On 22 June 2006, a City Star Airlines Dornier 328 (TF-CSB) operating a passenger flight from Stavanger, Norway, overshot the end of the airport&#x27;s runway by several hundred yards as it came in to land. None of the 16 passengers and 3 crew members on board were injured.
*On 16 June 2020, a former Flybe Bombardier Q400 (G-JECK) made a low speed rear end ground collision with a stationary Loganair Embraer ERJ-145EP (G-SAJS), the former becoming wedged under the latter. There were no passengers on either plane and no injuries.

==Ground transport==
===Rail===
The Aberdeen–Inverness railway line and Dyce railway station are located alongside the eastern boundary of the airport. As of July 2020, there is no scheduled bus service between the station and the main passenger terminal which is located on the western side of the airfield. Between 2012 and 2017 a shuttle bus (No. 80 Dyce Airlink) provided transport between the station and the terminal. The service ceased operation due to low passenger numbers, attributed by the operator to lower activity in the North Sea oil and gas industry.

===Bus===
Aberdeen Airport is served by local and express bus services operated by Stagecoach Bluebird. There is a dedicated Jet 727 bus service up to every 10 minutes to the main bus and rail station in central Aberdeen. 747 Aberdeen Airport–Peterhead formerly linked the airport with Balmedie, Ellon, and Peterhead.

===Road===
The airport lies on the main A96 Aberdeen to Inverness road, being only a few kilometres from the city centre itself.

The airport is connected to the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route at the Craibstone exit which is around 1 mile drive away from the Main terminal.

== Future ==
A range of proposals to better connect Dyce railway station to the main passenger terminal have been suggested over the years. A rail link between the two was ruled-out in 2019 as being too expensive, with an estimated cost in excess of £100 million. Options such as walking long distance travelators or covered walkways, bus services or fixed trams as well as the possibility of a railway station at nearby entertainment venue P&amp;J Live are still being considered.

<text>The Noctuidae, commonly known as owlet moths, cutworms or armyworms, are a family of moths. Taxonomically, they are considered the most controversial family in the superfamily Noctuoidea because many of the clades are constantly changing, along with the other families of the Noctuoidea. It was considered the largest family in Lepidoptera for a long time, but after regrouping Lymantriinae, Catocalinae and Calpinae within the family Erebidae, the latter holds this title now. Currently, Noctuidae is the second largest family in Noctuoidea, with about 1,089 genera and 11,772 species. This classification is still contingent, as more changes continue to appear between Noctuidae and Erebidae.

==Description==

Adult: Most noctuid adults have wings with a variety of shades of browns, grays, and other varied shades and colourations but some subfamilies, such as Acronictinae and Agaristinae, are very colorful, especially those from tropical regions (e.g. &quot;Baorisa hieroglyphica&quot;). They are characterized by a structure in the metathorax called the nodular sclerite or epaulette, which separates the tympanum and the conjunctiva in the tympanal organ. It functions to keep parasites (Acari) out of the tympanal cavity. Another characteristic in this group is trifine hindwing venation, by reduction or absence of the second medial vein (M2).

Markings present on the wings of noctuid adults can be helpful in distinguishing species. From the basal location to the outer edge (proximal to distal) on the forewing, there is a claviform (club-shaped) stigma, horizontally oriented with the thicker end closer to the wing&#x27;s outer edge, located posterior to a discal (round) stigma. These are followed distally by a reniform (kidney-shaped) stigma, which is typically oriented with its concave side facing the wing&#x27;s outer edge. It is often not possible to discern all of the stigmata on all specimens or species. Crossbands or crosslines may be present, oriented longitudinally from the leading to the trailing edge of the wing.

Larva: Commonly green or brown; some species present bright colors, such as the camphorweed cucullia moth (&quot;Cucullia alfarata&quot;). Most are pudgy and smooth with rounded short heads and few setae, but there are some exceptions in some subfamilies (e.g. Acronictinae and Pantheinae).

Pupa: The pupae most often range from shiny brown to dark brown. When they newly pupate they are bright brownish orange, but after a few days start to get darker.

Eggs: Vary in colors, but all have a spherical shape.

==Etymology==

The word Noctuidae is derived from the name of the type genus Noctua, which is the Latin name for the little owl, and the patronymic suffix -idae used typically to form taxonomic family names in animals.

The common name &quot;&quot; originally means a small or young owl. The names &quot;armyworms&quot; and &quot;cutworms&quot; are based on the behavior of the larvae of this group, which can occur in destructive swarms and cut the stems of plants.

==Ecology==

===Distribution and diversity===

This family is cosmopolitan and can be found worldwide except in the Antarctic region. Some species, such as the setaceous Hebrew character (&quot;Xestia c-nigrum&quot;), can be found in the Arctic Circle, specifically in the Yukon territory of western Canada, with an elevation 1,702 m above sea level, where the temperature fluctuates between 23/-25 °C (73/-13 °F). Many species of dart moths have been recorded in elevations as high as 4,000 m above sea level (e.g. &quot;Xestia elisabetha&quot;).
Among the places where the number of species has been counted are North America and northern Mexico, with about 2,522 species. 1,576 species are found in Europe, while the other species are distributed worldwide.

===Mutualism===

Members of Noctuidae, like other butterflies and moths, perform an important role in plant pollination. Some species have developed a stronger connection with their host plants. For example, the lychnis moth (&quot;Hadena bicruris&quot;) has a strange mutualistic relationship with pink plants or carnation plants (Caryophyllaceae), in that larvae feed on the plant while the adults pollinate the flowers.
===Food guilds===
Herbivory: Caterpillars of most Noctuidae feed on plants; some feed on poisonous plants and are unaffected by their chemical defences; for example, the splendid brocade moth (&quot;Lacanobia splendens&quot;) feeds on cowbane (&quot;Cicuta virosa&quot;), a plant that is notoriously toxic to vertebrates.

Predation and cannibalism: During the larval stage, some cutworms readily feed on other insects. One such species is the shivering pinion (&quot;Lithophane querquera&quot;), whose larvae commonly feed on other lepidopteran larvae. Moreover, many noctuid larvae, such as those of the fall armyworm (&quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;) and of genera such as &quot;Heliothis&quot; and &quot;Helicoverpa&quot;, aggressively eat their siblings and often other species of caterpillar.

Nectarivory and puddling: Like many Lepidoptera, many species of adult Noctuidae visit flowers for their nectar. They also seek other liquid food resources such as plant juices, honeydew, dung, urea and mud, among others.

As is common in members of the order Lepidoptera, courtship in many Noctuidae includes a set of movements in which the female evaluates the male&#x27;s reproductive fitness.

Most noctuid moths produce pheromones that attract the opposite sex. Female pheromones that attract males occur widely and have long been studied, but the study of male pheromones has further to go.

===Reproduction===

Noctuid moths commonly begin the reproductive season from spring to fall, and mostly are multivoltine, such as the eastern panthea moth (&quot;Panthea furcilla&quot;), which reproduces over the year. Nevertheless, some species have just one brood of offspring (univoltine); among the best known is the lesser yellow underwing (&quot;Noctua comes&quot;).

===Defense===

This group has a wide range of both chemical and physical defenses. Among the chemical defenses three types stand out. First, the pyrrolizidine alkaloid sequestration usually present in Arctiinae is also found in a few species of noctuids, including the Spanish moth (&quot;Xanthopastis timais&quot;). Another chemical defense is formic acid production, which was thought to be present only in Notodontidae, but later was found in caterpillars of &quot;Trachosea champa&quot;. Finally, the last type of chemical defense is regurgitation of plant compounds, often used by many insects, but the cabbage palm caterpillar (&quot;Litoprosopus futilis&quot;) produces a toxin called toluquinone that deters predators.

On the other hand, the main physical defense in caterpillars and adults alike is mimicry. Most owlet moths have drab colors with a variety of patterns suitable to camouflage their bodies. The second physical defense consists in thousands of secondary setae that surround the body. The subfamilies that present this mechanism are Pantheinae and Acronictinae. The third is aposematism, represented by species of Cucullinae. Finally, all adults have another mechanism for defense: a tympanal organ available to hear the echolocation spread out by bats, so the moths can avoid them.

==Human importance==
===Agriculture===

Many species of owlet moths are considered an agricultural problem around the world. Their larvae are typically known as &quot;cutworms&quot; or &quot;armyworms&quot; due to enormous swarms that destroy crops, orchards and gardens every year. The Old World bollworm (&quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;) produces losses in agriculture every year that exceed US$2 billion. Additionally, the variegated cutworm (&quot;Peridroma saucia&quot;) is described by many as one of the most damaging pests to vegetables.

In West Africa, species including &quot;Busseola fusca&quot;, &quot;Heliocheilus albipunctella&quot;, &quot;Sesamia calamistis&quot;, &quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;, and &quot;Spodoptera exempta&quot; are major pests of staple crops such as pearl millet, sorghum, and maize.

==Systematics==

Since molecular analysis began to play a larger role in systematics, the structure of many Lepidoptera groups has been changing and Noctuidae is not an exception. Most recent studies have shown that Noctuidae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is a monophyletic group, mainly based on trifine venation. Some clades within Noctuidae &quot;sensu lato&quot; have yet to be studied. This taxonomic division represents the subfamilies, tribes and subtribes considered so far.

<doc id="293266" wikidata="Q320386" url="?curid=293266" title="Benjamin, Duke of Soubise">
<text>Benjamin de Rohan, duc de Soubise (1580–1642), was a French Huguenot leader.

Son of René II, Viscount of Rohan, and younger brother of Henri de Rohan, he inherited the lordship of Soubise through his mother Catherine de Parthenay. He served his apprenticeship as a soldier under Maurice of Nassau in the Low Countries. In the religious wars from 1621 onwards his elder brother chiefly commanded on land and in the south, Soubise in the west and along the sea-coast. His exploits in the conflict have been sympathetically related by his brother, one of the most highly regarded military critics of the time.

The guidons he seized from Royalist forces when he took control of Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne during the Huguenot rebellions were installed in the Hôtel de Ville in La Rochelle in 1622.

Soubise&#x27;s chief exploit was a singularly bold and well-conducted attack (in 1625) on the Royalist fleet in the river Blavet (which included the cutting of a boom in the face of superior numbers) and the occupation of the islands of Ré and Oléron in 1625, leading to the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré in which Louis XIII recovered the island of Ré. He commanded at La Rochelle during the famous Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628). According to his brother, the failure of the defence and of the English attack on Île de Ré was mainly due to the alternate obstinacy of the townsfolk and the English commanders in refusing to listen to Soubise&#x27;s advice.

When surrender became inevitable he fled to England, which he had previously visited in quest of succour. He died in London in 1642.

<doc id="293269" wikidata="Q577795" url="?curid=293269" title="Charles d'Albert, 1st Duke of Luynes">
<text>Charles d&#x27;Albert, 1st [[Duke of Luynes]] (; 5 August 1578 – 15 December 1621) was a French courtier and a favourite of Louis XIII. In 1619, the king made him Duke of Luynes and a Peer of France, and in 1621, Constable of France. Luynes died of scarlet fever near the end of that year at the height of his influence.

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of Anne de Rodulf and Honoré d&#x27;Albert (1540–1592), &quot;seigneur&quot; de Luynes (in today&#x27;s &quot;département&quot; Bouches-du-Rhône in Provence), who was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV of France. His brother Honoré d&#x27;Albert, 1st Duke of Chaulnes, was governor of Picardy and Marshal of France (1619), and defended his province successfully in 1625 and 1635. His sister Antoinette d&#x27;Albert de Luynes was a lady-in-waiting to the queen.

Charles was brought up at court and attended the dauphin, later Louis XIII. The king shared his fondness for hunting and rapidly advanced him in favour.

==Career==

In 1615, he was appointed commander of the Louvre Palace and counsellor, and the following year Grand Falconer of France. He used his influence over the king in the court intrigues against the queen-mother Marie de&#x27; Medici and her favourite Concini. It was Luynes who, with Vitry, captain of the guard, arranged the plot that ended in Concini&#x27;s assassination in 1617, and secured all the latter&#x27;s possessions in Italy and France.

Also in 1617, he was appointed captain of the Bastille and lieutenant-general of Normandy. He employed extreme measures against the pamphleteers of the time, but sought peace in Italy and with the Protestants.

In August 1619, he negotiated the Treaty of Angoulême by which Marie de&#x27; Medici was accorded complete liberty. The same month he was made governor of Picardy and Duke of Luynes. He had recently purchased the Comté de Maillé on the Loire, about 10 miles west of Tours, and the king erected Maillé into the Duchy of Luynes, which included about 50 parishes and extended to the western wall of Tours and around it on three sides. On 14 November 1619, he was officially received as a duke and a Peer of France at a ceremony in the great hall of the Parlement of Paris. His rapid rise to power made him a host of enemies, who looked upon him as but a second Concini. He suppressed an uprising of nobles in 1620.

===1621 expedition===
In 1621, at the king&#x27;s request, Luynes agreed to lead an expedition against the Protestants in the southwest, even though Luynes had for a long time been opposed to the campaign. As part of the agreement, Louis appointed him Constable of France, even though Luynes had slight military ability or achievement. He was sworn in on 2 April. Luynes received the post in part by default: the obvious choice, the Duke of Lesdiguières, was a Protestant and refused to abjure. Later, after Luynes&#x27;s death, Lesdiguières converted and became constable. Luynes was involved in the failure of the Siege of Montauban (17 August – 2 November), for which he received much criticism, although he had not been the field commander. The Duke died of scarlet fever in December 1621 at Château de Longueville in the midst of the campaign.

==Personal life==
In 1617, he married Princess &quot;Marie&quot; Aimée de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Montbazon (1600–1679), who was 22 years his junior, daughter of Hercule de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon and, his first wife, Marie de Bretagne d&#x27;Avaugour. Together, they were the parents of:

* Louis Charles d&#x27;Albert de Luynes (1620–1690), 2nd Duke of Luynes who married Louise Marie Séguier, Marquise d&#x27;O (1629–1651). After her death, he married Princess Anne de Rohan-Montbazon (1640–1684), the younger half-sister of his mother from his grandfather&#x27;s second marriage to Madeleine de Lenoncourt. After Anne&#x27;s death in 1684, he married, thirdly, to Marguerite d&#x27;Aligre in 1685.

Luynes died of scarlet fever on 15 December 1621, aged 43, at Château de Longueville in Guienne. After his death, his widow remarried to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse (a son of Henry I, Duke of Guise), with whom she had three daughters. Upon Claude&#x27;s death in 1655, the Chevreuse peerage became extinct and the duchy was sold to Marie. After her death on 12 August 1679, Louis-Charles, Marie&#x27;s son from her marriage to the Duke of Luynes inherited the duchy of Chevreuse, and his descendants have held it since.

===Descendants===

Through his son Louis, he was posthumously a grandfather of six, including Charles Honoré d&#x27;Albert, duc de Luynes (1646–1712) and Jeanne Baptiste d&#x27;Albert de Luynes (1670–1736), best known today as the mistress of King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia.

<doc id="293270" wikidata="Q215864" url="?curid=293270" title="Heat wave">
<text>A heat wave or heatwave, sometimes described as extreme heat, is a period of abnormally hot weather generally considered to be at least &quot;five consecutive days&quot;. A heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual climate in the area and to normal temperatures for the season. The main difficulties with this broad definition emerge when one must quantify what the &#x27;normal&#x27; temperature state is, and what the spatial extent of the event may or must be. Temperatures that humans from a hotter climate consider normal can be regarded as a heat wave in a cooler area. This would be the case if the warm temperatures are outside the normal climate pattern for that area. Heat waves have become more frequent, and more intense over land, across almost every area on Earth since the 1950s, the increase in frequency and duration being caused by climate change.

Heat waves form when a high-pressure area in the upper atmosphere strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks. This traps heat near the earth&#x27;s surface. It is usually possible to forecast heat waves, thus allowing the authorities to issue a warning in advance.

Heat waves have an impact on the economy. They can reduce labour productivity, disrupt agricultural and industrial processes and damage infrastructure. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures and thousands of deaths from hyperthermia. They have increased the risk of wildfires in areas with drought. They can lead to widespread electricity outages because more air conditioning is used. A heat wave counts as extreme weather. It poses danger to human health, because heat and sunlight overwhelm the thermoregulation in humans.

== Definitions ==

There are several definitions of heat waves:
* The IPCC defines &quot;heatwave&quot; as &quot;a period of abnormally hot weather, often defined with reference to a relative temperature threshold, lasting from two days to months.&quot;
* A definition based on the &quot;Heat Wave Duration Index&quot; is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by , the normal period being 1961–1990. The same definition is used by the World Meteorological Organization.
* A definition from the &quot;Glossary of Meteorology&quot; is: &quot;A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather.&quot;
* &quot;Marine heatwaves&quot; are generally described as prolonged discrete periods of unusually warm sea surface temperatures in a specific region. At this time the most commonly accepted definition is that proposed by Hobday et. al. which refers to an algorithm that uses percentile values for temperatures, and defines a threshold set as the 90th percentile for a given day of the year, above which one can say a marine heatwave is occurring. This definition can be used with temperature data acquired anywhere in the world, allowing for comparisons across different observations and latitudes.

=== Definitions by country ===
==== Europe ====
Denmark defines a national heat wave (&quot;hedebølge&quot;) as a period of at least 3 consecutive days in which the average maximum temperature across more than half the country exceeds . The Danish Meteorological Institute also has a definition for a &quot;warmth wave&quot; (&quot;varmebølge&quot;). It defines this using the same criteria for a temperature. Sweden defines a heat wave as at least five days in a row with a daily high exceeding .

In Greece, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service defines a heat wave as occurring over three consecutive days with temperatures at 39 °C (102 °F) or higher. In the same period the minimum temperature is or more. During this period, there are either no winds or only weak winds. These conditions occur in a broad area.

The Netherlands defines a heat wave as a period of at least five consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds . During this period the maximum temperature in De Bilt must exceed for at least three days. Belgium also uses this definition of a heat wave with Ukkel as a reference point. So does Luxembourg.

In the United Kingdom, the Met Office operates a Heat Health Watch system. This places each Local Authority region into one of four levels. Heat wave conditions occur when the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rise above the threshold for a particular region. The length of time above that threshold determines the level. Level 1 represents normal summer conditions. Level 2 occurs when there is a 60% or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night. Level 3 arises when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night, and there is a 90% or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day. Level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels. Each of the first three levels gives rise to a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services. Level 4 involves a more widespread response. The threshold for a heat wave occurs when there are at least three days above across much of the country. Greater London has a threshold of .

In Ireland, a heat wave is defined as temperatures exceeding for five or more consecutive days.

==== North America ====
In the United States, definitions also vary by region. They usually involve a period of at least two or more days of excessively hot weather. In the Northeast, a heat wave is typically when the temperature reaches or exceeds for three consecutive days. This is not always the case. This is because the high temperature ties in with humidity levels to determine a heat index threshold. The same does not apply to drier climates. A heat storm is a Californian term for an extended heat wave. Heat storms occur when the temperature reaches for three or more consecutive days over a wide area (tens of thousands of square miles). The National Weather Service issues heat advisories and excessive heat warnings when it expects unusual periods of hot weather.

In Canada, heat waves are defined using the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and in most of the country, the humidex as well, exceeding a regional threshold for two or more days. The threshold in which daily maximum temperatures must exceed ranges between in Newfoundland and in interior British Columbia, though this threshold is much lower in Nunavut, ranging between and .

====Oceania====
In Adelaide, South Australia, a heat wave is five consecutive days at or above , or three consecutive days at or over . The Australian Bureau of Meteorology defines a heat wave as three or more days of unusual maximum and minimum temperatures. Before this new Pilot Heatwave Forecast there was no national definition for heat waves or measures of heat wave severity.

In New Zealand, heat waves thresholds depend on local climatology, with the temperature threshold ranging between in Greymouth and in Gisborne.

== Marine Heatwaves ==

Marine heatwaves have become a prominent subject of research in recent years, reflecting the fact that since the turn of this century many ocean areas have experienced peaks of temperatures, along with more frequent, more intense, more prolonged warming events than ever met on record. The genesis of marine heatwaves is mainly driven by a combination of oceanic and atmospheric factors, often triggered by high pressure systems that will reduce cloud cover and increase solar absorption by the sea surface. Human-induced climate change appears bound to play a growing role in the development of marine heatwaves, with increasing impacts on marine ecosystems, such as mass mortality in benthic communities, coral bleaching events, disruptions in fishery catches, and shifts in species distributions.

== Observations ==

It is possible to compare heat waves in different regions of the world with different climates thanks to a general indicator that appeared in 2015. With these indicators, experts estimated heat waves at the global scale from 1901 to 2010. They found a substantial and sharp increase in the number of affected areas in the last two decades.

One study in 2021 investigated 13,115 cities. It found that extreme heat exposure of a wet bulb globe temperature above 30 Celsius tripled between 1983 and 2016, and if the effect of population growth (increasing the urban heat island effect) during those years is excluded, the exposure increased a further 50%. The researchers compiled a comprehensive list of past urban extreme heat events.

== Causes ==
Heat waves form when a high pressure area at an altitude of strengthens and remains over a region for several days and up to several weeks. This is common in summer in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This is because the jet stream &#x27;follows the sun&#x27;. The high pressure area is on the equator side of the jet stream in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

Weather patterns are generally slower to change in summer than in winter. So, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air sinks toward the surface. It warms and dries adiabatically. This inhibits convection and prevents the formation of clouds. A reduction of clouds increases the shortwave radiation reaching the surface. A low pressure area at the surface leads to surface wind from lower latitudes that brings warm air, enhancing the warming. The surface winds could also blow from the hot continental interior towards the coastal zone. This would lead to heat waves on the coast. They could also blow from high towards low elevations. This enhances the subsidence or sinking of the air and therefore the adiabatic warming.

In the eastern regions of the United States a heat wave can occur when a high pressure system originating in the Gulf of Mexico becomes stationary just off the Atlantic Seaboard. Hot humid air masses form over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. At the same time hot dry air masses form over the desert Southwest and northern Mexico. The southwest winds on the back side of the high continue to pump hot, humid Gulf air northeastwards. This results in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the eastern United States and into southeastern Canada.

In the Western Cape Province of South Africa, a heat wave can occur when the low-pressure area offshore and the high-pressure area inland combine to form a bergwind. The air warms as it descends from the Karoo interior. The temperature will rise about 10 Celsius from the interior to the coast. Humidity is usually very low. The temperature can be over 40 Celsius in summer. The highest temperature recorded in South Africa (51.5 Celsius) occurred one summer during a berg wind along the Eastern Cape coastline.

The level of soil moisture can intensify heat waves in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miralles n/a–n/a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Low soil moisture leads to a number of complex feedback mechanisms. These in turn can result in increased surface temperatures. One of the main mechanisms is reduced evaporative cooling of the atmosphere. When water evaporates, it consumes energy. So, it will lower the surrounding temperature. If the soil is very dry, then incoming radiation from the sun will warm the air. But there will be little or no cooling effect from moisture evaporating from the soil.

== Impacts on human health ==
=== Heat-related health effects for vulnerable humans ===


=== Mortality ===

==== Underreporting of fatalities ====
The number of heat fatalities is probably highly underreported. This is due to a lack of reports and to misreporting. When considering heat-related illnesses as well, actual death tolls from extreme heat may be six times higher than official figures. This is based on studies of California and Japan.

Part of the mortality during a heat wave may be due to short-term forward mortality displacement. In some heat waves there is a decrease in overall mortality in the weeks after a heat wave. These compensatory reductions in mortality suggest that heat affects people who would have died anyway, and brings their deaths forward.

Social institutions and structures influence the effects of risks. This factor can also help explain the underreporting of heat waves as a health risk. The deadly French heat wave in 2003 showed that heat wave dangers result from a combination of natural and social factors. Social invisibility is one such factor. Heat-related deaths can occur indoors, for instance among elderly people living alone. In these cases it can be challenging to assign heat as a contributing factor.

=== Heat index for temperature and relative humidity ===

The heat index in the table above is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature.

=== Psychological and sociological effects ===
Excessive heat causes psychological stress as well as physical stress. This can affect performance. It may also lead to an increase in violent crime. High temperatures are associated with increased conflict between individuals and at the social level. In every society, crime rates go up when temperatures go up. This is particularly the case with violent crimes such as assault, murder and rape. In politically unstable countries, high temperatures can exacerbate factors that lead to civil war.

High temperatures also have a significant effect on income. A study of countries in the United States found that the economic productivity of individual days declines by about 1.7 percent for each degree Celsius above .

=== Surface ozone (air pollution) ===
High temperatures also make the effects of ozone pollution in urban areas worse. This raises heat-related mortality during heat waves. During heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20 percent higher than usual.

One study looked at fine particle concentrations and ozone concentrations from 1860 to 2000. It found that the global population-weighted fine particle concentrations increased by 5 percent due to climate change. Near-surface ozone concentrations rose by 2 percent.

An investigation to assess the joint mortality effects of ozone and heat during the European heat waves in 2003 concluded that these appear to be additive.

== Impacts on societies ==

=== Reduced economic outputs ===

Calculations from 2022 suggest that heat waves will shrink the global economy by about 1 percent decrease by the middle of the 21st century.

Heat waves often have complex effects on economies. They reduce labour productivity, disrupt agricultural and industrial processes and damage infrastructure that is not suitable for extreme heat. In 2016, a marine heatwave in Chile and its subsequent harmful algal bloom caused $800 million (USD) in export losses for the aquaculture industry as salmon and shellfish died off.

=== Reduced agricultural outputs ===
Heat waves are a big threat to agricultural production. In 2019 heat waves in the Mulanje region of Malawi involved temperatures as high as . This and a late rain season scorched tea leaves and reduced yields.

==== Farmed animals ====
=== Infrastructural damage ===
Heat waves cause roads and highways to buckle and melt, water lines to burst, and power transformers to detonate, causing fires. A heat wave can also damage railways, by buckling and kinking rails. This can slow down or delay traffic. It can even lead to cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains.

=== Power outages ===
Heat waves often lead to spikes in electricity demand because there is more use of air conditioning. This can create power outages, making the problem worse. During the 2006 North American heat wave, thousands of homes and businesses went without power, especially in California. In Los Angeles, electrical transformers failed, leaving thousands without power for as long as five days.
The early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave caused major power disruptions in the city of Melbourne. They left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid.

== Impacts on the environment ==

=== Wildfires ===
A heat wave occurring during a drought can contribute to bushfires and wildfires. This is because a drought dries out vegetation, so it is more likely to catch fire. During the disastrous heat wave that struck Europe in 2003, fires raged through Portugal. They destroyed over of forest and of agricultural land. They caused about €1 billion worth of damage. High end farmlands have irrigation systems to back up crops.

=== Floods ===
Heat waves can also contribute to flooding. Because hot air is able to carry more moisture, heatwaves may be followed by extreme rainfall especially in mid-latitude regions. For example, the record-breaking heat wave that afflicted Pakistan beginning in May 2022 led to glacier melt and moisture flow. These were factors in the devastating floods that began in June and claimed over 1,100 lives.

=== Wild animals on land ===
Researchers have predicted that roughly 10-40% of all land vertebrate species will be affected by heat waves by 2099, depending on the amount of future greenhouse gas emissions. Heatwaves present an additional form of stress and evolutionary pressure for species that already deal with habitat loss and climate change.

Species have a thermal range of tolerance that describes the temperatures where they perform best. Temperature conditions that are outside of this range may experience decreased fitness and the inability to reproduce. The species with sufficient genetic variation will be able to ensure some individuals can survive frequent days of high temperatures in the future.

===Oceans===
Marine heatwaves may cause mass mortality in fish populations, especially for species that are better adapted to cooler temperatures. Species that have adapted to warmer temperatures may expand their range during a heatwave. These invasive species may outcompete the native species that experience higher mortality during a heatwave, which disrupts ecosystem functioning. Marine heatwaves have also been correlated with negative impacts on foundation species such as coral and kelp.

== Options for reducing impacts on humans ==
A possible public health measure during heat waves is to set up air-conditioned public cooling centres. Adding air conditioning in schools provides a cooler work place. But it can result in additional greenhouse gas emissions unless solar energy is used.

Policymakers, funders and researchers have created the Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance coalition under the Atlantic Council. This advocates for naming heat waves, measuring them, and ranking them to build better awareness of their impacts.

== Recent examples by country or region ==
===Around the world in 2024===
===India===
===Southeast Asia===
=== China ===
A study found the average resident in China was exposed to 16 days of heat waves in 2023, with more than 37,000 heat wave-related deaths. Besides, the number of work hours lost due to heat stress in China was 36.9 billion in 2023, and China’s citizens experienced a 60% surge in lost safe outdoor activity hours, with each person losing 2.2 hours on average each day. The study predicted that by the 2060s, annual heat wave-related mortality is expected to reach 29,000 to 38,000 in China, with a 28% to 37% increase in work hours lost.

=== United States ===

In July 2019, there were over 50 million people in the United States in jurisdictions with heat advisories. Scientists predicted that many records for highest low temperatures would be broken in the days following these warnings. This means the lowest temperature in a 24-hour period will be higher than any low temperature measured before.

According to a 2022 study, 107 million people in the US will experience extremely dangerous heat in the year 2053.

Heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in the United States. Between 1992 and 2001, deaths from excessive heat in the United States numbered 2,190, compared with 880 deaths from floods and 150 from tropical cyclones. About 400 deaths a year on average are directly due to heat in the United States. The 1995 Chicago heat wave, one of the worst in US history, led to approximately 739 heat-related deaths over 5 days. In the United States, the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events. These include lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.

About 6,200 Americans need hospital treatment each summer, according to data from 2008. This is due to excessive heat, and those at highest risk are poor, uninsured or elderly.

The relationship between extreme temperature and mortality in the United States varies by location. Heat is more likely to increase the risk of death in cities in the northern part of the country than in southern regions. As a whole, people in the United States appear to be adapting to hotter temperatures further north each decade. This might be due to better infrastructure, more modern building design and better public awareness.

<text>Concino Concini, 1st Marquis d&#x27;Ancre (23 November 1569 – 24 April 1617) was an Italian politician, best known for being a minister of Louis XIII of France, as the favourite of Louis&#x27;s mother, Marie de Medici, Queen of France. In 1617, he was killed at the behest of the King.

== Early life ==
Concino was born on 23 November 1569 to family of Giovan Battista Concini and Camilla Miniati in Florence. Concino&#x27;s family boasted a history of service to powerful figures. His grandfather, Bartolomeo, held the position of first secretary to both Cosimo I and Francesco I. Additionally, Concino&#x27;s brother, Cosimo, served as an ambassador to both the Holy Roman Empire and the Spanish court. As a younger son, Concino&#x27;s path was not predetermined. He explored various options, studying at the University of Pisa and even contemplating a religious life as a Capuchin friar. He briefly served under the Cardinal of Lorraine before a pivotal opportunity arose in 1600.

During the marriage of Maria de&#x27; Medici to King Henry IV of France, Concino&#x27;s uncle-in-law, Belisario Vinta, the Grand Duke&#x27;s first secretary, suggested Concino accompany Maria to France to seek his fortune at the French court. Concino, eager to prove himself, embraced the chance. This marked the start of Concino&#x27;s remarkable journey as a courtier, a rare achievement for an Italian during the late Renaissance. While others like financiers and officials had also found success in France, Concino&#x27;s political career was a precursor to that of Cardinal Mazarin in the next generation, symbolizing a shift in the dynamics of power and influence.

== Marriage ==
On the journey to France, Concino began courting Leonora Dori, Maria de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s closest confidante, and eventually won her heart. However, their path to establishing themselves at the French court was fraught with obstacles. Leonora&#x27;s humble background, opposition from Concino&#x27;s enemies, and King Henry IV&#x27;s reluctance to have too many Italians in Maria&#x27;s entourage all posed significant challenges.

Despite these hurdles, Concino and Leonora as &quot;Dame d&#x27;atours&quot; skillfully navigated the complexities of court life, strategically positioning themselves between the queen and the king&#x27;s mistress. After months of negotiations, they were finally married on July 12, 1601, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The queen provided Leonora with a dowry of 70,000 &quot;tournois&quot;, and Concino was promised the prestigious position of premier maître d&#x27;hôtel (chief steward) to the queen. Their marriage contract, reflecting their shared ambition, stipulated a complete separation of assets.

Concino&#x27;s success at the French court throughout his career was largely due to his wife&#x27;s enduring influence over Queen Maria de&#x27; Medici. However, before King Henry IV&#x27;s assassination in May 1610, Concino and Leonora led a relatively quiet life at court, their progress not particularly noteworthy. They had two children: Henry, baptized on July 8, 1603, with the queen as godmother, and Maria, baptized in March 1608, with the king as godfather, both ceremonies taking place in Saint-Germain.

== Career ==
Concino&#x27;s success was evident in the rewards he received: 1,000 &quot;écus&quot; from the king in February 1602, a pension of 25,000 &quot;livres&quot; in 1603, and the completion of Leonora&#x27;s dowry payment by the queen in December 1605. He held his initial position until April 1608, when he was promoted to first equerry to the queen without cost, while selling his previous position for 6,000 &quot;écus&quot;.

However, Concino faced challenges. In July 1605, Don Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, the queen&#x27;s uncle and a skilled military figure, arrived at the French court, becoming a rival for the king&#x27;s favor. Concino&#x27;s vanity also displeased Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, who found the queen&#x27;s excessive affection for Concino and Leonora &quot;odious, not to say scandalous.&quot; As Don Giovanni&#x27;s influence grew, Concino embarked on a journey to Florence and Rome in the spring and summer of 1606, mainly for personal reasons. In 1607, amidst rumors of his potential assassination, the cautious Concino had his horoscope read. Finally, in March 1608, Don Giovanni returned to Florence, having failed to leverage his influence.

By 1609, Concino had earned the privilege of traveling in the king&#x27;s carriage, and Leonora was able to spend 14,000 &quot;écus&quot; on purchasing and restoring their rented palace in Faubourg Saint-Germain. Leonora adopted the surname Galigaï - a more prestigious Florentine family. Concini&#x27;s personality, however, made him deeply unpopular with the nobles and the general populace. Chronicler Pierre de L&#x27;Estoile recounts an incident on May 4, 1610, just ten days before Henry IV&#x27;s death, where Concini narrowly escaped death after entering the Parliament of Paris wearing his hat. The clerks of the Palace attacked him, along with the queen&#x27;s pages who tried to defend him. When Concini complained to the king, the parliament sent ten councillors to remind him of their residence&#x27;s immunity.

== Rise to power ==
After the assassination of Henry IV, Concino&#x27;s ascent continued with his appointment as Conseiller d&#x27;État (counselor of state) on July 26, 1610, though he cautiously chose not to participate in ministerial meetings. The Concinis&#x27; financial gains were also significant. On September 7, 1610, they acquired the right to sell royal offices, valued at 384,500 &quot;tournois&quot;, although the royal treasury later received only a fraction of this amount. Just days later, on September 16, 1610, Leonora purchased the lands and titles of the marquisate of Ancre in Picardy for 330,000 livres from Humières-Crevant family, a transaction facilitated by the queen, who covered the cost and exempted the Concinis from taxes.

Concino&#x27;s rise continued with a series of honors and appointments. On September 23, 1610, he was named governor of three frontier towns in Picardy (Péronne, Roye and Montdidier), marking his first political responsibility, which complemented his new status as a lord and landowner. Just four days later, he was appointed First Gentleman of the Chamber, with a substantial salary of 64,000 &quot;écus&quot;. In February 1611, Concino further expanded his influence in Picardy by becoming its lieutenant general. Rumors circulated that he was prepared to pay a hefty sum for the strategic fortress of Amiens. When the commander of Amiens died in June 1611, Concino was granted the position without cost. His social climb, initially precarious, was now fortified by a military stronghold. He also acquired the office of bailiff of Amiens and, in August 1611, accompanied by a retinue of fifty knights, he journeyed to inspect his new fortress and domain, making changes in command and rewarding the garrison.

== Height of power ==
In 1612, Concino was granted permission to build a small house connected to the Louvre through a garden, further solidifying his position at court. At times, he would emulate the behavior of other high-ranking figures, withdrawing to his estates or fortresses in a display of displeasure until he was summoned back into favor. During these periods, Leonora remained with the queen regent, ensuring their influence persisted. After 1613, the Concinis lived apart but maintained constant contact through letters and messengers. Concino&#x27;s behavior grew increasingly princely. In 1616, Guido Bentivoglio described him as &quot;an arrogant, proud man who scorns everyone.&quot; His extraordinary success bred not only envy but also hatred among many French people due to his perceived insolence. He maintained a bodyguard of forty men, each paid a thousand livres annually, whom he crudely referred to as his &quot;coglioni di mille franchi&quot; (thousand-franc balls).

He used his only daughter (Leonora being past childbearing age) as a bargaining chip in marriage proposals, aiming for powerful alliances with the Count of Soissons, Charles II, Duke of Elbeuf, and a nephew of Minister Villeroy, negotiating a substantial dowry of 300,000 &quot;livres&quot;. His importance was underscored by having both a French and an Italian secretary. His unique manner of speech, a blend of French and Italian, was noted by Bassompierre.

Concino&#x27;s most significant promotion came unexpectedly on November 7, 1613, when he was appointed marshal of France. This prestigious position granted him the title of &quot;excellence&quot; and the privilege of being addressed as &quot;mon cousin&quot; by the king. However, Louis XIII faced criticism for being a foreigner who had never experienced battle. Circumstances soon forced Concino to address this criticism. The persistent rebellion among the French nobility led him, two years after his appointment, to take command of an army himself. On October 28, 1615, he successfully captured the city of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis from Henri II, Prince of Condé. This victory resulted in the publication of three pamphlets praising his leadership, but it also made him the primary target of the rebels&#x27; animosity. When Treaty of Loudun was established in March 1616, one of the terms was that Marshal d&#x27;Ancre had to surrender the citadel of Amiens. Concino publicly agreed through a printed open letter to the queen, and indeed followed through on his promise a few months later. However, in the meantime, he was granted the citadel of Caen and the title of lieutenant-governor of Normandy, demonstrating the queen&#x27;s unwavering support. Concino&#x27;s ambition remained boundless. He offered a substantial sum of 600,000 &quot;livres&quot; for the position of colonel generall of the Swiss Guard. Rumors even circulated at court that he aspired to the highest military office of Constable of France.

== Later life ==
Concino&#x27;s early political maneuvers were indirect and somewhat chaotic, contrasting with the organized political opposition they faced. On May 22, 1615, the Parliament of Paris issued a protest seemingly directed at the Concinis, objecting to both the granting of fortresses to foreigners and the practice of Jewish doctors at court. The killing of a royal official by an Italian in Picardy in June 1615 sparked further unrest. The following year, tensions escalated as the animosity between Concino and the princes intensified. The Concinis were blamed for the arrest of the Prince of Condé on September 1, 1616, which led to their Parisian palace and Leonora&#x27;s secretary&#x27;s house being ransacked by a mob for two days.

Later in 1616, he obtained the disgrace of Nicolas Brûlart de Sillery and a new ministry was formed with Claude Mangot as keeper of the seals, Claude Barbin as Minister of Finance and Cardinal Richelieu as Foreign Affairs Minister. In response to the growing threats, Concino raised and equipped a formidable army of 6,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, consisting of both French and Liégeois soldiers. He fortified a town on the Normandy border, equipping it with cannons taken from the royal arsenal, which he boldly marked with his personal emblem. With this army, he engaged in a skirmish with his enemies, but the encounter proved inconclusive. Towards the end of 1616, his brother-in-law Sebastien d&#x27;Ori Galagai was appointed Archbishop of Tours without even becoming a bishop.

His daughter&#x27;s death on January 2, 1617 particularly affected Concini. According to Bassompierre, Concini confided him and told that &quot;Throughout my time in this world, I&#x27;ve come to understand that fate is not just about beginnings and rises, but also about falls and declines. I&#x27;ve observed that when someone reaches the peak of their success, they inevitably face a descent. And the higher and faster they climbed, the steeper and more dramatic their fall will be.&quot;

==Assassination==
By 1617, Louis XIII, incited by his favourite Charles de Luynes, was tired of Concini&#x27;s tutelage and his mother&#x27;s regency. Nicolas de L&#x27;Hôpital, as head of the royal guards, received in the King&#x27;s name the order to imprison him.

According to an anonymous account published in 1853 young Louis agreed that Concini could be killed if he resisted. Apprehended on the bridge of the Louvre castle, Concini was killed by guards after allegedly calling out &quot;À moi !&quot; (&quot;To me!&quot;) for help, which was interpreted as resistance. The action was the result of a secret plot organised by Louis and de Luynes, which was then executed by L&#x27;Hôpital. Concini had to be eliminated because he was perceived by Louis as a menace—a powerful politician, having a personal army of 7,000 soldiers and important supporters and contacts among the aristocrats of France. After his murder, the Queen Mother was ordered to retire to Blois.

Concini&#x27;s wife, Leonora Dori, was arrested, imprisoned in Blois and accused of sorcery. She was beheaded and her body subsequently burned at the stake on July 8 of the same year in Place de Grève, Paris. Their son Henry remained in prison for five years before being released, provided with a pension of 2,000 écus, and allowed to retire to Florence, where he resumed the title of Count of Penna and died of the plague in 1631. The Concinis&#x27; chattels and estates, in particular the castle of Lésigny and the palace of Rue de Tournon, were confiscated by King Louis XIII and given to Charles de Luynes.

In 1617–1618, over a hundred pamphlets hostile to Concinis were published in France, many of which were translated into other languages.

== Legacy ==
Concino and Leonora supported the poet Giambattista Marino, who arrived in France in 1615 and described Concino a year later as &quot;rich as a donkey.&quot; Marino dedicated two works to the Concinis in that year. Concino was also responsible for commissioning a bronze statue of Henry IV from Florence, intended for the new bridge over the Seine. Their protégé, the doctor Montalto, acquired several rare books for them, including medical texts in Hebrew. Concino&#x27;s patronage, however, was peculiar. Leonora was frugal and not associated with any charitable acts, while Concino spent lavishly but in specific ways. Richelieu observed that Concino did little for his relatives or fellow Italians, suggesting his loyalty lay primarily with France.

It appears that Concino did not collect paintings or books, and no oil portrait of him exists, only a drawing. When their Parisian palace was looted in 1616, for which they were later compensated, reports mentioned masks, costumes, clothes, furniture, and jewels being thrown out of the windows, but few works of art. Concino often invested his wealth in semi-military embellishments, transforming his band of bravi into a private army.

<text>A syndicate is a self-organizing group of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;syndicate&quot; comes from the French word &quot;syndicat&quot; which means &quot;administrator&quot; or &quot;representative&quot; (&quot;syndic&quot; meaning &quot;administrator&quot;), from the Latin word &quot;syndicus&quot; which in turn comes from the Greek word σύνδικος (&quot;syndikos&quot;), which means &quot;caretaker of an issue&quot;; compare to ombudsman or representative.

==Definition==
The &quot;Merriam Webster Dictionary&quot; defines syndicate as a group of people or businesses that work together as a team. This may be a council or body or association of people or an association of concerns, officially authorized to undertake a duty or negotiate business with an office or jurisdiction. It may mean an association of racketeers in organized crime. It may refer to a business concern that sells materials for publication (newspaper, radio, TV, internet) in a number of outlets simultaneously, or a group of newspapers under one management.

==Labor syndicates==
A syndicate, labor syndicate or worker&#x27;s syndicate can also mean a trade union. This usage mirrors the common meaning of the word&#x27;s etymological cousins in languages such as French and Spanish.

===Worker-managed enterprise===

In this sense, the term is also associated with anarchist theory, specifically anarcho-syndicalism, in which trade unions form an alternative to both the nation state and capitalist corporations. Anarchists, syndicalists, and other libertarian socialists use the word &quot;syndicate&quot; to refer to an enterprise managed by its workers. Such an enterprise is governed by a face-to-face meeting of everyone who works there, in which each worker has one vote. Either there are no managers, or the managers are directly elected and recallable. In either case, the most important decisions are made collectively by the whole workforce. This is known as workers&#x27; self-management.

==Crime syndicates==

Crime syndicates are formed to coordinate, promote, and engage in organized crime, running common illegal businesses on a subnational, national, or international scale. The subunit of the syndicate is a crime family or clan, organized by blood relationships, as seen in the Italian Mafia and the Italian American Mafia crime families (the Five Families dominating New York City crime, namely, the Gambino crime family, Genovese crime family, Lucchese crime family, Bonanno crime family, and the Colombo crime family).

==Media syndicates==

In media, syndicates are organizations by name and credit. For example, BBC Radio International is a radio syndicated business. A news ticker, residing in the lower third of the television screen image, usually shows syndicated news stories.

Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips, and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites. They offer reprint rights and grant permissions to other parties for republishing content of which they own/represent copyrights.

==Business syndicates==

A group formed of several business entities, like companies or corporations, which share common interests in a market but usually are not direct competitors. Larger companies or corporations form syndicates to strengthen their position in the market. Internet companies and corporations, focusing on various Internet ventures, tend to form syndicates within their own group, with direct competitors involved. In such cases, they share a certain type of market, like brand management or search engine optimization. They may be syndicated nationally or internationally.

== Sales syndicates ==
A sales syndicate is a cartel with a joint sales agency. Such combinations were widespread before the Second World War. The organizational merger of the sales departments of the individual enterprises caused an increased dependence of the cartel member on the cartel administration. This in trend stabilized these combinations.
Some headquarters and other premises of these syndicate cartels have remained up to the present via their monument status as historical buildings.

==Finance syndicates==
In finance, a bank (or credit union) syndicate, often referred to simply as a syndicate, is a group of banks (or credit unions) traditionally lending a usually large amount of money for a specific purpose and to one single borrower. Syndicated loans are loans underwritten by a bank syndicate and are more common in the US, where financial markets are in corporate ownership rather than private equity markets as in Europe or South America. Syndicates have a lead lender that originates the loan and subordinated lenders that participate in the loan. Servicing, Collections, etc. are generally handled by the lead lender.

==Insurance syndicates==

Insurance contracts (contracts of indemnity) processed under the syndicate form of business organization date to the Hammurabi Code. The notion of insurance syndicate as a process for supplying indemnity was first codified in Lex Rhodia and is still used today as shipping&#x27;s law of general average.

===The insurance syndicate as distinguished from the corporate insurer===

It is canon to the operation of the insurance syndicate that the liability of the suppliers of surplus is several and not joint. This means that members or subscribers at insurance syndicates obligate themselves to a precise individual separate and several liabilities rather of a joint liability. Insurance syndicates are not &quot;incorporated&quot; and may not be incorporated: the US Supreme Court has held in Roby v Lloyd&#x27;s that insurance syndicates have no separate existence.

Today, insurance syndicates seem present in three forms:

===The UK-based Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance exchange model===

Some insurance markets such as Lloyd&#x27;s of London provide insurance coverage underwritten by syndicates of investors who bear the full liability for meeting the costs of any claims. Each member of the syndicate has several liability which is a full and unfettered liability for the costs and expenses for the consequences of the underwriting entered into by the syndicate.

===The US-based insurance exchange model===

In the United States, there are four major insurance syndicates that supply indemnity through the several liabilities of their syndicate names - which are called subscribing members.

* United Services Automobile Association;

* Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club;
* Erie Indemnity Company;
* Farmers Group Inc;

These types of insurance syndicates are operated by Attorneys-in-Fact.

==Unregulated governmental and industrial insurance syndicates==

Typically these arrangements are neither public nor regulated and as such they are hard to describe and attribute. However, thousands of such arrangements in existence around the world where risks are shared by affinity/governmental/industrial groups on a several liability basis.

==Lottery syndicates==
Lottery syndicates are formed to pool tickets thus increasing the chances of winning. Lottery syndicates are more common in the UK and Europe in general. They are legal in the US, but legal problems are regularly reported.

== Crowdfunding ==
Researchers argue that syndicates may reduce the potential for market failure in crowdfunding, a method that allows creators to raise funds for projects from many different investors through online platforms. Equity crowdfunding allows creators to issue equity to investors when they make an investment in the project. In equity crowdfunding, information asymmetry between the creator and investor may result in a variety of problems and, in some cases, market failure.

A syndicate can be started by an individual, angel investor, or venture capitalist. An individual who wants to form a syndicate creates an investment strategy and discloses it on a crowdfunding platform. Other investors can choose to back the individual, who is the leader. The backing investors must follow the leader&#x27;s investment strategy and pay them a fee. Syndicates do not exist on all equity crowdfunding platforms.

<text>&quot;Rabid Dog&quot; is the twelfth episode of the fifth season of the American television drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, and the 58th overall episode of the series. Written and directed by Sam Catlin, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 1, 2013.

== Plot ==
Walter White cautiously examines his house in search of Jesse Pinkman, who broke in and doused it in gasoline. Jesse is absent, but Walt finds white powder in Saul Goodman&#x27;s crashed car, suspecting that Jesse is high on meth. After a cleaning crew cannot fully remove the gasoline scent, Walt douses his clothing and the seats of his car with it, concocting a fabrication about a pump malfunction at the gas station. Skyler and Walter White Jr. are doubtful for different reasons. Walter Jr thinks he fainted again due to the Cancer, whereas Skyler thinks something more sinister. The family moves into a hotel until the carpet and flooring can be replaced.

Walt secretly meets with Saul and Patrick Kuby in the hotel&#x27;s parking lot, asking for an update on Jesse&#x27;s whereabouts. Saul hints at the possibility of killing Jesse, but Walt rejects the idea. Back in their hotel room, Skyler confronts Walt over his lies, having just seen him with Saul. Walt confesses that Jesse is upset and tried to burn down their house, but he is not concerned since Jesse decided against it. A shocked Skyler presses Walt to kill Jesse, who she views as a threat to their safety.

A flashback reveals Hank Schrader trailed Jesse to Walt&#x27;s residence after Jesse assaulted Saul, talking Jesse out of torching the house. Hank convinces Jesse to work together to bring Walt down, leaving moments before Walt arrived. Marie talks to her therapist about her issues with Walt but will not disclose the full extent of his criminality. Hank keeps Jesse at their house because he believes Jesse is more protected there; Marie agrees once Hank tells her that Jesse&#x27;s involvement is bad for Walt. Hank and Steve Gomez tape Jesse as he recounts his history with Walt. Since there is no physical evidence, and Walt has left the meth business, Hank needs something incriminating enough to take to the authorities.

Walt leaves a voicemail for Jesse, asking to meet in a plaza to reconcile over Brock Cantillo&#x27;s poisoning. Hank coerces the reluctant Jesse to comply and retrieve appropriate evidence against Walt, despite Jesse&#x27;s fear for his own safety. Hank reassures Jesse by recounting Walt&#x27;s previous attempts to protect him at his own expense and states that since the meeting is in a public place, he will be safe. However, privately with Gomez, Hank is indifferent to Jesse risking his death; if Jesse is killed on camera, it can still be used as evidence.

Wired for sound, Jesse goes to meet with Walt but backs down after mistaking a nearby pedestrian for a hitman. Angered, Jesse goes to a pay phone to call Walt and threatens him, telling him that he will &quot;get him where he really lives.&quot; Hank berates Jesse for blowing the plan, but Jesse calmly informs him that he has a better strategy in mind. Meanwhile, Walt calls Todd, requesting another hit from his uncle, Jack.

<doc id="293283" wikidata="Q444857" url="?curid=293283" title="Pauline Oliveros">
<text>Pauline Oliveros (May 30, 1932 – November 24, 2016) was an American composer, accordionist and a central figure in the development of post-war experimental and electronic music.

She was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the 1960s, and served as its director. She taught music at Mills College, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros authored books, formulated new music theories, and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of &quot;deep listening&quot; and &quot;sonic awareness&quot;, drawing on metaphors from cybernetics. She was an Eyebeam resident.

==Early life and education==
Oliveros was born in Houston, Texas in 1932. She was of Tejana descent. She started to play music as early as kindergarten, and at nine years of age she began to play the accordion, received from her mother, a pianist, because of its popularity in the 1940s. She later went on to learn violin, piano, tuba and French horn for grade school and college music. At the age of sixteen she resolved to become a composer.

Oliveros arrived in California and supported herself with a day job, and supplemented this by giving accordion lessons. From there Oliveros went on to attend Moores School of Music at the University of Houston, studying with Willard A. Palmer. 
While attending the University of Houston, she was a member of the band program and helped form the Tau chapter of Tau Beta Sigma Honorary Band Sorority.

She earned a BFA degree in composition from San Francisco State College, where her teachers included composer Robert Erickson, with whom she had private lessons and who mentored her for six to seven years. This is also where she met artists Terry Riley, Stuart Dempster and Loren Rush.

==Career==
When Oliveros turned 21, she obtained her first tape recording deck, which led to her creating her own pieces and future projects in this field. Oliveros was one of the original members of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was an important resource for electronic music on the U.S. West Coast during the 1960s. The Center later moved to Mills College, with Oliveros serving as its first director; it was renamed the Center for Contemporary Music.

Oliveros often improvised with the &quot;Expanded Instrument System&quot;, an electronic signal processing system she designed, in her performances and recordings. Oliveros held Honorary Doctorates in Music from the University of Maryland (Baltimore County), Mills College (Oakland, California), and De Montfort University (Leicester, England, UK).

In 1967, Oliveros left Mills to take a faculty music department position at the University of California, San Diego. There, Oliveros met theoretical physicist and karate master Lester Ingber, with whom she collaborated in defining the attentional process as applied to music listening. She also studied karate under Ingber, achieving black belt level. In 1973, Oliveros conducted studies at the university&#x27;s one-year-old Center for Music Experiment; she served as the center&#x27;s director from 1976 to 1979. In 1981, to escape creative constriction, she left her tenured position as full Professor of Music at University of California, San Diego and relocated to upstate New York to become an independent composer, performer, and consultant.

In 1987, Oliveros had the tuning of her accordion changed from equal temperament to just intonation. She sings and plays the retuned accordion (without electronics) in the 1993 opera &quot;Agamemnon&quot;.

Oliveros was a member of Avatar Orchestra Metaverse, a global collaboration of composers, artists and musicians that approaches the virtual reality platform &quot;Second Life&quot; as an instrument itself.

==Deep listening==

In 1988, as a result of descending into the Dan Harpole underground cistern in Port Townsend, Washington, to make a recording, Oliveros coined the term &quot;deep listening&quot;—a pun that has blossomed into &quot;an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation. This aesthetic is designed to inspire both trained and untrained performers to practice the art of listening and responding to environmental conditions in solo and ensemble situations&quot;. Dempster, Oliveros and Panaiotis then formed the Deep Listening Band, and deep listening became a program of the Pauline Oliveros Foundation, founded in 1985. The Deep Listening program includes annual listening retreats in Europe, New Mexico and in upstate New York, as well as apprenticeship and certification programs. The Pauline Oliveros Foundation changed its name to Deep Listening Institute, Ltd., in 2005. The Deep Listening Band, which included Oliveros, David Gamper (1947–2011) and Stuart Dempster, specializes in performing and recording in resonant or reverberant spaces such as caves, cathedrals and huge underground cisterns. They have collaborated with Ellen Fullman and her long-string instrument, as well as countless other musicians, dancers and performers. The Center for Deep Listening at Rensselaer (CDL@RPI), initially under the direction of Tomie Hahn, is now established and is the steward of the former Deep Listening Institute. A celebratory concert was held on March 11, 2015, at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Stephanie Loveless is the current director of the CDL@RPI.

==Sonic awareness==

Heidi Von Gunden names a new musical theory developed by Oliveros, &quot;sonic awareness&quot;, and describes it as &quot;the ability to consciously focus attention upon environmental and musical sound&quot;, requiring &quot;continual alertness and an inclination to be always listening&quot; and which she describes as comparable to John Berger&#x27;s concept of visual consciousness (as in his &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot;). Oliveros discusses this theory in the &quot;Introductions&quot; to her &quot;Sonic Meditations&quot; and in articles. Von Gunden describes sonic awareness as &quot;a synthesis of the psychology of consciousness, the physiology of the martial arts, and the sociology of the feminist movement&quot;, and describes two ways of processing information, &quot;attention and awareness&quot;, or focal attention and global attention, which may be represented by a dot and circle, respectively, a symbol Oliveros commonly employs in compositions such as &quot;Rose Moon&quot; (1977) and &quot;El Rilicario de los Animales&quot; (1979). (The titles of Oliveros&#x27; pieces &quot;Rose Moon&quot; and &quot;Rose Mountain&quot; refer to her romantic partner Linda Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.) Later this representation was expanded, with the symbol quartered and the quarters representing &quot;actively making sound&quot;, &quot;actually imagining sound&quot;, &quot;listening to present sound&quot; and &quot;remembering past sound&quot;, with this model used in &quot;Sonic Meditations&quot;. Practice of the theory creates &quot;complex sound masses possessing a strong tonal center&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was openly lesbian. In 1975 Oliveros met her eventual partner, performance artist Linda Montano. The titles of Oliveros&#x27; pieces &quot;Rose Moon&quot; and &quot;Rose Mountain&quot; refer to Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time. In her later years, Oliveros developed a 32-year romantic partnership and creative collaboration with sound artist IONE (Carole Lewis). The couple worked together on several major musical theatre productions, dance operas, and films. They were influential figures in their community. Sound artist and experimental turntablist Maria Chavez, a friend and mentee of Pauline, describes Pauline and Ione: &quot;when you saw them together, you saw love.&quot;

She was also a patron of Soundart Radio in Dartington, Devon.

==Death==
She died in 2016 in Kingston, New York.

<text>Tuskegee University (Tuskegee or TU; formerly known as the Tuskegee Institute) is a private, historically black land-grant university in Tuskegee, Alabama, United States. It was founded on July 4, 1881 by the Alabama Legislature.

The campus was designated as the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site by the National Park Service in 1974. The university has been home to a number of important African American figures, including founder and first principal/president Booker T. Washington, scientist George Washington Carver and World War II&#x27;s Tuskegee Airmen.

Tuskegee University offers 43 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, including a five-year accredited professional degree program in architecture, 17 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 5 doctoral degree programs, including the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Tuskegee is home to nearly 3,000 students from around the U.S. and over 30 countries.

Tuskegee&#x27;s campus was designed by architect Robert Robinson Taylor, the first African-American to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in conjunction with David Williston, the first professionally trained African-American landscape architect.

==History==

===Planning and establishment===

The school was founded on July 4, 1881, as the Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers. This was a result of an agreement made during the 1880 elections in Macon County between a former Confederate Colonel, W.F. Foster, who was a candidate for re-election to the Alabama Senate, and a local black Leader, Lewis Adams. W.F. Foster offered that, if Adams could persuade the black constituents to vote for Foster, then Foster, if elected, would push the state of Alabama to establish a school for black people in the county. The majority of Macon County&#x27;s population was black, so black constituents had political power. Adams succeeded and Foster followed through with the school.
The school became a part of the expansion of higher education for black people in the former Confederate states following the American Civil War, with many schools founded by the northern American Missionary Association. A teachers&#x27; school was the dream of Lewis Adams, a former slave, and George W. Campbell, a banker, merchant, and former slaveholder, who shared a commitment to the education of black people. Despite lacking formal education, Adams could read, write, and speak several languages. He was an experienced tinsmith, harness-maker, and shoemaker and was a Prince Hall Freemason, an acknowledged leader of the African-American community in Macon County, Alabama.

Adams and Campbell had secured $2,000 from the State of Alabama for teachers&#x27; salaries but nothing for land, buildings, or equipment. Adams, Campbell (replacing Thomas Dryer, who died after his appointment), and M. B. Swanson formed Tuskegee&#x27;s first board of commissioners. Campbell wrote to the Hampton Institute in Virginia, requesting the recommendation of a teacher for their new school. Samuel C. Armstrong, the Hampton principal and a former Union general, recommended 25-year-old Booker T. Washington, an alumnus and teacher at Hampton.
As the newly hired principal in Tuskegee, Booker T. Washington began classes for his new school in a rundown church and shanty. The following year (1882), he purchased a former plantation of 100 acres in size. In 1973 the Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University, did an oral history interview with Annie Lou &quot;Bama&quot; Miller. In that interview she indicated that her grandmother sold the original 100 acres of land to Booker T. Washington. That oral history interview is located at the Tuskegee University archives. The earliest campus buildings were constructed on that property, usually by students as part of their work-study. By the start of the 20th century, the Tuskegee Institute occupied nearly 2,300 acres.

Based on his experience at the Hampton Institute, Washington intended to train students in skills, morals, and religious life, in addition to academic subjects. Washington urged the teachers he trained &quot;to return to the plantation districts and show the people there how to put new energy and new ideas into farming as well as into the intellectual and moral and religious life of the people.&quot; Washington&#x27;s second wife Olivia A. Davidson, was instrumental to Tuskegee&#x27;s success. As assistant principal, she worked with Washington to raise funds from donors in Massachusetts, and within a few months, they had raised enough to purchase a farm and construct a large school building.

Gradually, a rural extension program was developed, to take progressive ideas and training to those who could not come to the campus. Tuskegee alumni founded smaller schools and colleges throughout the South; they continued to emphasize teacher training.

===Booker T. Washington&#x27;s leadership===


As a young free man after the Civil War, Washington sought a formal education. He worked his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (now Hampton University) and attended college at Wayland Seminary in Washington, DC (now Virginia Union University). He returned to Hampton as a teacher.

Hired as principal of the new normal school (for the training of teachers) in Tuskegee, Alabama, Booker T. Washington opened his school on July 4, 1881, on the grounds of the Butler Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The following year, he bought the grounds of a former plantation, out of which he expanded the institute in the decades that followed.

The school expressed Washington&#x27;s dedication to the pursuit of self-reliance. In addition to training teachers, he also taught the practical skills needed for his students to succeed at farming or other trades typical of the rural South, where most of them came from. He wanted his students to see labor as practical, but also as beautiful and dignified. As part of their work-study programs, students constructed most of the new buildings. Many students earned all or part of their expenses through the construction, agricultural, and domestic work associated with the campus, as they reared livestock and raised crops, as well as producing other goods.

The continuing expansion of black education took place against a background of increased violence against blacks in the South, after Democrats regained power in state governments and imposed white supremacy in society. They instituted legal racial segregation and a variety of Jim Crow laws, after disfranchising most blacks by constitutional amendments and electoral rules from 1890 until 1964. Against this background, Washington&#x27;s vision, as expressed in his &quot;Atlanta Compromise&quot; speech, became controversial and was challenged by new leaders, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, who argued that blacks should have opportunities for study in classical academic programs, as well as vocational institutes. In the early twentieth century, Du Bois envisioned the rise of &quot;the Talented Tenth&quot; to lead African Americans.

Washington gradually attracted notable scholars to Tuskegee, including the botanist George Washington Carver, one of the university&#x27;s most renowned professors.

===1881–1900===
Perceived as a spokesman for black &quot;industrial&quot; education, Washington developed a network of wealthy American philanthropists who donated to the school, such as Andrew Carnegie (funding a library building), Collis P. Huntington, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Huttleston Rogers, George Eastman, and Elizabeth Milbank Anderson. An early champion of the concept of matching funds, Henry H. Rogers was a major anonymous contributor to Tuskegee and dozens of other black schools for more than fifteen years. There is some discussion as to whether his strong support for &quot;industrial&quot; education was fully earnest or at least partly a strategy to attract such large donors, as he thought the idea of an &quot;industrial&quot; college would appeal to them. Publication of the article &quot;Industrial Education of the Negro&quot; in a leading magazine designed for African-American readers is one piece of evidence against this claim.

Thanks to recruitment efforts on the island and contacts with the U.S. military, Tuskegee had a particularly large population of Afro-Cuban students during these years. Following small-scale recruitments prior to the 1898–99 school year, the university quickly gained popularity among ambitious Afro-Cubans. In the first three decades of the school&#x27;s existence, dozens of Afro-Cubans enrolled at Tuskegee each year, becoming the largest population of foreign students at the school.

===1900–1915===
Washington developed a major relationship with Julius Rosenwald, a self-made man who rose to the top of Sears, Roebuck and Company in Chicago, Illinois. He had long been concerned about the lack of educational resources for blacks, especially in the South. After meeting with Washington, Rosenwald agreed to serve on Tuskegee&#x27;s board of directors. He also worked with Washington to stimulate funding to train teachers&#x27; schools such as Tuskegee and Hampton institutes.

Washington was a tireless fundraiser for the institute. In 1905 he kicked off an endowment campaign, raising money all over America in 1906 for the 25th anniversary of the institution. Along with wealthy donors, he gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall in New York on January 23, 1906, called the Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture, in which Mark Twain spoke.

Beginning with a pilot program in 1912, Rosenwald created model rural schools and stimulated construction of new schools across the South. Tuskegee architects developed the model plans, and some students helped build the schools. Rosenwald created a fund but required communities to raise matching funds, to encourage local collaboration between blacks and whites. Rosenwald and Washington stimulated the construction and operation of more than 5,000 small community schools and supporting resources for the education of blacks throughout the rural the South into the 1930s.

Despite his travels and widespread work, Washington continued as principal of Tuskegee. Concerned about the educator&#x27;s health, Rosenwald encouraged him to slow his pace. In 1915, Washington died at the age of 59, as a result of high blood pressure. At his death, Tuskegee&#x27;s endowment exceeded US$1.5 million. He was buried on the campus near the chapel.
Tuskegee, in cooperation with church missionary activity, work to set up industrial training programs in Africa.

===1915–1940===

After Washington&#x27;s death, he was succeeded as principal by Robert Russa Moton for the next 20 years.

The years after World War I challenged the basis of the Tuskegee Institute. Teaching was still seen as a critical calling, but southern society was changing rapidly. Attracted by the growth of industrial jobs in the North, including the rapid expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, suffering job losses because of the boll weevil and increasing mechanization of agriculture, and fleeing extra-legal violence, hundreds of thousands of rural blacks moved from the South to Northern and Midwestern industrial cities in the Great Migration. A total of 1.5 million moved during this period. In the South, industrialization was occurring in cities such as Birmingham, Alabama and other booming areas. The programs at Tuskegee, based on an agricultural economy, had to change. During and after World War II, migration to the North continued, with California added as a destination because of its defense industries. A total of 5 million black Southerners moved out of the South from 1940 to 1970.

===United States Public Health Service syphilis experiment===
Tuskegee Institute had become a center for medical excellence, with the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital (the first full service hospital in the nation developed and operated by African Americans) and the Tuskegee Veterans Hospital (the only ever U.S. African American staffed Veterans Administration hospital). This medical center had more medical professionals than any other medical facility of its size in the U.S. Because of Booker T. Washington&#x27;s community outreach, with National Health Week, and the success of these facilities, trust in modern medicine and African American medical professionals, like the National Medical Association, African American families had full trust in science and medicine, which began extending the lives in the African American community. However, in the middle of this progress, from 1932 to 1972, the United States government, through the United States Public Health Service, conducted the USPHS syphilis experiment by which the effects of deliberately untreated syphilis were studied, in Macon County, Alabama, with African-American men, living in remote rural communities near Tuskegee, Alabama. These experiments have become infamous for deceiving study participants, poor African-American men, both by not telling them that they had latent syphilis and by pretending to give them medical care; in fact researchers were only monitoring the progression of the disease, so that when the men were deceased their bodies could be studied in the laboratory. Syphilis is a debilitating disease that can leave its victims with permanent neurological damage and horrifying scars. Penicillin was discovered in 1927 and it was being used to treat human disease by the early 1940s. In 1947 it had become the gold standard in treating syphilis and often only required one intramuscular dose to eliminate the disease. The researchers were well aware of this information and in order to continue their experiments, they chose to withhold the life-saving treatment. The researchers proceeded to actively deter study participants from obtaining penicillin from other physicians. The patients were told that they had &quot;bad blood.&quot; This experiment was conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service. This was a direct violation of the Hippocratic Oath; however, not a single researcher was legally punished. Academic research has shown that the study had long-term, damaging effects on black men&#x27;s health, and the health of their families and contributed to mistrust of white medical professionals among black men.

===World War II===

In 1941, in an effort to train black aviators, the U.S. Army Air Corps established a training program at Tuskegee Institute, using Moton Field, about away from the campus center. The graduates became known as the Tuskegee Airmen. The Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site at Moton Field was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy have R.O.T.C. programs on campus today.

Numerous presidents have visited Tuskegee, including Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt was also interested in the Institute and its aeronautical school. In 1941 she visited Tuskegee Army Air Field and worked to have African Americans get the chance as pilots in the military. She corresponded with F.D. Patterson, the third president of the Tuskegee Institute, and frequently lent her support to programs.

===Postwar===
The noted architect Paul Rudolph was commissioned in 1958 to produce a new campus master plan. In 1960 he was awarded, along with the partnership of John A. Welch and Louis Fry, the commission for a new chapel, perhaps the most significant modern building constructed in Alabama.

The postwar decades were a time of continued expansion for Tuskegee, which added new programs and departments, adding graduate programs in several fields to reflect the rise of professional studies. For example, its School of Veterinary Medicine was added in 1944. Mechanical Engineering was added in 1953, and a four-year program in Architecture in 1957, with a six-year program in 1965.

In 1985, Tuskegee Institute achieved university status and was renamed Tuskegee University.

In July 2020, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Tuskegee. Her donation is the largest single gift in Tuskegee&#x27;s history from a known donor.

In 2023, Tuskegee received funding from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to develop plans for safeguarding the school&#x27;s historic buildings against climate change.

In April 2024, Tuskegee received a $20 million gift from an anonymous donor. The major gift will go towards supporting Tuskegee&#x27;s STEM programs and a variety of campus improvements.

In May 2024, Mark Brown became the first Tuskegee graduate (Class of 1986) to be appointed president of the institution.

===2024 shooting===

On November 10, 2024, LaTavion Jashun Johnson, a visiting 18-year-old high school male, was killed and 16 other people were injured in a mass shooting on campus during homecoming weekend by a lone gunman, who was not a Tuskegee student, and traveled from Montgomery, Alabama, later identified as 25-year-old Jaquez Myrick who was in possession of a handgun and a machine gun conversion device which were used in the shooting.

===Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site===
In 1965 Tuskegee University was declared a National Historic Landmark for the significance of its academic programs, its role in higher education for African-Americans, and its status in United States history. Congress authorized the establishment of the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site in 1974.

The National Historic Site includes Booker T. Washington&#x27;s home The Oaks and the George Washington Carver Museum. The district historic landmark district includes the entire Tuskegee University campus at the time.
&quot;Points of special historic interest&quot; noted in the landmark description include:
* The Oaks (Washington&#x27;s Home)
* Booker T. Washington monument, &quot;Lifting the Veil of Ignorance&quot; statue by Charles Keck
* Grave of Booker T. Washington
* Grave of George Washington Carver
* The George Washington Carver Museum

The Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site is at Moton Field, in Tuskegee, Alabama.

==Campus==

The Tuskegee University Andrew F. Brimmer College of Business and Information Science is fully accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB-International).

The school of Nursing was established as the Tuskegee Institute Training School of Nurses and registered with the Alabama State board of Nursing, September 1892 under the auspices of the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital. In 1948 the university began its baccalaureate program in Nursing; becoming the first nursing program in the state of Alabama. The Nursing department holds full accreditation from the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission and is approved by the Alabama State Board of Nursing.

The Occupational Therapy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association. The Clinical Laboratory Science Program is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences. (NAACLS)

Tuskegee University began offering certificates in Architecture under the Division of Mechanical Industries in 1893. The 4-year curriculum in architecture leading to the Bachelor of Science degree was initiated in 1957 and the professional 6-year program in 1965. The Robert R. Taylor School of Architecture offers two professional programs: Architecture, and Construction Science and Management. The 5-year Bachelor of Architecture program is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). Graduates of the program are qualified to become registered architects.

In 2019, Tuskegee signed a partnership with the Ross University School of Medicine to help redress diversity shortages in the medical field. Qualified Tuskegee students will automatically gain admissions into the medical school with a tuition-free first semester.

In 2020, Tuskegee established a strategic partnership with the Cumberland School of Law that will allow Tuskegee students to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree and law degree in six years as opposed to the traditional seven.

===Reputation and rankings===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; places Tuskegee 3rd out of 79 Historically Black Colleges and Universities in their 2022 rankings. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; also rated Tuskegee 20th &quot;Best Regional College in the South&quot; for 2021 out of 134 schools evaluated. Tuskegee is ranked 109th among 614 master&#x27;s universities (which award a significant number of master&#x27;s degrees but few or no doctoral degrees) in the U.S. according to the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; 2020 rankings, which rate schools&#x27; contribution to the public good as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

===National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care===
National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care is the nation&#x27;s first bioethics center devoted to engaging the sciences, humanities, law and religious faiths in the exploration of the core moral issues which underlie research and medical treatment of African Americans and other under-served people. The official launching of the Center took place two years after President Bill Clinton&#x27;s apology to the nation, the survivors of the Syphilis Study, Tuskegee University, and Tuskegee/Macon County, Alabama for the U.S. Public Health Service medical experiment (1932–1972), where 399 poor—and mostly illiterate—African American sharecroppers became part of a study on non-treating and natural history of syphilis. The center houses the Bioethics Honors Program available to undergraduate students interested in bioethics.

<text>Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury (or Chirbury) KB (3 March 1583 – 5 August 1648) was an English soldier, diplomat, historian, poet and religious philosopher.

He studied multiple languages and disciplines at University College, Oxford, and began his political career in Parliament, representing the Welsh counties Montgomeryshire and Merioneth.

As a soldier, Herbert distinguished himself in the Low Countries, serving under the Prince of Orange. His diplomatic career was most active in Paris, where he aimed to arrange a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Henrietta Maria, which took place in 1625.

Herbert was granted an Irish peerage as the Baron Herbert of Castle Island in 1624, followed by an English barony in 1629. During the English Civil War, he took a neutral stance, retiring to Montgomery Castle which he surrendered to Parliament.

Herbert is most renowned for his work in philosophy, particularly his treatise &quot;De Veritate&quot; which positioned him as the &quot;father of English Deism&quot;. This seminal work distinguishes truth from revelation, probability, possibility, and falsehood. Other significant works include the &quot;De religione gentilium&quot;, a pioneering work on comparative religion, and &quot;Expedition Buckinghami ducis&quot;, a defence of the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s actions in 1627.

Herbert also produced a body of poems, showing his prowess as a faithful disciple of Donne, and his autobiography provides a lively account of his life up until 1624.

==Life==

===Early life===
Edward Herbert was the eldest son of Richard Herbert of Montgomery Castle (a member of a collateral branch of the family of the Earls of Pembroke) and of Magdalen, daughter of Sir Richard Newport, and brother of the poet George Herbert. He was born within England at Eyton-on-Severn near Wroxeter, Shropshire. After private tuition, he matriculated at University College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, in May 1596. On 28 February 1599, at the age of 15, he married his cousin Mary, then aged 21, (&quot;notwithstanding the disparity of years betwixt us&quot;), who was daughter and heiress of Sir William Herbert (d. 1593). He returned to Oxford with his wife and mother, continued his studies, and learned French, Italian and Spanish, as well as music, riding and fencing. During this period, before he was 21, he started a family.

Herbert entered Parliament as knight of the shire for Montgomeryshire in 1601. On the accession of King James I he presented himself at court and was created a Knight of the Bath on 24 July 1603. From 1604 to 1611 he was Member of Parliament for Merioneth. From 1605 he was magistrate and appointed sheriff of Montgomeryshire for 1605.

===Soldier===

In 1608, Edward Herbert went to Paris, with Aurelian Townshend, enjoying the friendship and hospitality of the old Constable de Montmorency at Merlou and meeting King Henry IV; he lodged for many months with Isaac Casaubon. On his return, as he wrote of himself, he was &quot;in great esteem both in court and city, many of the greatest desiring my company&quot;. At this period he was close to both Ben Jonson and John Donne, and in Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene, or the Silent Woman&quot; Herbert is probably alluded to. Both Donne and Jonson honoured him in poetry. In December 1609 he fought with a Scottish usher at Greenwich Palace who had snatched a ribbon from Mary Middlemore&#x27;s hair, and if the Privy Council had not prevented it, would have fought a duel in Hyde Park.

In 1610 Herbert served as a volunteer in the Low Countries under the Prince of Orange, whose intimate friend he became, and distinguished himself at the capture of Juliers from the Holy Roman Emperor. He offered to decide the war by engaging in single combat with a champion chosen from among the enemy, but his challenge was declined. Back in England in 1611 he survived an assault in London by Sir John Eyre who accused him of having an affair with his wife Dorothy. He paid a visit to Spinola, in the Spanish camp near Wezel, and afterwards to the elector palatine at Heidelberg, subsequently travelling in Italy. At the instance of the Duke of Savoy he led an expedition of 4,000 Huguenots from Languedoc into Piedmont to help the Savoyards against Spain, but after nearly losing his life in the journey to Lyon he was imprisoned on his arrival there, and the enterprise came to nothing. Thence he returned to the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange, arriving in England in 1617.

===Diplomat===
In 1619, Herbert was made ambassador to Paris, taking in his entourage Thomas Carew. He became involved with the case of Piero Hugon who had stolen jewels belonging to Anne of Denmark. A quarrel with de Luynes and a challenge sent by him to the latter occasioned his recall in 1621. After the death of de Luynes, Herbert resumed his post in February 1622.

He was popular at the French court and showed considerable diplomatic ability. His chief objects were to accomplish the marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales and Henrietta Maria, and to secure the assistance of Louis XIII for Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He failed in the latter, and was dismissed in April 1624.

Herbert returned home greatly in debt and received little reward for his services beyond the Irish peerage of Baron Herbert of Castle Island on 31 May 1624 and the English barony of Herbert of Cherbury, or Chirbury, on 7 May 1629.

===Later life===
In 1632, Herbert was appointed a member of the council of war. He attended the king at York during the First Bishops&#x27; War with Scotland in 1639, and in May 1642 was imprisoned by the parliament for urging in the House of Lords the addition of the words &quot;without cause&quot; to the resolution that the king violated his coronation oath by making war on parliament. He determined after this to take no further part in the struggle that became the English Civil War, retired to Montgomery Castle, and declined the king&#x27;s summons to Shrewsbury, pleading ill-health.

On 5 September 1644 he surrendered the castle, by negotiation, to the Parliamentary forces led by Sir Thomas Myddelton. He returned to London, submitted, and was granted a pension of £20 a week. In 1647 he paid a visit to Pierre Gassendi at Paris, and died in London the following summer, aged 65, being buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields.

===Family===
Herbert left two sons, Richard (c. 1600 – 1655), who succeeded him as 2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and Edward. Richard&#x27;s sons, Edward Herbert (died 1678) and Henry Herbert (died 1691), each succeeded to the title, after which it became extinct. It was revived in 1694 when Henry Herbert (1654–1709), son of Sir Henry Herbert (1594–1673), last surviving brother of the 1st Lord Herbert, was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lord Herbert&#x27;s cousin and namesake, Sir Edward Herbert, was also a prominent figure in the English Civil War.

==&quot;De Veritate&quot;==
Herbert&#x27;s major work is the &quot;De Veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False)&quot; He published it on the advice of Grotius.

In the &quot;De Veritate&quot;, Herbert produced the first purely metaphysical treatise, written by an Englishman. Herbert&#x27;s real claim to fame is as &quot;the father of English Deism&quot;. The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the charter of the English deists. Charles Blount, in particular, acted as a publicist for Herbert&#x27;s idea.

It has been placed on the index of forbidden books of the Catholic Church.

==Other works==

The &quot;De religione gentilium&quot; was a posthumously published work, influenced by the &quot;De theologia gentili&quot; of Gerardus Vossius, and seen into print by Isaac Vossius. It is an early work on comparative religion, and gives, in David Hume&#x27;s words, &quot;a natural history of religion.&quot; It is also to some extent dependent on the &quot;De dis Syris&quot; of John Selden, and the &quot;Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim&quot; of Marin Mersenne. By examining pagan religions Herbert finds the universality of his five great articles, and that these are clearly recognisable. The same vein is maintained in the tracts &quot;De causis errorum&quot;, an unfinished work on logical fallacies, &quot;Religio laici&quot;, and &quot;Ad sacerdotes de religione laici&quot; (1645).

Herbert&#x27;s first historical work was the &quot;Expedition Buckinghami ducis&quot;, a defence of the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s conduct on the La Rochelle expedition of 1627. &quot;The Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII&quot; (1649) is considered good for its period, but hampered by limited sources.

His poems, published in 1665 (reprinted and edited by John Churton Collins in 1881), show him in general a faithful disciple of Donne. His satires are poor, but a few of his lyrical verses show power of reflection and true inspiration, while his use of the metre afterwards employed by Tennyson in his &quot;In Memoriam&quot; is particularly happy and effective. His Neo-Latin poems are evidence of his scholarship. Three of these had appeared together with the &quot;De causis errorum&quot; in 1645.

To these works must be added &quot;A Dialogue between a Tutor and a Pupil&quot;, which is of disputed authenticity; and a treatise on the king&#x27;s supremacy in the Church (manuscript in the Record Office and at the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford). His autobiography, first published by Horace Walpole in 1764, a naïve and amusing narrative, is much occupied with his duels and amorous adventures, and breaks off in 1624. Missing from it are his friendships and the diplomatic side of his embassy in France, in relation to which he described only the splendour of his retinue and his social triumphs.

He was a lutenist, and his collection &quot;Lord Herbert of Cherbury&#x27;s Lute-Book&quot; survives in manuscript. His own compositions, in all four preludes, four pavans and a courante, are conservative in style, showing little influence from the works of the French school that appear in his collection. According to the polymath Samuel Hartlib, he also composed &#x27;some Excellent pieces for the Viole da Gamba&#x27; but these are not extant. Hartlib recorded in his Ephemerides that these pieces were composed &quot;Ex intimis Matheseos fundamentis&quot; from which Herbert derived &quot;Rules&quot; for composition, suggesting that Herbert was writing music derived from the mathesis universalis.

Herbert was also the author of an unfinished play, &#x27;The Amazon&#x27;, the working draft of which was rediscovered in 2009. The play was probably written while he was completing &quot;De Veritate&quot; during his terms as English ambassador to France, 1619–21 and 1622–4.

==Views of prayer==
Joseph Waligore, in his article &quot;The Piety of the English Deists&quot; has shown that Herbert was one of the most pious of the deists, as he fervently prayed to God and believed God gave signs in answer to our prayers. He was so sure God answered our prayers that he said prayer was an idea God put into every human. He said that:

For Herbert, this universal testimony of God answering our prayers meant that it was a common notion or something engraved into our heart by God.

Herbert was speaking from experience. In his autobiography, Herbert said he once prayed for and received a divine sign. He had written &quot;De Veritate&quot; and was wondering whether he should publish it. So he got down on his knees and prayed fervently to God for a sign instructing him what to do. Even though it was a clear, sunny day with no wind, Herbert said he heard a gentle noise in the clear sky that so comforted him that he decided it was a sign from God that he should publish his book. Herbert wrote:

Herbert was attacked by orthodox Protestant ministers of the eighteenth century as a religious enthusiast. One minister, John Brown, said his claim to have received a sign from God was &quot;enthusiastic&quot;. Another minister, John Leland, said even asking for such a sign was improper, as God does not become involved like that in people&#x27;s lives. Leland said that Herbert&#x27;s claim &quot;passed for a high fit of enthusiasm. ... I think it maybe justly doubted, whether an address of such a particular kind, as that made by his Lordship, was proper or regular. It does not seem to me, that we are well-founded to apply for or to expect an extraordinary sign from heaven.&quot; Clearly these two eighteenth-century Christian commentators did not see Herbert&#x27;s understanding of God as distant and uninvolved. Rather, Herbert was attacked for believing in an overly-involved deity who had an overly-intimate relationship with people.

Modern scholars of deism often have difficulty fitting Herbert&#x27;s religious views into their scheme of what deists believed. For example, Peter Gay said that Herbert—who lived in the early seventeenth century—was atypical of the later deists because Herbert thought he had received a divine sign but Waligore argues that instead of saying Herbert was not a deist, we should change our notions about the deists and their relationship to God through prayer.

Besides believing in prayers and divine signs, Herbert also believed in miracles, revelation, and direct divine inspiration. Herbert was so sure God performed miracles that he thought this doctrine, and the related notion that God answered our prayers, was an idea God put into every human. Herbert said his emphasis on natural religion did not mean revelation was superfluous. He said he thought the Bible was a &quot;surer source of consolation and support&quot; than any other book and reading it stirred &quot;the whole inner man&quot; to life. Herbert thought that divine inspiration generally happened through &quot;the medium of spirits ... variously called angels, demons, intelligences and geniuses&quot;. He said that we could be sure we had divine inspiration if we prepared ourselves for it and it met certain conditions. To begin with, said Herbert, &quot;we must employ prayers, vows, faith and every faculty which can be used to invoke&quot; the divine. Then &quot;the breath of the Divine Spirit must be immediately felt&quot; and the recommended course of action must be good. When these conditions were met, &quot;and we feel the Divine guidance in our activities, we must recognize with reverence the good will of God&quot;.

<text>A son is a male offspring; a boy or a man in relation to his parents. The female counterpart is a daughter. From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative.

==Social issues==

In pre-industrial societies and some current countries with agriculture-based economies, a higher value was, and still is, assigned to sons rather than daughters, giving males higher social status, because males were physically stronger, and could perform farming tasks more effectively.

In China, a one-child policy was in effect until 2015 in order to address rapid population growth. Official birth records showed a rise in the level of male births since the policy was brought into law. This was attributed to a number of factors, including the illegal practice of sex-selective abortion and widespread under-reporting of female births.

In patrilineal societies, sons will customarily inherit an estate before daughters.

In some cultures, the eldest son has special privileges. For example, in Biblical times, the first-born male was bequeathed the most goods from his father. Some Japanese social norms involving the eldest son are: &quot;that parents are more likely to live with their eldest child if their eldest child is a son&quot; and &quot;that parents are most likely to live with their eldest son even if he is not the eldest child&quot;.

==Christian symbolism==

Among Christians, &quot;the Son&quot; or Son of God refers to Jesus Christ. Trinitarian Christians view Jesus as the human incarnation of God the second person of the Trinity, known as God the Son. In the Gospels, Jesus sometimes refers to himself as the Son of Man.

==Indications in names==

===Semitic===
The Arabic word for son is &quot;ibn.&quot; Because family and ancestry are important cultural values in the Arab world and Islam, Arabs and most Muslims (e.g. Bruneian) often use &quot;bin,&quot; which is a form of &quot;ibn,&quot; in their full names. The &quot;bin&quot; here means &quot;son of.&quot; For example, the Arab name &quot;Saleh bin Tarif bin Khaled Al-Fulani&quot; translates as &quot;Saleh, son of Tarif, son of Khaled; of the family Al-Fulani&quot; (cf. Arab family naming conventions). Accordingly, the opposite of &quot;ibn&quot;/&quot;bin&quot; is &quot;abu,&quot; meaning &quot;the father of.&quot; It is a retronym, given upon the birth of one&#x27;s first-born son, and is used as a moniker to indicate the newly acquired fatherhood status, rather than a family name. For example, if Mahmoud&#x27;s first-born son is named Abdullah, from that point on Mahmoud can be called &quot;Abu Abdullah.&quot;

This is cognate with the Hebrew language &quot;ben,&quot; as in &quot;Judah ben Abram HaLevi,&quot; which means &quot;Judah, son of Abram, the Levite.&quot; Ben is also a standalone name.

<text>Günzburg is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. Its capital is the town Günzburg. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Dillingen, Augsburg, Unterallgäu and Neu-Ulm, and by the state of Baden-Württemberg (districts Alb-Donau and Heidenheim).

==History==
In the early Middle Ages the tiny county of Burgau ruled the region. In 1213 the county was acquired by the lords of Berg; it was then known as Berg-Burgau, but the last ruler of this collateral line died in 1301, and Burgau (now raised to the level of a margraviate) became an exclave of Austria. In the early 17th century the administrative seat was moved from the town of Burgau to Günzburg, but the margraviate retained its name. When the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist in 1806, the margraviate was dissolved and the region was annexed by Bavaria.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Günzburg and Krumbach. Günzburg lost its status as an urban district and became the administrative seat of the new district.

==Geography==
The Danube river and its tributaries characterise this district. The Danube runs through the northernmost parts of the district, passing the cities of Günzburg and Leipheim. There are several affluents coming from the south, for example Biber, Günz and Mindel. Most of the district&#x27;s area is covered with forests; the eastern third of the territory is part of the &quot;Augsburg Western Forests Nature Park&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
On the right there are the old arms of the margravate of Burgau: red and white with a yellow beam. The eagle is from the arms of the Schwabegg-Ursberg family, which founded two monasteries in the district.

<text>Craig Rosebraugh (born April 15, 1972) is an American writer, filmmaker and activist advocating for political and social justice, and environmental and animal protection.

== Activism ==
A political activist since the early 1990s when he opposed the first Gulf War, Rosebraugh has been involved in a variety of human rights, environmental and animal protection campaigns. In 1996, he co-formed the Liberation Collective organization, a group based in Portland, Oregon that worked to bring together commonalities in various justice struggles. The same year he took part in a protest against the Seattle Fur Exchange, and was one of five people arrested for civil disobedience after blocking the entrance. In May of the same year, Rosebraugh was one of four people who blockaded the entrance to the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center in protest of primate experimentation. In 1997, Rosebraugh co-organized the 1997 Primate Tour, a series of vigils at the then seven regional primate research facilities in the United States. The same year, he took part in a national protest against the California Regional Primate Research Center at the University of California Davis, and was one of thirty-two people arrested for non-violent civil disobedience. In 1997, Rosebraugh also began acting as a spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front. In 1998, he wrote the essay, &quot;Arguments Against The Use of Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical And Scientific Experimentation&quot;, where he seeks to examine the ethical implications of the experimentation on animals and refute its supposed contribution to the medical research for human health. The following year, Rosebraugh was a co-founder of the Coalition to End Primate Experimentation (CEPE) and served as the National Organizer for the 1999 Primate Freedom Tour, a four-month-long protest tour of the primary primate research facilities in the United States.

From 1997 to 2001, Rosebraugh served as a spokesperson for the Earth Liberation Front receiving anonymous communiques from the ELF and forwarding them on to news media internationally. In 1999, Rosebraugh co-formed the North American Earth Liberation Front Press Office (NAELFPO) with Leslie James Pickering, where he continued to forward communiques, conduct international press interviews, and nationwide informational lectures on the ideology of the ELF movement. Between 1997 and 2006, Rosebraugh received eight subpoenas to appear before federal grand juries to discuss his sources, but he has said he has no knowledge of them and refused to cooperate with the proceedings. The New York Times Magazine dubbed him the &quot;Face of Ecoterrorism&quot; in 1998.

Rosebraugh resigned his position as spokesperson on September 5, 2001, believing that a refocusing of strategies and tactics needed to occur to fully promote justice in the United States.

Despite the seizure of his computer equipment; searches of his business, person, and home; grand jury investigations; FBI and ATF questioning; facing years in prison and hundreds of death threats; he did not reveal the identities of members of the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front movements.

Rosebraugh&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Logic of Political Violence: Lessons in Reform and Revolution&quot; was published in 2003 and is a comparison study between the use of non-violence and politically motivated violence in historical justice struggles. His second book, &quot;Burning Rage of a Dying Planet: Speaking for the Earth Liberation Front&quot; was published in 2004 and is a memoir of his time speaking on behalf of the Earth Liberation Front. In 2009, Rosebraugh was the contributing editor of the book, &quot;This Country Must Change: Essays on the Necessity of Revolution in the U.S.A.&quot;, a compilation of essays from prominent political prisoners and activists in the United States.

In the Summer of 2009, the first issue of his magazine, &quot;&quot;, was released. The magazine covers the actions and discusses the philosophy and tactics of earth liberation groups, such as the ELF and ALF.

Also in 2009, Rosebraugh co-formed Responsible Education and Media (R.E.M.), a non-profit organization in Los Angeles combining art and entertainment with a factual analysis of social and political issues impacting the global community to promote global justice. The group&#x27;s projects have included full-page information advertisements in Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona newspapers railing against the use of ammonia in the nation&#x27;s meat supply and Arizona Senate Bill 1070, the controversial immigration law.

== Restaurant owner ==
In January 2004, with the financial backing of his parents, Rosebraugh opened Calendula, then Portland&#x27;s only all-vegan and organic restaurant. The restaurant was named one of the best vegetarian restaurants in North America in 2004 by VegNews Magazine. He was criticized in the local press for his treatment of his employees and for failing to adhere to principles he had espoused. Employees that he fired joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) which organized a boycott of the restaurant. Rosebraugh spent $3,000 to defend himself in ads in the local alternative press. Other employees came to Rosebraugh&#x27;s defense, accusing the IWW union as misguided and &quot;barking up the wrong tree.&quot; He closed the restaurant in September 2004, and reopened it for a short time in December of that year. The restaurant closed for the final time during the final months of 2005.

== Filmography ==
Rosebraugh&#x27;s screenplay, &quot;Burning Rage&quot;, was a quarterfinalist in the prestigious Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Zoetrope International Screenplay Competition and also in the 2009 Phoenix Film Festival Screenplay Competition. In 2009, Rosebraugh began working on a feature-length documentary entitled &quot;Greedy Lying Bastards&quot;, an investigation into the power and dominance of the fossil fuel industry. Filmed in fourteen countries during the first half of 2010, &quot;Greedy Lying Bastards&quot; was released theatrically in North America on March 8, 2013, in the UK on September 27, 2013, and is currently available in North America for digital download, video on demand and DVD sales. The President of One Earth Productions in Los Angeles, Rosebraugh&#x27;s background includes significant work in both feature film and television scripted and non-scripted content and he has personally overseen numerous projects from conception and development, through financing and pre-production, into production, post-production and distribution. Rosebraugh additionally works as a consultant for independent filmmakers as well as continuing to write, direct, and produce content.

<doc id="293307" wikidata="Q153557" url="?curid=293307" title="Kakwa people">
<text>The Kakwa are an ethnic group primarily found in the border regions of northwestern Uganda, southwestern South Sudan, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They are part of the larger Nilo-Saharan language family, and their traditional homeland spans across these three countries, reflecting both historical and cultural ties in the region.

In Uganda, for example, many Kakwa live in the West Nile region (including districts like Koboko and parts of Arua). In South Sudan, they are present in areas such as Yei River State (formerly part of Central Equatoria). They can also be found in adjacent areas of the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite political boundaries, the Kakwa people share common linguistic and cultural traditions across these national borders.

The Kakwa people are a Nilotic ethnic group and part of the Karo people found in north-western Uganda, south-western South Sudan, and north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly to the west of the White Nile river.

==Demography ==
Sources:

The Kakwa people are a small minority but a part of the larger Karo people, an intermarried group that also includes the Bari, Pojulu, Mundari, Kuku, Ngepo, and Nyangwara. Their language, Kutuk na Kakwa, is an Eastern Nilotic language.

They can be found in South Sudan, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The major towns of the Kakwa people are the town of Yei and Morobo County (South Sudan), Koboko District (Uganda), and Imgbokolo and Aba (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Kakwa people sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;Kakwa Salia Musala&quot;, translated directly as &quot;Kakwa three country&#x27;s&quot; a phrase they commonly use to denote their &#x27;oneness&#x27; in spite of being politically dispersed among three countries.

==History==
According to the Kakwa oral tradition, they migrated out of East Africa (Nubian region) from the city of Kawa in between the third and fourth cataracts of the Nile. First into South Sudan, and from there southwards into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some of the Kakwa who bordered Uganda, converted to Islam, accepting the Maliki school of Sunni theology in the medieval era. They were annexed into the Equatoria region claimed by the Egyptian Islamic ruler Khedive Ismail (Isma&#x27;ili Pasha) by his descendant Tewfik Pasha in 1889. As the British colonial empire expanded into East Africa and Egypt, the region with Kakwa people became a part of the Uganda Protectorate.

The Kakwa people rose to international prominence when General Idi Amin, of Kakwa ancestry, assumed power in Uganda through a military coup. He filled important military and civil positions in his administration with his ethnic group, and Nubians. He arrested and killed officials from other ethnic groups such as the Acholi and Lango people, whom he doubted. Idi Amin also supplied arms and financed the Sudanese Kakwa people in the first civil war of Sudan. The Kakwa officials in Idi Amin regime were later accused of many humanitarian crimes. After Amin was deposed in 1979, many Kakwa people were killed in revenge killings, causing others to leave the area and fled to Sudan. However, they have now returned to their native areas in the West Nile region of northern Uganda.

===Ethnic violence===
For most of the South Sudanese Civil War, the fighting was focused in the Greater Upper Nile region. After the clashes in Juba in 2016, the fighting largely shifted to the previously safe haven of Equatoria, where the bulk of SPLM-IO forces went for shelter. Accounts point to both sides targeting civilians on ethnic lines between the Dinka and the dozens of ethnic groups among the Equatorian who are historically in conflict with the Dinka, such as the Karo, who include the Bari. Witnesses report Dinka soldiers threatening villagers that they will kill all Kakwa people for their alleged support to Machar and killing Pojulu people while sparing those who they find can speak Dinka. A UN investigation said rape was being used a tool of ethnic cleansing and Adama Dieng, the U.N.&#x27;s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, warned of genocide after visiting areas of fighting in Yei.

==Lifestyle==
The traditional Kakwa livelihood has been based on cultivating corn, millet, cassava, fishing and cattle. The traditional villages of Kakwa are linked by their lineage, with males forming councils of elders. Polygyny is accepted and practiced, while Christian and Islamic traditions form part of the Kakwa people’s [cultural value systems and living style].

== Cuisine ==
The Kakwa people traditionally consume a variety of cultural foods, including maize, cassava, sorghum, millet, beans, cowpeas, sesame, groundnuts, and palm oil. Their diet also features yams, sweet potatoes, and an assortment of local fruits.

<doc id="293320" wikidata="Q359936" url="?curid=293320" title="Ambrogio Spinola">
<text>Ambrogio Spinola Doria, 1st Marquess of Los Balbases and 1st Duke of Sesto (1569 – 25 September 1630) was an Italian &quot;condottiero&quot; and nobleman of the Republic of Genoa, who served as a Spanish general and won a number of important battles. He is often called &quot;Ambrosio&quot; by Spanish-speaking people and is considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time and in the history of the Spanish army. His military achievements earned him the title of &quot;Marquess of Los Balbases&quot; in the Spanish peerage, as well as the Order of the Golden Fleece and Order of Santiago.

==Early life==
Ambrogio Spinola was born in Genoa, the eldest son of Filippo Spinola, Marquis of Sexten and Venafro, and his wife Polissena Grimaldi, daughter of Nicolò prince of Salerno. The family of Spinola was of great antiquity, wealth and power in Genoa. Don Ambrogio&#x27;s sister Donna Lelia was married to Don Giulio Cesare Squarciafico, 2nd Marquess of Galatone, from whom descend the Princes of Belmonte.

In the 16th century, the Italian Republic of Genoa was in practical terms a protected state of the Spanish Empire; the Genoese were the bankers of the Spanish monarchy and had control of its finances. Several of the younger brothers of Ambrogio Spinola sought their fortune in Spain, and one of them, Federico, distinguished himself greatly as a soldier in the Army of Flanders.&lt;br&gt; 
As the eldest brother, Ambrogio remained at home to marry and continue the family. In 1592 he was married to Giovanna Bacciadonne, daughter of the count of Galerata.

==Spanish service==

The houses of Spinola and Doria were rivals for authority within the republic. Ambrogio Spinola continued the rivalry with the count of Tursi, then the chief of the Dorias. He was not successful, and having lost a lawsuit into which he had entered to enforce a right of pre-emption of a palace belonging to the Salerno family which the Doria wished to purchase, he decided to withdraw from the city and advance the fortunes of his house by serving the Spanish monarchy in Flanders. 

In 1602 he and his brother Federico entered into a contract with the Spanish government—a &quot;condotta&quot; on the old Italian model. It was a speculation on which Spinola risked the whole of the great fortune of his house. Ambrogio Spinola undertook to raise 9,000 Lombard mercenaries for land service, and Federico to form a squadron of galley ships for service on the coast.

Several of Federico&#x27;s galleys were destroyed by English and Dutch war-ships; first at the at Sesimbra in June and then at the in October in the English Channel. He himself was slain in an action with the Dutch on 24 May 1603. 

Ambrogio Spinola marched overland to Flanders in 1602 with the men he had raised at his own expense. During the first months of his stay in Flanders, the Spanish government played with schemes for employing him on an invasion of England, which came to nothing. At the close of the year, he returned to Italy for more men. 

His experience as a soldier did not begin until, as General, and at the age of thirty-four, he undertook to continue the Siege of Ostend on 29 September 1603. Despite failing to relieve Sluis under siege at the same time, the ruins of Ostend fell into his hands on 22 September 1604. For this victory, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1605.

==War in Flanders==
The governor of Flanders Archduke Albert and the Infanta Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II, who had set their hearts on taking Ostend, were delighted at Spinola&#x27;s success, and it won him a high reputation among the soldiers of the time. At the close of the campaign, he went to Spain to meet with the court, then in Valladolid, and make arrangements for the continuation of the war. At Valladolid, he insisted on being appointed commander-in-chief in Flanders. 

By April he was back in Brussels to lead his first campaign. At this period, the wars of the Low Countries consisted almost entirely of sieges, and Spinola made himself famous by the number of places he took in spite of the efforts of Maurice of Nassau to defend them, including heavily fortified Groenlo.

In 1606 he again went to Spain. He was received with much outward honour, and entrusted with a very secret mission to secure the government of Flanders in case of the death of the Archduke or his wife. However, he could not obtain the grandeeship which he desired and was compelled to pledge his entire fortune as security for the expenses of the war before the bankers would advance funds to the Spanish government. He was never repaid, resulting in his complete financial ruin. 

The Spanish government now had a reason to keep him away from Spain. Until the signing of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in 1609, he continued to command in the field with general success. After it was signed he retained his post, and had among other duties to conduct the negotiations with France when Henry II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé fled to Flanders with his wife, Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, in order to put her beyond the reach of the admiration of the older Henry IV of France.

By 1611 Spinola&#x27;s financial ruin was complete, but he was given the aristocratic title, a Grandeza, which he had sought. In 1614 he was involved with operations connected with the settlement of the War of the Jülich Succession, which awarded Cleves to George William, Elector of Brandenburg and Jülich to Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg. From 1620 to 1622, in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he led the Palatinate campaign in the Lower Palatinate, which included the capture of many towns and villages, including Drais, and was rewarded with the rank of Captain-General.

After the renewal of the war in the Low Countries in 1621 he had the most renowned victory of his career, the capture of Breda. Success came after a long siege (28 August 16245 June 1625), in spite of the objections of Philip IV of Spain, who thought the siege was too risky and expensive, and the strenuous efforts of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange to save it. The surrender of Breda is the subject of a famous painting by Velázquez, known as &quot;Las Lanzas&quot;.
===Capture of Breda===
Spinola captured the city after a prolonged siege. After its surrender, he gave safe passage to its leaders and soldiers, who were allowed to leave the city with their banners and arms, an extraordinary and magnanimous gesture that made Spinola famous throughout Europe. Spinola famously argued, &quot;El valor del vencido es la gloria del vencedor&quot; (&quot;The valour of the defeated is the glory of the victor&quot;). The gesture, which was understood as true Christian benevolence, is depicted in Velázquez&#x27;s work.

The taking of Breda was the culmination of Spinola&#x27;s career. Utter want of money paralysed the Spanish government, and the new favourite, Olivares, was jealous of the general. Spinola could not prevent Frederick Henry of Nassau from taking Groll (or Groenlo) in 1627, a good set-off for Breda. 

In January 1628 he left for Spain, resolved not to resume the command in Flanders unless security was given to him for the support of his army. At Madrid he had to endure much insolence from Olivares, who endeavoured to make him responsible for the loss of Groll. Spinola was resolute not to return to Flanders.

==Death==
Meanwhile, the Spanish government added a war over the succession to the Duchy of Mantua to its heavy burdens. Spinola was appointed as plenipotentiary and general. He landed at Genoa on 19 September 1629. With him, at the suggestion of painter Peter Paul Rubens, came the Spanish royal painter Diego Velázquez, who went with him to see famous paintings in Genoa, Milan, Venice and Rome.

In Italy, he was pursued by the enmity of the Conde-Duque of Olivares, who had been, curiously enough, born in Rome in 1587, where his father, don Enrique de Guzmán y Ribera, a cadet child from one of Spain&#x27;s oldest noble families, was the Spanish ambassador. Olivares ultimately caused Spinola to be deprived of his powers as plenipotentiary.

Spinola&#x27;s health broke down, as he was already 61 years old, with over 30 years&#x27; experience on the battlefield. He died on 25 September 1630 at the Siege of Casale, muttering, apparently, the words &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;reputation.&quot;

The title of &quot;Marquess of Los Balbases&quot;, still borne by his representatives in Spain, was all that his family received for the vast fortune they spent in the service of Philip III and IV. He would be painted however after his death, by Diego Velázquez, in 1635, as ordered by Felipe IV, in &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot;.

Spinola was a brilliant field commander, whose daring in battle often was used to outflank his opponents and catch them off guard. He was not a great technical innovator but was a master of military skills. He used rapid movement and pell-mell actions in his battles. He was skilled at picking out an enemy&#x27;s weakest spot and applying force there to achieve victory.

==Family==
Spinola and Giovanna Bacciadonne had three children:
* Filippo (15948 August 1659), 2nd Marquess of Balbases and his successor.

<text>Damien Steven Hirst (; né
Brennan; born 7 June 1965) is an English artist and art collector. He was one of the Young British Artists (YBAs) who dominated the art scene in the UK during the 1990s. He is reportedly the United Kingdom&#x27;s richest living artist, with his wealth estimated at US$384 million in the 2020 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List. During the 1990s his career was closely linked with the collector Charles Saatchi, but increasing frictions came to a head in 2003 and the relationship ended.

Death is a central theme in Hirst&#x27;s works. He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals (including a shark, a sheep, and a cow) are preserved, sometimes having been dissected, in formaldehyde. The best-known of these is &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot;, a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a clear display case.

In September 2008, Hirst made an unprecedented move for a living artist by selling a complete show, &quot;Beautiful Inside My Head Forever&quot;, at Sotheby&#x27;s by auction and bypassing his long-standing galleries. The auction raised £111 million ($198 million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst&#x27;s own record with £10.3 million for &quot;The Golden Calf&quot;, an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde.

Since 1999, Hirst&#x27;s works have been challenged and contested as plagiarised 16 times. In one instance, after his sculpture &quot;Hymn&quot; was found to be closely based on a child&#x27;s toy, legal proceedings led to an out-of-court settlement.

==Early life and training==
Hirst was born Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol and grew up in Leeds with his Irish mother who worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau. He never met his father; his mother married his stepfather when Hirst was two, and the couple divorced 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic.

His mother stated that she lost control of her son when he was young; he was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker to turn it into a fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, &quot;If she didn&#x27;t like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop&quot;. She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.

His art teacher at Allerton Grange School &quot;pleaded&quot; for Hirst to be allowed to enter the sixth form, where he took two A-levels, achieving an &quot;E&quot; grade in art. He was refused admission to Jacob Kramer College when he first applied, but attended the art school after a subsequent successful application to the Foundation Diploma course.

He went to an exhibition of work by Francis Davison, staged by Julian Spalding at the Hayward Gallery in 1983. Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, &quot;blew me away&quot;, and which inspired his own work for the next two years.

He worked for two years on London building sites, then studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College (1986–89), although again he was refused a place the first time he applied. In 2007, Hirst was quoted as saying of &quot;An Oak Tree&quot; by Goldsmiths&#x27; senior tutor, Michael Craig-Martin: &quot;That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture. I still can&#x27;t get it out of my head.&quot; While a student, Hirst had a placement at a mortuary, an experience that influenced his later themes and materials. While an art student, Hirst was an assistant at Anthony d&#x27;Offay″s gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;alainelkanninterviews/anthony-doffay&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;artspace/52504&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk/7600564&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career—student and warehouse shows==
In July 1988, in his second year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main organiser of an independent student exhibition, &quot;Freeze&quot;, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London&#x27;s Docklands. He gained sponsorship for this event from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst&#x27;s own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint. After graduating, Hirst was included in &quot;New Contemporaries&quot; show and in a group show at Kettle&#x27;s Yard gallery in Cambridge. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached Karsten Schubert, but was turned down.

Hirst, along with his friend Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising &quot;warehouse&quot; shows in 1990, &quot;Modern Medicine&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;, in a Bermondsey former Peek Freans biscuit factory they designated &quot;Building One&quot;. Saatchi arrived at the second show in a green Rolls-Royce and, according to Freedman, stood open-mouthed with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst&#x27;s first major &quot;animal&quot; installation, &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow&#x27;s head. They also staged Michael Landy&#x27;s &quot;Market&quot;. At this time, Hirst said, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get into a position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say &#x27;f off&#x27;. But after a while you can get away with things.&quot;

==Professional career==
===1987–1990===
1987 – Damien Hirst and Holden Rowan, Old Court Gallery, Windsor Arts Centre, Windsor, UK – Curator Derek Culley

1988 – Damien Hirst: Constructions and Sculpture, Old Court Gallery, Windsor, UK -Curator Derek Culley

1988 – Freeze, Surrey Docks, London, UK

1989 – New Contemporaries, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, UK

1990 – Modern Medicine, Building One, London, UK

1990 – Gambler, Building One, London, UK

1990 – Building One, Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery, Paris, FR

===1991–1994===
His first solo exhibition, organised by Tamara Chodzko (now Dial), &quot;In and Out of Love&quot;, was held in an unused shop on Woodstock Street in central London in 1991; already in 1989 he had been part of a group exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery in Paris. The Serpentine Gallery presented the first survey of the new generation of artists with the exhibition &quot;Broken English&quot;, in part curated by Hirst. In 1991 Hirst met the up-and-coming art dealer, Jay Jopling, who then represented him.

In 1991, Charles Saatchi had offered to fund whatever artwork Hirst wanted to make, and the result was showcased in 1992 in the first &quot;Young British Artists&quot; exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London. Hirst&#x27;s work was titled &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot; and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for £50,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost £6,000. The exhibition also included &quot;In a Thousand Years&quot;. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year&#x27;s Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey.

Hirst&#x27;s first major international presentation was in the Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, &quot;Mother and Child Divided&quot;, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited in a series of separate vitrines. He curated the show &quot;Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away&quot; in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited &quot;Away from the Flock&quot; (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work &quot;Black Sheep&quot;. He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst&#x27;s wish, and was given two years&#x27; probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of £1,000. When a photograph of &quot;Away from the Flock&quot; was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst &quot;I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now,&quot; the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on &quot;Black Sheep.&quot;

===1995–1999===
In 1995, Hirst won the Turner Prize. New York public health officials banned &quot;Two Fucking and Two Watching&quot; featuring a rotting cow and bull, because of fears of &quot;vomiting among the visitors&quot;. There were solo shows in Seoul, London and Salzburg. He directed the video for the song &quot;Country House&quot; for the band Blur. &quot;No Sense of Absolute Corruption&quot;, his first solo show in the Gagosian Gallery in New York was staged the following year. In London the short film, &quot;Hanging Around&quot;, was shown—written and directed by Hirst and starring Eddie Izzard. In 1997 the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition opened at the Royal Academy in London. &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; and other works by Hirst were included, but the main controversy occurred over other artists&#x27; works. It was nevertheless seen as the formal acceptance of the YBAs into the establishment.

In 1997, his autobiography and art book, &quot;I Want To Spend the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now&quot;, was published. With Alex James of the band Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song &quot;Vindaloo&quot;, followed up by &quot;Jerusalem&quot; with the London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was to be used to calibrate the probe&#x27;s cameras after it had landed on Mars. He turned down the British Council&#x27;s invitation to be the UK&#x27;s representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale because &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;. He threatened to sue British Airways claiming a breach of copyright over an advert design with coloured spots for its low budget airline, Go.

===2000–2004===
In 2000, Hirst&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Hymn&quot; (which Saatchi had bought for a reported £1m) was given pole position at the show &quot;Ant Noises&quot; (an anagram of &quot;sensation&quot;) in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was then sued himself for breach of copyright over this sculpture (see Appropriation below). Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first. In September 2000, in New York, Larry Gagosian held the Hirst show, &quot;Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings&quot;. 100,000 people visited the show in 12 weeks and all the work was sold.

On 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online:
The next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd:
In 2002, Hirst gave up smoking and drinking after his wife Maia had complained and &quot;had to move out because I was so horrible&quot;. He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer died of a heart attack. This had a profound effect on Hirst, who said, &quot;It was the first time I felt mortal&quot;. He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians.

In April 2003, the Saatchi Gallery opened at new premises in County Hall, London, with a show that included a Hirst retrospective. This brought a developing strain in his relationship with Saatchi to a head (one source of contention had been who was most responsible for boosting their mutual profile). Hirst disassociated himself from the retrospective to the extent of not including it in his CV. He was angry that a Mini car that he had decorated for charity with his trademark spots was being exhibited as a serious artwork. The show also scuppered a prospective Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern. He said Saatchi was &quot;childish&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not Charles Saatchi&#x27;s barrel-organ monkey ... He only recognises art with his wallet ... he believes he can affect art values with buying power, and he still believes he can do it.&quot;

In September 2003, he had an exhibition &quot;Romance in the Age of Uncertainty&quot; at Jay Jopling&#x27;s White Cube gallery in London, which made him a reported £11m, bringing his wealth to over £35m. It was reported that a sculpture, &quot;Charity&quot;, had been sold for £1.5m to a Korean, Kim Chang-Il, who intended to exhibit it in his department store&#x27;s gallery in Seoul. The 22-foot (6.7m), 6-ton sculpture was based on the 1960s Spastic Society&#x27;s model, which is of a girl in leg irons holding a collecting box. In Hirst&#x27;s version the collecting box is shown broken open and is empty.

&quot;Charity&quot; was exhibited in the centre of Hoxton Square, in front of White Cube. Inside the gallery downstairs were 12 vitrines representing Jesus&#x27;s disciples, each case containing mostly gruesome, often blood-stained, items relevant to the particular disciple. At the end was an empty vitrine, representing Christ. Upstairs were four small glass cases, each containing a cow&#x27;s head stuck with scissors and knives. It has been described as an &quot;extraordinarily spiritual experience&quot; in the tradition of Catholic imagery. At this time Hirst bought back 12 works from Saatchi (a third of Saatchi&#x27;s holdings of Hirst&#x27;s early works), through Jay Jopling, reportedly for more than £8 million. Hirst had sold these pieces to Saatchi in the early 1990s for rather less, his first installations costing under £10,000.

On 24 May 2004, a fire in the Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including 17 of Hirst&#x27;s, although the sculpture &quot;Charity&quot; survived, as it was outside in the builder&#x27;s yard. That July, Hirst said of Saatchi, &quot;I respect Charles. There&#x27;s not really a feud. If I see him, we speak, but we were never really drinking buddies.&quot;

Hirst designed a cover image for the &quot;Band Aid 20&quot; charity single featuring the &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; in late 2004, and image showing an African child perched on his knee. This design was not to the liking of the record company executives, and was replaced by reindeer in the snow standing next to a child.

In December 2004, &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot; was sold by Saatchi to American collector Steve Cohen, for $8 million, in a deal negotiated by Hirst&#x27;s New York agent, Gagosian. Cohen, a Greenwich hedge fund manager, then donated the work to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sir Nicholas Serota had wanted to acquire it for the Tate Gallery, and Hugo Swire, Shadow Minister for the Arts, tabled a question to ask if the government would ensure it stayed in the country.

===2005–2009===
Hirst exhibited 30 paintings at the Gagosian Gallery in New York in March 2005. These had taken 3½ years to complete. They were closely based on photos, mostly by assistants (who were rotated between paintings) but with a final finish by Hirst. Also in 2005, Hirst founded the art book publisher Other Criteria.

In February 2006, he opened a major show in Mexico, at the Hilario Galguera Gallery, called &quot;The Death of God, Towards a Better Understanding of Life without God aboard The Ship of Fools&quot;, an exhibition that attracted considerable media coverage as Hirst&#x27;s first show in Latin America. In June that year, he exhibited alongside the work of Francis Bacon (&quot;Triptychs&quot;) at the Gagosian Gallery, Britannia Street, London, an exhibition that included the vitrine, &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; (1990), and four triptychs: paintings, medicine cabinets and a new formaldehyde work entitled &quot;The Tranquility of Solitude (For George Dyer)&quot;, influenced by Bacon.

&quot;A Thousand Years&quot; (1990) contains an actual life cycle. Maggots hatch inside a white minimal box, turn into flies, then feed on a bloody, severed cow&#x27;s head on the floor of a claustrophobic glass vitrine. Above, hatched flies buzz around in the closed space. Many meet a violent end in an insect-o-cutor; others survive to continue the cycle. &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; was admired by Bacon, who in a letter to a friend a month before he died, wrote about the experience of seeing the work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Margarita Coppack notes that &quot;It is as if Bacon, a painter with no direct heir in that medium, was handing the baton on to a new generation.&quot; Hirst has openly acknowledged his debt to Bacon, absorbing the painter&#x27;s visceral images and obsessions early on and giving them concrete existence in sculptural form with works like &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;.

Hirst gained the world record for the most expensive work of art by a living artist—his &quot;Lullaby Spring&quot; in June 2007, when a 3-metre-wide steel cabinet with 6,136 pills sold for 19.2 million dollars to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar.

In June 2007, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, an exhibition of Hirst&#x27;s new work, opened at the White Cube gallery in London. The centre-piece, a Memento Mori titled &quot;For the Love of God&quot;, was a human skull recreated in platinum and adorned with 8,601 diamonds weighing a total of 1,106.18 carats. Approximately £15,000,000 worth of diamonds were used. It was modelled on an 18th-century skull, but the only surviving human part of the original is the teeth. The asking price for &quot;For the Love of God&quot; was £50,000,000 ($100 million or 75 million euros). It didn&#x27;t sell outright, and on 30 August 2008 was sold to a consortium that included Hirst himself and his gallery White Cube.

In November 2008, the skull was exhibited at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam next to an exhibition of paintings from the museum collection selected by Hirst. Wim Pijbes, the museum director, said of the exhibition, &quot;It boosts our image. Of course, we do the Old Masters but we are not a &#x27;yesterday institution&#x27;. It&#x27;s for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way.&quot;

Responding to this show at the Rijksmuseum and to the piece more generally in a feature-length article on the entwined histories of European art and double-entry bookkeeping, the art historian Rachel Cohen wrote:

Two years [after the sale of &quot;For the Love of God&quot;], with financial markets imploding on every side, it was reported that the work had in fact been sold to a holding company that turned out to consist of Hirst&#x27;s gallerist, his business manager, his friend the Russian billionaire art collector Viktor Pinchuk, and Hirst himself. There were then those who, staring at their own newly empty stock portfolios, found in the title apt expression of their feelings. The work itself, with its diamond-laden eye sockets and its original inhabitant&#x27;s grinning teeth, seems unperturbed by any hollowness of value in the financial or art markets. It does not matter to this cynical epitome of our glittering age whether it was made for the love of anything but more zeroes.

In December 2008, Hirst contacted the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS) demanding action be taken over works containing images of his skull sculpture &quot;For the Love of God&quot; made by a 16-year-old graffiti artist, Cartrain, and sold on the internet gallery 100artworks.com. On the advice of his gallery, Cartrain handed over the artworks to DACS and forfeited the £200 he had made; he said, &quot;I met Christian Zimmermann [from DACS] who told me Hirst personally ordered action on the matter.&quot; In June 2009, copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry compared the two images and said, &quot;This is fairly non-contentious legally. Ask yourself, what portion of the original–and not just the quantity but also the quality–appears in the new work? If a &#x27;substantial portion&#x27; of the &#x27;original&#x27; appears in the new work, then that&#x27;s all you need for copyright infringement... Quantitatively about 80% of the skull is in the second image.&quot;

In April – September 2009, the exhibition &quot;Requiem&quot; took place in the Victor Pinchuk art centre.

In October 2009, Hirst revealed that he had been painting with his own hand in a style influenced by Francis Bacon for several years. His show of these paintings, &quot;No Love Lost&quot;, was at the Wallace Collection in London.

===2010–2014===
In 2011, Damien Hirst designed the cover of the Red Hot Chili Peppers album &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;.
Hirst&#x27;s representation of the British Union Flag formed the arena centrepiece for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. In January 2013, Hirst became the third British artist to design the Brit Awards statue using his signature NEO-Pop art style inspired by his 2000 LSD &quot;spot painting.&quot; In October 2014, Hirst exhibited big scale capsules, pills and medicines at the Paul Stolper Gallery titled, &quot;Schizophrenogenesis&quot;.

===2015–present===

In April 2016, a study published in &quot;Analytical Methods&quot; claimed Hirst&#x27;s preserved carcasses leaked formaldehyde gas above legal limits at Tate Modern; however, this study was shown to be flawed.

In 2017, he organised with Pinault Foundation a solo exhibition, in Venice contemporarily to the Biennale in two places in the city: Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana. The title was &quot;Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable&quot;, purporting to present ancient treasures from a sunken Greek ship, with pieces that range from Ancient Egyptian-alike items to Disney character reproductions, encrusted with shells and corals.

In July 2021 through January 2022, Hirst&#x27;s series &quot;Cherry Blossoms&quot; was exhibited at the Foundation Cartier in Paris. The exhibition was then moved to the National Art Center in Tokyo in 2022. The show marked Hirst&#x27;s first major solo exhibition in Japan.

===&quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot;===
This artwork features a large tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate sections. The work was created in 1991, and since then, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal&#x27;s body, which shows signs of decay. Hirst says that the formaldehyde surrounding the shark is the process of death and decay.

Some critics argue that the minimalistic qualities of the work, coinciding with the &#x27;stereotypical&#x27; death theme, are too bland for such a prestigious artist. One critic wrote, &quot;But the famous shark, shackled to its coffeebar-existentialist title – The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living – seems ever more dilapidated, more fairground sideshow, with every dowdy showing. What clichéd menace it may once have theoretically possessed has evaporated.&quot; Another art critic, Luke White, disagrees, saying that others had earlier perceived sharks &quot;...as ugly and dangerous, but by the end of the century, they found them instead exhilarating, fascinating, and sublime.&quot; White argues that sharks have been seen as transcendent, awe-inspiring creatures throughout centuries, a creature that is the embodiment of sublimitude as well as a metaphorical representation of our mind helps, relaying the importance of how special our thoughts really are.

===Beautiful Inside My Head Forever===

&quot;Beautiful Inside My Head Forever&quot; was a two-day auction of Hirst&#x27;s new work at Sotheby&#x27;s, London, taking place on 15 and 16 September 2008. It was unusual as he bypassed galleries and sold directly to the public. Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Cahal Milmo said that the idea of the auction was conceived by Hirst&#x27;s business advisor of 13 years, Frank Dunphy, who had to overcome Hirst&#x27;s initial reluctance about the idea. Hirst eventually defended the concept and refuted the accusation that he was only interested in making money:

The sale raised £111 million ($198 million) for 218 items. The auction exceeded expectations, and was ten times higher than the existing Sotheby&#x27;s record for a single artist sale, occurring as the financial markets plunged. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; said that Hirst&#x27;s business colleagues had &quot;propped up&quot; the sale prices, making purchases or bids which totalled over half of the £70.5 million spent on the first sale day: Harry Blain of the Haunch of Venison gallery said that bids were entered on behalf of clients wishing to acquire the work.

==Hirst art collecting==
In November 2006, Hirst was curator of &quot;In the darkest hour there may be light&quot;, shown at the Serpentine Gallery, London, the first public exhibition of (a small part of) his own collection. Now known as the &#x27;murderme collection&#x27;, this significant accumulation of works spans several generations of international artists, from well-known figures such as Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons, Tracey Emin, Richard Prince, Banksy and Andy Warhol, to British painters such as John Bellany, John Hoyland, and Gary Hume, and artists in earlier stages of their careers Rachel Howard, David Choe, Ross Minoru Laing, Nicholas Lumb, Tom Ormond, and Dan Baldwin.

Hirst is currently restoring the Grade I listed Toddington Manor, near Cheltenham, where he intends to eventually house the complete collection. In 2007, Hirst donated the 1991 sculptures &quot;The Acquired Inability to Escape&quot; and &quot;Life Without You&quot; and the 2002 work &quot;Who is Afraid of the Dark?&quot; (fly painting), and an exhibition copy from 2007 of &quot;Mother and Child Divided&quot; to Tate from his own personal collection of works.

In 2010, Hirst was among the unsuccessful bidders to take over the Magazine Building, a 19th-century structure in Kensington Gardens, which reopened in 2013 as the Serpentine Sackler Gallery after its conversion by Zaha Hadid. In March 2012, he outlined his plans to open a gallery in Vauxhall, London specifically designed to exhibit his personal collection, which includes five pieces by Francis Bacon. The Newport Street Gallery opened in October 2015. It is located in a former theater carpentry and scenery production workshops redesigned by Peter St John and Adam Caruso, and runs the length of Newport Street in Vauxhall.

==Awards and recognition==
Hirst was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1992, for his first &quot;Young British Artists&quot; exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London, which included his &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death...&quot;, with the award going to Grenville Davey that year.

Hirst won the Turner Prize in 1995. He was asked to represent the UK in the Venice Biennale in 1999 or to become a Royal Academian but refused.

In 2012, Hirst was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his album cover for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

==Critical responses==

===Positive===
Hirst has been praised in recognition of his celebrity and the way this has galvanised interest in the arts, raising the profile of British art and helping to (re)create the image of &quot;Cool Britannia.&quot; In the mid-1990s, the Heritage Secretary, Virginia Bottomley recognised him as &quot;a pioneer of the British art movement&quot;, and even sheep farmers were pleased he had raised increased interest in British lamb. Janet Street-Porter praised his originality, which had brought art to new audiences and was the &quot;art-world equivalent of the Oasis concerts at Earl&#x27;s Court&quot;.

Andres Serrano is also known for shocking work and understands that contemporary fame does not necessarily equate to lasting fame, but backs Hirst: &quot;Damien is very clever ... First you get the attention ... Whether or not it will stand the test of time, I don&#x27;t know, but I think it will.&quot; Sir Nicholas Serota commented, &quot;Damien is something of a showman ... It is very difficult to be an artist when there is huge public and media attention. Because Damien Hirst has been built up as a very important figure, there are plenty of sceptics ready to put the knife in.&quot;

Tracey Emin said: &quot;There is no comparison between him and me; he developed a whole new way of making art and he&#x27;s clearly in a league of his own. It would be like making comparisons with Warhol.&quot; Despite Hirst&#x27;s insults to him, Saatchi remains a staunch supporter, labelling Hirst a genius, and stating:
Hirst was among the names in Blake Gopnik&#x27;s 2011 list &quot;The 10 Most Important Artists of Today&quot;, with Gopnik interpreting Hirst&#x27;s career as &quot;a metaphor for how consumption has become our guiding force&quot;.

===Negative===
There has been equally vehement opposition to Hirst&#x27;s work. Of Hirst&#x27;s work, the former &quot;Evening Standard&quot; art critic, Brian Sewell, expressed the following: &quot;I don&#x27;t think of it as art ... It is no more interesting than a stuffed pike over a pub door. Indeed there may well be more art in a stuffed pike than a dead sheep.&quot;

The Stuckist art group was founded in 1999 with a specific anti-Britart agenda by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish; Hirst is one of their main targets. They wrote (referring to a Channel 4 programme on Hirst):


In 2003, under the title &quot;A Dead Shark Isn&#x27;t Art&quot;, the Stuckism International Gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display two years before Hirst&#x27;s by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. Thomson asked, &quot;If Hirst&#x27;s shark is recognised as great art, then how come Eddie&#x27;s, which was on exhibition for two years beforehand, isn&#x27;t? Do we perhaps have here an undiscovered artist of genius, who got there first, or is it that a dead shark isn&#x27;t art at all?&quot; The Stuckists suggested that Hirst may have got the idea for his work from Saunders&#x27; shop display.

In a 2008 Channel 4 documentary called &quot;The Mona Lisa Curse&quot;, art critic Robert Hughes claimed that Hirst&#x27;s work was &quot;tacky&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;. Hughes said it was &quot;a little miracle&quot; that the value of £5 million was put on Hirst&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Mother&quot; (a 35-foot bronze statue), which was made by someone &quot;with so little facility&quot;. Hughes called Hirst&#x27;s shark in formaldehyde &quot;the world&#x27;s most over-rated marine organism&quot; and attacked the artist for &quot;functioning like a commercial brand&quot;, making the case that Hirst and his work proved that financial value was now the only meaning that remained for art.

Hirst&#x27;s 2009 show, &quot;No Love Lost&quot;, of paintings by his own hand, at the Wallace Collection in London, received &quot;one of the most unanimously negative responses to any exhibition in living memory&quot;. Tom Lubbock of &quot;The Independent&quot; called Hirst&#x27;s work derivative, weak and boring: &quot;Hirst, as a painter, is at about the level of a not-very-promising, first-year art student.&quot; Rachel Campbell-Johnston of &quot;The Times&quot; said it was &quot;shockingly bad&quot;. A 2012 exhibition of paintings by Hirst at the White Cube gallery in Bermondsey, entitled &quot;Two Weeks One Summer&quot;, provoked in &quot;The Guardian&quot; the comment that Hirst &quot;can kid himself he is an Old Master and have the art world go along with the fantasy&quot;.

Julian Spalding, British art critic and author of the book &quot;Con Art – Why You Should Sell Your Damien Hirsts While You Can&quot;, has said,

Hirst&#x27;s 2012 retrospective at the Tate Gallery, while setting records for attendance, also received many complaints. &quot;Members of the public wrote to the state-funded gallery accusing it of wasting taxpayers&#x27; money by showcasing art that was &#x27;repetitive&#x27;, &#x27;meaningless&#x27; and &#x27;almost universally awful&#x27;.&quot;

Hirst&#x27;s work has also been a frequent subject of criticism in the tabloid press. A &quot;Daily Mail&quot; headline read: &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all.&quot; Norman Tebbit, commenting on the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition, wrote &quot;Have they gone stark raving mad? The works of the &#x27;artist&#x27; are lumps of dead animals. There are thousands of young artists who didn&#x27;t get a look in, presumably because their work was too attractive to sane people. Modern art experts never learn.&quot;

==Backdating claims==
In March 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that four of Hirst&#x27;s formaldehyde animal works, which were dated to the 1990s by Hirst&#x27;s company Science Ltd., were actually made in 2017. The four works in question were made by preserving in formaldehyde a dove, two sharks, and two calves. In response, Science Ltd. claimed that the dates the artist had assigned to these works did not represent the dates they were made, but rather the dates they were conceived.

In May 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed that at least 1,000 paintings of colorful dots on A4 paper, which were part of an art project called &quot;The Currency&quot;, that Hirst had repeatedly claimed were &quot;made in 2016&quot; and that had the year &#x27;2016&#x27; inscribed on them along with Hirst&#x27;s signature were in fact created several years later than claimed. In response, lawyers for Hirst and Science Ltd. did not dispute that at least 1,000 of the paintings dated from 2016 were created years later, but argued that it was Hirst&#x27;s &quot;usual practice&quot; to date works from a conceptual art project with the date of the project&#x27;s conception.

==Appropriation and plagiarism claims==
In 1999, chef Marco Pierre White said Hirst&#x27;s &quot;Butterflies on Mars&quot; had plagiarised his own work, &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, which he then put on display in the restaurant Quo Vadis in place of Hirst&#x27;s work.

In 2000, Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over his sculpture, &quot;Hymn&quot;, which was a , six ton, enlargement of his son Connor&#x27;s 14&quot; &quot;Young Scientist Anatomy Set&quot;, designed by Norman Emms, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull-based toy manufacturer Humbrol for £14.99 each. Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, Children Nationwide and the Toy Trust, in an out-of-court settlement, as well as a &quot;goodwill payment&quot; to Emms. The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst also agreed to restrictions on further reproductions of his sculpture.

In 2006, a graphic artist and former research associate at the Royal College of Art, Robert Dixon, author of &#x27;Mathographics&#x27;, alleged that Hirst&#x27;s print &quot;Valium&quot; had &quot;unmistakable similarities&quot; to one of his own designs. Hirst&#x27;s manager contested this by explaining the origin of Hirst&#x27;s piece was from a book &quot;The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry&quot; (1991)—not realising this was one place where Dixon&#x27;s design had been published.

In 2007, artist John LeKay, a friend of Damien Hirst between 1992 and 1994, was reported by Dalya Alberge of &quot;The Times&quot; to have provided ideas and inspirations for a variety of his later works, including having given him a &quot;marked-up duplicate copy&quot; of a Carolina Biological Supply Company catalogue that LeKay had been using as inspiration and supply for his work, noting that &quot;You have no idea how much he got from this catalogue. The Cow Divided is on page 647—it is a model of a cow divided down the centre, like his piece&quot;, a reference to Hirst&#x27;s work &quot;Mother and Child, Divided&quot;, a cow and calf cut in half and placed in formaldehyde. LeKay also suggests that Hirst copied the idea of &quot;For the Love of God&quot; from his work on crystal skulls in 1993, saying, &quot;I would like Damien to acknowledge that &#x27;John really did inspire the skull and influenced my work a lot.&#x27;&quot; Copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry reviewed images of LeKay&#x27;s and Hirst&#x27;s work and saw no basis for any appropriation rising to the legal level of a copyright infringement.

In 2010, in &quot;3:AM Magazine&quot; and in &quot;The Jackdaw&quot;, Charles Thomson argued that there are 15 cases where Hirst plagiarised the work of others, including his enlarged version of an anatomical torso model, &quot;Hymn&quot; (1999) which Thomson presents alongside a comparable John LeKay&#x27;s anatomical torso model from Carolina Science, &quot;Yin and Yang&quot; (1990), and Hirst&#x27;s &quot;In Nomine Patris&quot; [&quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;] (2005), which presents a split-open crucified sheep in a tank of formaldehyde, after John LeKay&#x27;s comparably posed split-open crucified sheep, entitled &quot;This is My Body, This is My Blood&quot; (1987) mounted on a wooden board. Other examples cited were the similarity of Hirst&#x27;s cabinets with shelves and bottles, e.g., &quot;My Way&quot; (1991), which expanded to become his room-size installation, &quot;Pharmacy&quot; (1992), which Thomson relates to a Joseph Cornell display of cabinet with shelves and bottles, &quot;Pharmacy&quot; (1943); and Hirst&#x27;s appropriation of concept from Lori Precious, who had made stained-glass window effects from butterfly wings from 1994, a number of years before Hirst. The art gallery lemon sky: projects + editions exhibited a selection of these works by Precious at the Year 06 Contemporary Art Fair in London in October 2006, where these pieces were viewed by a large audience and would have been seen at that time, to have credibly been plagiarized. Thomson also suggested that Hirst&#x27;s spin paintings and installation of a ball on a jet of air were not original, since similar pieces had been made in the 1960s. A spokesperson for Hirst said the article was &quot;poor journalism&quot; and that Hirst would be making a &quot;comprehensive&quot; rebuttal of the claims.

In May 2017 Hirst was accused of copying and appropriating Yoruba art from Ilé-Ifẹ̀ in his work &quot;Golden Heads (Female),&quot; which was on display in his exhibition &quot;Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable&quot; at the Venice Biennale. The work, said critics, was not given appropriate context for viewers.

Commenting on his collection, Hirst has said &quot;As a human being, as you go through life, you just do collect. It was that sort of entropic collecting that I found myself interested in, just amassing stuff while you&#x27;re alive.&quot;

In 2022 artist and writer Joe Machine accused Hirst of plagiarism of his cherry blossom paintings, the 16th accusation of plagiarism against Hirst.

==Hirst business ventures==
===Work philosophy===
Although Hirst participated physically in the making of early works, he has always needed assistants—for instance, Carl Freedman helped with the first vitrines—and the current volume of work produced necessitates a &quot;factory&quot; setup. This has led to questions about authenticity, as was highlighted in 1997, when a spin painting that Hirst said was a &quot;forgery&quot; appeared at sale, although he had previously said that he often had nothing to do with the creation of these pieces.

Hirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t be fucking arsed doing it&quot;; he described his efforts as &quot;shite&quot;—&quot;They&#x27;re shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She&#x27;s brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel.&quot; He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked for one of the paintings. Hirst told her to, &quot;&#x27;make one of your own.&#x27; And she said, &#x27;No, I want one of yours.&#x27; But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.&#x27;&quot; By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist:

Hirst is also known to volunteer repair work on his projects after a client has made a purchase. For example, this service was offered in the case of the suspended shark purchased by Steven A. Cohen.

===Restaurant ventures===
Hirst had a short-lived partnership with chef Marco Pierre White in the restaurant Quo Vadis. His best-known restaurant involvement was Pharmacy, located in Notting Hill, London, which closed in 2004. Although one of the owners, Hirst had only leased his art work to the restaurant, so he was able to retrieve and sell it at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction, earning over £11 million. Some of the work had been adapted, e.g. by signing it prior to the auction.

Hirst is a co-owner of the seafood restaurant, 11 The Quay, in the English seaside town of Ilfracombe. In 2016, Damien Hirst designed the interiors of his new restaurant Pharmacy 2 at the Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall, London.

===Net worth===
Art by Hirst sold at his auction in 2008, &quot;Beautiful Inside My Head Forever&quot;, raised US$198 million. It is said to be the largest amount raised by any living artist to date. Hirst is reputed to be the richest living artist to date. In 2009, the annually collated chart of the wealthiest individuals in Britain and Ireland, Sunday Times Rich List, placed Hirst at joint number 238 with a net worth of £235m. Hirst&#x27;s wealth was valued at £215m in the 2010 Sunday Times Rich List, making him Britain&#x27;s wealthiest artist.

==Personal life==
Between 1992 and 2012, Hirst lived with his American girlfriend, Maia Norman, with whom he has three sons, born 1995, 2000 and 2005.

Since becoming a father, Hirst has spent most of his time at his remote farmhouse near Combe Martin in Devon. Hirst and Norman were never married, although Hirst had referred to Norman as his &quot;common-law wife&quot;.

Hirst has admitted serious drug and alcohol problems during a ten-year period from the early 1990s: &quot;I started taking cocaine and drink... I turned into a babbling fucking wreck.&quot; During this time he was known for his wild behaviour and eccentric acts including, for example, putting a cigarette in the end of his penis in front of journalists.

He is a friend of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and 7-time World Snooker Champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

===Charitable work===
Hirst is a supporter of the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International. In September 2008, Hirst donated the work, &quot;Beautiful Love Survival&quot;, at the Sotheby&#x27;s London sale, &quot;Beautiful Inside My Head Forever&quot;, to raise money for this organisation. Later, he also contributed his writing to the book, &quot;We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples&quot;, released in October 2009, in support of Survival. The book explores the existence of, and threats to, indigenous cultures around the world.

In 2016 he donated artworks for the secret auction of Art on a Postcard, a charity supporting the fight against Hepatitis C.

==NFTs==
In July 2021 Hirst announced his first NFT project, named &quot;The Currency&quot;: it consisted of 10,000 unique hand-painted dot-covered works on paper, each one corresponding to a non-fungible token. Two months later, the project earned a total of $25,000,000. Hirst instructed those who bought pieces from his latest collection to choose either the physical artwork or the NFT representing it. Buyers were informed that corresponding artworks for the unexchanged NFTs would be destroyed, with the first 1,000 artworks being burned on 11 October, 2022. He streamed the burning of his physical pieces on Instagram live from his London gallery and is set to burn thousands more of his artworks to complete the transformation of the selected artworks so they can exist solely as NFTs. It has been estimated the works being burned are collectively worth almost £10 million.

<text>Frederick Henry (; 29 January 1584 – 14 March 1647) was the sovereign prince of Orange and stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from his older half-brother&#x27;s death on 23 April 1625 until his death on 14 March 1647. In the last seven years of his life, he was also the stadtholder of Groningen (1640-1647). 

As the leading soldier in the Dutch wars against Spain, his main achievement was the successful Siege of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 1629. It was the main Spanish base and a well-fortified city protected by an experienced Spanish garrison and by formidable water defenses. His strategy was the successful neutralization of the threat of inundation of the area around &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch&#x27; and his capture of the Spanish storehouse at Wesel. The successful sieges under his command earned him the epithet ‘city forcer’ (). He was the paternal grandfather of William III, who later became King of England, Scotland &amp; Ireland, through his only surviving son, William II.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frederick Henry was born on 29 January 1584 in Delft, Holland, Dutch Republic. He was the youngest child of William the Silent and Louise de Coligny. His father William was stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, and Friesland. His mother Louise was daughter of the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, and was the fourth wife of his father. He was thus the half brother of his predecessor Maurice of Orange, deceased in 1625.

Frederick Henry was born six months before his father&#x27;s assassination on 10 July 1584. The boy was trained to arms by his elder brother Maurice, one of the finest generals of his age. After Maurice threatened to legitimize his illegitimate children if he did not marry, Frederick Henry married his first cousin once removed, Countess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels in 1625. His illegitimate son by Margaretha Catharina Bruyns (1595–1625), Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein was born in 1624 before his marriage and became the governor of the young William III of England for seven years.

===Stadtholder===
On the death of Maurice in 1625 without legitimate issue, Frederick Henry succeeded him in his paternal dignities and estates, and also in the stadtholderates of the five provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Overijssel and Guelders, and in the important posts of captain and admiral-general of the Union (commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army and of the Dutch navy).

Frederick Henry proved himself almost as good a general as his brother, and a far more capable statesman and politician. For twenty-two years he remained at the head of government in the United Provinces, and in his time the power of the stadtholderate reached its highest point. The &quot;Period of Frederick Henry,&quot; as it is usually styled by Dutch writers, is generally accounted for the golden age of the republic. It was marked by great military and naval triumphs, by worldwide maritime and commercial expansion, and by a wonderful outburst of activity in the domains of art and literature.

The chief military exploits of Frederick Henry were the sieges and captures of Grol in 1627, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 1629, of Maastricht in 1632, of Breda in 1637, of Sas van Gent in 1644, and of Hulst in 1645. His chief opponent during the later 1640s was Andries Bicker, burgomaster of Amsterdam and powerful member of the States General, who was looking for peace with Spain, wanted to reduce the army and preferred Amsterdam&#x27;s trading power. During the greater part of his administration the alliance with France against Spain had been the pivot of Frederick Henry&#x27;s foreign policy, but in his last years he sacrificed the French alliance for the sake of concluding a separate peace with Spain, by which the United Provinces obtained from that power all the advantages they had been seeking for eighty years.

Frederick Henry built the country houses Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg, and for his wife Huis ten Bosch, and he renovated the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague. Huis Honselaarsdijk and Huis ter Nieuwburg are now demolished.

===Death===
Frederick Henry died on 14 March 1647 in The Hague, Holland, Dutch Republic. He left his wife Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, his son William II, Prince of Orange, four of his daughters, and his illegitimate son Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein.

On Frederick Henry&#x27;s death, he was buried with great pomp beside his father and brother at Delft. The treaty of Munster, ending the long struggle between the Dutch and the Spaniards, was not actually signed until 30 January 1648, the illness and death of the stadtholder having caused a delay in the negotiations. Frederick Henry left an account of his campaigns in his &quot;Mémoires de Frédéric Henri&quot; (Amsterdam, 1743). See &quot;Cambridge Mod. Hist.&quot; vol. iv. chap. 24.

His widow commissioned an elaborate mausoleum in the &quot;Oranjezaal&quot;, a panoramic painted ballroom with scenes from his life and allegories of good government based on his achievements.

==Children==

Frederick Henry and his wife Amalia of Solms-Braunfels had nine children, seven daughters and two sons. Four of their children, including one son, died in childhood, leaving Frederick Henry with only a single son as heir. Ultimately, after the death of Frederick Henry&#x27;s only male-line grandson, the stadtholdership was to pass to a distant agnatic cousin, who was married to Frederick Henry&#x27;s daughter Albertine Agnes. Frederick Henry&#x27;s children were:
* William II, Prince of Orange (27 May 16266 November 1650)
* Luise Henriette of Nassau (27 December 162718 June 1667)
* Henriëtte Amalia of Nassau (26 October 1628 2 December 1628) died in infancy.
* Elisabeth of Nassau (4 August 1630) died at birth.
* Isabella Charlotte of Nassau (28 April 163217 May 1642) died young at age 10.
* Albertine Agnes of Nassau (9 April 163424 May 1696)
* Henriette Catherine of Nassau (10 February 16373 November 1708)
* Hendrik Lodewijk of Nassau (30 November 163919 December 1639) died in infancy.
* Maria of Nassau (5 September 164217/20 March 1688)

Frederick Henry recognized one illegitimate child by Margaretha Catharina Bruyns:
* Frederick Nassau, lord of Zuylestein (1624–1672)

<doc id="293336" wikidata="Q188543" url="?curid=293336" title="Ammonium chloride">
<text>Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula , also written as . It is an ammonium salt of hydrogen chloride. It consists of ammonium cations and chloride anions . It is a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. In its naturally occurring mineralogic form, it is known as salammoniac. The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. It is also found around some types of volcanic vents. It is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. It is a product of the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.

==Production==

It is a product of the Solvay process used to produce sodium carbonate:
:CO2 + 2 NH3 + 2 NaCl + H2O → 2 NH4Cl + Na2CO3

Not only is that method the principal one for the manufacture of ammonium chloride, but also it is used to minimize ammonia release in some industrial operations.

Ammonium chloride is prepared commercially by combining ammonia (NH3) with either hydrogen chloride (gas) or hydrochloric acid (water solution):
:NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl

Ammonium chloride occurs naturally in volcanic regions, forming on volcanic rocks near fume-releasing vents (fumaroles). The crystals deposit directly from the gaseous state and tend to be short-lived, as they dissolve easily in water.

==Reactions==

Ammonium chloride appears to sublime upon heating but actually reversibly decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas:
: NH4Cl NH3 + HCl

Ammonium chloride reacts with a strong base, like sodium hydroxide, to release ammonia gas:
: NH4Cl + NaOH → NH3 + NaCl + H2O
Similarly, ammonium chloride also reacts with alkali-metal carbonates at elevated temperatures, giving ammonia and alkali-metal chloride:
: 2 NH4Cl + Na2CO3 → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O + 2 NH3

A solution of 5% by mass of ammonium chloride in water has a pH in the range 4.6 to 6.0.

Some reactions of ammonium chloride with other chemicals are endothermic, such as its reaction with barium hydroxide and its dissolving in water.

==Applications==
===Agriculture===

The dominant application of ammonium chloride is as a nitrogen source in fertilizers (corresponding to 90% of the world production of ammonium chloride) such as chloroammonium phosphate. The main crops fertilized this way are rice and wheat in Asia. When using ammonium chloride as a nitrogen fertilizer for plants, the appropriate concentration is applied to provide sufficient nutrients without causing harm. Ammonium chloride is approximately 26% nitrogen by weight and can be used to supply nitrogen to plants, especially those preferring slightly acidic conditions. The concentration for nitrogen fertilization in solution is between 50 and 100 milligrams of nitrogen per liter of water (mg N/L), which is equivalent to 50–100 parts per million (ppm) nitrogen, which translates to approximately 0.2 to 0.4 grams of ammonium chloride per liter of water. Ammonium chloride can acidify the soil over time, so soil pH is regularly monitored, especially when growing plants sensitive to acidic conditions. Some plants are sensitive to chloride ions (e.g., avocados, beans, grapes), so applying ammonium chloride to such plants should be done with extra caution to prevent chloride toxicity. While ammonium chloride can be beneficial as a nitrogen source, improper use can harm plants and the environment.

Ammonium chloride solutions are generally stable and can be stored for a certain period if kept under appropriate conditions, that is in airtight containers (to prevent contamination, evaporation and hydrolysis), away from light (to prevent photodegradation) and heat sources (to reduce microbial growth and chemical degradation), and if contamination is prevented. In agricultural applications the solution is used shortly after preparation, for the following reasons:
# Nutrient-rich solutions can promote the growth of microorganisms over time, so that microbial activity can alter the chemical composition of the solution, potentially reducing its efficacy as a fertilizer and introducing pathogens to plants.
# Over time, water can evaporate from the solution, especially if not stored in a tightly sealed container, which increases the concentration of ammonium chloride, and may lead to over-fertilization and potential damage to plants when applied.
# While ammonium chloride is relatively stable, prolonged storage may lead to minor changes in pH due to ongoing hydrolysis, especially if the solution is exposed to air, potentially impacting plants sensitive to acidity of the soil.
# If the water used is not distilled or deionized, dissolved minerals and impurities may precipitate over time, altering the nutrient balance of the solution.

===Pyrotechnics===
Ammonium chloride was used in pyrotechnics in the 18th century but was superseded by safer and less hygroscopic chemicals. Its purpose was to provide a chlorine donor to enhance the green and blue colours from copper ions in the flame.

It had a secondary use to provide white smoke, but its ready double decomposition reaction with potassium chlorate producing the highly unstable ammonium chlorate made its use very dangerous.

===Metalwork===
Ammonium chloride is used as a flux in preparing metals to be tin coated, galvanized or soldered. It works as a flux by cleaning the surface of workpieces by reacting with the metal oxides at the surface to form a volatile metal chloride. For that purpose, it is sold in blocks at hardware stores for use in cleaning the tip of a soldering iron, and it can also be included in solder as flux.

===Medicine===
Ammonium chloride is used as an expectorant in cough medicine. Its expectorant action is caused by irritative action on the bronchial mucosa, which causes the production of excess respiratory tract fluid, which presumably is easier to cough up. Ammonium salts are an irritant to the gastric mucosa and may induce nausea and vomiting.

Ammonium chloride is used as a systemic acidifying agent in treatment of severe metabolic alkalosis, in oral acid loading test to diagnose distal renal tubular acidosis, to maintain the urine at an acid pH in the treatment of some urinary-tract disorders.

===Food===
Ammonium chloride, under the name &quot;sal ammoniac&quot; or &quot;salmiak&quot; is used as food additive under the E number E510, working as a yeast nutrient in breadmaking and as an acidifier. It is a feed supplement for cattle and an ingredient in nutritive media for yeasts and many microorganisms.

Ammonium chloride is used to spice up dark sweets called salty liquorice (popular in the Nordic countries, Benelux and northern Germany), in baking to give cookies a very crisp texture, and in the liquor Salmiakki Koskenkorva for flavouring. In Turkey, Iran, Tajikistan, India, Pakistan and Arab countries it is called &quot;noshader&quot; and is used to improve the crispness of snacks such as &quot;samosas&quot; and &quot;jalebi&quot;.

===In the laboratory===
Ammonium chloride has been used historically to produce low temperatures in cooling baths. 

Ammonium chloride solutions with ammonia are used as buffer solutions including ACK (Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium) lysis buffer.

In paleontology, ammonium chloride vapor is deposited on fossils, where the substance forms a brilliant white, easily removed and fairly harmless and inert layer of tiny crystals that covers up any coloration the fossil may have, and if lighted at an angle highly enhances contrast in photographic documentation of three-dimensional specimens. The same technique is applied in archaeology to eliminate reflection on glass and similar specimens for photography.

In organic synthesis saturated NH4Cl solution is typically used to quench reaction mixtures.

It has a lambda transition at 242.8 K and zero pressure.

===Flotation===
Giant squid and some other large squid species maintain neutral buoyancy in seawater through an ammonium chloride solution which is found throughout their bodies and is less dense than seawater. This differs from the method of flotation used by most fish, which involves a gas-filled swim bladder.

===Batteries===

Around the turn of the 20th century, ammonium chloride was used in aqueous solution as the electrolyte in Leclanché cells that found a commercial use as the &quot;local battery&quot; in subscribers&#x27; telephone installations. Those cells later evolved into zinc–carbon batteries still using ammonium chloride as electrolyte.

=== Concrete treatments ===
Ammonium chloride is known to be an aggressive cleaning agent.

A penetrating and intense reddish brown color is stained into concrete surfaces with a mixture of ammonium chloride and ferric chloride. Pre-treatment with acid is unnecessary.

===Photography===

Ammonium chloride can also be used in the process of making albumen silver prints, commonly known as albumen prints. In traditional photographic printing processes of the 19th century, ammonium chloride served as a key component in preparing the albumen solution used to coat the photographic paper. Albumen printing was the dominant photographic printing technique from the 1850s through the 1890s, prized for its fine detail and rich tonal rendition. The incorporation of ammonium chloride in the albumen solution was a significant factor in the quality and popularity of this photographic process. The process involves mixing egg whites (albumen) with ammonium chloride to create a viscous solution. This mixture is then applied as a thin layer onto paper, which, after drying, forms a smooth and glossy surface. Ammonium chloride acts as a salting agent, contributing chloride ions that are essential for forming light-sensitive silver chloride when the coated paper is subsequently sensitized with a solution of silver nitrate. Upon exposure to light, the silver chloride reduces to metallic silver, creating a visible image. The use of ammonium chloride, as opposed to sodium chloride (common salt), can influence the contrast and tonal range of the final print, often yielding warmer tones and greater image clarity.

===Other applications===
Ammonium chloride is used in a ~5% aqueous solution to work on oil wells with clay swelling problems. Other uses include in hair shampoo, in the glue that bonds plywood, and in cleaning products. In hair shampoo, it is used as a thickening agent in ammonium-based surfactant systems such as ammonium lauryl sulfate. Ammonium chloride is used in the textile and leather industry, in dyeing, tanning, textile printing and cotton clustering. In woodworking, a solution of ammonium chloride and water, when applied to unfinished wood, will burn when subjected to a heat gun resulting in a branding iron mark without use of a branding iron. The solution can be painted onto the wood or applied with a common rubber stamp.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
Pliny, in Book XXXI of his &quot;Natural History&quot;, refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of Cyrenaica named &quot;hammoniacum&quot;, so called because of its proximity to the nearby Temple of Jupiter Amun (Greek Ἄμμων &quot;Ammon&quot;). However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride. According to Herbert Hoover&#x27;s commentary in his English translation of Georgius Agricola&#x27;s &quot;De re metallica&quot;, it is likely to have been common sea salt. Nevertheless, that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name.

=== Ancient China ===
The earliest mention of ammonium chloride was in 554 in China. At that time, ammonium chloride came from two sources: (1) the vents of underground coal fires in Central Asia, specifically, in the Tian Shan mountains (which extend from Xinjiang province of northwestern China through Kyrgyzstan) as well as in the Alay (or Alai) mountains of southwestern Kyrgyzstan, and (2) the fumaroles of the volcano Mount Taftan in southeastern Iran. (Indeed, the word for ammonium chloride in several Asian languages derives from the Iranian phrase &quot;anosh adur&quot; (immortal fire), a reference to the underground fires.) Ammonium chloride was then transported along the Silk Road eastwards to China and westwards to the Muslim lands and Europe.

=== Jabirian alchemists ===
Around 800 A.D. the Arabian chemist Jabir ibn Hayyan discovered ammonium chloride in the soot that resulted from burning camel dung, and this source became an alternative to those in Central Asia.

The Jabirian alchemists were the authors of the Jabirian corpus, tentatively dated to . The word for ammonium chloride in the Jabirian corpus was &quot;nošāder&quot;, Arabian in origin. Whereas Greek alchemical texts had been almost exclusively focused on the use of mineral substances, Jabirian alchemy pioneered the use of vegetable and animal substances, and so represented an innovative shift towards &#x27;organic chemistry&#x27;. In the Jabirian corpus, the production of ammonium chloride from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) is described. These are the oldest known instructions for deriving an inorganic compound from organic substances by chemical means.

One of the innovations in Jabirian alchemy was the addition of ammonium chloride to the category of chemical substances known as &#x27;spirits&#x27; (i.e., strongly volatile substances). This included both naturally occurring sal ammoniac and synthetic ammonium chloride produced from organic substances. The addition of sal ammoniac to the list of &#x27;spirits&#x27; can perhaps also be seen as a product of this new focus on organic chemistry.

=== Late Middle Ages ===
The first attested reference to &quot;sal ammoniac&quot; as ammonium chloride is in the Pseudo-Geber work &quot;De inventione veritatis&quot;, where a preparation of sal ammoniac is given in the chapter &quot;De Salis ammoniaci præparatione&quot;, &quot;sal ammoniacus (genitive: salis ammoniaci)&quot; being a common name in Latin of the Middle Ages for sal ammoniac.

<doc id="293340" wikidata="Q374646" url="?curid=293340" title="1993 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1993 Canadian federal election was held on October 25, 1993, to elect members to the House of Commons of the 35th Parliament of Canada. Considered to be a major political realignment, it was one of the most eventful elections in Canada&#x27;s history. Two new regionalist parties emerged, finishing second and third in seat count. Most notably, the election marked the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level and the worst ever suffered by a governing party in the Western democratic world. The Liberal Party, led by Jean Chrétien, won a majority government, defeating the governing Progressive Conservative Party in a landslide.

The election was called on September 8, 1993, by the new Progressive Conservative Party (PC) leader, Prime Minister Kim Campbell, near the end of her party&#x27;s five year mandate. When she succeeded longtime Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and assumed office on 25 June, the party was deeply unpopular due to the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords in 1990 and 1992, respectively, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 1991, and the early 1990s recession. The PCs were further weakened by the emergence of new parties that were competing for its core supporters, including a Western-based party and a political party advocating for Quebecois sovereignty and separatism (both of which ended up heavily splitting the PC vote).

Campbell&#x27;s initial efforts helped the party recover somewhat in pre-election polls before the writs were issued on 8 September. However, this momentum did not last, and the Progressive Conservatives suffered the most lopsided defeat for a Canadian governing party at the federal level and the worst ever suffered by a governing party in the Western democratic world, losing 154 seats and official party status in the House of Commons and more than half of their vote from 1988. The Progressive Conservatives also launched a controversial attack ad during the campaign.

The Western-based Reform Party won over many traditional PC voters, particularly social conservatives, alienated Western Canadians, and fiscal conservatives who opposed the Mulroney government&#x27;s deficit spending and tax increases. The popularity of Preston Manning, and profound Western discontent with the PCs, led the Reform Party to replace the PCs as the major right-wing party in the Commons, although it won only one seat east of Manitoba. Though the Progressive Conservatives recovered slightly in the 1997 election, they lost seats in 2000 and would never be a major force in Canadian politics again. In 2003, the Progressive Conservative Party ceased to exist when it merged with the larger Canadian Alliance (the successor of the Reform Party) to create the new Conservative Party of Canada.

The sovereigntist Bloc Québécois won almost half of the popular vote in Quebec and became the Official Opposition. To date, this is the only time that a party committed to the political secession of a region of Canada has become the Official Opposition of Canada. The traditional third party, the New Democratic Party (NDP), collapsed to nine seats only one election after having what was then its best performance. It remains the NDP&#x27;s worst result in a federal election since its formation and the only election where the party polled fewer than one million votes. The turnover of MPs was stark and unprecedented for Canadian politics, with 132 MPs losing their seats. In total, 194 out of 295 ridings changed hands.

==Background==

The Liberal Party had dominated Canadian politics for much of the 20th century. The party had been in office for all but 22 years between 1896 and 1984, with the Conservatives/Progressive Conservatives only forming government seven times during this period: in 1911, 1917, 1921 and 1926 (both under Arthur Meighen, without election), 1930, 1957, and 1979.

===Mulroney era===
In 1984, Brian Mulroney led the Progressive Conservatives to a majority government with the most seats in Canadian history, winning a majority of the seats in every province and a majority of votes cast. The Liberals lost 95 seats in the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level at the time.

The PCs made a strong showing in Quebec, a province where they had held few seats for much of the century. Between 1896 and 1984, they had only taken a majority of seats in that province once, in their 1958 landslide—the only other time besides 1984 that a party won more than 200 seats in an election. After winning only one seat in Quebec (out of 75) in 1980, the Tories won 58 seats in 1984, leaving the Liberals with almost no seats outside of Montreal.

Mulroney&#x27;s government was based on a coalition of socially conservative populists from the West, fiscal conservatives from Atlantic Canada and Ontario, and Quebec nationalists. This coalition helped him win reelection in 1988 (an election almost wholly focused on the proposed Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement) but with only a minority of the votes cast this time. Over the next five years, the popularity of Mulroney and his party collapsed further. The late 1980s recession badly harmed the Canadian economy, as both unemployment and the federal debt grew. Despite the government&#x27;s pledges to reduce the annual federal deficit, it grew from $34.5 billion in 1984, when Mulroney took power, to more than $40 billion by the time Mulroney stepped down in 1993. The federal debt was at $500 billion in 1993. Mulroney brought in the unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1991 and the governing policies were broadly unpopular by early 1993.

While Mulroney had railed against Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s patronage appointments in 1984, he permitted a series of patronage appointments just as he left the PM&#x27;s office in 1993.

====Quebec constitutional status====
Mulroney had also promised to change the constitutional status quo in favour of increasing provincial autonomy; this was one of the most important reasons for his party&#x27;s support in Quebec. He attempted to amend the constitution twice, but both reform proposals failed. The Meech Lake Accord collapsed in 1990 when the provincial legislatures of Newfoundland and Manitoba adjourned without bringing the issue to a vote; all 10 provincial legislatures had to ratify the accord for it to become law. The Charlottetown Accord was defeated by the Canadian people in an October 1992 referendum. In the case of the Charlottetown Accord, the majority of Canada&#x27;s population voted against an agreement endorsed by every First Minister and most other political groups. This stinging rebuke against the &quot;political class&quot; in Canada was a preview of things to come, as the upcoming election would be held on October 25, 1993, a year less a day after the Charlottetown referendum. Additional polls in January 1993 concerning the cost-of-living crisis in the country showed that public opinion was broadly against the unpopular PCs.

===Campbell replaces Mulroney===
These factors combined to make Mulroney the least popular leader since opinion polling began in the 1940s. The Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s popularity reached a low of just over 15% in 1991. With polls showing him facing almost certain defeat in the next election, Mulroney announced his retirement from politics (which had been speculated since early February) on 24 February 1993. While several senior Cabinet members had passed over contesting the leadership, Minister of Defence Kim Campbell quickly emerged as the leading candidate to replace Mulroney as party leader and prime minister. Despite a vigorous challenge from Environment Minister Jean Charest, Campbell emerged victorious in the June leadership election and became Canada&#x27;s first female prime minister.

Campbell enjoyed a brief period of high popularity upon being sworn in, becoming the eponym of &quot;Campbellmania&quot;, just as Pierre Trudeau had been the subject of late-1960s Trudeaumania. and was polling favorably by mid-March of that year. Campbell campaigned extensively during the summer, touring the nation and attending barbecues and other events.

===Opposition parties===
The other traditional parties were also not faring well. While John Turner and the Liberal leadership supported the Meech Lake Accord, there was significant internal disagreement, with Trudeau returning from retirement to speak out against it. After the Liberals&#x27; disappointing showing in the 1988 election, Turner stayed on for a couple of years before resigning. The party then selected veteran politician Jean Chrétien over Paul Martin as party leader after a divisive battle, but Chrétien was unpopular, especially in his native Quebec, after declaring his opposition to the Meech Lake Accord, being rocked by caucus defections. The federal Liberals were disorganized, near bankruptcy, and dropped in the polls from 50 to 32 per cent, so Chrétien appointed Jean Pelletier as chief of staff to reinvigorate his leadership and reorganize his office. As the ruling Tories suffered the most backlash from the unsuccessful constitutional amendments in 1990 and 1992, the Liberals rapidly picked up support and surged to a wide lead in opinion polling.

The New Democratic Party (NDP) had won a record 43 seats in 1988 under Ed Broadbent, who retired the next year. In the following few years, their support continued to grow, at one point leading in the opinion polls. This helped the NDP win a series of victories at the provincial level. In a surprise victory in 1990, Bob Rae led the party to office in Ontario–the first time the NDP had formed a provincial government east of Manitoba. That same year, the NDP won a by-election in Quebec to take its first-ever seat in that province. The next year, under Mike Harcourt, the New Democrats were elected in British Columbia. Within a few years, however, the NDP provincial ministries in both Ontario and British Columbia became deeply unpopular, and support for the federal NDP also began to fall. In a deviation from their traditional position as staunch federalists, the NDP chose to align itself with the Liberals and PCs on the &quot;yes&quot; side of the 1992 Charlottetown Accord. As well, new leader Audrey McLaughlin made efforts to expand party support into Quebec instead of focusing on Western alienation, having defeated Dave Barrett, who had campaigned for the opposite policies. These positions gained the NDP little headway in Quebec and hurt the party&#x27;s standing as the traditional voice of Western protest.

===New parties===
The greatest difference from 1988 was the rise of two new parties that cut into the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; support and caused Mulroney&#x27;s &quot;grand coalition&quot; to implode.

After the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, Lucien Bouchard led a group of Progressive Conservative and Liberal MPs to form the Bloc Québécois. This party quickly gained the support of Quebec sovereigntists and access to the networks of the provincial Parti Québécois. Gilles Duceppe won a 1990 by-election, and throughout the period leading up to the election, the Bloc polled as the most popular party in Quebec.

The Reform Party of Canada was a Western-based populist party led by Preston Manning, the son of former Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. Originally broadly focused on Western Canadian interests, it had quickly moved far to the right after its formation. It originally campaigned under the slogan &quot;the West wants in&quot;. Reform had nominated candidates in the 1988 election, but had failed to win any seats, and garnered only 2.5 per cent of the popular vote. Many Western voters had never forgiven the Liberals for the National Energy Program in the 1980s, and Mulroney&#x27;s attempt to pacify Quebec caused them to rethink their support for the Tories. In early 1989, Deborah Grey won a by-election in an Edmonton-area riding to become the first Reform MP. This came as a considerable shock to the Tories, who had dominated Alberta&#x27;s federal politics for a quarter-century, and as Grey had finished a distant fourth in the general election held a few months earlier. As Conservative support collapsed over the next four years, Reform party support increased. Reform also picked up support from many longtime NDP voters. The NDP (and its predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) had been the traditional Western protest party for most of the last 40 years, but since the 1990s, they had attempted to make inroads in Quebec and had joined the Progressive Conservatives and Liberals in supporting the Charlottetown Accord. Despite sharp ideological differences, Reform&#x27;s populism struck a responsive chord in disaffected NDP supporters.

== Opinion polling ==

==Campaign==

===Pre-campaign===
An election had to be called in the fall of 1993, since Parliament&#x27;s term would expire some time in September. By the end of the summer, Campbell&#x27;s personal popularity was far ahead of that of Chrétien. Support for the Progressive Conservative Party had also increased after Campbell won the leadership, and their polling numbers were roughly equal to the Liberals, while Reform had been reduced to single digits. It was nevertheless thought likely that Reform would hold the balance of power in the event of neither the Progressive Conservatives nor Liberals winning a majority, as the NDP were polling even worse than Reform, while the Bloc were considered unlikely to enter into a confidence and supply agreement with either of the two largest parties. Campbell was therefore seen as having a good chance of remaining in power if the Progressive Conservatives could at least finish with a similar number of seats to the Liberals, and that Reform would support a continuation of her government (likely in return for some concessions on fiscal policy) over one led by Chrétien.

With this in mind, Campbell asked Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to dissolve parliament on September 8, only a few weeks before Parliament was due to expire. The election date was set for October 25. Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, this was the last day that the election could legally be held with the then-current enumeration still valid. In accordance with Canadian constitutional practice, Hnatyshyn granted the dissolution, beginning the seven-week campaign.

At the ceremony at Rideau Hall, Campbell made the first of a series of remarks that would dog the Conservative campaign. When she was running for the party leadership, Campbell&#x27;s frank honesty was seen as an important asset and a sharp contrast from Mulroney&#x27;s highly polished style (Mulroney was criticized for waiting until the last year of his mandate before resigning, leaving office only months before the Tories&#x27; five-year term ended, as well as for his international farewell tour devoid of any official business). During the campaign, however, Campbell repeatedly made statements that caused problems for the party. At the Rideau Hall event, she told reporters that it was unlikely that the deficit or unemployment would be much reduced before the &quot;end of the century&quot;. Later in the campaign, a reporter claimed she stated &quot;an election is no time to discuss serious issues.&quot; Campbell denied the report and declared her sentence was distorted; her actual quote meant that 47 days were not enough to discuss the overhaul in social policy that she thought Canada needed.

===Liberal===

The Liberals had long prepared for the campaign. They had amassed a substantial campaign war chest, almost as large as that of the Tories. On September 19, the Liberals released their entire platform, which the media quickly named the Red Book. This document gave a detailed account of exactly what a Liberal government would do in power. Several years of effort had gone into the creation of the document, which was unprecedented for a Canadian party. Several days later, the Progressive Conservatives released the hastily assembled &quot;A Taxpayer&#x27;s Agenda&quot;, but the Liberals had captured the reputation of being the party with ideas. The Liberals were also consistently well organized and on message, in contrast to the PC campaign, which the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; on September 25 stated was &quot;shaping up to be the most incompetent campaign in modern political history.&quot;

===Bloc Québécois===

The Bloc Québécois benefited from a surge in support for Quebec nationalism after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990, which resulted in a number of Liberal and Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) organizing the Bloc. The Bloc&#x27;s leader, Lucien Bouchard, campaigned on promising that the Bloc would represent Quebec&#x27;s interests at the federal level, with the party running candidates exclusively in Quebec while endorsing and supporting Quebec sovereignty (political independence from Canada).

===Reform===

The Reform Party developed an extensive grassroots network in much of western Canada and Ontario. Reform&#x27;s support for populist policies, such as a democratically elected and regionally equal Senate and more plebiscites and referendums in the political process, was very popular in Western Canada. In addition, Reform&#x27;s backing of smaller government, lower taxes, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and social conservative policies as well as its opposition to the Goods and Services Tax won over many conservatives in the West and Ontario.

Small-&quot;c&quot; conservatives in the West and Ontario who traditionally supported the Progressive Conservatives were drawn to Reform for several reasons. These conservative voters were disenchanted with the PCs for imposing the Goods and Services Tax and failing to reduce Canada&#x27;s growing deficit and national debt. There was also the PC government&#x27;s failure to deliver a democratically elected Senate as it had promised (while appointing unelected Senators in 1990, as it was obligated to do), its socially progressive policies, and its repeated failed attempts to officially bring Quebec into the Constitution, a focus that was seen as coming at the expense of attention to the concerns of other regions, especially the West.

Reform had little money and few resources, with its candidates and campaign staff flying economy class, staying in cheap hotels, and relying on pre-packaged lunches, all which helped endear them to money-conscious fiscal conservatives. The campaign was managed by seasoned political strategist Rick Anderson. Some Reformers had been annoyed that a moderate former Liberal and Ottawa insider had been made campaign manager, but he soon proved his political ability.

Reform found itself embroiled in controversy when Toronto-area candidate John Beck made a series of anti-immigrant remarks in an interview with Excalibur, the York University student paper. York students confronted Manning with the remarks, who immediately denounced them. Within an hour, Beck was forced to withdraw his candidacy.

===New Democrat===

The New Democratic Party suffered badly in the election. With the rising unpopularity of the Ontario NDP government of Bob Rae, many traditional NDP voters were disenchanted and moved to the Liberal Party. In Western Canada, a portion of the NDP vote was attracted to the right-wing Reform party as a protest vote, as that party&#x27;s populism struck a chord despite the sharp ideological differences between the two parties (as the centre-left NDP and right-wing Reform were on completely opposite sides of the political spectrum), and some went to the Liberals as well. Nationally, frustration with the PC party was also so high that some traditional NDP voters moved to the Liberals as a strategic vote. Although McLaughlin was returned in her own seat (Yukon), elsewhere the NDP was only truly competitive in Saskatchewan - even there, they finished third place in the popular vote although it was still enough to tie the Liberals for a plurality of seats at five (one more than the Reform Party).

===Progressive Conservative===

The PC campaign was headed by chair John Tory and chief strategist Allan Gregg, both experienced Mulroney loyalists. It was the best-funded campaign, but it quickly ran into organizational problems. The party failed to get literature distributed to the local campaigns, forcing all the PC candidates to print their own material and thus preventing the party from putting forth a unified message. The Progressive Conservative campaign was focused on three issues: job creation, deficit reduction, and improving quality of life; the party, however, had little credibility on the first two, as over their time in office both unemployment and the deficit had increased dramatically. The party was also reluctant to propose new fiscal or social programs, as in Quebec they had to appeal to nationalists who opposed federal government intervention, and in the West had to appeal to Reform supporters who opposed government intervention in general.

In addition, what remained of the initial euphoria over Campbell quickly wore off as the campaign progressed. Her style was initially seen as frank and honest, but as her numbers dropped she was seen as condescending and pretentious. The Tories also continued to be dogged by the long shadow of the unpopular Mulroney.

Following their devastating defeat, Campbell joked &quot;Gee, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t sell my car&quot; during her concession speech. She resigned as party leader in December.

===Leaders debates===
Over the course of the campaign, Progressive Conservative support steadily bled away to the other parties. The leaders debates were held October 3 and 4, and were generally regarded as inconclusive, with no party gaining a boost from them. The most memorable moment involved Lucien Bouchard continuously questioning Campbell about the real deficit in the 1993 budget and Campbell dodging the question. The French debates were held on the first night. Manning, who did not speak French, read prepared opening and closing remarks, but did not participate in the debate itself.

===Chrétien ad===

By October, the Progressive Conservatives were considerably behind the Liberals in the polls, and it was obvious that they would not be reelected. The consensus was that the Liberals were on their way to at least a minority government, and would probably win a majority without dramatic measures. Despite this, Campbell was still far more personally popular than Chrétien. Polling found that a considerable number of potential Liberal voters held negative opinions about Chrétien.

Believing they had no other way to keep the Liberals from winning a majority, Gregg and Tory decided to launch a series of commercials attacking Chrétien. While the ad&#x27;s creators claim they had meant for the line &quot;I would be very embarrassed if he became Prime Minister of Canada&quot; to refer to Chrétien&#x27;s policies and ethics, the intercutting with images of his face and its facial deformity (caused by Bell&#x27;s palsy) were interpreted by many as an attack on Chrétien&#x27;s appearance. The ad quickly received widespread attention as the Liberal war room under Roméo LeBlanc immediately contacted media outlets. This generated a severe backlash from all sides of the spectrum, including some PC candidates, and Campbell ordered them off the air.

Chrétien turned the situation to his advantage, comparing his opponents to the children who teased him when he was a boy. &quot;When I was a kid people were laughing at me. But I accepted that because God gave me other qualities and I&#x27;m grateful.&quot; Chrétien&#x27;s approval ratings shot up, nullifying the only advantage the Progressive Conservatives still had over him. The Tories also pointed out that Chrétien himself had used his half-paralyzed face in the campaign, with Liberal signs in Quebec that translated as &quot;Strange-looking face, but reflect on what&#x27;s inside.&quot; Furthermore, most newspapers and magazines had used similar photos that highlighted Chrétien&#x27;s facial deformity.

Aside from raising Chrétien&#x27;s personal popularity, it is unclear what effect the ad had on the election. Prior to the controversy, the Campbell Tories were already beset by many problems; notably the recession, the unpopular GST, and their support bases moving to Reform and the Bloc. Nonetheless, the negative backlash over the television spot proved to be the final nail in the Tories&#x27; coffin. Their support plummeted into the teens, all but assuring that the Liberals would win a majority government.

==Issues==
The most important issue of the 1993 election was the economy. The nation was mired in the early 1990s recession, and unemployment was especially high. The federal deficit was also extremely high, and both the Reform and Progressive Conservatives focused on cutting it as the path to economic health. Reform proposed deep cuts to federal programs in order to do this, while the Progressive Conservatives were less specific. The Liberals also promised cuts, focusing on the unpopular and expensive plan to buy new military helicopters to replace the aging Sea Kings. They also promised new programs such as a limited public works programme and a national child care program. The Reform Party called for a &quot;Zero in Three&quot; plan that would reduce the deficit to zero in three years. The Liberals had a far more modest plan to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of their first term. All opposition parties pledged to repeal the Goods and Services Tax. Once elected, however, the Liberals reneged on this pledge to much outcry, stating the Conservatives had understated the size of the deficit. Instead the GST remained. In some provinces it was Harmonized with the Provincial sales tax, while in other provinces the GST and the Provincial Sales Tax remained separate.

The 1988 election had been almost wholly focused on the issue of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, and similarly, the 1993 election was preceded by the agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Liberals opposed NAFTA and promised to try to renegotiate the FTA, but this was not a central campaign theme. The NDP did focus on opposition to NAFTA, but the Canadian people mostly felt that the free trade debate was over. When in office, the Liberals signed on to NAFTA with little opposition. Similarly, while constitutional issues had dominated the national debate for several years, two failed reform proposals led most to support giving the issue a rest. Chrétien promised not to reopen the constitution, and that under the Liberals any change would be incremental in nature. In Quebec the election was seen as a prelude to the next Quebec election and the referendum on secession that was sure to follow.

The Reform Party advanced proposals in a number of areas that challenged the status quo. It proposed extensive reform to Canada&#x27;s parliamentary system, including more free votes, recall elections, and change to the Senate. The party also advocated a reduction in immigration levels and a retreat from official bilingualism.

==Finances==
The election was held under the Election Expenses Act of 1974. This forced parties to disclose most donations, but put few limits on who could donate and how much could be given. Individual donations up to $1,150 were given a tax credit, encouraging such pledges. The Conservatives had the largest budget, spending $10.4 million on their national campaign; the Liberals spent $9.9 million, while the NDP spent $7.4 million. The Bloc and Reform both spent less than $2 million on their national campaigns. Actual election spending is far larger than these numbers indicate: each candidate raised substantial amounts of money independently of the national campaign. In this era there were also large expenses, such as polling and fundraising costs, that did not need to be disclosed.

In the year of the election, two traditional parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, each received about 60% of their funding from corporations and the rest from individuals. For the NDP half of the funding came from individuals, and a third came from trade unions. The Reform Party relied almost wholly on individual donations, with only some 12% coming from corporations. The Bloc relied almost solely on individual donations, as its party charter barred donations from corporations. The NDP had by far the most donors, with over 65,000, but the average donation was only $80. By contrast the 45,000 Conservative donors gave more than $200 on average.

The NDP and Conservatives had more problems after the vote. The NDP found itself deeply in debt, but recouped some of it by selling their Ottawa headquarters to the new Ukrainian Embassy. The Conservatives, despite cutting back on spending late in the campaign, were some $7.5 million in debt by the end of the election, and it took years to clear this burden. The heavy debt load would hamper the party&#x27;s ability to campaign in subsequent elections, and this would lead to its eventual merger with Reform&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance.

==Minor parties==
Fourteen registered political parties contested the election, a Canadian record. Jackson and Jackson, in their book &quot;Politics in Canada&quot;, argue that the proliferation of minor parties was an outgrowth of the single-issue political movements that had come to prominence in Canada in the 1980s. For instance, the environmentalist, anti-abortion, and anti-free trade movements all had closely associated parties. Each candidate required a $1000 deposit, an increase from $200 in the last election. If the candidate did not win 15% of the vote, which none of the minor parties did, these deposits would be forfeit. Parties that nominated 50 candidates qualified as official parties and, most importantly, received government subsidies for advertising. The smaller parties were not invited to the main leaders debate, something Mel Hurtig of the National Party complained vehemently about. The Green Party of Canada Chief Agent Greg Vezina organized a debate between the leaders of seven of the minor parties on October 5, which was broadcast on CBC Newsworld and CPAC. The National Party did not attend.

Few of these parties were expected to win a seat. One exception was the National Party. Founded by Mel Hurtig, a prominent nationalist, it campaigned on a strongly economically nationalist, broadly centre-left platform focusing on opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The party ran 171 candidates, and for a time polling indicated it could potentially have an impact. However, the party failed to make a significant impression and imploded due to internal party turmoil. Some time after the election it applied to Canada&#x27;s Chief Election officer to de-register the party. Another prominent minor party was the Natural Law Party. Linked to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, it advocated yogic flying as the solution to most of Canada&#x27;s ills. It ran 231 candidates, more than some major parties. Its campaign was also accompanied by several million dollars of advertising, and it was successful in attracting media attention. Some accused its efforts of actually being government-subsidized marketing for yogic flying centres, which are non-profit, non-religious meditation centres. Other minor parties included the Green Party of Canada which ran 79 candidates, Libertarian Party of Canada, the Marxist–Leninist Party of Canada and the Christian Heritage Party, which was mainly dedicated to opposing abortion. The election saw three minor parties focused on radical reform to the monetary system: the Canada Party, the Abolitionist Party, and the Party for the Commonwealth of Canada, which was formed by supporters of U.S. fringe politician Lyndon LaRouche.

This election was also the last time that the Social Credit Party attempted to run candidates in an election. The party had been in headlong decline since losing its last Member of Parliament in 1980, and was now led by fundamentalist Christian preacher Ken Campbell. Campbell briefly changed the party&#x27;s name to the &quot;Christian Freedom Party&quot; in an attempt to appeal to social conservatives. However, the party failed to nominate the minimum 50 candidates and was deregistered by Elections Canada.

The satirical Rhinoceros Party was likewise deregistered after they declined to contest the election, in protest of new electoral laws that required parties to run 50 candidates at a cost of $1,000 per riding. Unlike the Socreds, however, the Rhinos would eventually reform in 2006, once the 50-candidate requirement had been dropped, and began contesting federal elections again beginning with the 2008 election.

Several unrecognized parties also contested the election, including the Canadian Party for Renewal (which was closely aligned with the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist)).

== Candidates ==
==Results==

This election, like all previous Canadian elections, was conducted under a single-member plurality (or first past the post) system in which the country was carved into 295 electoral districts, or ridings, with each one electing one representative to the House of Commons. Those eligible to vote cast their ballot for a candidate in their electoral district and the candidate with the most votes in that district became that riding&#x27;s Member of Parliament. The party that has the confidence of the House (ie. that can rely on the votes of the most MPs) forms the government. By convention, its leader is appointed Prime Minister and its Members of Parliament to the Cabinet of Canada by the Governor General.

===Progressive Conservatives===
The election was a debacle for the Tories. Their popular vote plunged from 43% to 16%, losing more than half their vote from 1988. They lost all but two of the 156 seats they held when Parliament was dissolved—far surpassing the Liberals&#x27; 95-seat loss in 1984. It was the worst defeat, both in absolute terms and in terms of percentage of seats lost, for a governing party at the federal level in Canada, and among the worst ever suffered for a governing party in a Westminster system. It is also one of the few instances of a governing party in any country going from a strong majority to being almost wiped off the electoral map.

Mulroney&#x27;s &quot;grand coalition&quot; completely fell apart. The Tories&#x27; support in the West, with few exceptions, transferred to Reform, while their party&#x27;s support in Quebec was split between the Liberals and the Bloc, and their support in Atlantic Canada and Ontario largely migrated to the Liberals. The PCs did win over two million votes, almost as many as Reform and far ahead of the Bloc or NDP. However, this support was spread out across the country. Due to the first past the post system, which awards power solely on the basis of seats won, the Tories&#x27; support was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into seats. The party was shut out of Ontario for the first time in its history. Mulroney&#x27;s former riding, Charlevoix in eastern Quebec, fell to Bloc candidate Gérard Asselin in a landslide; the Tory candidate only received 6,800 votes and almost lost his deposit.

Campbell was defeated in her Vancouver riding by rookie Liberal Hedy Fry—only the third time in Canadian history that a sitting prime minister lost an election &quot;and&quot; was unseated at the same time (it previously happened to Arthur Meighen twice: in 1921 and 1926). All other Cabinet members lost their seats except for Jean Charest, who won re-election in Sherbrooke, Quebec; moreover, many prominent ministers such as Michael Wilson, Don Mazankowski, Joe Clark, and John Crosbie did not seek re-election. The only other Progressive Conservative besides Charest to win a Commons seat was Elsie Wayne, the popular mayor of Saint John, New Brunswick. Gilles Bernier, who had served two terms as a Progressive Conservative from Beauce, Quebec, was also re-elected, but was forced to run as an independent after Campbell barred him from running under the PC banner due to fraud charges.

In addition, 147 PC candidates failed to win 15% of the vote, losing their deposits and failing to qualify for funding from Elections Canada. The party as a whole was left deeply in debt, and came up ten seats short of official party status in the Commons. Without official party status, the Progressive Conservatives lost access to funding and had a considerably reduced role in Parliament.

===Liberals===
The Liberals swept Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, with only Wayne&#x27;s win in New Brunswick denying them a clean sweep of Atlantic Canada. They also won all but one seat in Ontario; only a 123-vote loss to Reform&#x27;s Ed Harper in Simcoe Centre denied the Liberals the first clean sweep of Canada&#x27;s most populous province by a single party. In both Ontario and Atlantic Canada, the Liberals gained support from many centre-right voters who were fed up with the Tories but found Reform too extreme for comfort. Ontario replaced Quebec (see below) as the main bastion of Liberal support for the next two decades; the party easily won a majority of the province&#x27;s seats in the next four elections.

In the West, the Liberals dominated Manitoba, winning all but two seats. They also won seats in Saskatchewan for the first time since 1974 and in Alberta for the first time since 1968. In Saskatchewan, the Liberals won the popular vote for the first (and, as of 2021, only) time since 1949 and tied the NDP for a plurality of the seats. All of their Alberta seats were in the Edmonton area (Anne McLellan in Edmonton Northwest, John Loney in Edmonton North, and Judy Bethel in Edmonton East), which has historically been friendlier to the Liberals than the rest of Alberta. The Liberals also held onto Edmonton Southeast, the lone seat in Alberta they held when the writ was dropped, which they picked up in 1990 when David Kilgour crossed the floor from the Progressive Conservatives.

Despite being led by a Quebecker, the Liberals were unable to recover their dominant position in Quebec. This was in part due to the staunchly federalist Chrétien&#x27;s opposition to the Meech Lake Accord, which was revealed when leadership rival Paul Martin pressed him on the issue back in 1990. Chrétien&#x27;s reputation in his home province never recovered, especially when the Bloc Québécois rallied on the issue. As a result, the Liberals were unable to capitalize on the collapse of Tory support in the province. The Tories had swept to power in 1984 largely by flipping many long-time Liberal bastions in Quebec, and held onto most of them in 1988. However, with few exceptions, most of that support bled to the Bloc in 1993. While the Liberals dominated the Montreal area (home to almost 75% of the province&#x27;s anglophones) and the Outaouais (home to a large number of civil servants who work across the river in Ottawa), they only won two seats elsewhere. One of them belonged to Chrétien, who won in Saint-Maurice, a strongly nationalist riding that he had previously represented from 1963 to 1986 (he had represented Beauséjour, New Brunswick as Opposition Leader from 1990 to 1993). The Liberals also did not do as well as hoped in British Columbia, winning almost no seats outside Vancouver.

Even with these disappointments, the Liberals won 177 seats — the third-best performance in party history, and their best performance since their record of 190 seats in 1949. This gave them an overwhelming majority in the Commons; no other party crossed the 60-seat mark. The Liberals were also the only party to win seats in every province.

===Bloc Québécois===
The Bloc won 54 seats, capturing just under half the vote in Quebec and nearly sweeping the francophone ridings there. In many cases, they pushed Tory cabinet ministers from the province into third place. This was the best showing by a third party since the 1921 election, when the Progressive Party won 60 seats. The Bloc&#x27;s results were considered very impressive since the party had only been formed three years before, and because there were lingering questions about its viability.

On paper, the Bloc was in a rather precarious position. Most of the Tories&#x27; support in Quebec was built on flipping ridings that had voted Liberal for decades. However, francophone anger at Chrétien&#x27;s staunch federalism caused PC support in Quebec to transfer virtually en masse to the Bloc. Most of those seats would remain in Bloc hands for two decades, until nearly all of them were lost to the NDP at an election in which the Bloc was cut down to only four seats.

Despite only running candidates in Quebec, the Bloc&#x27;s strong showing in that province and the fragmentation of the national vote made them the second-largest party in the Commons and gave them Official Opposition status. As the Official Opposition, they enjoyed considerable privileges over other parties; for instance, Question Periods in the 35th Parliament were dominated by issues of national unity.

===Reform===
Reform had a major breakthrough, gaining a substantial portion of the Tories&#x27; previous support in the West. The party won all but four seats in Alberta and dominated British Columbia as well. Reform also finished second in the popular vote in Saskatchewan, where they won four seats, and picked up one seat in Manitoba.

While Reform was expected to win over PC support, it also won around a quarter of voters who had voted for the NDP in the previous election. They did this by raising the problem of Western alienation and rallying against the Charlottetown Accord, two issues that the NDP made unpopular stands on. In one stroke, Reform had replaced the Progressive Conservatives as the major right-wing party in Canada (despite being virtually nonexistent east of Manitoba) and supplanted the NDP as the voice of Western discontent.

Reform had built up a large base of support in rural central Ontario, which had been the backbone of past provincial Tory governments. This area is very socially conservative—in some cases, almost as socially conservative as rural Western Canada. However, this support did not translate into actual seats; massive vote splitting with the PCs allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take all but one seat in the area. Reform did manage to take Simcoe Centre—their only victory east of Manitoba, ever—but even this win came by a wafer-thin 123-vote margin over the Liberals. They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada and did not run candidates in Quebec. It is not likely they would have won any seats in Quebec in any case due to Manning&#x27;s inability to speak fluent French, its uncompromising federalism, and opposition to official bilingualism. Nonetheless, the election was a tremendous success for a party that had only won 2.1 per cent of the national vote in the previous election.

Reform&#x27;s heavy concentration of Western support netted it 52 seats. However, the Bloc&#x27;s concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger, leaving Reform three seats short of making Manning Leader of the Opposition. Though the Bloc was the Official Opposition, the Liberals reckoned Reform as their main opposition on all other issues that were not specific to Quebec. Also, in 1995 when Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard&#x27;s position as Opposition Leader granted him a meeting with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard&#x27;s separatist leverage.

===New Democrats===
The NDP won the fewest votes of any major party, and only nine seats — three short of the requirement for official party status. This was a substantial drop from its record performance in 1988. Those members who were elected were in heavily divided ridings, mostly in the party&#x27;s traditional Western heartland. On average, winning NDP MPs only got 35.1% of the vote. Ultimately, the NDP only retained 34.99% of the votes it received in the 1988 election, even less than the 38.58% of the vote that the Progressive Conservatives retained.

The New Democrats lost support in several directions. One factor was the unpopularity of NDP provincial governments led by Bob Rae in Ontario and Mike Harcourt in British Columbia, which reflected badly on their federal counterpart. In 1988, the peak of federal NDP support was a major asset to the success of provincial affiliates; however, by 1993, they were a considerable liability to the federal party because of recessions, social policies, and scandals. Not coincidentally, the federal NDP was decimated in both of those provinces; it lost all 10 of its Ontario MPs and all but two of its British Columbia MPs, more than half of the party&#x27;s caucus in the Commons. The party also lost its only seat in Alberta, where the Alberta NDP had also been wiped out earlier in the year. Defeated Ontario MP Steven Langdon had called upon Rae to resign, having spent the 1993 election campaign disassociating himself from the provincial NDP&#x27;s measures. The Ontario NDP would be heavily defeated in 1995 (in which it was reduced to third place), while the British Columbia NDP rebounded long enough to survive until it was almost wiped out in 2001.

A significant number of NDP voters also switched to Reform. Despite sharp differences in ideology, Reform&#x27;s populism struck a chord with many NDP voters; twenty-four per cent of those who voted NDP in 1988 switched to Reform. In 1989, while running for the federal NDP leadership, former British Columbia Premier Dave Barrett argued that the party should be concerned with Western alienation rather than focusing its attention on Quebec. However, Barrett was defeated at the convention by Audrey McLaughlin, and his platform was not adopted by the party. The NDP also supported the Charlottetown Accord, which Barrett called a mistake since it was unpopular in Western Canada. In contrast, Barrett raised the issue of Western alienation and strongly opposed the Accord. Barrett&#x27;s warning proved to be remarkably prescient, as the NDP was severely punished in its former Western stronghold.

The NDP had never been a force in Quebec, but they had been supported by those who would not vote for either the Liberals or Progressive Conservatives. While McLaughlin made efforts to make inroads in Quebec, this proved fruitless and likely contributed to Western discontent. These voters largely moved to the Bloc, with 14% of NDP voters supporting the Bloc in 1993. The NDP lost their only seat in the province, which it had gained in a 1990 by-election, as Phil Edmonston, a Quebec nationalist, opted not to see re-election because he disagreed with the party&#x27;s support for the Charlottetown Accord.

==Legacy==

The 1993 election is considered a political realignment election with lasting effects on Canadian politics. Prior to the 1988 election, there had been talk the Liberal party would be relegated to third place. But the Liberal party turned its luck around in 1988, and the 1993 election solidified its strength.

Since Confederation in 1867, Canada has had a two-party system with the Liberals and Conservatives alternating in government. Since the 1920s there had generally been one or more third parties in the House of Commons (small caucuses had been elected from that source even before 1920). None of these parties came close to winning power and of those parties, the CCF was the only one that achieved long-term success. The CCF was folded into the NDP in 1961, by which time it had clearly established itself as the nation&#x27;s third major party. It eventually gained enough strength to wield the balance of power in the Liberal minority governments of the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1984 election the NDP only lost one seat and finished only 10 seats behind the Liberals. This led to considerable talk that Canada was headed for a UK-style Labour-Tory division, with the Liberals following their UK counterparts into third-party status.

However, the Liberals recovered enough ground in 1988 to firmly reestablish themselves as the main opposition party in opposition to the Conservatives.

The 1993 election fundamentally changed the balance of power among the parties. The Liberals emerged into strength and has been a party to be reckoned with ever since. This strength was gained by strong support in Central Canada.

Together Ontario and Quebec are guaranteed a majority of seats in the Commons under both Constitution Acts. Those two provinces constitute nearly two-thirds of the Canadian population. Thus, it is nearly impossible to form even a minority government without considerable support in one or both provinces. In the early 1990s Liberals were the only party with a strong base in both provinces, making it the only party with a realistic chance to form government. The Liberals dominated Canadian politics for the next decade, retaining almost all of its Ontario ridings while making steady gains in Quebec. They were not seriously challenged until 2004, with the sponsorship scandal and party infighting reduced them to a minority government with continued strong support from Ontario. The Liberals retained the majority of Ontario ridings, despite being defeated in 2006, finally relinquishing their lead in 2008.

In fact the Liberals were so strong in the 1990s that no party other than the Liberals had a realistic chance of forming government after 1993. Some commentators said that Canada had moved to a dominant-party system. The opposition to the Liberals in the House of Commons was divided between four parties. Many commentators said it was ironic that Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition consisted of a separatist party. The Liberals, along with several commentators, said they considered the Reform Party the de facto opposition on issues that did not pertain to Quebec and national unity.

On the other hand, some political scientists said the new five-party parliament was an example of a multi-party system. The five parties were reduced to four when the PC Party and Canadian Alliance (successor to the Reform Party) merged in 2003. From 2004 to 2006, three opposition parties—the new Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc—faced the Liberal minority government. Then three opposition parties in the House of Commons faced a Conservative minority government from 2006 to 2008.

After the Liberals&#x27; win in 1993, it was almost 20 years before the Progressive Conservatives regained power. These were bleak years for the party. In December 1993, Campbell resigned as Conservative leader and was replaced by Charest, the only surviving member of the previous Cabinet. Under Charest, they rebounded to 20 seats in 1997. Despite naming former prime minister Joe Clark as leader, in 1998 the party was were reduced to 12 seats, mostly in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, and would win only two seats west of Quebec in the next two elections, finally ascending to majority government in 2011 with Stephen Harper at the helm.

In 1997 election, the Reform Party replaced the Bloc as the Official Opposition. Although Reform was then the major right-wing party in Canada, most Ontarians saw it as too extreme and it had little chance of dislodging the Liberals. Its chances were also hampered in Quebec because Manning could not speak French. In 2000, the party evolved into the Canadian Alliance but even then won only two seats outside its Western Canadian base (both in Ontario).

In 2003, the Canadian Alliance under Stephen Harper and the Progressive Conservatives under Peter MacKay merged, creating the Conservative Party of Canada. The new party, led by Harper, reduced the Liberals to a minority government in 2004 by capitalizing on the sponsorship scandal. It then formed its first government, a minority, in early 2006 with Harper as prime minister. Key to its victory was that it made inroads into the eastern part of Canada. In the 2008 election, the Conservatives won a stronger minority government and then won majority government in 2011. However, this was of short duration and the Liberals defeated them in 2015.

The NDP recovered somewhat, regaining official party status in 1997. However, it would take another decade for the party to reach the same level of support it enjoyed in the 1980s. The NDP supported the Liberal minority government after the 2004 election but moved towards differentiating itself from the Liberals, including uniting with the other opposition parties to bring down the Liberals and force the 2006 election in which the NDP made substantial gains in the House of Commons.

The Bloc Québécois failed to propel the sovereigntist side to victory in the 1995 Quebec referendum and lost Official Opposition status in the 1997 election. It lost more seats in the 2000 election. However, bolstered by the Liberals&#x27; sponsorship scandal, it remained a significant presence in the House of Commons. The Bloc nearly tied its large 1993 vote tally in 2004 but then in 2006 it lost support to a resurgent Conservative Party. The Bloc&#x27;s position continued to erode in 2008. The BQ won with 47 of Quebec&#x27;s 75 seats but saw its popular vote decline, although it remained an important force in federal politics for Quebec. 2011 saw massive change in Quebec, with the Bloc losing a third of its voter support, getting just 4 seats in the Commons and losing official party status. BQ made a modest comeback in the 2015 election, increasing their seat count to 10, 2 seats short of regaining official party status. In the 2019 election, BQ took half again more votes, tripled its seat count and became the third-largest party in the House, once again becoming a strong force in Canadian politics. In the following 2021 election, it kept all its seats and its vote share.

<text>Peter Bruce Lilley, Baron Lilley, PC (born 23 August 1943) is a British politician and life peer who served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) Hitchin and Harpenden from 1997 to 2017 and, prior to boundary changes, St Albans from 1983.

Born in Kent, Lilley studied economics at Clare College, Cambridge. He served as Trade and Industry Secretary from July 1990 to April 1992. As Social Security Secretary from April 1992 to May 1997, he introduced Incapacity Benefit.

On 26 April 2017, he announced his retirement as an MP. He has been a long-term critic of the European Union and backed Brexit in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He was supportive of the Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave. In May 2018, he was nominated for a peerage in the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Lilley, whose father was a personnel officer for the BBC, was born at Hayes in Kent. He was educated at Dulwich College and Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences before switching to economics. His Cambridge contemporaries included Kenneth Clarke, Michael Howard and Norman Lamont, a group later known as the Cambridge Mafia.

Before he entered Parliament he was an energy analyst at the City of London stockbroker W. Greenwell &amp; Co. He was the chairman of the Conservative think tank the Bow Group from 1973 to 1975.

In October 1974 he stood as a candidate in the safe Labour seat of Tottenham and was defeated by the defending MP Norman Atkinson. He later said &quot;I fought Tottenham, and Tottenham fought back.&quot;

==Parliamentary career==
Following his election in 1983 as MP for St Albans, a generally safe Conservative seat, he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Nigel Lawson, then as Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Financial Secretary to the Treasury before joining the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to replace Nicholas Ridley in mid-1990 after the latter was forced to resign over an anti-German remark.

Initially regarded as a right wing Thatcher loyalist, he privately told her her career was finished after she failed to win outright in the first round ballot of a leadership challenge, and subsequently urged her ultimate successor John Major to stand for election to succeed her. Following the 1992 general election he became Secretary of State for Social Security.

===Social Security Secretary===
In 1992, John Major made Lilley the secretary of state at the Department of Social Security at a time when the number of claimants of sickness benefits was growing rapidly. Shortly after his appointment, Lilley entertained the Conservative Party&#x27;s annual conference by outlining his plan to &quot;close down the something for nothing society&quot;, delivered in the form of a pastiche of the Lord High Executioner&#x27;s &quot;little list&quot; song from &quot;The Mikado&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan:

: I&#x27;ve got a little list / Of benefit offenders who I&#x27;ll soon be rooting out / And who never would be missed / They never would be missed. /
: There&#x27;s those who make up bogus claims / In half a dozen names / And councillors who draw the dole / To run left-wing campaigns / They never would be missed / They never would be missed. /
: There&#x27;s young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue / And dads who won&#x27;t support the kids / of ladies they have ... kissed / And I haven&#x27;t even mentioned all those sponging socialists / I&#x27;ve got them on my list / And they&#x27;ll none of them be missed / They&#x27;ll none of them be missed.

The speech was well received by party members and tabloid newspapers but some commentators &quot;saw his performance as symbolic of a party out of touch with some of society&#x27;s most vulnerable people&quot;. &quot;Spitting Image&quot; depicted him as a commandant at a Nazi concentration camp and commentator Mark Lawson of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that if Lilley stayed as Secretary of State for Social Security, it would be &quot;equivalent to Mary Whitehouse becoming madam of a brothel&quot;.

In 1995, Lilley introduced Incapacity Benefit in the hope of checking the rise in sickness benefit claims. Unlike its predecessor, Invalidity Benefit, this new welfare payment came with a medical test that gauged claimants&#x27; ability to work. Nevertheless, the number of claimants and the cost to the taxpayer continued to rise.

Lilley was among the front bench Conservative ministers who threatened to join the Maastricht Rebels in voting against his government over the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. When asked why Lilley and two of his colleagues had not been sacked from their front bench positions, Major replied &quot;We don&#x27;t want another three more of the bastards out there&quot;

===Conference song===
Lilley reprised his lampooning of some people drawing benefits from the National Insurance scheme – the overall number of which had grown rapidly on his watch – by singing to the Conservative Party&#x27;s annual conference after it had lost the general election in 1997. He changed the words of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; to create a song &quot;Land of Chattering Classes&quot;, in condemnation of the purported abandonment of British values and history by Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour. Lilley joked that a Labour version of Land and Hope and Glory had been &quot;leaked&quot; to him. He said, &quot;They call it &#x27;Land of Pseudo Tories&#x27; and it goes like this:

&quot;Land of chattering classes, no more pageantry / Darlings, raise your glasses, to brave modernity / Who needs Nelson or Churchill? The past is so passé / Britain&#x27;s now about Britpop and the River Café / God, this place is so frumpy, let&#x27;s be more like LA!&quot;

After cheers from the conference, he continued: &quot;Not to be outdone, [Chancellor] Gordon Brown has tried to trump his neighbour [Mr Blair] with a new version of Rule Britannia&quot;:&quot;

&quot;Cool Britannia, where saving costs you more / Unless, like Geoffrey Robinson, your Trust&#x27;s offshore!&quot;

===In opposition===
He contested the 1997 Conservative Party leadership election, placing fourth in a field of five, ahead of Michael Howard. In opposition, he held the post of Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 1998 and was Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 1998 to 1999. In June 1999, Conservative Party leader William Hague sacked Lilley as part of a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle. The cause was Lilley&#x27;s Rab Butler Memorial Lecture, in which he suggested the party distance itself from Thatcher&#x27;s free market ideology.

Lilley is known for being an advocate of marijuana legalisation. In 2001, Lilley provoked some controversy in his party and Britain more widely by calling for cannabis to be legalised in a Social Market Foundation pamphlet.

Lilley produced a report for the Bow Group in 2005 that was highly critical of Government plans to introduce national identity cards.

When David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservatives in December 2005, Lilley was appointed Chairman of the Globalisation and Global Poverty policy group as part of Cameron&#x27;s extensive 18-month policy review.

===Climate change===
In November 2012, it was reported that Lilley had been selected by the Conservative Party to join the House of Commons Select Committee on Climate Change. Lilley was at that time vice chairman and senior independent non-executive director of Tethys Petroleum and had received options to buy over $400,000 of shares at a price above their then market value. He resigned from the board in 2014 without exercising those options. He was seen by some as being unsuitable for the position because of this role and a perceived conflict of interest. He was one of only five MPs to oppose the Climate Change Act 2008. Further scrutiny came from the highlighting by &quot;Private Eye&quot; that Lilley had previously lobbied then climate change minister Ed Miliband with letters requesting the &#x27;cost of global warming&#x27;.

===Queen&#x27;s Speech amendment===
On 19 May 2016, Lilley, backed by other Eurosceptic Tory MPs as well as the other parties proposed a rebel amendment to the Queen&#x27;s Speech, over fears that the US-EU pact would lead to the privatisation of the NHS by paving the way for American health providers in the UK. Lilley said that the Investor state dispute settlement provision in TTIP would grant American multinationals the right to sue the British government over any regulations which affected their profits, and questioned why the British government had not tried to exclude the NHS from TTIP.

The UK government ultimately agreed to amend the Queen&#x27;s Speech to commit to explicitly protecting the NHS from the terms of the future trade deal.

Lilley had earlier committed to supporting withdrawal from the EU during the referendum campaign.

===Common Sense Group===
Following an interim report on the connections between colonialism and properties now in the care of the National Trust, including links with historic slavery, Lilley was among the signatories of a letter to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in November 2020 from the &quot;Common Sense Group&quot; of Conservative Parliamentarians. The letter accused the National Trust of being &quot;coloured by cultural Marxist dogma, colloquially known as the &#x27;woke agenda&#x27;&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Gail Ansell, a dress designer turned artist, on 24 May 1979. The couple have no children. Lilley has a holiday home in France.

Lilley was created a Life Peer on 18 June 2018 taking the title of Baron Lilley, of Offa in the County of Hertfordshire.

<doc id="293345" wikidata="Q1202626" url="?curid=293345" title="Pizzicato Five">
<text>Pizzicato Five (formerly typeset as Pizzicato V and sometimes abbreviated to P5) was a Japanese pop band formed in Tokyo in 1984 by multi-instrumentalists Yasuharu Konishi and Keitarō Takanami. After some personnel changes in the late 1980s, the band gained international fame as a duo consisting of Konishi and vocalist Maki Nomiya. With their music blending together 1960s pop, jazz and synth-pop, the group were a prominent component in the Shibuya-kei movement of the 1990s.

Pizzicato Five was a hugely prolific group during its existence, usually releasing at least a studio album each year in addition to various EPs and remix albums. Their music has appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and video games.

==History==
===1980s===
Pizzicato V began in 1984 when university students Yasuharu Konishi and Keitarō Takanami first met at a local music society conference. Ryō Kamomiya, Mamiko Sasaki, and Shigeo Miyata were soon recruited after a few years. Miyata left the group almost immediately but the four remaining members kept the name Pizzicato V. The band released its first single on Haruomi Hosono&#x27;s Non-Standard label (Teichiku Records), a 12-inch release titled &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Complex&quot; which was produced by Hosono, in 1985. They followed this with the single &quot;Action&quot;.

In 1986, Pizzicato V signed with CBS/Sony (now Sony Music Entertainment Japan). In 1987, the band released their first all-new album, &quot;Couples&quot;. It was a commercial failure, and the record company began pressuring the band to find a new lead singer. Kamomiya and Sasaki decided to quit. Takao Tajima, Original Love&#x27;s frontman, joined the band soon as the new vocalist. He decided to work at these two bands. With Tajima, the band released its second album, &quot;Bellissima!&quot; in 1988.

The next two albums, 1989&#x27;s &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Request&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Soft Landing on the Moon&quot;, were also commercial failures.

===1990s===

In 1990, Maki Nomiya, who had previously released one solo album, joined as the third lead vocalist. Takao Tajima left to concentrate on his own band Original Love. In 1991, Pizzicato Five signed with Nippon Columbia/Seven Gods (later Triad Records).

Following three EPs showcasing Nomiya&#x27;s vocals, Pizzicato Five released &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot;. Inspired by the advent of sampling (De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; is said to have been a major influence), the group put together a sound which would help start the burgeoning Shibuya-kei scene. The album would spawn two of their best-known songs: &quot;Twiggy Twiggy&quot; and &quot;Baby Love Child&quot;.

1992 saw a change in direction as the clubby &quot;Sweet Pizzicato Five&quot; was released.

The band began to get increasing exposure via the theme songs it recorded for television dramas (a common practice for pop bands in Japan), achieving widespread fame with the 1993 single &quot;Sweet Soul Revue&quot;, which was featured in a major spring advertising campaign for Kao Corporation (Kanebo Cosmetics) and as the theme song to the 1995 Pauly Shore film &quot;Jury Duty&quot;. In December, the single (literally, 7 p.m. in Tokyo) became another smash hit after it was used as the opening theme of the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;UgoUgo Rūga Ni-gō&quot;.

The band&#x27;s American debut came in 1994 with the release of the EP &quot;Five by Five&quot; on Matador Records. This was quickly followed by a full-length album, &quot;Made in USA&quot;, a compilation of tracks from their last three Japanese albums which sold 200,000 copies worldwide.

Shortly before the release of the next album &quot;Overdose&quot; in the same year, Keitarō Takanami quit the band, leaving Konishi and Nomiya as the only remaining members. In February 1995, the two set off on a successful 14-stop tour of Europe and America. Another compilation, &quot;The Sound of Music by Pizzicato Five&quot;, was released in October 1995, again featuring various tracks from the Maki-era albums.

After the 1996 release of the album &quot;Romantique 96&quot; and several singles, including the hit &quot;Baby Portable Rock&quot;, in 1997 the band formed its own label, Readymade Records, and released the commercially successful album &quot;Happy End of the World&quot; – the only Pizzicato Five album to be released unchanged in both Japan and the rest of the world.

In 1998, the band released &quot;The International Playboy &amp; Playgirl Record&quot; in Japan. It would be released a year later worldwide with a slightly different track listing and the shortened title (which was also its Japanese title) of &quot;Playboy &amp; Playgirl&quot;.

1999 came and Pizzicato Five released the &quot;JBL Maxisonic&quot; series of EPs, followed by the album &quot;Pizzicato Five&quot;. It included songs from each of the three EPs in very different forms: &quot;Darlin&#x27; of Discothèque&quot; is shorter and instrumental, &quot;A Perfect World&quot; is a lounge-style rearrangement sung by guest vocalist Mieko Hirota and the new song &quot;20th Century Girl&quot; is based on the B-side &quot;Room Service&quot;, originally written by Masumi Arichika of TV Jesus.

===Final years===
In 2000, Matador Records released &quot;Pizzicato Five&quot; under the somewhat less confusing name of &quot;The Fifth Release from Matador&quot;. The CD version of this left out the first song &quot;Love Again&quot; but added three extra tracks (one from each of the &quot;JBL Maxisonic&quot; EPs), while the LP version shared the same title but deviated still further from the original track listing. It would also be Pizzicato Five&#x27;s last American release.

2001 saw the Japanese release of the album &quot;Çà et là du Japon&quot; and the announcement that the band was to break up, followed by a series of live events featuring guest performances by old members and two further &quot;Big Hits and Jet Lags&quot; albums – &quot;Pizzicato Five R.I.P.&quot; (1998–2001) and &quot;Singles&quot; (1993–2001).

<text>Friedrich Albert Lange (; ; 28 September 1828 – 21 November 1875) was a German philosopher and sociologist.

==Biography==

Lange was born in Wald, near Solingen, the son of the theologian, Johann Peter Lange. He was educated at Duisburg, Zürich and Bonn, where he distinguished himself in gymnastics as much as academically. In 1852 he became a schoolmaster at Cologne; in 1853 &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in philosophy at Bonn; and in 1858 schoolmaster at Duisburg, resigning when the government forbade schoolmasters to take part in political activities.

Lange entered journalism as editor of the &quot;Rhein- und Ruhr-Zeitung&quot; in 1862 in the cause of political and social reform. His &quot;ceterum censeo&quot; can be considered to be the repeated demand for Bismarck&#x27;s resignation. He was prominent in public affairs, yet found enough time to write most of his best-known books, &quot;Die Leibesübungen&quot; (1863), &quot;Die Arbeiterfrage&quot; (1865, 5th ed. 1894), &quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot; (1866), and &quot;John Stuart Mills Ansichten über die soziale Frage&quot; (1866). He also wrote a number of works on pedagogy and psychology. In 1863, Lange supported the socialist leader Ferdinand Lassalle in an important trial concerning the constitutional guarantee of academic freedom. From 1864 to 1866, Lange was a member of the executive committee of the Association of German Labour Unions (&quot;Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine&quot;), an early organisation of the German labour movement. One of his colleagues there was August Bebel, the Social-Democratic leader who wrote of him that &quot;he had a short and strong figure, and was of a sympathetic presence. He had magnificent eyes, and was one of the most amiable men whom I have ever known. He won the hearts of people at first sight&quot; while also describing him as of &quot;firm character&quot;.

In 1866, discouraged by affairs in Germany, he moved to Winterthur, near Zürich, to become connected with the democratic newspaper, &quot;Winterthurer Landbote&quot;. In 1869 he was &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Zürich, and the next year he was appointed professor of inductive philosophy, a new position. He was also engaged in the Swiss Democratic movement and helped write the constitution of the Canton of Zurich. This was distinguished by the use of &quot;direct democratic&quot; measures such as referendum and recall. Still in Zürich he recognized first signs of his illness, which led several years later to his death. The strong French sympathies of the Swiss in the Franco-Prussian War as well as the prospect for a pension for his wife in the case of his death led to his speedy resignation. He had an offer from the universities of Würzburg, Königsberg, Kiel, Gießen and Jena, but in 1872 he accepted a professorship at the University of Marburg. He is sometimes credited with founding the Marburg School of neo-Kantianism, along with his star pupil, Hermann Cohen. It was Cohen, however, who pioneered the Marburg School&#x27;s characteristic logicist interpretation of Kantian philosophy. In later years, Lange accepted Cohen&#x27;s refutation of a psychological interpretation of the &quot;a priori&quot;, to which he himself had once subscribed.

Although he rejected Marxist materialism, a materialism that, according to Engels and Marx, he had completely misunderstood, Lange continued to influence the German Social-Democratic movement. He favoured an ethically motivated, reformist socialism. He especially influenced some leaders of the Lassallean General German Workers&#x27; Union and, posthumously, the Revisionist theoretician Eduard Bernstein, whose slogan &quot;Kant, not cant&quot; proclaimed his abandonment of Marxian &quot;scientific socialism&quot; in favour of a neo-Kantian, ethically based social reformism. Subsequent leaders of the Marburg School, such as Cohen and Natorp, continued this association with the reformist wing of the SPD. Unhappily, his body was already stricken with disease. He no longer played a role in the unification of the Lassalleans with Bebel&#x27;s socialists into the unified SPD in May 1875. After a lingering illness, probably gastro-intestinal cancer, he died in Marburg in November of that year. His &quot;Logische Studien&quot; (&quot;Logical Studies&quot;) were published by Hermann Cohen in 1877. Lange also wrote a number of literary studies which were published posthumously. His main work, the &quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot; is a didactic exposition of principles rather than a history in the proper sense. According to Lange, &quot;to think clearly about materialism is to refute it&quot;.

There is a comprehensive school named after him, the Friedrich-Albert-Lange-Gesamtschule, in Wald, his birthplace, which is now part of the city of Solingen.

==Overview of his philosophy==
Adopting the Kantian standpoint that we can know nothing but phenomena, Lange maintained that neither materialism nor any other metaphysical system has a valid claim to ultimate truth. For empirical phenomenal knowledge, however, materialism with its exact scientific methods has done a most valuable service. Ideal metaphysics, though they fail of the inner truth of things, have a value as the embodiment of high aspirations, in the same way as poetry and religion. In Lange&#x27;s &quot;Logische Studien&quot;, which attempts a reconstruction of formal logic, the leading idea is that reasoning has validity in so far as it can be represented in terms of space. His &quot;Arbeiterfrage&quot; advocates an ill-defined form of socialism. It protests against contemporary industrial selfishness, and against the organization of industry on the Darwinian principle of struggle for existence.

== Political activism ==
Lange was a known political activist who frequently advocated for nonviolent social change in Germany, commonly attributed to his support of worker’s rights and women&#x27;s suffrage following the upsurge of labor movements during Germany’s early industrialization. Lange was sympathetic towards the rallying of workers&#x27; unions as he believed them to be a crucial step towards the egalitarian society he details in a large variety of his published works. When Lange was twenty, he became an official member of the German Social Democratic Party, otherwise known as the SPD, and would swiftly rise to prominence primarily as a result of his dedication to improving workers’ well-being and education. He would remain an important piece of the SPD until his death at the age of forty-seven. Lange upheld his belief in passive reform and argued against the use of violence in spite of many revolutionaries who he frequently clashed with. His loyalty to his ideals enabled him to accrue a great following of supporters that believed in his idea of a peaceful revolution, giving him a powerful basis for his later movements and publications.

Prior to his time spent in the SPD, Lange was a member of the General Herman Workers’ Association, also known as ADAV. The association was founded by Ferdinand Lassalle and the two would frequently engage in debate in regard to their differing stances on the role held by the state in supporting significant social change. He served as a primary editor for the party&#x27;s newspaper, enabling him to shape the public&#x27;s perception of socialism while engaging in meaningful debates regarding the organization&#x27;s goals. Lange was a strong supporter of the state&#x27;s power to influence the revolution and remained steadfast in his opposition to revolutionary violence. During his time as an editor in the association, he would establish trade unions through his socialist approach to politics that would ultimately form the basis of the upcoming socialist movement in Germany. In 1865, Lange would decide to leave the ADAV under the notion that the organization had become overly authoritarian and ego-centric under the leadership of Lassalle.

In 1848, Lange, being only twenty years of age, was deeply involved in the revolutionary uprisings spreading across Europe. He was seen rallying behind workers as they demanded political reform and freedom from the Prussian monarchy. During this time Lange was an outspoken advocate for the use of revolutionary violence, as he believed it was necessary to achieve an equitable society, however, he would reconsider his stance following the failure of the revolution. Being encouraged to flee Germany in light of his role in the revolution, Lange would continue writing about German socialist reform while living in Switzerland, drawing primarily from socialist and liberal ideologies.

Following his change in perception regarding the nature of revolutionary violence, Lange shifted his approach to supporting the underrepresented working class. Lange had a fundamental belief that the primary concern for the working class lay in its inaccessibility to affordable living based on the minimal wages being provided. Lange would spend a significant amount of time analyzing the beliefs of Thomas Malthus. Thomas believed that an increase in food availability should be the first and foremost concern when attempting to raise the standing of the working class, as the primary constraint is in the struggle for mere existence. While Malthus&#x27; notions would be most commonly interpreted as supportive of capitalism and widely disparaged in Germany, Lange had a unique understanding of his argument that led him to conclude that bolstering the lower class&#x27;s living conditions must be brought through a fundamental change in the legal system. He believed that it was in the responsibility of those in a higher class, especially those involved in state government, to listen to the demands of the working class, and mediate the standard of living through gradual reform via rational arguments.

<text>Lethbridge ( ) is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada. With a population of 106,550 in the 2023 municipal census, Lethbridge became the fourth Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people. The nearby Canadian Rocky Mountains contribute to the city&#x27;s warm summers, mild winters, and windy climate. Lethbridge lies approximately southeast of Calgary on the Oldman River and northwest of the Canada–United States border at the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing.

Lethbridge is the commercial, educational, financial, industrial and transportation centre of southern Alberta. The city&#x27;s economy developed from drift mining for coal in the late 19th century and agriculture in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The University of Lethbridge, the only university in Alberta south of Calgary, is located here, as well as Lethbridge Polytechnic. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, galleries, museums, gardens, and sports centres.

== History ==
Before the 19th century, the Lethbridge area was populated by several First Nations at various times. The Blackfoot referred to the area as &quot;Aksaysim&quot; (&quot;steep banks&quot;), &quot;Mek-kio-towaghs&quot; (&quot;painted rock&quot;), &quot;Assini-etomochi&quot; (&quot;where we slaughtered the Cree&quot;) and &quot;Sik-ooh-kotok&quot; (&quot;coal&quot;). The Tsuutʼina (Sarcee) referred to it as &quot;Chadish-kashi&quot; (&quot;black/rocks&quot;), the Cree as &quot;Kuskusukisay-guni&quot; (&quot;black/rocks&quot;), and the Nakoda (Stoney) as &quot;Ipubin-saba-akabin&quot; (&quot;digging coal&quot;). The Kutenai referred to it as &quot;ʔa•kwum&quot;.

After the United States Army stopped alcohol trading with the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whisky trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post&#x27;s nickname became Fort Whoop-Up. The whisky trade led to the Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent to stop the trade and establish order, arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on October 9, 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.
Lethbridge&#x27;s economy developed from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western&#x27;s president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name. By the turn of the century, the mines employed about 150 men and produced of coal each day. In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories, with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. After the war, increasing oil and natural gas production gradually replaced coal production, and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.

The first rail line in Lethbridge was opened on August 28, 1885, by the Alberta Railway and Coal Company, which bought the North Western Coal and Navigation Company five years later. The rail industry&#x27;s dependence on coal and the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s (CPR) efforts to settle southern Alberta with immigrants boosted Lethbridge&#x27;s economy. After the CPR moved the divisional point of its Crowsnest Line from Fort Macleod to Lethbridge in 1905 and a new Lethbridge Canadian Pacific Railway Station (Union Station) was built in 1906, the city became the regional centre for Southern Alberta. In the mid-1980s, the CPR moved its rail yards in downtown Lethbridge to nearby Kipp, and Lethbridge ceased to be a rail hub.

Between 1907 and 1913, a development boom occurred in Lethbridge, making it the main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a Lethbridge Transit, a streetcar system, and Exhibition Park—as well as a construction boom and rising real estate prices—transformed the mining town into a significant city. Between World War I and World War II, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World War II, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city&#x27;s population and economy. Lethbridge became a centre for post-secondary education in Southern Alberta with the opening of Lethbridge Polytechnic (formerly Lethbridge College) in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.

In 2015 American musician Marilyn Manson was assaulted by a local resident in the city&#x27;s Denny&#x27;s after the singer allegedly insulted a woman in the restaurant in the early hours of the morning.

== Geography ==


The city of Lethbridge is located at 49.7° north latitude and 112.833° west longitude and covers an area of . It is divided by the Oldman River; its valley, the Oldman River valley parks system, has been turned into one of the largest urban park systems in North America at of protected land. Lethbridge is Alberta&#x27;s third-largest city by population and area after Calgary and Edmonton. It is located near the Canadian Rockies, southeast of Calgary.

Lethbridge is split into three geographical areas: north, south and west. The Oldman River separates West Lethbridge from the other two, while Crowsnest Trail and the Canadian Pacific Kansas City rail line separate North and South Lethbridge. The newest and largest of the three areas, West Lethbridge (pop. 40,898) is home to the University of Lethbridge—which opened at that site in 1971. Although several farms existed on what is now the Westside, the first housing development was not completed until 1974 and Whoop-Up Drive access opened only in 1975. Much of the city&#x27;s recent growth has been on the west side, and it has the youngest median age of the three. The north side (pop. 28,172) was originally populated by workers from local coal mines. It has the oldest population of the three areas, is home to multiple industrial parks and includes the former Hamlet of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge in 1978. South Lethbridge (pop. 32,412) is the commercial heart of the city; it contains the downtown core, Downtown Lethbridge, the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments, and the Lethbridge Polytechnic.

=== Climate ===
Lethbridge has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with an average maximum temperature of and an average minimum temperature of . With precipitation averaging , and 264 dry days on average, Lethbridge is the eleventh driest city in Canada.

On average, Lethbridge has 116 days with wind speed of or higher, ranking it as the second city in Canada for such weather.

Its high elevation of and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains provides Lethbridge with cooler summers than other locations in the Canadian Prairies. These factors protect the city from strong northwest and southwest winds and contribute to frequent Chinook winds during the winter. Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies, reducing the severity and duration of winter cold periods and resulting in fewer days with snow cover. The average daytime temperature peaks by the end of July/beginning of August, when it reaches . The city&#x27;s temperature reaches a maximum high of or greater on average once or twice a year.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Lethbridge was on August 10, 2018. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on January 7, 1909; December 18, 1924; January 3, 1950; and December 29, 1968.

== Economy ==


Lethbridge is southern Alberta&#x27;s commercial, distribution, financial and industrial centre (although Medicine Hat plays a similar role in southeastern Alberta). It has a trading area population of 341,180, including parts of British Columbia, and provides jobs for up to 86,000 people who commute to and within the city from a radius of .

Lethbridge&#x27;s economy has traditionally been agriculture-based; however, it has diversified in recent years. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. Several national companies are based in Lethbridge. From its founding in 1935, Canadian Freightways based its head office there until moving operations to Calgary in 1948, though its call centre remains in Lethbridge. Taco Time Canada was based in the city from 1978 to 1995 before moving to Calgary. Minute Muffler, which began in 1969, is based in Lethbridge. International shipping company H &amp; R Transport has been based in the city since 1955. Braman Furniture, which has locations in Manitoba and Ontario, was headquartered in Lethbridge from 1991 to 2008.

Lethbridge serves as a hub for commercial activity in the region by providing services and amenities. There are many transport services in Lethbridge, including Red Arrow buses, four provincial highways, rail service and Lethbridge Airport, are concentrated in or near the city. In 2004, the police services of Lethbridge and Coaldale combined to form the Lethbridge Police Service. Lethbridge provides municipal water to Coaldale, Coalhurst, Diamond City, Iron Springs, Monarch, Shaughnessy and Turin.

In 2002, the municipal government organized Economic Development Lethbridge, a body responsible for promoting and developing the city&#x27;s commercial interests. Two years later, the city joined in a partnership with 24 other local communities to create an economic development alliance called SouthGrow, representing a population of over 140,000. In 2006, Economic Development Lethbridge partnered with SouthGrow Regional Initiative and Alberta SouthWest Regional Alliance to create the Southern Alberta Alternative Energy Partnership. This partnership promotes business related to alternative energy, including wind power, solar power and biofuel, in the region.

== Arts and culture ==

Lethbridge was designated a Cultural Capital of Canada for the 2004–2005 season. The Southern Alberta Ethnic Association (Multicultural Heritage Centre) promotes multiculturalism and ethnic heritage in the community.

The city is home to venues and organizations promoting the arts. Founded in 1958, the Allied Arts Council of Lethbridge is the largest organization in the city dedicated to preserving and enhancing the local arts. In the spring of 2007, the Allied Arts Council Facilities Steering Committee initiated the Arts Re:Building Together Campaign, a grass roots campaign initiative to raise awareness and support for improving arts facilities in Lethbridge. The campaign identified three arts buildings: the Yates Memorial Centre, the Bowman Arts Centre, and the Southern Alberta Art Gallery as cornerstone facilities in the community requiring care and attention. On July 14, 2007, the Finance Committee of City Council approved four arts capital projects for inclusion in the city&#x27;s Ten Year Capital Plan. Under the campaign to 2010, the renovation and expansion of the Southern Alberta Art Gallery was completed, a new Community Arts Centre will be built in downtown Lethbridge, the City of Lethbridge has a Public Art Program, and a committee was formed to research the possibility of a new Performing Arts Centre in Lethbridge.

Lethbridge has a public library and three major museum/galleries. The Southern Alberta Art Gallery is a contemporary gallery; the community arts centre Casa, administered by the Allied Arts Council; and the University of Lethbridge Art Gallery produces contemporary exhibitions including works from its extensive collection of Canadian, American and European art.

The city is also home to the Lethbridge Symphony, which was founded in 1960 and incorporated as a non-profit in 1961. It has produced several spin-off music groups, including the Southern Alberta Chamber Orchestra, and the still-active Lethbridge Musical Theatre, which produces an annual show. Vox Musica, which traces its roots back to 1968, is a community choir previously based at the University of Lethbridge. As a fully independent non-profit society, Vox Musica continues to rehearse and perform at Southminster United Church and around the community. Theatrical productions are presented by the University of Lethbridge&#x27;s drama department and New West Theatre, which performs at the Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre using its two theatres: the 500-seat proscenium Yates Theatre and the 180-seat black box Sterndale Bennett Theatre.

Lethbridge hosts a number of annual festivals and events throughout the year including Kiwanis Music Festival, Lethbridge Independent Film Festival, Centric Music Festival, Lethbridge Pride Fest, Street Machine Weekend, Lethbridge Dragon Boat Festival, Word on the Street, Lethbridge Electronic Music Festival, and many more. The best-known event in Lethbridge is Whoop-Up Days, a rodeo and fair held annually in August.

== Attractions ==
The city, which began as a frontier town, has several historical attractions. The Lethbridge Viaduct, commonly known as the &quot;High Level Bridge&quot;, is the longest and highest steel trestle bridge in North America. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city&#x27;s western edge. Indian Battle Park, in the coulees of the Oldman River, commemorates the last battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot First Nations in 1870.

Originally known as Fort Hamilton, Fort Whoop-Up was a centre of illegal activities during the late 19th century. It was first built in 1869 by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton as a whisky post and was destroyed by fire a year later. A second, sturdier structure later replaced the fort.

As the cultural centre of southern Alberta, Lethbridge has notable cultural attractions. Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden in south Lethbridge was opened in 1967 as part of a Canadian centennial celebration attended by Japan&#x27;s Prince and Princess Takamatsu. The Galt Museum &amp; Archives is the largest museum in the Lethbridge area; the building housing the museum served as the city&#x27;s main hospital during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries. Several other important attractions are based in Lethbridge, including the Lethbridge Military Museum and the Helen Schuler Nature Centre which educates about the river bottom and coulees.

Several structures such as the historic post office are prominent on the skyline of Lethbridge. Less well-known than the High Level Bridge, the post office is one of the most distinctive buildings in Lethbridge. Built in 1912, the four-storey structure is crowned by a functioning clock tower. Other prominent buildings include office towers; the water tower, which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant; and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.

From March 2018 to August 2020, Lethbridge was home to ARCHES, 24-hour supervised drug use site. It was the busiest SCS in North America with 663 visits a day. &quot;The Star&quot; called it a &quot;new landmark&quot;. The SCS featured injection drug and inhalation drug facilities and it was a subject of disagreement by the nearby business community. The site closed at the end of August 2020 after the province removed grant funding following discovery of misappropriation of public funds. A week long survey was held for the 2020 budgeting priorities in Lethbridge. 401 randomly selected people participated in this survey and 43 percent of them identified the presence of ARCHES SCS as the top concern. Only 8% of participants identified the same issue as the top concern in 2018.

== Sports and recreation ==

Lethbridge has designated 16 percent of the land within city boundaries as parkland, including the Oldman River valley parks system. It has facilities for field sports, numerous baseball diamonds, the Spitz Stadium, the Nicholas Sheran Park (a disc golf course), two skateparks, a BMX track, a climbing wall, a dozen tennis courts, and seven pools. It is home to five golf courses, including the award-winning Paradise Canyon Golf Resort, and is within of several others.

Built for the 1975 Canada Winter Games, the VisitLethbridge.com Arena, formerly the |ENMAX Centre, is Lethbridge&#x27;s multipurpose arena. The 6,500-seat facility has hosted concerts, three-ring circuses, multicultural events, national curling championships, basketball events, banquets, skating events and is home to the Lethbridge Hurricanes, a major Western Hockey League franchise. The arena has a running track, racquetball and squash courts, and a full-size ice rink. In 1997, the Servus Sports Centre (originally the Lethbridge Soccer Centre) was built directly south of the ENMAX Centre and added two regulation size indoor soccer pitches to the complex. The Lethbridge Kyodokan Judo Club facility is located next to the Community Savings Place, and has been a Judo Canada Regional Training Centre since 2015.

On the city&#x27;s west side, Phase 1 of the Cavendish Farms Centre, formerly the ATB Centre, a recreation complex, opened in 2016 and houses two hockey rinks and the Lethbridge Curling Club. Phase 2 of this project The Cor Van Ray YMCA opened in May 2019 and includes a field house with basketball courts and a 300m running track, as well as an aquatics centre with slides and a wave pool.

Several winter sports venues are in or near Lethbridge. The city has six indoor ice arenas with a total ice area of and a total seating capacity of 8,149. Other than the ENMAX Centre, all ice surfaces are available from October to April only. Lethbridge is east of the Castle Mountain ski resort.

Lethbridge hosted the inaugural championship match for the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League in 2011, while the city&#x27;s WWCFL team, the Lethbridge Steel, played in three straight title matches from 2012 to 2014.

== Government ==


Eight councillors and a mayor make up the Lethbridge City Council. City voters elect a new government every four years. The last election was October 18, 2021, Lethbridge municipal election. Lethbridge does not have a ward system, so the mayor and all councillors are elected at large. The 2009–2011 operating budget of the City of Lethbridge was –278 million, more than half of which came from property tax. One member of parliament (MP) representing federal electoral district of Lethbridge sits in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and two members of Alberta&#x27;s legislative assembly (MLAs), representing Lethbridge-East (UCP) and Lethbridge-West (NDP), sit in the Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton.

Traditionally, political leanings in Lethbridge have been right-wing. Federally, from 1917 to 1930, Lethbridge voters switched between various federal parties, but from 1935 to 1957, they voted Social Credit in each election. Progressive Conservatives held office from 1958 until 1993, when the Reform Party of Canada was formed. The Reform party and its various subsequent incarnations such as the current Conservative Party of Canada have dominated the polls since. The city&#x27;s two provincial electoral districts are represented by one government MLA, Nathan Neudorf for Lethbridge-East, and one opposition MLA, Rob Miyashiro for Lethbridge-West (following a by-election to replace Shannon Phillips).

Alberta Health Services, the provincial health authority that plans and delivers health services on behalf of the Ministry of Health, administers public health services in Lethbridge. Chinook Health oversees facilities in southwestern Alberta, such as the Chinook Regional Hospital and St. Michael&#x27;s Health Centre.

== Transportation ==
Mass transit in Lethbridge consists of 40 buses (with an average age of 10 years) operating on more than a dozen routes. Traditionally, bus routes in the city started and ended downtown. In the early 21st century, however, Lethbridge Transit introduced cross-town and shuttle routes, such as University of Lethbridge to Lethbridge Polytechnic, University of Lethbridge to the North Lethbridge terminal, and Lethbridge Polytechnic to the North Lethbridge terminal. Several routes converge near the Chinook Regional Hospital, although it is not officially a terminal.

The Parks and Recreation department maintains the citywide, pedestrian / cyclist Coal Banks Trail system. The system was designed to connect the Oldman River valley with other areas of the city, including Pavan Park in the north, Henderson Lake in the east, Highways 4 and 5 in the south and a loop in West Lethbridge (including University Drive and McMaster Blvd).

Four provincial highways (3, 4, 5, and 25) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads, including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive. This infrastructure and its location on the CANAMEX Corridor has helped make Lethbridge and its freight depots a major shipping destination. Lethbridge is north of the United States border via Highways 4 and 5 and south of Calgary via Highways 2 and 3. Highways 2, 3 and 4 form part of the CANAMEX Corridor, a trade route between Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

Lethbridge has a commercial airport, Lethbridge Airport, and the Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) rail yards in Kipp, Alberta ( away). The airport provides commercial flights to Calgary, industrial and corporate opportunities, as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States. Lethbridge Canadian Pacific Railway Station was served by passenger rail on the CPR line between 1906 and 1971. The rail yards were eventually moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983. The yards were planned for redevelopment with a mix of multi-family residential, commercial and light industrial land uses. The Park Place Mall is now located on the portion of the former rail yards north of 1 Avenue South between Scenic Drive to the west and Stafford Drive to the east.

== Education ==
The Lethbridge School Division and the separate Holy Spirit Roman Catholic School Division administer grades kindergarten through 12 locally. The Palliser School Division, which is based in Lethbridge, administers public primary and secondary education in the outlying areas. Lethbridge School Division administers five high schools (Chinook High School, Immanuel Christian High School, Lethbridge Collegiate Institute, Victoria Park High School, and Winston Churchill High School), four middle schools, and 14 elementary schools in Lethbridge. Immanuel Christian covers grades 6 through 12. There is also a Francophone school in Lethbridge, which is part of the Francophone school board, Conseil scolaire FrancoSud, based in Calgary.

Lethbridge is home to Lethbridge Polytechnic, founded in 1957, and the University of Lethbridge, founded in 1967. Red Crow Community College has a campus in the city. During the 2015–2016 school year, the University of Lethbridge and the Lethbridge Polytechnic had a combined enrolment of 14,820, which represented 20% of the city&#x27;s population. 

== Media ==
Lethbridge has two major newspapers: the daily &quot;Lethbridge Herald&quot; and the weekly &quot;Lethbridge Sun Times&quot;. The university and polytechnic both have a student-run, weekly newspaper. There are 12 FM radio stations, including CKXU-FM, a campus radio station located at the University of Lethbridge.

<text>Wŏnhyo (; ; 617 – 686, meaning: &quot;Dawnbreak&quot;) was one of the most important philosophers and commentators in East Asian Buddhism and the most prolific scholar in Korean Buddhism. As one of the most eminent scholar-monks in East Asian history, his extensive literary output runs to over 80 works in 240 fascicles. His most influential commentaries are those on buddha-nature texts like the *&quot;Vajrasamādhisūtra&quot;, the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, and the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra&quot;. These works became classics widely respected throughout Korea, China and Japan.

Wonhyo&#x27;s work was foundational for all of Korean Buddhism and also influenced Buddhism in other East Asian nations. Chinese masters who were heavily influenced by Wonhyo include Huayan masters like Fazang, Li Tongxuan, and Chengguan. The Japanese monks Gyōnen, Zenshu and Joto of the Kegon school were also influenced by him.

==Biography==

Wonhyo was born in Amnyang (押梁), (modern Gyeongsan, South Korea). Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his career as a monk studying under various Korean Buddhist teachers and living in Hwangnyongsa Temple.

One of the most famous episodes of Wonhyo&#x27;s life, found in various hagiographical accounts, is the story of his aborted attempt to travel to Tang China to study the Yogācāra teachings of the school of Xuanzang (602–664). The hagiographies of Wohnyo explain that what kept him from leaving Korea was an enlightenment experience.

The story says that in 661 Wonhyo and a close friend called Uisang (625–702) were traveling to China, when, somewhere in the region of Baekje, the pair were caught in a heavy downpour and forced to take shelter in what they believed to be an earthen sanctuary. During the night Wonhyo was overcome with thirst, and reaching out grasped what he perceived to be a gourd, and drinking from it was refreshed with a draught of cool, refreshing water. Upon waking the next morning, however, the companions discovered much to their amazement that their shelter was in fact an ancient tomb littered with human skulls, and the vessel from which Wonhyo had drunk was a human skull full of brackish water. Startled by the experience of believing that a gruesome liquid was a refreshing treat, Wonhyo was astonished at the power of the human mind to transform reality. As he reflected on this, he had a deep insight into how the world is a creation of mind and directly experienced the Yogacara principle of &quot;mind-only&quot; (cittamatra). Due to this insight, he did not feel it necessary to travel to China since all phenomena are ultimately not outside our own mind.

The sources also state that at that time he proclaimed: &quot;Because of the arising of thought, various phenomena arise; since thought ceases, a cave and a grave are not two. Since there are no dharmas outside of the mind, why should I seek them somewhere? I will not go to the Tang.&quot; This statement refers to a passage in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;.

Wonhyo left the priesthood after an affair with a princess named Yoseok. He then turned to spreading Buddhism among the common people as a layman, calling himself a &quot;Layman of Minor Lineage.&quot; He was known not only for his extensive writings and commentaries, but also for his unconventional behaviors. Wonhyo became famous for visiting towns and villages and performing songs and dances to teach Buddhism. He is also said to have visited bars and brothels, played the lute and slept in the homes of common people. While the orthodox Buddhist tradition discouraged such behaviors, his songs and dances were seen as upaya, or skillful means, meant to help save all sentient beings. At other times he lived alone in the mountains or along rivers, wrote various works and gave lectures on Buddhism and taught the people to chant the Buddha&#x27;s name.

Because of this aspect of his character, Wonhyo ended up becoming a popular folk hero in Korea. Wohnyo later married and had a son, Seol Chong, who is considered to be one of the great Confucian scholars of Silla.

Wonhyo died while staying at Hyeolsa in 686 at the age of 70. His remains were interred by his son at Bunhwangsa.

=== Influence ===

Wohnyo&#x27;s work influenced all of East Asian Buddhism. His commentaries on various texts were widely respected by Buddhist scholars in Korea, China and Japan. As noted by Hee-Sung Keel:

Wohnyo&#x27;s collaboration with Uisang directly led to the establishment of the influential Hwaeom (Korean Huayan) school as a major stream of thought in Korea.

Wohnyo is also thought to have founded Korea&#x27;s lone riverside temple, Silleuksa, in the late 600s. While Wonhyo was in Bunhwangsa (in modern Guhwang-dong, Gyeongju), he wrote a number of books. For such strong association with Wonhyo, a research center and a shrine named Bogwangjeon hall dedicated to Wonhyo&#x27;s legacy are located in Bunhwangsa.

==Philosophy==
Wonhyo&#x27;s career last from the end of Korea&#x27;s Three Kingdoms era to the dawn of the Unified Silla kingdom (668–935). Wonhyo extensive work was vital for the reception of Mahayana Buddhism in Korea and as such he is a central figure in the development of Korean Buddhism. Wonhyo was especially influenced by Buddha-nature literature, East Asian Yogācāra, Huayan thought and the philosophy of Essence-Function (). His work is widely cited by later scholarly works from China, Korea and Japan.

In his extensive scholarly works, composed mostly as commentaries and a few treatises, he developed a unified Mahayana Buddhist philosophy drawing on all the different Chinese Buddhist traditions (including Sutra Studies, Pure Land, Huayan, Sanlun, Yogacara, Vinaya, Logic).

Wonhyo never associated himself with any specific Buddhist tradition and drew on a wide variety of Mahayana sources. Wonhyo&#x27;s main focus was on Yogacara and Buddha-nature texts like the *&quot;Vajrasamādhisūtra&quot;, the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, and the &quot;Mahāparinivāṇasūtra&quot;. His most influential writings include commentaries on these three texts, all of which were widely respected throughout East Asia.

=== Harmonization of disputes ===
A key project of Wonhyo was to harmonize the various Buddhist teachings and traditions all of which he saw as non-contradictory. As such, the &#x27;harmonization of disputes&#x27; (hwajaeng; 和諍) is central for Wonhyo&#x27;s philosophical outlook. Wohnyo&#x27;s works often seek to harmonize the various seemingly contradictory Buddhist teachings found in all of the Buddhist texts by showing how they are based on a single deeper principle.

Wonhyoʼs harmonization methodology is found in almost all his works and often expresses itself in a deep investigation of the root of seemingly conflicting Buddhist doctrines and positions. Wonhyo&#x27;s generally seeks to show that these variant doctrines often arise from things like the background, biases and motivations of particular authors of doctrinal positions. This approach to doctrinal harmonization is quite different than that of most Chinese commentators who instead rely on hierarchical doctrinal classification schemas (Chinese: panjiao, Korean: pangyo 判教) which placed only some teachings at the top of a doctrinal hierarchy. Instead of creating a hierarchy, Wonhyoʼs method seeks to show how the various Buddhist teachings are mutually interconnected in a harmonious whole. As such, Wonhyo criticized thinkers who hierarchically classificed the Dharma like Zhiyi. Wohnyo writes:You should know that the Buddha&#x27;s meaning is deep and profound without limit. So if you want [like Chih-i] to divide the scriptural meaning into four teachings, or limit the Buddha&#x27;s intent with five periods, then this is like using a snail shell to scoop out the ocean, or trying to see the heavens through a narrow tube. Wonhyo&#x27;s &quot;Hwajaeng theory&quot; (harmonization of disputes) was summarized in his work &quot;Ten Approaches to the Reconciliation of Doctrinal Disputes&quot; (&quot;Simmun hwajaeng non&quot; 十門和諍論, 십문화쟁론). Wonhyo often traces the origin of intra-Buddhist doctrinal conflict to a misunderstanding of linguistic conventions like difference and sameness, and affirmation and negation. Ultimately, Wohnyo&#x27;s analysis of conflicting interpretations of Buddhist doctrine and doctrinal disputes is thus centered on language and on the relationship between names and meanings (which are neither identical nor remain static/fixed). According to Wohnyo, disputes among Buddhist schools often arise due to grasping at literal meaning of words. For him, all Buddhist teachings point to a single truth. As such, Wohnyo writes: &quot;If you take a sentence literally, it could be disagreed with. If you focus on its meaning, you could understand it.&quot;

In his &quot;Reconciliation of Doctrinal Disputes&quot;, Wonhyo proceeds to draw on numerous Buddhist philosophical systems and on the Mahayana sutras like the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; and &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; to resolve doctrinal conflicts and demonstrate the compatibility of all of Mahayana Buddhist teachings. For Wohnyo, all Mahayana doctrines are metaphors which point to the same ultimate truth.

Another element of his harmonization method was to draw on Huayan metaphysics of interpenetration to demonstrate how all Buddhist teachings are ultimately in a state of non-obstruction. Thus one can say that Wohnyo saw all Buddhist doctrines as a harmonious interpenetrating reality, and as such he often called his philosophy &quot;interpenetrated Buddhism&quot; (&quot;t&#x27;ong pulgyo,&quot; 通佛教).

=== One-mind and essence-function thought ===
Wonhyo&#x27;s philosophy is centered on the &quot;One Mind theory&quot; (Ch: &quot;yixinshixiang&quot;, 一心思想; ). Wŏnhyo&#x27;s worldview sees the one mind as the ultimate reality which manifests in two aspects:

* “true-thusness”, which is intrinsically pure and unchanging Thusness (Tathātā, 眞如), the ultimate reality, the true nature of the mind, which is without concepts or discrimination, without arising or ceasing.
* “arising-and-ceasing”, which is impure, impermanent, subject to cause and effect and manifests as all forms of samsara and delusion. This is the mind of everyday reality, the mind of suffering (dukkha) and the mind of the six realms.

As such, the One Mind is the non-dual source of all phenomena, the source of both samsara and nirvana, and it contains both purity and ignorance and defilement.

The one mind (一心) theory is drawn from the influential treatise &quot;The Mahayana Awakening of Faith&quot; (大乘起信論; pinyin: &quot;Dàshéng Qǐxìn Lùn&quot;) and is discussed in Wonhyo&#x27;s numerous commentaries. This doctrine is a synthesis of the Mahayana doctrines of the ālayavijñāna (storehouse consciousness) and buddha-nature. The importance of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;&#x27;s theories for Wonhyo is proved by the fact that he wrote nine commentaries on this text (only two are extant). The &quot;Awakening of Faith&#x27;s&quot; One Mind teaching is one of the central principles which Wonhyo uses to harmonize the various Buddhist teachings.

Another important and related doctrine which Wonhyo relies and expands upon is the Chinese theory of essence-function (體用, Chinese pinyin: &quot;tǐ yòng&quot;, Korean: &quot;che-yong&quot;) which is also found in the Awakening of Faith. Essence here refers to pure Suchness, the ultimate reality, i.e. the One Mind; while function refers to all relative phenomena (dharmas). These two aspects are seen by Wonhyo as non-dual, as part of a harmonious whole.

=== Original enlightenment and Buddhist practice ===
Wonhyo also wrote on and developed the related theory of original enlightenment (Chinese: 本覺; pinyin: &quot;běnjué&quot;, Korean: &quot;bongak&quot;), which sees enlightenment as immanent in the mind, though it has to be discovered through purifying the mind and practicing the six paramitas. Indeed, for Wohnyo, the ultimate principle (Dharma), the essence or One Mind, is nothing but the principle of enlightenment itself which penetrates the minds of all sentient beings.

According to Wohnyo, liberation or enlightenment means to truly know that all phenomena are the One Mind which is already immanent within the mind of sentient beings. It is thus to understand that we already are enlightenment. As such, enlightenment is also called &quot;returning to the original source&quot;. Thus, for Wohnyo, nothing new is attainment in enlightenment, one merely recognizes what is already there.

How does one reach or return to the original enlightenment? For Wohnyo, this happens through the process of &quot;actualizing enlightenment&quot; through which a Buddhist practitioner can move away from the state of non-enlightenment towards the enlightened source (though in reality, these two states are non-dual, not completely separate, but are like waves and the ocean). To actualize enlightenment and let go of ignorance and duality, religious practice is required. As one practices, original enlightenment reveals itself as ignorance and the defilements are gradually eliminated. Indeed, it is through the power of original enlightenment itself that the mind is purified in the process of actualizing enlightenment.

Wonhyo&#x27;s held that it was possible to apply these deep principles in one&#x27;s personal everyday life. As such, he met with commoners and elites alike and taught people according to their needs. For the commoners he generally taught a flexible teaching which included Buddhist metaphysics and the simple Pure Land practice of reciting the name of Amitabha with a sincere mind intent on bodhicitta.

== Works ==
Wonhyo was a very prolific author with a broad mastery of the Buddhist canon. He is said to have composed 80 texts in over 200 fascicles. Only twenty two are extant. As noted by Charles Muller &quot;except for the works of the extraordinarily prolific translators such as Kumārajīva (344–413) and Hsüan-tsang (596–664), this is probably the largest literary output by a single scholar in East Asian Buddhist history.&quot;

His life&#x27;s work includes writings on all the key Mahayana Buddhist topics of the day, including Prajñāpāramitā, Madhyamaka, Nirvana Sutra, Buddha-nature, Lotus Sutra, Vinaya, Pure Land, Yogācāra, State Protection, Huayan, and Buddhist Logic. Most of Wonhyo&#x27;s writings are commentaries on classic Mahayana Buddhist works. His commentaries are often holistic ones, which, according to Robert Buswell, &quot;seek to demonstrate, first, how each section, part, and division of the scripture resonates with the rest of the sections, parts, and divisions of the text; and second, how the text that is the focus of his commentary reticulates within the entire fabric of the Buddhist scriptural teachings...he attempts nothing less than to demonstrate that the entirety of Mahayana Buddhism is revealed in the single sūtra that is the focus of his exegesis.&quot;

Some of his key texts include: 

* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Daehyedo gyeong jong-yo&quot; 大慧度經宗要) 
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Lotus Sutra&quot; (Beophwa jong-yo 法華宗要)
* &quot;Expository Notes to the Awakening of Mahāyāna Faith&quot; 
* &quot;Praise of Amitabhaʼs Realization of His Nature&quot;
* &quot;System of the Two Hindrances&quot;
* Commentary to the &quot;Awakening of Mahāyāna Faith&quot;
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Sutra on the Ascension of Maitreya&quot;
* &quot;Commentary on the Discrimination between the Middle and the Extremes&quot;
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Critique of Inference&quot;
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Sutra of Immeasurable Life&quot; (Muryangsugyeong jong-yo 無量壽經宗要) 
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Nirvana Sutra&quot; (Yeolban jong-yo 涅槃宗要)
* &quot;Exposition of the Vajrasamādhi-sūtra&quot;. 
* &quot;Commentary on the Flower Ornament Sutra&quot; (Hwaeom- gyeong so byeong seo 華嚴經疏并序)
* &quot;Doctrinal Essentials of the Flower Ornament Sutra&quot;
* &quot;Commentary on the Amitâbha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Amitagyeong so&quot;, 阿彌陀經疏)
* &quot;Personal Notes on the Fundamentals of Bodhisattva Precepts in the Brahmāʼs Net Sutra&quot;
* &quot;Essentials of Observing and Transgressing the Code of Bodhisattva Precepts&quot;

Wonhyo&#x27;s twenty-three extant works are currently in the process of being translated into English as a joint project between Dongguk University and Stony Brook University. The University of Hawaii Press is publishing them in five volumes. There are currently two volumes of this project published:

* &quot;Wonhyo&#x27;s Philosophy of Mind&quot;, Edited by A. Charles Muller and Cuong T. Nguyen (2012)
* &quot;Cultivating Original Enlightenment: Wonhyo&#x27;s Exposition of the Vajrasamadhi-Sutra&quot;, Translated with an introduction by Robert E. Buswell Jr. (2007)

==Legacy==
The International Taekwon-Do Federation pattern &quot;Won-Hyo&quot; is named in Wonhyo&#x27;s honor. This pattern consists of 28 movements.

The World Taekwondo Federation has a Hyeong or pattern named Ilyeo for 9th Dan black belt which means the thought of the Buddhist priest of Silla Dynasty, Wonhyo.

Wonhyo Bridge across the Han River in Seoul is named after him.

=== Wonhyo Pilgrimage Project ===
In 2011, retired Canadian journalist Tony MacGregor walked across the Korean Peninsula in an attempt to understand the awakening experience of Wonhyo. Legend says that Wonhyo walked across the peninsula in the 7th century and found enlightenment in a cave on the western side of the peninsula. MacGregor&#x27;s journey, which involved staying at mountain monasteries and talking to monks, was the first in over 1,000 years to honor Wonhyo&#x27;s accomplishment. A documentary film of the walk was completed and a project to establish a permanent pilgrimage trail is currently being developed.

<text>Johann Peter Lange (; 10 April 1802 in Sonnborn (now a part of Wuppertal) – 9 July 1884, Bonn), was a German Calvinist theologian of peasant origin.

==Biography==
He was born at Sonnborn near Elberfeld, and studied theology at Bonn (from 1822) under K. I. Nitzsch and G. C. F. Lücke, held several pastorates, and eventually (1854) settled at Bonn as professor of theology in succession to Isaac August Dorner, becoming also in 1860 counsellor to the Coblence Consistory of the old-Prussian Rhenish Ecclesiastical Province.

==Theology==
&quot;Lange has been called the poetical theologian &quot;par excellence&quot;: “It has been said of him that his thoughts succeed each other in such rapid and agitated waves that all calm reflection and all rational distinction become, in a manner, drowned” (F. Lichtenberger).

As a dogmatic writer he belonged to the school of Schleiermacher. His &quot;Christliche Dogmatik&quot; (5 volumes, 1849–1852; new edition, 1870) “contains many fruitful and suggestive thoughts, which, however, are hidden under such a mass of bold figures and strange fancies and suffer so much from want of clearness of presentation, that they did not produce any lasting effect” (Otto Pfleiderer).&quot;

==Writings==
His other works include &quot;Das Leben Jesu&quot; (3 volumes, 1844–1847; Eng. trans. 1864 and 1872), &quot;Das apostolische Zeitalter&quot; (2 volumes, 1853–1854), &quot;Grundriss der theologischen Encyklopädie&quot; (1877), &quot;Grundriss der christlichen Ethik&quot; (1878), and &quot;Grundriss der Bibelkunde&quot; (1881). In 1857 he undertook with other scholars a &quot;Theologisch-homiletisches Bibelwerk&quot;, to which he contributed commentaries on the first four books of the Pentateuch, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Matthew, Mark, Revelation. The &quot;Bibelwerk&quot; was translated into English, enlarged and revised under the general editorship of Philip Schaff, with assistance of other scholars from the United States of various denominations, under the title &quot;A Commentary on the Holy Scriptures, Critical, Doctrinal, and Homiletical&quot; (25 volumes, New York: Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, 1865–80).

<text>Mac OS X Panther (version 10.3) is the fourth major release of macOS, Apple&#x27;s desktop and server operating system. It followed Mac OS X Jaguar and preceded Mac OS X Tiger. It was released on October 24, 2003, with the retail price of US$129 for a single user and US$199 for a five user, family license.

The main features of Panther included a refined Aqua theme, Exposé, Fast user switching, and a new Finder. Panther also included Safari as its default browser, as a change from Internet Explorer in Jaguar.

==System requirements==
Panther&#x27;s system requirements are:
*PowerPC G3, G4, or G5 processor (at least 233 MHz)
*Built-in USB
*At least 128 MB of RAM (256 MB recommended, minimum of 96 MB supported unofficially)
*At least 1.5 GB of available hard disk space
*CD drive
*Internet access requires a compatible service provider; iDisk requires a .Mac account
Video conferencing requires:
*333 MHz or faster PowerPC G3, G4, or G5 processor
*Broadband internet access (100 kbit/s or faster)
*Compatible FireWire DV camera or web camera

Because a New World ROM was required for Mac OS X Panther, certain older computers (such as beige Power Mac G3s and &#x27;Wall Street&#x27; PowerBook G3s) were unable to run Panther by default. Third-party software (such as XPostFacto) can, however, override checks made during the install process; otherwise, installation or upgrades from Jaguar fails on these older machines.

Panther still fully supported the Classic environment for running older Mac OS 9 applications, but made Classic application windows double-buffered, interfering with some applications written to draw directly to screen.

==New and changed features==

===End-user features===
Apple advertised that Mac OS X Panther had over 150 new features, including:

*Finder: Updated with a brushed-metal interface, a new live search engine, customizable Sidebar, secure deletion, colored labels (resurrected from classic Mac OS) in the filesystem and Zip support built in. The Finder icon was also changed.
*Fast user switching: Allows a user to remain logged in while another user logs in, and quickly switch among several sessions.
*Exposé: Helps the user manage windows by showing them all as thumbnails.
*TextEdit: TextEdit now is also compatible with Microsoft Word (.doc) documents.
*Xcode developer tools: Faster compile times with gcc 3.3.
*Preview: Increased speed of PDF rendering.
*QuickTime: Now supports the Pixlet high-definition video codec.

===New applications in Panther===
*Font Book: A font manager which simplifies viewing character maps, and adding new fonts that can be used systemwide. The app also allows the user to organize fonts into collections.
*FileVault: On-the-fly encryption and decryption of a user&#x27;s home folder.
*iChat AV: The new version of iChat. Now with built-in audio- and video conferencing.
*X11: Compatibility for applications based on the X Window System, commonly used for UNIX applications, is available through an optional install, found in the install disk. Mac OS X Panther is the first macOS version to officially support X11. It utilizes Quartz to provide hardware accelerated graphics and is based on the XFree86 implementation of X Window System.
*Safari: A new web browser that was developed to replace Internet Explorer for Mac when the contract between Apple and Microsoft ended, although Internet Explorer for Mac was still available. Safari 1.0 was included in an update in Jaguar but was used as the default browser in Panther.

===Other===
*Microsoft Windows interoperability improvements, including out-of-the-box support for Active Directory and SecurID-based VPNs.
*Built-in fax support, with Address Book integration. Sending a fax can be done using the native Print dialog. To receive faxes, users must pre-configure in System Preferences on how the system should handle an incoming fax, with options including selecting a folder to save the incoming faxes, to automatically email to an address or to print via a selected printer, upon receiving of the fax.
*Secure Empty Trash, was a feature added in Mac OS X Panther to ensure files that are deleted cannot be recovered, through the use of data erasure techniques.

=== Additional ===
Panther was Apple&#x27;s earliest version of Mac OS X that supported WPA and WPA2 security for wireless networks (with the AirPort 4.2 software update).

<doc id="293359" wikidata="Q367653" url="?curid=293359" title="Gregory Hines">
<text>Gregory Oliver Hines (February 14, 1946 – August 9, 2003) was an American dancer, actor, choreographer, and singer. He is one of the most celebrated tap dancers of all time. As an actor, he is best known for &quot;Wolfen&quot; (1981), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;White Nights&quot; (1985), &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1986), &quot;The Gregory Hines Show&quot; (1997–1998), playing Ben on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (1999–2000), and for voicing Big Bill on the Nick Jr. animated children&#x27;s television program &quot;Little Bill&quot; (1999–2004).

Hines starred in more than 40 films and also appeared on Broadway. He received many accolades, including a Daytime Emmy Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Tony Award, as well as nominations for a Screen Actors Guild Award and four Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Hines was born in New York City, on February 14, 1946, to Alma Iola (Lawless) and Maurice Robert Hines, a dancer, musician, and actor, and grew up in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Harlem. He began tap dancing when he was two years old, and began dancing semi-professionally at age five. After that, he and his older brother Maurice performed together, studying with choreographer Henry LeTang.

Gregory and Maurice also studied with veteran tap dancers such as Howard Sims and The Nicholas Brothers when they performed at the same venues. The brothers were known as The Hines Kids, making nightclub appearances at venues in Miami, Florida, with Cab Calloway. They were later known as The Hines Brothers.

When their father joined the act as a drummer, their name changed again in 1963 to &quot;Hines, Hines, and Dad&quot;.

==Career==

===Tap dance===
Hines was an avid improviser of tap steps, tap sounds, and tap rhythms alike. His improvisation was like that of a drummer, doing a solo and coming up with rhythms. He also improvised the phrasing of a number of tap steps, mainly to fit the unfolding sound. A laid-back dancer, he usually wore loose-fitting pants and a tighter shirt.

Although he inherited the roots and tradition of the black rhythmic tap, he also promoted the new black rhythmic tap. &quot;He purposely obliterated the tempos,&quot; wrote tap historian Sally Sommer, &quot;throwing down a cascade of taps like pebbles tossed across the floor. In that moment, he aligned tap with the latest free form experiments in jazz and new music and postmodern dance.&quot;

Throughout his career, Hines wanted and continued to be an advocate for tap in America. He successfully petitioned the creation of National Tap Dance Day in May 1989, which is now celebrated in forty cities in the United States, as well as eight other nations. He was on the board of directors of Manhattan Tap, a member of the Jazz Tap Ensemble, and a member of the American Tap Dance Foundation, which was formerly called the American Tap Dance Orchestra.

In 1989, he created and hosted a PBS special called &quot;Gregory Hines&#x27; Tap Dance in America&quot;, which featured various tap dancers such as Savion Glover and Bunny Briggs.

In 1990, Hines visited his idol (and &quot;Tap&quot; co-star) Sammy Davis Jr., who was dying of throat cancer and was unable to speak. After Davis died, an emotional Hines spoke at Davis&#x27; funeral of how Davis made a gesture to him, &quot;as if passing a basketball ... and I caught it.&quot; Hines spoke of how honored he had been that Davis thought that he could carry on from where Davis left off.

Through his teaching, he influenced tap dancers such as Savion Glover, Dianne Walker, Ted Levy, and Jane Goldberg. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1988, Hines said that everything he did was influenced by his dancing: &quot;my singing, my acting, my lovemaking, my being a parent.&quot;

===Stage acting===
Hines made his Broadway debut with his brother in &quot;The Girl in Pink Tights&quot; in 1954. He earned Tony Award nominations for &quot;Eubie!&quot; (1979), &quot;Comin&#x27; Uptown&quot; (1980), and &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot; (1981), and won the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for &quot;Jelly&#x27;s Last Jam&quot; (1992) and the Theatre World Award for &quot;Eubie!&quot;.

===Music===
Hines performed as the lead singer and musician in a rock band called Severance based in Venice, Los Angeles in 1975 and 1976. Severance was one of the house bands at an original music club called Honky Hoagies Handy Hangout, otherwise known as the 4H Club. Severance released their self-titled debut album on Largo Records (a subsidiary of GNP Crescendo) in 1976.

In 1986, he sang a duet with Luther Vandross called &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Better Than Love&quot;, which reached the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. Encouraged by his first success on the chart, Hines subsequently released his self-titled debut album on Epic in 1988 with much support of Vandross. This album produced a Vandross-penned single &quot;That Girl Wants to Dance with Me&quot;, which peaked at #6 on the R&amp;B charts in June 1988.

===Film and television===
In 1981, Hines made his movie debut in Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, replacing Richard Pryor, who was originally cast in the role but sustained severe burns just days before he was due to begin shooting. Madeline Kahn, also starring in the film, suggested to director Mel Brooks that he look into Hines for the role after they learned of Pryor&#x27;s hospitalization. He also appeared in the horror film &quot;Wolfen&quot; later that year.

Hines&#x27; peak as an actor came in the mid-1980s. He had a large role in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), where he and his brother Maurice (in his sole film credit) played a 1930s tap-dancing duo reminiscent of the Nicholas Brothers. Hines co-starred with Mikhail Baryshnikov in the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;, and co-starred with Billy Crystal in the 1986 buddy cop film &quot;Running Scared&quot;. He starred in the 1989 film &quot;Tap&quot; opposite Sammy Davis Jr. (in Davis&#x27; last screen performance). He appeared alongside Whitney Houston and Loretta Devine in the highly successful 1995 film &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; and opposite Houston, Denzel Washington and Courtney B. Vance the following year in &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;. On television, he starred in his own sitcom in 1997, &quot;The Gregory Hines Show&quot;, which ran for one season on CBS, and had a recurring role of Ben Doucette on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

In an interview in 1987, Hines said that he often looked for roles written for white actors, &quot;preferring their greater scope and dynamics.&quot; Of his role in &quot;Running Scared&quot;, for example, he said that he enjoyed that his character had sex scenes, because &quot;usually, the black guy has no sexuality at all.&quot;

Hines starred in the 1998 film &quot;The Tic Code&quot;. He voiced Big Bill in the Nick Jr. Channel&#x27;s animated children series &quot;Little Bill&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2004. He won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for the role in 2003.

===Other===
Hines co-hosted the Tony Awards ceremony in 1995 and 2002.

==Personal life==
Hines&#x27; marriages to Patricia Panella and Pamela Koslow ended in divorce. He had a daughter, Daria, with Panella, and a son, Zachary, with Koslow. For the last three years of his life, he was engaged to bodybuilder Negrita Jayde, who was based in Toronto.

==Death==
Hines died of liver cancer on August 9, 2003, en route to a hospital from his home in Los Angeles. He was diagnosed with the disease a year earlier, but informed only his closest friends. At the time of his death, production of the television show &quot;Little Bill&quot; was ending. He was survived by his fiancée Jayde, children Daria and Zachary, ex-stepdaughter Jessica, and grandson Lucian.

His funeral was held at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. He was buried at St. Volodymyr Ukrainian Catholic Cemetery in Oakville, Ontario.

== Legacy ==
On January 28, 2019, the United States Postal Service honored Hines with a postage stamp as part of its Black Heritage Series. It was issued with a ceremony at the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts.

<doc id="293361" wikidata="Q6863201" url="?curid=293361" title="Minaret of Freedom Institute">
<text>The Minaret of Freedom Institute is an Islamic libertarian organization established in 1993 and based in Bethesda, Maryland. It is dedicated to educating both Muslims and non-Muslims. It was co-founded by Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, its president, and Shahid N. Shah, its treasurer. Its early board of advisers included former Richard Nixon advisor Robert D. Crane, a convert to Islam, and Charles Butterworth, a University of Maryland Islamic scholar. Its current board of directors and board of advisers include religious, academic and business leaders.

== Mission ==
Its Mission Statement aims for non-Muslims are:
* &quot;to counter distortions and misconceptions about Islamic beliefs and practice&quot;
* &quot;to demonstrate the Islamic origins of modern values like the rule of law and sciences like market economics
* &quot;to advance the status of Muslim peoples maligned by a hostile environment in the West and oppressed by repressive political regimes in the East&quot;

Its Mission Statement aims for Muslims (in concert with Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah obligations) are:
* &quot;to discover and publish the politico-economic policy implications of Islamic law (shari`ah) and their consequences on the economic well-being of the community&quot;
* &quot;to expose both American and Islamic-world Muslims to free market thought&quot;
* &quot;to educate Islamic religious and community leaders in economics and in the fact that liberty is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the achievement of a good society&quot;
* &quot;to promote the establishment of free trade and justice (an essential common interest of Islam and the West)&quot;

It implements these goals through independent scholarly research into policy issues of concern to Muslims; publication of scholarly and popular expositions of such research; translation of appropriate works on the free market into the languages of the Muslim world; and the operation of a scholars exchange program.

== Religious views ==

===Sharia law===
The Institute holds that adherence to Sharia law and even Islamist politics can be compatible with libertarian ideas. In a paper delivered at a 2005 Center for the Study of Islam and
Democracy conference Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad noted the similarities of American secularism and Islamic law, argued that the free exercise of religion is inherently part of Islamic law and outlined a vision of &quot;Islamic pluralism&quot; where the traditional dhimmi system of protection of non-Muslims must be explicitly protected constitutionally.

In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad commented on the Saudi Arabian Embassy&#x27;s Islamic Affairs Department distribution of &quot;The Noble Koran&quot; which included commentary that disparaged Jews and Christians. Ahmad told The Washington Post &quot;The outcry was so great...People were disgusted. And it wasn&#x27;t just liberals. I couldn&#x27;t find an American Muslim who had anything good to say about that edition. I would call it a Wahhabi Koran.&quot;

Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has been quoted as calling the September 11th attacks in the name of Islam as an offense against Islam. He has written that it is the moral duty of Muslims to identify the perpetrators and their supporters and “confront them with the fact that their actions have violated sharia’ah (sic) in a most egregious manner, to urge them to repent and to punish them if the families of the victims are unwilling to be merciful and accept compensation.”

===Loan interest===
The institute deviates from orthodox Islamic thinking in its belief that the Qur&#x27;anic prohibition of riba (usury) does not prohibit all lending at interest, only that which is excessively high.
 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has stated that the Islamic world pioneered the scientific method, but may have been unable to progress to an Industrial Revolution because the prohibition of interest prevented would-be inventors from obtaining the necessary financing to develop their inventions.

===Circumcision===
With regards to female circumcision, Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad writes that clitoridectomy and infibulation should be viewed as practices prohibited by Islam because they jeopardize the girl&#x27;s future ability to enjoy sexual relations with her husband, and hence should be considered disliked. He dismisses hygienic or religious justifications for &quot;this painful and potentially harmful practice.&quot; Ahmad supports male circumcision, writing that although it is not prescribed in the Qur&#x27;an &quot;male circumcision is clearly a Muslim tradition.&quot;

==Political views==

===Civil liberties===
In 1999 the Institute sponsored a panel on “Secular Threats to Freedom of Expression,” which was labeled “secular fundamentalism,&quot; and identified as being as great a threat to liberty as religious fundamentalism. Two speakers shared their personal stories, Merve Kavakçı, an elected Turkish parliamentarian removed from office because she insisted on wearing the hijab (Islamic headcovering) and Sami Al-Arian, a tenured University of South Florida professor who at the time was threatened with dismissal because a former leader of his dialogue group of Muslim and non-Muslim intellectuals later was identified as the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al-Arian described how the 1996 immigration legislation had led to 29 individuals being held in prison for years under “secret evidence” provisions, noting that 28 were Muslims.

After the September 11th attacks Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad spoke out about suspicion of and accusations against Muslims that worried many American Muslims, making them more cautious. After the U.S. government closed down the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development charity and convicted its leaders of financing terrorism, Ahmad stated that the convictions shocked Muslims, confused donors and “seems to give a green light for further intimidation of Muslim charities.”

In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad and Minaret Vice President Aly R. Abuzaakouk signed a letter in “defense of free speech” condemning “any intimidation or threats of violence directed against any individual or group exercising the rights of freedom of religion and speech; even when that speech may be perceived as hurtful or reprehensible.” They expressed concern about threats “made against individual writers, cartoonists, and others by a minority of Muslims” and called on all Muslims to “refrain from violence.”

===Sami Al-Arian===

The Minaret of Freedom has supported Sami Al-Arian
who was indicted in 2003 for alleged terrorist ties to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, acquitted of most charges by a jury that deadlocked on other charges. After spending more time in jail, in 2006 Al-Arian plead guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 57 months in prison and deportation upon release.

In 2006 an Alexandria, Virginia grand jury subpoena was issued to the Minaret of Freedom Institute seeking notes about the symposium on “The United States and Iran: It’s Time to Talk” that he moderated in 1999. Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told the New York Sun that he believed the agents sought information because Sami Al-Arian had attended the event. He noted that the same prosecutor seeking Al-Arian’s grand jury testimony at the time had signed the subpoena. Ahmad never was required to testify to the grand jury.

===Anti-imperialism===
Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told &quot;Reason&quot; magazine that Western liberals had abandoned their anti-imperialist views, including by invading Iraq, and thus had alienated Islamists from pro-liberty viewpoints. He stated Western government financial support for various factions in Muslim and Arab countries tends to prop up the most oppressive elements.

===Opposition to Zionism===
The Institute defines the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in terms of Israel&#x27;s violations of individual property rights, starting with the fact that Jews owned only 7 percent of the land in Palestine in 1948 but have gained control of most of it as of today. Ahmad states that &quot;Israelis employ a series of strategies to keep pressure on the indigenous people to leave.&quot;

In his address to the First Conference on Jerusalem in Beirut, Lebanon in 2001 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad expressed his desire for the &quot;liberation of Jerusalem.&quot; He stated that American’s support for Zionism was due to their hearing “only what the Zionist-controlled media and politicians have let them know” and the failure of Palestinians to be &quot;frank and direct with the people of America and the world, preferring to work with corrupt governments in the Muslim world or with power-hungry revolutionary movements.&quot; He stated the American people were unaware of &quot;Zionism’s history, its racist foundation, its colonialist nature, and the systematic brutality of its daily dealings with the indigenous people of Palestine.” In 2003 Ahmad told Reason magazine that the Zionist movement had socialist and fascist wings, neither supportive of classical liberalism and that Israel today is “characterized mostly as a socialist, militarist and racist entity,” which he held are incompatible with “libertarian ideals.”

<text>RSA SecurID, formerly referred to as SecurID, is a mechanism developed by RSA for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource.

== Description ==


The RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a &quot;token&quot;—either hardware (e.g. a key fob) or software (a soft token)—which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card&#x27;s factory-encoded almost random key (known as the &quot;seed&quot;). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server) as the tokens are purchased. On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.

The token hardware is designed to be tamper-resistant to deter reverse engineering. When software implementations of the same algorithm (&quot;software tokens&quot;) appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server. Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library. In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate one-time passwords. Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a smart card-like device for securely storing certificates.

A user authenticating to a network resource—say, a dial-in server or a firewall—needs to enter both a personal identification number and the number being displayed &quot;at that moment&quot; on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.

On older versions of SecurID, a &quot;duress PIN&quot; may be used—an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The &quot;duress PIN&quot; feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.

While the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server&#x27;s clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored &quot;drift&quot; value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.

RSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called &quot;Ubiquitous Authentication&quot;, partnering with device manufacturers such as IronKey, SanDisk, Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Redcannon, Broadcom, and BlackBerry to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.

== Theoretical vulnerabilities ==

Token codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code). This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.

The simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional electronic leash or body sensor and alarm.

While RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password replay attacks, they are not designed to offer protection against man in the middle type attacks when used alone. If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent man in the browser (MitB) based attacks.

SecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard. If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker&#x27;s authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL.

Although soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the tamper-resistant property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations, which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.

Hard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via social engineering) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the user&#x27;s UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the user&#x27;s UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.

Batteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.

== Reception and competing products ==
As of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard. A study on OTP published by Gartner in 2010 mentions OATH and SecurID as the only competitors.

Other network authentication systems, such as OPIE and S/Key (sometimes more generally known as OTP, as S/Key is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bellcore) attempt to provide the &quot;something you have&quot; level of authentication without requiring a hardware token.

== March 2011 system compromise ==
On 17 March 2011, RSA announced that they had been victims of &quot;an extremely sophisticated cyber attack&quot;. Concerns were raised specifically in reference to the SecurID system, saying that &quot;this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation&quot;. However, their formal Form 8-K submission indicated that they did not believe the breach would have a &quot;material impact on its financial results&quot;. The breach cost EMC, the parent company of RSA, $66.3 million, which was taken as a charge against second quarter earnings. It covered costs to investigate the attack, harden its IT systems and monitor transactions of corporate customers, according to EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Goulden, in a conference call with analysts.

The breach into RSA&#x27;s network was carried out by hackers who sent phishing emails to two targeted, small groups of employees of RSA. Attached to the email was a Microsoft Excel file containing malware. When an RSA employee opened the Excel file, the malware exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The exploit allowed the hackers to use the Poison Ivy RAT to gain control of machines and access servers in RSA&#x27;s network.

There are some hints that the breach involved the theft of RSA&#x27;s database mapping token serial numbers to the secret token &quot;seeds&quot; that were injected to make each one unique. Reports of RSA executives telling customers to &quot;ensure that they protect the serial numbers on their tokens&quot; lend credibility to this hypothesis.

Barring a fatal weakness in the cryptographic implementation of the token code generation algorithm (which is unlikely, since it involves the simple and direct application of the extensively scrutinized AES-128 block cipher), the only circumstance under which an attacker could mount a successful attack without physical possession of the token is if the token seed records themselves had been leaked. RSA stated it did not release details about the extent of the attack so as to not give potential attackers information they could use in figuring out how to attack the system.

On 6 June 2011, RSA offered token replacements or free security monitoring services to any of its more than 30,000 SecurID customers, following an attempted cyber breach on defense customer Lockheed Martin that appeared to be related to the SecurID information stolen from RSA. In spite of the resulting attack on one of its defense customers, company chairman Art Coviello said that &quot;We believe and still believe that the customers are protected&quot;.

=== Resulting attacks ===
In April 2011, unconfirmed rumors cited L-3 Communications as having been attacked as a result of the RSA compromise.

In May 2011, this information was used to attack Lockheed Martin systems. However Lockheed Martin claims that due to &quot;aggressive actions&quot; by the company&#x27;s information security team, &quot;No customer, program or employee personal data&quot; was compromised by this &quot;significant and tenacious attack&quot;. The Department of Homeland Security and the US Defense Department offered help to determine the scope of the attack.

<text>The kacapi is a traditional zither of Sundanese people in Indonesia. This musical instrument is similar to Chinese , Japanese &quot;koto&quot;, the Mongolian , the Korean , the Vietnamese and the Kazakh jetigen. The kacapi played as the main accompanying instrument in the Tembang Sunda or Mamaos Cianjuran, kacapi suling (tembang Sunda without vocal accompaniment) genre (called &quot;kecapi seruling&quot; in Indonesian), pantun stories recitation or an additional instrument in Gamelan Degung performance.

The word &quot;kacapi&quot; in Sundanese also refers to santol tree, from which initially the wood is believed to be used for building the zither instrument.

==Form==

According to its form or physical appearance, there are two kinds of kacapis:
#Kacapi Parahu (=Boat Kacapi) or Kacapi Gelung; and
#Kacapi Siter

The Kacapi Parahu is a resonance box with an uncovered underside to allow the sound out. The sides of this kind of kacapi are tapered inward from top to bottom, which gives the instrument a boat-like shape. In ancient times, it was made directly from solid wood by perforating it.

The Kacapi siter is a plan-parallel resonance box. Similar to the kacapi parahu, its hole is located at the bottom. The upper and bottom sides of it form a trapezoid shape.

For both kinds of kacapi, each string is affixed to a small screw or peg on the top right-hand side of the box. They can be tuned in different systems: pelog, sorog/madenda, or slendro. Kacapi siter often tuned in Western diatonic scale for some purposes, such as contemporary music.

Nowadays, the resonance box of kacapi is made by gluing six wood-plates side by side.

The kacapi is traditionally played by sitting cross-legged on the floor. Thus, the strings are about 25 cm above the floor. Nowadays the kacapi is sometimes placed on a wooden frame, so that the player can sit on a chair. If the kacapi indung is played while sitting on the floor, usually a pillow or some other small object is placed under its left-hand side, as seen from the player, so that the sound can freely escape through the resonance hole in the bottom of the soundbox. Some kecapi are fitted with small feet, so that it is not necessary to lift them in this way.

==Functions==

According to its functions in a musical accompaniment, the kacapi is played as:
#Kacapi Indung (=mother kacapi) or ; and
#Kacapi Anak (=child kacapi) or Kacapi Rincik

The Kacapi indung leads the accompaniment by providing intros, bridges, and interludes, as well as determining the tempo. For this purpose, a large kacapi with 18 or 20 strings is used. 
The Kacapi rincik enriches the accompaniment by filling in inter-note spaces with higher frequencies, especially in fixed metered songs as in the kacapi suling or Sekar Panambih. For this purpose, a smaller kacapi with ~15 strings is used.
==Tuning and notation==
Kacapi uses various scales, such as Saléndro, Degung, Madenda, and its derived transpositions. Wisaya nad Mandalungan are playable if the suling has additional holes. See the following table.
The note range, from the lowest to the highest frequency in Degung scale is:

The kacapi is tuned to match the 60 cm length suling tones. With this length, an approximation for the tuning compared to western scale is: 
The following picture applies the above-mentioned tuning and notation.
==Physical dimensions==
==Recitation of pantun stories==
It is not certain how long the kacapi has been used to accompany the recitation of pantun stories. In the Sundanese dictionary published by the Lembaga Basa &amp; Sastra Sunda (1976) the primary meaning of the word pantun is given as kacapi. This may be an indication that the relation between the kacapi and the recitation of pantun stories is an old one. Eringa (1949:3) points to the proverb &quot;&quot;kawas pantun teu jeung kacap&quot;i&quot;, &#x27;like a pantun (traditional sung story telling) without a kacapi&#x27;, used of someone who likes to give other people advice but who does not himself practise what he preaches. This proverb, according to Eringa, indicates that the kacapi is the Standard instrument for accompanying a pantun recitation. The Baduy Sundanese of Banten Province still make exclusive use of the kacapi to accompany their pantun stories.

<doc id="293369" wikidata="Q1154798" url="?curid=293369" title="Stock split">
<text>A stock split or stock divide increases the number of shares in a company. For example, after a 2-for-1 split, each investor will own double the number of shares, and each share will be worth half as much. 
A stock split causes a decrease of market price of individual shares, but does not change the total market capitalization of the company: stock dilution does not occur.

A company may split its stock when the market price per share is so high that it becomes unwieldy when traded. One of the reasons is that a very high share price may deter small investors from buying the shares. Stock splits are usually initiated after a large run up in share price.

==Effects==
The main effect of stock splits is an increase in the liquidity of a stock: there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $10 than 1 share at $100. 
Some companies avoid a stock split to obtain the opposite strategy: by refusing to split the stock and keeping the price high, they reduce trading volume. Berkshire Hathaway is a notable example of this. As of 2023, the company has never split its stock and trades at over US$500,000.

One possible explanation for increased trading volume is confusion. If some investors are unable to recognize that a split stock should trade at a lower price than before the split, the result can be a temporary increase in demand and the share price. Others contend that the management of a company, by initiating a stock split, is implicitly signaling its confidence in the future prospects of the company.

In a market where there is a high minimum number of shares, or a penalty for trading in so-called odd lots (a non multiple of some arbitrary number of shares), a reduced share price may attract more attention from small investors. Small investors such as these, however, will have negligible impact on the overall price.

==Split ratios==
Ratios of &quot;2-for-1&quot;, &quot;3-for-1&quot;, and &quot;3-for-2&quot; splits are the most common, but any ratio is possible. Splits of 4-for-3, 5-for-2, and 5-for-4 are used, though less frequently. Investors will sometimes receive cash payments in lieu of fractional shares.

In the above examples ‘y-for-x’ Shows the number of shares before (x) and after (y). Other common reporting nomenclatures are ‘x-y’ and ‘stock dividend’ of [=]y-x. In the above ‘3-for-1’ example (or 1-3 and 2 share stock dividend) would mean a stockholder holding 100 shares (on record date) will receive 200 new shares after the split for those 100 shares.

==Example==
A company which has 100 issued shares priced at $50 per share, has a market capitalization of $5000 = 100 × $50. If the company splits its stock 2-for-1, there are now 200 shares of stock and each shareholder holds twice as many shares. The price of each share is adjusted to $25 = $5000 / 200. The market capitalization is 200 × $25 = $5000, the same as before the split.

==Currency==
The analog in currency would be redenomination. This would be where a currency increases in value so that people have to use small fractions. Then a new unit (such as dollar) can be introduced, such that an old unit is equal to 10 (or some number) new units.

An example is with the Australian currency. In 1966 the Australian pound was split into two Australian dollars.

==Effect on historical charts==
When a stock splits, many charts show it similarly to a dividend payout and therefore do not show a dramatic dip in price. Taking the same example as above, a company with 100 shares of stock priced at $50 per share. The company splits its stock 2-for-1. There are now 200 shares of stock and each shareholder holds twice as many shares.

The price of each share is adjusted to $25. As a result, when looking at a historical chart, one might expect to see the stock dropping from $50 to $25. To avoid these discontinuities, many charts use what is known as an adjusted share price; that is, they divide all closing prices before the split by the split ratio. Thus, when looking at the charts it will seem as if the price was always $25. Both the Yahoo! historical price charts and the Google historical price charts show the adjusted close prices.

<doc id="293371" wikidata="Q435300" url="?curid=293371" title="Franciscus Patricius">
<text>Franciscus Patricius (Croatian: &quot;Franjo Petriš&quot; or &quot;Frane Petrić&quot;, Italian: &quot;Francesco Patrizi&quot;; 25 April 1529 – 6 February 1597) was a philosopher and scientist from the Republic of Venice, originating from Cres. He was known as a defender of Platonism and an opponent of Aristotelianism.

His national origin differs in sources, and he is described both as Croatian and as Italian. In Croatia he is mostly referred to as Franjo Petriš or Frane Petrić (sometimes &quot;Petris&quot;, &quot;Petrišević&quot; and &quot;Petričević&quot;). His family name in Cres was known as Petris.

Patricius initially dedicated his studies to Aristotelian Philosophy at the University of Padua, but turned to Platonism while still a student. He became a sharp, high-profile opponent of Aristotelianism, with whom he grappled extensively in extensive writings. After many years of unsuccessful efforts to secure material livelihood, he finally received an invitation in 1577 to the Ducal Court of House of Este in the Duchy of Ferrara. At the University of Ferrara, a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up especially for him. In the years that followed, he gained a reputation as a professor, but was also involved in scientific and literary controversy; he tended to polemic and was in turn violently attacked by opponents. In 1592 he accepted an invitation to Rome, where thanks to papal favor a new chair was created for him. The last years of his life, were embroiled in a serious conflict with the Roman Inquisition, which banned his main work, the &quot;Nova de universis philosophia&quot;.

As one of the last Renaissance humanists, Patricius was characterized by extensive education, varied scientific activity, a strong will to innovate and exceptional literary fertility. He critically examined established, universally recognized teachings and suggested alternatives. In particular, he wanted to replace the prevailing Aristotelian natural philosophy with his own model. He opposed the traditional view of the meaning of historical studies, which was usually restricted to moral instruction, with his concept of a broad, neutral, scientific historical research. In Poetry he emphasized the importance of Inspiration and fought against conventional rules, which he considered to be arbitrary, unrealistic restrictions on creative freedom.

In the Early Modern Period, Patricius&#x27;s strongly controversial philosophy of nature found considerable echo despite the church&#x27;s condemnation, but remained an outsider position. Modern research recognizes his contributions to the constitution of modern concept of space and to historical theory.

== Origin and name ==
Francesco Patricius came from the town Cres on the homonymous island in front of Istria (Italian &quot; Cherso &quot;). At that time the island belonged to Republic of Venice. Francesco was an illegitimate son of the priest Stefano di Niccolò di Antonio Patricius (Stjepan Nikola Antun Petriš or Petrić), who belonged to the lower nobility. His mother was Maria Radocca (also &quot;Borofcich&quot;), a local woman who later married another man, and possibly &quot;shared the bed with two priests of the same [Patrizi] family.&quot; In older literature, Francesco&#x27;s father was mistakenly identified with the judge of the same name, Stefano di Niccolò di Matteo Patricius, and his mother Maria was identified with Maria Lupetino, the judge&#x27;s alleged wife. Also incorrect is the claim related to the erroneous genealogy of a relationship of the philosopher with the famous theologian Matthias Flacius.

According to Francesco, his family was originally based in Bosnia and, according to their coat of arms, was of royal descent. As a result of the Turkish conquest of her homeland, she emigrated, and so an ancestor named Stefanello came to Cres. This happened, if the communication is correct, in the second half of the 15th century. In his book, &quot;Paralleli militari&quot;, he said he descended from the Patrizi family from Siena.

Following a humanistic custom, the philosopher Latinized his name and called himself &quot; Patricius &quot; or &quot; Patritius &quot;. Since he lived in Italy and published his works there, the name form &quot; Francesco Patricius &quot; has established itself internationally, but in Croatia variants of the Croatian form are preferred. The addition &quot;da Cherso&quot; (from Cres) serves to distinguish it from the Siena humanist Francesco Patricius (Franciscus Patricius Senensis), who lived in the 15th century.

== Life ==
=== Youth and Education ===
Francesco Patricius was born on 25 April 1529 in Cres. He initially spent his childhood in his hometown. His uncle Giovanni Giorgio Patricius (Ivan Juraj Petriš), who commanded a Venetian warship, took the only nine-year-old boy on a war campaign against the Turks in February 1538. So it turned out that Francesco participated in the Battle of Preveza, in which the Christian fleet was struck. He almost fell into Turkish captivity. He spent several years at sea. In September 1543 he went to Venice to acquire a professional qualification. Initially he went to a commercial school according to Giovanni Giorgio&#x27;s will, but his inclination was for humanism. Since his father showed understanding for this, the youngster received Latin lessons. Later the father sent him to study at Ingolstadt, where the seat of the Bavarian University was. There he acquired knowledge of Greek. In 1546, however, he had to leave Bavaria because of the turmoil of the Schmalkaldic War.

In May 1547 Patricius went to Padua, whose university was one of the most respected universities in Europe. Initially, at the request of his practical-thinking father Stefano, he studied medicine with Giambattista Montano, Bassiano Lando and Alberto Gabriele, but only very reluctantly. When Stefano died in 1551, he was able to drop out of medical training. He sold the medical books. He continued to be interested in humanistic education. During his studies, he attended philosophical lectures by professors Bernardino Tomitano, Marcantonio de &#x27;Passeri (Marcantonio Genova), Lazzaro Buonamici and Francesco Robortello. Among his friends and fellow students was Niccolò Sfondrati, who later became pope as Gregory XIV. Philosophy classes were a disappointment for Patricius, because Padua was a stronghold of Aristotelian, whose representatives continued the tradition of medieval Scholastic. This was a direction that Patricius firmly rejected and fought violently later. Under the influence of a Franciscan scholar, he turned to Platonism. The Franciscan recommended the Neoplatonic teaching of the humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499). The reading of Ficino&#x27;s writings, especially his major philosophical-theological work, the &quot; Theologia Platonica&quot;, was pioneering for Patricius. He later expressed his distance to Padua&#x27;s scholastic-Aristotelian teaching practice by writing in an autobiographical letter in 1587 as self-taught represented. In his student days he already wrote and published philosophical and philological writings; he had a collection of his youth works printed in Venice in 1553.

=== First attempts to secure livelihood (1554–1560) ===
In 1554, Patricius had to return to Cres because of a lengthy dispute over the inheritance of his uncle Giovanni Giorgio. The spell at Cress, which was characterized by illness, isolation and the family conflict. At that time he apparently belonged to the spiritual class - at least until 1560. He tried unsuccessfully to secure his livelihood in the long term To get home to an ecclesiastical. After this failure, he went to Rome in 1556, but his efforts for a benefice also failed there. Then he moved to Venice. The young scholar unsuccessfully sought employment at the glamorous courtyard of the house Este in Ferrara. After all, he gained a foothold in the Venetian humanist circles: he joined the Accademia della Fama, a scholarly community in which he found like-minded people.

=== Activities in Cyprus (1560-1568) ===
In 1560, Patricius entered the service of the Venetian patrician Giorgio Contarini. While initially tutoring his employer in Aristotelian ethics. Patricius soon won Contarini&#x27;s trust and was given an important assignment: he was sent to Cyprus to inspect and then report on the family property, which was administered by a brother of Contarini. When he described the situation on his return in the summer of 1562, Contarini sent him again to Cyprus and gave him authorization to carry out measures for improvement. As the new administrator, Patricius ensured by Melioration a significant increase in the value of the land, which could now be used for growing cotton. However, the measures required were costly and poor harvests also reduced income, so that the client could not be satisfied. Contarini&#x27;s Cypriot relatives, who Patricius discredited with his report, took this opportunity to take revenge and to blame the administrator on the head of the family. When Patricius&#x27;s justification was not accepted, he asked to be released in 1567.

Patricius initially stayed in Cyprus. He now entered the service of the Catholic Archbishop of Nicosia, the Venetian Filippo Mocenigo, who entrusted him with the administration of the villages belonging to the Archdiocese. But in 1568, with the island under Turkish threat, he left the island with the archbishop and went to Venice. In retrospect, he saw the years in Cyprus as lost time. After all, he used the stay in the Greek-speaking world for an important humanistic concern: he searched for Greek manuscripts with considerable success, which he then bought or had written down, or perhaps even copied himself.

=== Varying endeavors for a material livelihood (1568–1577) ===
Upon his return, Patricius returned to science. He now went to Padua again, where he apparently no longer worked at the university but only gave private lessons. Among his disciples was Zaccaria Mocenigo, a nephew of the archbishop. It was very important to him to exchange ideas with the well-known philosopher Bernardino Telesio, with whom he later remained in correspondence.

During this time, Patricius&#x27;s relationship with the archbishop deteriorated. He made contact with Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y de la Cerda, the viceroy of Catalonia, who was an enthusiastic book collector. The beginning of this connection was promising: the viceroy invited him to Barcelona and offered him the prospect of employment as a court philosopher with an annual salary of five hundred ducat. As a result, Patricius made his first trip to Spain. In Barcelona, however, he was very disappointed because the financial promise was not kept. For these circumstances, the philosopher was forced to return in 1569.
One of the benefits of the trip, however, was the prospect of making a living in the long-distance book trade. The export of books from Italy to Barcelona seemed lucrative; Patricius had been able to reach an agreement with business partners there before he left. Shipping started and actually proved worthwhile at first, but the company eventually failed because of the philosopher&#x27;s inexperience and lack of business talent. A serious blow hit Patricius in 1570 when the Turks in Cyprus captured a shipment of goods belonging to him and intended for export to Venice, for which he had spent 3,500 ducats. As a result, he got into such trouble that he turned to his former employer, Contarini, who he still owed him 200 ducats. When the latter refused to pay, a lengthy process appeared which Patricius apparently lost.

In order to restructure his financial situation, Patricius turned to book production. In August 1571 he entered into a contract with the heir to the manuscript of a script by the late scholar Girolamo Ruscelli about Emblems, &quot; Le imprese illustri &quot;. He took over the editing, and the work was published the following year by a Venetian printer. However, Patricius was unable to meet his contractual obligations due to his precarious financial situation. This resulted in a conflict, which was difficult to resolve. After this unpleasant experience, Patricius founded his own publishing house, &quot; all&#x27;Elefanta &quot;. There he published three books in 1573, but then the publisher went in. The philosopher then went on a new trip to Spain in 1574 to sue his former business partners and sell Greek manuscripts. In February 1575 he was received by Antonio Gracián, the secretary king Philip II, Who gave him for the royal library in the El Escorial 75 Codices. From a humanistic point of view, however, this commercial success was questionable, because the Escorial was considered a &quot;book grave&quot; by the scholars. When the legal proceedings for the failed book trade dragged on without any foreseeable result, Patricius returned home after thirteen months.

Upon his return, Patricius settled in Modena in 1577, where he entered the service of the respected musician and poet Tarquinia Molza, to whom he gave Greek lessons.

=== Professorship in Ferrara (1578-1592) ===

In Modena, Patricius received the invitation to the ducal court of Ferrara that had been sought two decades ago. At the turn of the year 1577/1578 he arrived in Ferrara. He was warmly received by the Duke, Alfonso II, D&#x27;Este, an important cultural patron. His advocate there was the Ducal Council - from 1579 secretary - Antonio Montecatini, who valued him very much, although he was a representative of the Aristotelianism that Patricius had fought against from a Platonic perspective. At Montecatini&#x27;s suggestion, a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up for Patricius at the University of Ferrara. The starting salary of 390 lire was later increased to 500. The time of material worries was over.

With the move to Ferrara, the new professor began an enjoyable and profitable phase of life. He was highly regarded both at the glamorous court of Alfonso and in the academic environment. He was friends with the Duke. Patricius also had a good personal relationship with the famous poet Torquato Tasso, who lived in Ferrara, even though he had a controversy with him in a controversial event. In the fourteen years of his work in Ferrara, he published numerous writings.

However, Patricius&#x27;s dedicated opinions on philosophical and literary issues also caused controversy and led to disputes. Because of Aristotle&#x27;s criticism, a written polemic with the Aristotelian Teodoro Angelucci eased. In the literary field, Patricius was involved in a dispute over the criteria of poetic quality, in which Camillo Pellegrino and Torquato Tasso took the opposite view.

=== Professorship in Rome, conflict with censorship and death (1592–1597) ===

Patricius&#x27;s academic career finally peaked thanks to the benevolence of Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini, who invited him to Rome in October 1591. In January 1592 Aldobrandini was elected Pope and took the name Clement VIII. He gave an enthusiastic welcome to the scholar who arrived in Rome on 18 April 1592. At the Sapienza University of Rome a chair for Platonic philosophy was created for Patricius. The professor had his residence in the house of Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini, who was a nephew of the Pope and a well-known patron and was raised to Cardinal in 1593. On 15 May, he gave his inaugural lecture on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaios&quot; &quot;to a large audience. The allowance granted to him - 500 ducats basic salary, with allowances a good 840 ducats&quot; - was the highest on the Sapienza. It was a sign of the special papal favor that the Platonist received. Among his listeners and interlocutors was Torquato Tasso, now living in Rome, who did not regret the conflict in Ferrara.

Despite his excellent relationship with the Pope, Patricius soon became a target of church censorship. The occasion was his major philosophical work &quot; Nova de universis philosophia&quot;, which he published in Ferrara in 1591. There the censor Pedro Juan Saragoza discovered a number of statements which he considered heretical or at least suspicious and which he denounced in an expert report. Among other things, he declared the statement that the earth was rotating to be erroneous because this was incompatible with the Scriptures. According to the consensus of the theologians, it can be gathered from the Bible that the fixed star sky revolves around the immovable earth.

In October 1592 the index congregation, the authority responsible for the Index of Forbidden Books. In November 1592, she summoned the author of the suspect document and allowed him to read Saragoza&#x27;s report, which was unusual for the accused at the time. Patricius responded to the censor&#x27;s attack with a letter of defense, the &quot; Apologia ad censuram&quot;, in which he basically declared his submission, but defended his position aggressively and assumed Saragoza incompetence. He found no understanding. He later tried unsuccessfully to satisfy the panel with written explanations of his teaching and concessions. Even after the Congregation decided in December 1592 to list the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia &quot; in the new version of the index, the author continued his rescue efforts, while the publication of the new index of 1593 was delayed. The main disadvantage was that the censor responsible last, the Jesuit Francisco de Toledo, was a well-known representative of the patriotic scholastic Aristotelianism. In July 1594 the congregation banned the distribution and reading of the work and ordered the destruction of all traceable copies. Scripture was listed in the updated edition of the index, which appeared in 1596, and in subsequent editions. However, the author was expressly encouraged to submit an amended version for approval. The aged and conflict-ridden philosopher tackled the revision, but was unable to finish it because he died on 7 February 1597 with a fever. He was buried in the Roman church Sant&#x27;Onofrio al Gianicolo next to Torquato Tasso.

== Works ==
Most of Patricius&#x27;s writings are in Italian, the rest in Latin. The Latin part of the oeuvre primarily includes two monumental works: the &quot; Discussiones peripateticae&quot;, an extensive pamphlet against Aristotelianism, and the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia&quot;, the unfinished overall presentation of his teaching.

The struggle against Aristotelianism was a central concern of Patricius, which is evident everywhere in his texts. He wanted not only to refute individual teachings of the ancient thinker, but to bring the entire system to collapse. For this purpose, he wrote a polemical script which he called &quot; Discussiones peripateticae &quot; &quot; (Peripatetic Examinations)&quot;, referring to the Peripatos, Aristotle&#x27;s School of Philosophy. The first impulse came from a request from his student Zaccaria Mocenigo, who asked him to write a story about Aristotle. Patricius fulfilled this request with the original version of the &quot; Discussiones&quot;, a critical examination of the life and works of the Greek philosopher, which he published in Venice in 1571. Later, after a long interruption, he took up the systematic analysis of Aristotelianism again and expanded his original text to a comprehensive criticism of the peripatetic interpretation of the world. In this expansion of the project, the &quot; Discussiones &quot; printed in 1571 were the first volume to be incorporated into a four-volume work, which Patricius had printed in folio in Basel in Pietro Perna in 1581. In doing so, he submitted a polemical script, which was also designed as a manual for Aristotelianism.

The first volume consists of thirteen books. The first book offers a detailed biography of Aristotle, the second a list of works. The following seven books contain philological studies. It is about clarifying the questions as to which of the traditionally attributed writings to Aristotle actually come from him, which work titles are authentic and how the writings are to be arranged systematically. Patricius defines a number of stylistic, substantive and historical criteria for the distinction between genuine and fake writings. Particular attention is paid to the fragments from lost works by the Greek thinker, which are preserved in later ancient literature. They are compiled in large numbers. The tenth book deals with the history of reception. The last three books are devoted to the various methods that can be used for interpreting teaching and for Aristotelian philosophizing.

In the second volume, Patricius compares peripatetic philosophy with older teachings, especially Platonism. His intention is to discredit Aristotle as plagiarism or and compiler. However, he expresses himself cautiously, because this volume is dedicated to his friend and colleague Antonio Montecatino, the holder of the chair for Aristotelian philosophy in Ferrara. A contrast to this is the open, violent polemic in the last two volumes, in which the author gives up his reluctance. The third volume presents the peripatetic teachings as incompatible with those of the pre-Socratics and Plato. Patricius discusses the disagreements between the authorities on the basis of a plethora of contradicting statements, always declaring Aristotle&#x27;s view to be wrong . From his point of view, Aristotelianism is a decline in intellectual history, a falsification and destruction of the knowledge of earlier thinkers. The fourth book serves to prove errors in Aristotelian natural philosophy.

When dealing with peripatetic thinking, Patricius attaches great importance to taking Aristotle&#x27;s doctrine directly from his own words and not - as has been customary since the Middle Ages - to be influenced by the interpretations of the numerous commentators. In addition, he demands that Aristotle&#x27;s view not be backed up by a single statement, as was previously the case, but rather that all relevant statements by the philosopher be used. In the &quot; Discussiones peripateticae &quot; Patricius does not consistently go from a Platonic alternative system to Aristotelianism but also takes advantage of arguments based on nonplatonic, rather nominalistic and empirical ideas. He sees a fateful development in philosophy: the first pupils of Aristotle still thought independently and also contradicted their teacher; later, however, Alexander of Aphrodisias surrendered unconditionally to the school founder and, thus, renounced free thinking. The first medieval Arabic-language interpreters, Avicenna, Avempace and Alfarabi, were still relatively unbiased, but then Averroes had the absolute authority of Aristotle proclaimed and thus pointed the way to sterile, scholastic Aristotelism.

==== Controversy with Teodoro Angelucci ====
The devastating verdict on Aristotelian philosophy in the &quot; Discussiones peripateticae &quot; led to controversy with the Aristotelian Teodoro Angelucci. The latter responded to the &quot; Discussiones &quot; with a counter-writing in which he sharply criticized Patricius&#x27;s statements on metaphysics and natural science. The attacked man replied to this with the &quot; Apologia contra calumnias Theodori Angelutii &quot; &quot; (Defense against Teodoro Angelucci&#x27;s defamation)&quot;, which he had printed in 1584. The following year, Angelucci continued the argument with another combat script, the &quot; Exercitationes &quot; &quot; (Exercises) &quot;.

=== Metaphysics, natural philosophy, mathematics and number symbolism ===
==== Preparatory work on the system of the &quot;new philosophy&quot; ====

In the 1580s, Patricius worked on preparatory work for an overall presentation of his philosophical system, which he conceived as an alternative to Aristotelianism. First, he provided relevant material. He translated the commentary of the pseudo - John Philoponus on the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; of Aristotle as well as the &quot;Elementatio physica&quot; and the &quot;Elementatio theologica&quot; of the late antique Neoplatonist Proclus (412–485) into Latin. Both translations were printed in 1583. Then Patricius worked out his theory of space. In the Treatise &quot; Della nuova geometria&quot;, which he dedicated to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, he laid a new foundation for the geometry that he preferred Euclidean definitions. In 1587 a Latin representation of his understanding of space appeared as the first part of a &quot; Philosophia de rerum natura &quot; &quot; (Philosophy on the nature of things) &quot;. This publication consists of the two books &quot; De spacio physico &quot; &quot; (About the physical space) &quot; and &quot; De spacio mathematico &quot; &quot; (About the mathematical space) &quot;. There he presented his alternative to Aristotelian cosmology and physics.

Patricius&#x27;s work &quot; Zoroaster et eius CCCXX oracula Chaldaica &quot; &quot; (Zarathustra and its 320 Chaldean oracles)&quot;, the first independent modern collection of fragments of the Chaldean Oracles, was also created as part of this preliminary work. He believed that it was authentic teachings Zarathustras and the oracles were the oldest evidence of the history of philosophical thought. It was therefore important to him to secure the text inventory. The positions were taken from works by the late antique authors Proklos, Damaskios, Simplicius of Cilicia, Olympiodorus and Synesius. His collection, which comprises 318 oracle verses, was a strong extension of the previously authoritative compilation of Georgios Gemistos Plethon, which contains only sixty Hexameter.

==== &quot;Nova de universis philosophia&quot; ====
According to his plan, Patricius&#x27;s main work, the &quot;Nova de universis philosophia&quot; &quot;(New Philosophy of Things in its entirety)&quot; should consist of eight parts and explain its entire world interpretation. However, he was able to complete only the first four parts and publish them in Ferrara in 1591. He worked on another part, &quot;De humana philosophia&quot;, in 1591/1592, but the manuscript remained incomplete and the conflict with the censorship authority prevented its completion and publication. The author dedicated the first edition of 1591 to Pope Gregory XIV, With whom he had a friendship from his childhood in Padua.

In the preface recommended to the Pope that the Pope profoundly changed the Catholic school system: in the teaching of ecclesiastical educational institutions - religious schools and universities under papal control - he proposed to replace Aristotelianism, which had dominated the Middle Ages, with an alternative world view that was superior to the prevailing school philosophy . Five models would be considered. The first is his own system according to the &quot;Nova de universis philosophia&quot;, the second the Zoroastrianism, the third the Hermetics, the teaching of the Hermes Trismegistos, the fourth is an allegedly ancient Egyptian philosophy - meaning the teaching of the &quot;Theologia Aristotelis&quot; wrongly attributed to Aristotle -, the fifth is Platonism. He had reconstructed, ordered and explained the four older philosophies. All five models are conducive to religion and acceptable from a Catholic perspective, in contrast to Aristotelianism, which is godless and incompatible with faith. The ancient Church Fathers had already recognized the conformity of Platonism with Christianity. Nevertheless, Aristotelian philosophy had prevailed. Their continued dominance goes back to the medieval scholastics. Plato&#x27;s works were unknown to them, so they turned to the unsuitable writings of Aristotle.

In the preface, Patricius provocatively criticized the approach of the Counter-Reformation church, which tried to secure its belief in its teaching by means of censorship, the Inquisition and state violence. He strongly recommended that you rely on reason and the persuasiveness of philosophical arguments rather than relying on compulsion.

The first part of the script, entitled &quot;Panaugia&quot; (&quot;All-Brightness&quot; or &quot;All-Shine&quot;), deals with the principle of light, which is represented as the shaping and invigorating force in the universe, and with physical light and its properties. Among other things, the reflection and refraction of light and the nature of the colors are discussed. The second part is called &quot;Panarchia&quot; (&quot;Omnipotence&quot; or &quot;All-causality&quot;), a word derived the Greek noun &quot;archḗ&quot; (&quot;origin&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;), which refers to the hierarchical world order and its divine source. The &quot;Panarchia&quot; describes the Emanationism - the gradual outflow of the entities from their divine source - and the hierarchy based on them in the universe. The third part is titled &quot;Pampsychia&quot; (&quot;All-souls&quot;). There the philosopher presents his concept of the soul of the entire physical cosmos through the world soul and particularly discusses the souls of animals. In the fourth part, the &quot;Pancosmia&quot; (&quot;All-order&quot;), topics of physical cosmology are discussed, in particular the question of the spatial expansion of the universe, which Patricius considers infinite.

In addition to the source texts, attached are two digression s by the author on special topics: an attempt to determine the order of Plato&#x27;s dialogues and a compilation of contradictions between Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy. The source texts are Patricius&#x27;s collection of fragments of the Chaldean oracles, hermetic literature and the &quot; Theologia Aristotelis&quot;, described as the &quot;mystical philosophy of the Egyptians&quot;, a pseudo-Aristotelian script, the content of which is Patricius with only orally presented &quot;unwritten teaching&quot; equated to Plato. He said it was a record of Aristotle&#x27;s wisdom teachings of ancient Egyptian origin, which Plato conveyed to his students in class.

Despite his great respect for the creators of the ancient wisdom teachings, Patricius did not hesitate to take a different view in individual cases. He stressed the need for valid evidence and refused to accept quotes from venerable authorities to replace missing arguments. He saw it as his task to provide arguments for what was not sufficiently founded in the traditional texts of the wise men of antiquity.

==== &quot; De numerorum mysteriis &quot; ====
According to the Pythagorean theory of numbers, the scripture &quot; De numerorum mysteriis &quot; &quot; (About the Secrets of Numbers)&quot;, which Patricius commissioned in 1594 on behalf of the Cardinal Federico Borromeo wrote. It has been handed down in handwriting, but remained unchanged.

=== State Theory, History Theory and Military Science ===
==== &quot; La città felice &quot; ====
&quot; La città felice &quot; &quot; (The happy city) &quot; is a youth work by the philosopher, which he wrote as a student, completed in 1551 and had printed in Venice in 1553. The treatise is intended to show the conditions for a successful life in an ideal state community. The starting point is the relevant considerations in the &quot; Politics &quot; of Aristotle, the views of which the young humanist largely follows here. But there is something wrong the influence of Platonism can be seen. Material from Stoic literature is also used in the state model, and the influence of Niccolò Machiavelli s is also noticeable.

==== &quot; Della historia diece dialoghi &quot; ====
Patricius was one of the pioneers of History Theory, a young branch of research at that time. Ten dialogues of the Venetian scholar, which he published in 1560 under the title &quot; Della historia diece dialoghi&quot;, deal with the basics of History of philosophy and the methods of historical research. The fictional dialogues take place in Venice among friends and acquaintances of the author, he is always there. The participants in the speech represent and oppose different opinions. Her remarks are presented in a way that corresponds to a natural course of conversation, with frequent interruptions and digressions, with irony, doubt, ridicule and a wealth of witty remarks.

==== &quot; La militia romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo &quot; ====
The treatise &quot; La militia romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo &quot; &quot; (The Roman warfare after Polybios, Titus Livius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus)&quot;, which Patricius wrote in 1573, was not printed until ten years later. It is strongly inspired by Machiavelli&#x27;s ideas. The starting point is the thesis that the art of war is the basis of peace and a prerequisite for human happiness. The decisive factor is the warfare of the ancient Romans, which is superior to all others, especially the Turkish. You have to stick to this model, because if you can regain the old Roman clout, you no longer have to fear the Turks. The only one who has almost succeeded so far is Duke Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, who as a general, as well as in siege technology and in fortress construction, is the unmatched role model of all other rulers. With this flattery, Patricius wanted to impress Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, grandson of Alfonso I, who was then ruling in Ferrara. He dedicated his writing to him.

==== &quot; Paralleli militari &quot; ====
The &quot; Paralleli militari &quot; &quot; (Military Comparisons)&quot;, printed in two parts in 1594 and 1595, are Patricius&#x27;s last publication. They take stock of his considerations in the face of the political and military crisis in Italy in the late 16th century. He claimed to be able to use his theory of warfare to instruct the military in their own field. For this purpose he sent his writing to the well-known military commanders Ferrante Gonzaga, Francesco Maria II Della Rovere and Alfonso II D&#x27;Este.

=== Literary studies ===
==== &quot; Discorso della diversità de &#x27;furori poetici &quot; ====
The &quot; Discorso della diversità de &#x27;furori poetici &quot; &quot; (treatise on the diversity of poetic emotions)&quot;, a 1553 printed youth work by Patricius, deals with the origin and the different products of poetic inspiration. The author deals with the controversial relationship between inspired work in a state of emotion and learned engineering techniques based on traditional norms and patterns. According to the concept of the &quot; Discorso&quot;, the inspired poet is a creator who follows his inspiration without being bound by rules; his art cannot be learned, but a divine gift. Following the poetics of the Roman poet Horace, the humanist theorist assumes that &quot;ingegno&quot; and &quot;furore&quot; work together in poetic production. By &quot;ingegno&quot; he means individual inclination, talent and here especially mental agility, by &quot;furore&quot; the inspiration from the divine Muses. Thanks to the interplay of these factors, the poet gains a privileged relationship with the deity, which makes him appear sick and crazy from the perspective of people without understanding. However, Patricius admits that the reception of foreign works, learning and practice could also make a contribution to success .

==== &quot; Lettura sopra il sonetto del Petrarca &quot;La gola, e&#x27;l sonno, e l&#x27;ociose piume&quot; &quot; ====
This font is also one of Patricius&#x27;s youth works printed as early as 1553. Here he analyzes the sonnet &quot; La gola, e&#x27;l sonno, e l&#x27;ociose piume &quot; of the famous poet Francesco Petrarca from a philosophical perspective, giving him a symbolic meaning in the context of the Platonic Soul Doctrine.

==== &quot; Della retorica dialoghi dieci &quot; ====
Patricius&#x27;s ten dialogues on rhetoric were printed in Venice in 1562. They are dedicated to Cardinal Niccolò Sfondrati, who later became Pope Gregory XIV. Each dialogue is named after one of the participants. The author himself is involved in all discussions. The scripture turns against the opinion widespread in humanist circles, based on the view of Aristotle and Ciceros, that rhetoric is an art of conviction that is necessary for any knowledge transfer. Patricius sees this as an overestimation of this discipline, which he regards as a means of deception and is viewed with skepticism. He describes it as a mere technique of dealing with linguistic means of expression without any internal relation to truth and reality. Since the principle of rhetoric is unknown and because it deals with the probable and not with the true, it cannot be called science at the current state of knowledge, although the possibility of future scientific rhetoric remains open.

Other topics of rhetoric writing are the origin of language and the power of words. The author believes that the spoken word had a magical power in a mythical past. The later introduced control of the minds with the art of persuasion was only a cheatechoes of this original power, because the former connection with the truth had been lost to humanity. Patricius draws a cultural pessimistic image of human history, emphasizing fear as a decisive factor that led to the deplorable state of civilization in his time and dominated social life. In the context of this decline he categorizes the origins and history of rhetoric.

==== &quot; Parere in difesa dell&#x27;Ariosto &quot; ====
The appearance of the final version of Torquato Tassos epic &quot; Jerusalem Delivered &quot; in 1581 sparked lively controversy in Ferrara. Admirers Tassos faced a group of literary critics for whom Ariosts &quot; Orlando Furioso &quot; was the authoritative pattern. After the poet Camillo Pellegrino made a pejorative statement about Ariost&#x27;s fabric treatment, Patricius intervened in 1585 with a pamphlet. In his statement, entitled &quot; Parere in difesa dell&#x27;Ariosto&quot;, he praised Ariost&#x27;s independence, who neither mimicked the epics Homer s nor followed the rules of Aristotle&#x27;s poetics. Based on the current controversy, Patricius wanted to show the uselessness of the established Aristotelian poetry. He claimed, among other things, that Homer, like Ariost, had not adhered to the rules of this poetics. Tasso immediately responded with a reply in which he defended the conventional principles.

==== &quot; Poetica &quot; ====
The &quot; Poetica &quot; is a large-scale representation of Patricius&#x27;s poetry theory, an alternative to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot; Poetics &quot;. It comprises seven volumes, called decades, because they each consist of ten books. The first two decades, the &quot; Deca istoriale &quot; and the &quot; Deca disputata&quot;, were printed in 1586. The &quot; Deca istoriale &quot; offers a detailed description of the poetic products of antiquity and the forms of their public reception. The inventory is followed by the classification, the examination of Metrik and the presentation of the presentation of poetry in cultural life. One of the theses put forward here is that the actors had always sung at the Tragedy Performances in ancient Greece. The second decade deals with theory. It concludes with a discussion of Torquato Tasso&#x27;s understanding of poetic quality. Patricius called this part of his work &quot; Trimerone &quot; &quot; (three-day work) &quot; because it had taken three days to draft. The remaining five decades, which were lost in the early modern period, were only discovered in 1949 and published in 1969/1971.

==== Controversy with Jacopo Mazzoni ====
Patricius had an intensive discussion with the scholar Jacopo Mazzoni, who contradicted him on a philological question. It was about the lost work &quot; Daphnis oder Lityerses &quot; by the Hellenistic poet Sositheus, which was probably a satire. Patricius wrongly believed that &quot; Daphnis &quot; and &quot; Lityerses &quot; were the titles of two tragedies of Sositheos, while Mazzoni - also falsely - assumed that it was an Eclogue with the title &quot; Daphnis and Lityerses &quot;. Patricius responded to Mazzoni&#x27;s criticism of his hypothesis in 1587 with a reply, the &quot; Risposta di Francesco Patricius a due opposizioni fattegli dal Signor Giacopo Mazzoni &quot; &quot; (response to two objections by Mr Jacopo Mazzoni)&quot;, to which Mazzoni published a reply, to which Patricius replied with a new replica, the &quot; Difesa di Francesco Patricius dalle cento accuse dategli dal Signor Iacopo Mazzoni &quot; &quot; (Francesco Patricius&#x27;s defense against the hundred accusations made against him by Mr Jacopo Mazzoni) &quot;.

=== Erotic ===
==== &quot; Discorsi et argomenti &quot; on Luca Contiles sonnets ====
Patricius was friends with the poet Luca Contile. When he published an edition of his friend&#x27;s collected poetic works in Venice in 1560, he added his &quot; discorsi et argomenti&quot;, introductory and explanatory texts, in which he laid out a philosophical basis for the love poetry. He continued the treatment of the subject of Erost in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot; Symposium &quot; and transferred to his revered friend Tarquinia Molza the role of Plato&#x27;s famous literary figure Diotima, who had the essential knowledge mediated through love. He compared the ancient love poem with that of the Renaissance. After dealing with the theory, he went into the poetic implementation of philosophical thoughts and commented on fifty sonnets Contiles.

==== &quot; Il Delfino overo Del bacio &quot; ====
When Patricius wrote the dialogue &quot;Il Delfino overo Del bacio&quot; &quot;(Delfino or About the Kiss)&quot; is controversial. He did not publish it; the work was not made available in print until 1975, when the critical first edition appeared. The interlocutors are the author and an angelo Delfino, after whom the work is named, which cannot be identified with certainty. Delfino is probably a member of the important Venetian noble family of the Dolfin. The starting point is a question that the young Delfino asks the patrician who lives in seclusion: he wants to know what is causing the &quot;sweetness&quot; of the kiss. He found nothing about it in love literature; she ignores the kiss as if it were irrelevant to love. The two men discuss the different types of kissing and their effects, and Patricius gives a detailed explanation that satisfies the questioner. He goes into the different erotic sensibilities of individual parts of the body and rehabilitates the sense of touch that has been dismissed by Marsilio Ficino. Finally, the grateful Delfino sends a prayer to the &quot;exceedingly powerful&quot; god of love Amor.

==== &quot; L&#x27;amorosa filosofia &quot; ====
&quot; L&#x27;amorosa filosofia &quot; is a writing about female attractiveness and love, which Patricius wrote in Modena in 1577 but did not publish.

=== Water management ===
In 1578/1579 Patricius dealt with a water management and at the same time political question. The occasion was a serious problem on the lower reaches of the Po, on the bank of which is Ferrara. After a devastating flood of the river Reno it was channeled in 1442 and led into the Po. The melioration measure was in the interest of the city damaged by the flood Bologna, which the Reno flows past. In the opinion of the Ferrarese, however, it was the cause of the landing, which severely impaired shipping in its area on the Po. Therefore, the rulers of Ferrara in the 15th and 16th centuries reluctantly consented to the introduction of Reno water into the Po or refused to grant it. For this reason, a new conflict between the two cities arose in the 1570s, in which Pope Gregory XIII took over the mediation.

The Pope set up a commission of inquiry in which Scipione di Castro, a political advisor without engineering skills, set the tone. Di Castro wrote an expert opinion in 1578, in which he came to the conclusion that the landing was not caused by the Reno. This angered the Ferrarese, for whom Patricius took the floor after extensive studies. He first formulated and justified his opinion in a report drawn up in 1579 for Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, the &quot; Discorso sopra lo stato del Po di Ferrara &quot; &quot; (treatise on the condition of the Po of Ferrara)&quot;, and then in a damning opinion on the document of Castro, the &quot; Risposta alla scrittura di D. Scipio di Castro sopra l&#x27;arrenamento del Po di Ferrara &quot;. His contact on the part of the Curia was the Bishop Tommaso Sanfelice, with whom he could communicate well. In 1580, Patricius wrote a report on his negotiations with Sanfelice. However, the Duke did not take up his bold proposals for the construction of new canals.

=== &quot; Il Barignano &quot; ===
Patricius treated an ethical topic in 1553 in the collection of early works &quot; Dialogo dell&#x27;honore &quot; &quot; (Dialogue on Honor)&quot;, which he named &quot; Il Barignano &quot;. The namesake is Fabio Barignano, a contemporary poet from Pesaro who was still very young at that time, and who appears as one of the two participants in the fictional discussion. His interlocutor is also a historical figure, the Count Giovan Giacomo Leonardi, a diplomat in the service of the Duke of Urbino. In the dedication letter, Patricius notes that honor is very important to everyone. Even the worst person wanted to be respected everywhere and held to be honorable and took revenge for insult and slander. Nevertheless, no one has ever dedicated a script to honor and examined philosophically what it actually consists of. Only one special aspect, the duel, has so far been discussed in the literature. The &quot; Barignano &quot; should remedy this deficiency. During the conversation, Leonardi conveys his young dialogue partner his understanding of true honor. According to him, this does not consist in prestige, but in an unshakable onevirtuous basic attitude. Therefore, one can never lose true honor, which does not depend on the judgments of others, in contrast to the theory of pretense, an ephemeral reputation based on external values and questionable ideas.

=== Poems ===
Patricius wrote two poems of praise from the late 1550s. He also glorified the painter Irene di Spilimbergo in two sonnets after her early death.

The first of the two poems of praise, &quot; L&#x27;Eridano &quot; &quot; (Der Po)&quot;, was created when the philosopher unsuccessfully sought employment at the court of the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole II D&#x27;Este, tried. It was intended to show the ruler the humanistic qualifications of the author and at the same time to impress with the usual flattery. Patricius dedicated the poem, in which he praised the ruling family, to a duke&#x27;s brother, the cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este. He had it printed in 1557 and included an explanation of the verse form, the &quot; Sostentamenti del nuovo verso heroico &quot;. As in other fields, he also appeared as an innovator here: he claimed that he was introducing a new heroic measure into Italian poetry that matched the heroic content of an epic. These are thirteen silbler with a caesura after the sixth syllable, a form recreated from the classic hexameter. In reality, this measure, which probably goes back to the Alexandrine, was not new, it was already used in the 14th century.
The second poem of praise, the &quot; Badoaro&quot;, was written in 1558 and is also written in the &quot;new&quot; heroic measure. Patricius praises the Venetian humanist, politician and diplomat Federico Badoer. The long lost text was only published in 1981.

=== Letters ===
Around a hundred letters from Patricius have survived, including a letter of 26 June 1572 to Bernardino Telesio, which is particularly important as a source, in which he critically examines his philosophical principles, and an autobiographical letter to his friend Baccio Valori, dated 12 January 1587. They make up only a modest part of his correspondence and largely date from the years in Ferrara and Rome; all letters from adolescence are lost. The style is factual and dry, without literary jewelry. This source material shows the scholar as an important figure in the cultural life of his era.

=== &quot; Del governo de &#x27;regni &quot; ===
According to a hypothesis by John-Theophanes Papademetriou, which is considered plausible, Patricius has printed in Ferrara in 1583 the Italian translation of an oriental fairy tale collection under the title &quot;Del governo de &#x27;regni&#x27; &quot;. The template was a Greek version of this work, which was originally made in India and is called &quot;Fables of Bidpai&quot; orhe &quot; Kalīla wa Dimna &quot; is known.

== Teaching ==
With his teachings in different subject areas, Patricius wanted to distinguish himself as a critic of traditional ways of thinking and finder of new ways. He preferred to differentiate himself from all previous developments and chose an unusual approach, which he - sometimes exaggerating - presented as a fundamental innovation. He sought to broaden the horizons and go beyond the usual limits. In doing so, he came across one of the main obstacles that he tried to remove: the relatively rigid housing of Aristotelism, which dominated in school philosophy, which had developed over the centuries through the extensive Aristotle commentary and allowed innovation only within a predetermined, narrow framework. In view of this situation, the humanist&#x27;s polemic was directed not only against Aristotle, but also against the scholastic tradition shaped by Aristotelian thinking and in particular against its Averroistic current. He accused Aristotelians and scholastics of dealing with words - abstractions introduced arbitrarily and without reason - rather than things and having lost all contact with the reality of nature.

In general, Patricius&#x27;s philosophy is characterized by the priority of the deductive approach. He derived his theses from premise n, the correctness of which he considered evident. In doing so, he aspired to be scientific, based on the model of mathematical discourse. The goal was knowledge of the whole existing through order &quot;(rerum universitas)&quot; through an understanding of structures. Patricius justified his rejection of Aristotelian reasoning by saying that it failed in relation to contingents. His approach should remedy this shortcoming; he wanted to systematize the contingent and thereby make it capable of science.

=== Metaphysics, natural philosophy and mathematics ===
In natural philosophy, Patricius emphasized the novelty of his teaching; he stated that he was announcing &quot;great things&quot; and &quot;outrageous things.&quot; In fact, he made a fundamental break with the medieval and early modern scholastic tradition.

==== Space concept ====
In scholastic physics based on Aristotelian standards, which still prevailed in the 16th century, spatial concept was bound to the concept of location. The place was conceived as a kind of vessel that can absorb the body and constitute the space. The idea of a three-dimensional space that existed independently of places as a reality of its own was missing.

Patricius opposed this way of thinking with his new spatial concept. According to his understanding, space is neither a substance nor an accident, and it cannot be integrated into it Aristotelian category scheme. It is also not a &quot;nothing&quot; or similar to the non-being, but an actual being something, namely the first being in the world of the sensible. The being of space precedes all other physical being temporally and ontological: it is the prerequisite for its existence. If the world perished, space nonetheless would exist, not only potentially, but actually. As something, space is qualitatively determined; its characteristics are receptivity, three-dimensionality and homogeneity. It is indifferent to what is in it. Considered in and of itself, it is equivalent to the vacuum. On the one hand, physical space is physical because it has three dimensions like a body; on the other hand, it is non-physical because it does not offer any resistance.

==== Philosophy of Mathematics ====
With the &quot;new geometry&quot; that Patricius proposed, he meant a new philosophical foundation of this science. He justified their necessity with an inadequacy of the Euclidean system: Euclid had defined elementary terms such as point, line and area, but had failed to develop a philosophical system that would allow the other geometric terms to be determined correctly. Above all, Euclid does not have a definition of space, although space must be the primary object of geometry. Patricius tried to remedy this deficiency by making space the basis of his own system and deriving points, lines, angles, surfaces and bodies from it.

In Patricius&#x27;s understanding, the continuum is a real fact, while the discrete is a product of thought. This gave him the primacy of geometry over mathematics over arithmetic. This view corresponded to the state of knowledge at that time; the analytical geometry, which extends the concept of number and makes it continuous, has not yet been discovered.

==== Cosmology and world origin ====
According to Aristotelian cosmology, the world of material things enclosed by the spherical vault of heaven forms the whole of the universe. Nothing can be outside of this limited universe, not even time and empty space. Patricius, on the other hand, considered that part of the three-dimensional space that he imagined contains all of the matter to be a delimited area surrounded by empty space. The question of the form of this area remained open. The Aristotelian assumption that the material world is spherical was viewed with skepticism by Patricius, since no proof of the spherical shape of the sky had been provided. Apparently he preferred the hypothesis that the material part of the universe takes the form of a regular tetrahedron s hat. In the middle of the material world, according to his model, is the earth, which rotates about its axis every day. He did not consider the counter-hypothesis, a daily rotation of the celestial vault around the earth, to be plausible, since the required speed was hardly possible. He rejected the conventional explanation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, according to which the stars are attached to transparent material spheres (sphere n), whose revolutions they follow. Instead, he assumed that they were moving freely in the room. For him, the traditional idea that the orbits were circular also fell away. Therefore, he also gave up the concept of the Sphere Harmony, which has been widespread since ancient times, which presupposes physical spheres. However, he held on to the idea of a harmonious structure of the cosmos in the sense of the Platonic natural philosophy. The appearance of a new star, the Supernova from 1572, he took the opportunity to declare Aristotle&#x27;s claim that the sky is unchangeable and imperishable to be refuted.

In Patricius&#x27;s model, the material world is surrounded by an infinitely extended, homogeneous, empty space. This is flooded with light; an empty room must be bright because the light is everywhere where there is no material that could create darkness with its impenetrability. The space that encompasses the material world already existed before the creation of matter, which then in put him in. With this hypothesis, the humanist thinker contradicted Aristotelian teaching, according to which a vacuum is in principle impossible. He also accepted vacuums within the physical world; these are tiny empty spaces between the particles of matter. He saw one of several proofs of the existence of such vacuums in the condensation processes, in which, in his opinion, the empty spaces are filled.

In cosmogony, the doctrine of the origin of the world, Patricius adopted the basic principles of the Neoplatonic Emanationism, which represents the creation of everything created as a gradual emergence from a divine source. He used the ideas of the Chaldean Oracles and the Hermetics.

In contrast to Aristotle, Patricius assumed a temporal beginning of the world. According to his teaching, the creation of the cosmos is not an arbitrary act of God, but a necessity. It inevitably results from God&#x27;s nature, which demands creation. God must create. As creator, he is the source, the first principle in which everything has its origin. This source is called &quot;the one&quot; in Neoplatonism. Patricius used his own word creation for this: &quot;un&#x27;omnia &quot; (&quot;One-Everything&quot;).

According to the model of the &quot;new philosophy&quot;, the first product of the creation process is the spatial principle, the indifferent, neutral principle of the local. Its existence is the prerequisite for everything else, for the unfolding of nature. The starting point of nature is the second principle, the &quot;light&quot;. This does not mean light as a natural phenomenon and the object of sensory perception, but a supra-objective natural condition, the generating principle of form, which is also the principle of knowing and being recognized. From this light emerge in a continuous process, which are metaphorically referred to as the &quot;seeds&quot; of things. These are introduced through the &quot;heat&quot; (Latin &quot; calor &quot;) into the &quot;flow&quot; or the &quot;moisture&quot; (Latin &quot;fluor&quot;), a flexible substrate, from which the preforms are made of world things, their patterns. All of this is not yet material; the first emanation processes take place in a purely intellectual area. In this context, terms such as &quot; fluor &quot; and &quot; calor &quot; are only used to illustrate the non-illustrative. By &quot;fluor&quot; we mean the continuity principle, which creates the connection between the different elementary areas, forces and designs. At the same time, &quot; fluorine &quot; is the passive principle of taking up form and Factor that gives the bodies the resilience needed to maintain their mutual delimitation. The &quot;warmth&quot; represents an active principle, it is the dynamic unfolding of the light principle in the &quot; fluor &quot;.

Thus the four basic principles &quot;space&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, &quot;flowing&quot; and &quot;warmth&quot; are the basis of the cosmos. The material world emerges from them. They form a complex ideal unity that is inherent in all material existence and precedes it as a condition of existence. On the material level, the principle of &quot; fluorine &quot; is shown in the form of the relative &quot;liquid&quot; of the material objects. This means their different degrees of density. These are the cause of the different resistance of physical bodies, their hardness or softness.

This cosmology also has an epistemological aspect. If the physical universe depends on the generating principle of light, it is light-like. Accordingly, from Patricius&#x27;s perspective, nature does not appear to be impenetrable, alien and dark matter, but is in itself clear, it manifests itself. Its clarity does not have to be set and produced by the human observer. Accordingly, there can be no fundamental, unsolvable problem of natural knowledge.

==== Concept of time ====
When examining time, Patricius dealt with Aristotle&#x27;s definition, which he subjected to fundamental criticism. Aristotle made several mistakes at the same time by defining that time is &quot;the number or measure of movement by means of earlier or later&quot;. He had made the measure and number, which are the products of human thought, essential to the inherent fact of nature, as if a thought of man gave being to a natural thing. In reality, time exists without any measurement or count. In addition, Aristotle only took movement into account and ignored standstill or rest. It is not time that measures movement, but movement that time. Movement and measurement are not even essential for human perception of time. Even the &quot;earlier&quot; and &quot;later&quot; of things subject to the passage of time are not part of the essence of time. Rather, time is nothing more than the duration of the body.

According to this understanding, time cannot be ontologically equal to space. Since it is determined as the duration of bodies, but the existence of bodies presupposes that of space, time must be subordinate to space, the primary given, and also to the bodies.

=== Anthropology ===
In the &quot; Pampsychia&quot;, the third part of the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia&quot;, Patricius dealt with the determination of the specifically human through demarcation from the animal. There he dealt with the &quot; animus&quot;, the invigorating and enabling body in the cosmos and especially in living things. He came to the conclusion that there was no inherently irrational &quot; animus &quot;. In doing so, he turned against the popular opinion that the animals had an irrational soul. In his understanding, rationality is not a peculiarity of man, but is more or less pronounced in the animal world. The empirical finding does not allow a fundamental delimitation of the rational from the irrational, rather the differences between the species with regard to rationality are only gradual.

It also makes no sense to use the speech act - defined as &quot;uttered in words&quot; - as a demarcation characteristic of humans, because there is no fundamental discontinuity in this regard either. The utterances of the animals are means of communication that are part of their languages, and their functions are analogous to human languages. The animals were also given a certain level of cognition, which enabled them to act in a targeted manner, and they had reason (ratiocinium), because they were able to meaningfully exchange individual memories with new ones To link perceptions, and that is the activity of the mind. The special position of man rests only on his ability to gain deep insight into causal relationships with the intellect and on the immortality of his soul. In the writing &quot; La gola, e&#x27;l sonno, e l&#x27;ociose piume&quot;, Patricius cited the characteristic of the specifically human in addition to access to knowledge that goes beyond what is perceived by the senses, the impulse control.

Like all Neoplatonists, Patricius dealt intensively with the relationship between the spiritual (intelligible) and the sensually perceptible world. In the hierarchical order of his system, the material sphere is subordinate to the spiritual in every respect, since it is its image and product. The spiritual, as the higher level, is the simpler and closer to the divine origin, the sensually perceptible appears in the variety of the individual sensory objects and the complexity of the physical world. Each of the two spheres is graduated in itself, whereby the simpler is always the superior in rank and power. The relatively simple is always the all-encompassing at the same time, since it produces the relatively complex and varied. Within this order of all reality, man takes a middle position. He forms the lowest level of expression in the spiritual world, because his intellect is the spiritual form that connects its unity with the greatest degree of diversity. At the same time, he is the highest level of existence in the field of beings bound to a physical substrate, since he is the only one with an intellect.

With regard to the classification of the soul in this system, Patricius&#x27;s view agrees with the teaching Plotin s, the founder of Neoplatonism. This is about the controversial question among the Neo-Platonists, whether the soul, through its descent into the physical world, surrenders completely to the material circumstances, as the late antique Neo-Platonists meant, or whether Plotinus could maintain its presence in the spiritual world at any time. Patriciuss is convinced that the human soul has no non-rational or suffering life in itself, but only a life of knowledge; the impulsiveness, the irrational is a result of the physicality, which it encounters from the outside.

=== History and State Theory ===
==== The draft state utopia ====
With his youth work &quot; La città felice &quot; Patricius presented a state model based on Aristotle&#x27;s Political Theory Utopian. At that time, the Aristotelian guidelines were still decisive for him.

The starting point is the determination of the human goal in life. For the author as a Christian, this can only be the attainment of the highest good, the future bliss in the hereafter. The hope of this maintains man in need of his earthly existence. However, there must also be a provisional goal on this side: the creation of advantageous living conditions that encourage higher aspirations. For Patricius, like for other humanists, the optimum that can be achieved in earthly existence is the &quot; felicità&quot;, the happiness that he, like ancient Peripateticians and Stoics, does with the practice of virtue &quot; (operazione della virtù) &quot;. The state that as citystate in the sense of the ancient &quot; polis &quot; and the Italian city republic, the task is to create and guarantee stable framework conditions for this. The happiness of the city is the sum of the happiness of its citizens. This presupposes the opportunity to be happy.

On a social level, the needs arising from the natural love for life in community must be met. On an individual level, it is about carefully maintaining the bond that connects soul and body, maintaining the spirit of life by fulfilling the physical needs. First of all, the physical must be guaranteed; The conditions include favorable climatic conditions and an adequate supply of water and food. If these basic requirements are met, community and public life can be optimized. This requires that citizens know and interact with one another, for example through meals together, and in particular that they connect with one another through educational aspirations and intellectual exchange. To make this possible, the citizenship must not exceed a certain size. Furthermore, the social and class structural inequality among the citizens must be kept within limits; the state should provide public meeting places and the legislation should counter private hostilities. Patricius&#x27;s central demands are the temporal limitation of the exercise of power and the free access of every citizen to the highest state offices. This is to prevent tyrannis chem or oligarchical abuse of power. External security is guaranteed by the citizens themselves, not by mercenaries.

Patricius believes religious cult, rites and a priesthood to satisfy a basic human need are necessary, &quot;temples and churches&quot; are to be built and &quot;the gods&quot; are worshiped. The religion of the &quot;happy city&quot; is not described in any more detail, in any case it does not have a specifically Christian character.

A particularly important state goal is the education of children to virtue. Legislators must ensure that they are not exposed to bad influences. Great emphasis is placed on the musical education of the youth. The teaching in music and painting has a propaedeutic function with regard to later philosophical activity.

According to the state theory of Aristotle, the population of the city-state is divided into classes. Only the upper classes, the ruling class, form the citizens with political rights. The members of the lower classes - farmers, artisans and traders - are busy with their hard work to secure their livelihood and have no opportunity to achieve the happiness they are striving for in the &quot;happy city&quot;. According to the author, they are naturally not predisposed to and capable of doing this. Their arduous existence is a prerequisite for the well-being of the upper class. - With regard to the inevitability of oppression, the young patrician followed the guidelines of Aristotle, who reserved the possibility of a successful life for an elite and saw a natural condition in such social conditions. This view was widespread in the Italian educational class to which Patricius belonged.

==== The evaluation of the forms of government ====
When comparing the different forms of government, Patricius came to the conclusion that a balanced republican mixed constitution was superior to all alternatives. One should neither entrust too much power to an individual, nor paralyze the state through radical democratization. The rule of a small group spurred ambition too much, which could lead to civil wars. Optimal is the Mixed Constitution of the Republic of Venice, in which aspects of the different forms of government are combined. There the element of individual rule is represented by the office of Doge, the principle of the rule of a small elite is enforced by the Senate and the idea of everyone&#x27;s participation is taken into account by the establishment of the Grand Council.

==== Establishing interest in history ====
As in his state utopia, Patricius also uses his determination of the human aim in life as happiness &quot; (felicità) &quot; when dealing with history. According to his teaching, this has three aspects: mere being as successful self-preservation, eternal being as a union with the deity and being &quot;in a good way&quot; &quot; (bene essere)&quot;, successful life in a social context. Looking at history is about studying human striving for being &quot;good&quot; in this sense. The philosopher turns to his discussion of the historical dimension of life.

The need for happiness in the sense of this good being arises according to Patricius&#x27;s finding of sensuality and thus the area of Affekt e. Man is a sensual, passionate being. The affects are primary facts and are in themselves neither commendable nor blameworthy, but they create the possibility of behavior to which praise or blame can be referred. Whether or not you can achieve the &quot;bene essere&quot; depends on whether you learn to properly deal with your passions. A person&#x27;s work on himself begins with behavior towards his own affinity, and only there can &quot;good being&quot; be the goal. According to Patricius, the passions do not come into play inside the individual without cause, but always ignite in the encounter with other people and always aim to have a certain effect on others. The right relationship with them can only be gained and consolidated through practice in the community. Good being through mastering passions proves to be identical with ethical behavior in social life, in the family and in the state.

This is where the time dimension comes into play for Patricius. The community is determined not only by the present, but also by its history. Therefore, dealing with the social challenge must include the entire past, which shows itself as history. A human being living only in the present would be exposed to his affects like an animal. What prevents him from doing so is confrontation with the past. Only history opens up the field in which the individual has to face up to his social task and can prove himself through his ethical behavior. A constructive reference to the present is established through the analysis and awareness of the past.

==== The criticism of the traditional approaches of historians ====
The idea that the purpose of dealing with history was to exemplify the validity of moral teachings and to visualize inspiring or dissuasive patterns has been widespread since ancient times. Even in the Renaissance, numerous authors had endorsed this view, including the well-known humanist Giovanni Pontano and Patricius&#x27;s teacher Francesco Robortello. In this way, the consideration of history was placed in the service of moral education and subordinated to its purposes. This made her the poet and the rhetoricik approximated, which should also aim at educational returns. In addition, a gripping, entertaining, literary narrative was expected from historian as well as from the poet or speaker. As a result, the differences between historical reporting and fictional literature became blurred, for example in the speeches of statesmen and generals invented by historians.

Patricius rigorously opposed this way of dealing with historical materials, which had been common for thousands of years, although he ultimately also pursued an ethical goal and enthusiastically affirmed the role model function of great figures from the past. Like his predecessors, he emphasized the practical use of historical knowledge in civil life and above all in politics. His novelty, however, was that he insisted on a consistent separation between finding the truth and moral instruction or use, and condemned every decoration. In doing so, he attacked the famous historians Thucydides and Livius, whom he accused of having invented alleged speeches that would never have been given in this way. According to his concept, the lessons to be learned from history are knowledge, which is not mediated through rhetorical language art, but is to be acquired through reflection and contemplation based on the facts ascertained by the historian.

According to Patricius&#x27;s reasoning, the concept of historiography, which has been common since ancient times, is based on a contradictory relationship to the subject of consideration. The starting point of his considerations can be summarized as follows: The historians theoretically admit to the ideal that historians are obliged to be impartial and to strictly adhere to the truth. However, it is obvious that this is hardly ever the case in practice, because the historians&#x27; accounts contradict each other on countless points. Furthermore, there are important obstacles to fulfilling the claim to truth: Because of the obvious subjectivity of perceptions and points of view and the inadequacy of the source-based tradition, historians have only a very limited access to historical reality. At best, they can determine the results of the historical events somewhat correctly, while the circumstances, the background and causes remain in the dark. The actual relationships are only known to the respective actors, but they lack the impartiality required for a truthful presentation. Only impartial eyewitnesses are really reliable, but such rapporteurs are usually not available. The neutral historian has no access to the information that he would actually need for his work.

For Patricius, the train of thought can now be continued like this: A representative of the conventional moralizing, rhetorically embellishing presentation of history may concede, because of the weak points mentioned, that the pure truth must remain hidden. However, he will assert that a rough approximation is still possible. One has to put up with not being able to illuminate the background. This concession will not seem too serious to him, because from his perspective the historical truth is irrelevant anyway. He thinks that historical knowledge is not in itself worth striving for, but only as a means for the purpose of instruction that ultimately serves the actual goal of obtaining bliss.

This is where the decisive counter argument comes in, with which Patricius wants to refute the view he is attacking. It reads: A moral poetic invention - such as the epics of Homer and Virgil s - can produce the desired moral yield as well as a historical work, the truth with Ersomixes. Thus, if one resigns in finding the truth and only holds on to the educational effect, the difference between poetry and historiography is eliminated. Historicity loses its intrinsic value and thus historical research loses its meaning. Then you can - according to Patricius - do without historical studies and instead teach bliss with any fables.

==== The concept of scientific history research ====
Patricius countered the criticism of history with his opposite conviction, according to which the historical researcher&#x27;s sole aim is to know the historical truth and to find the facts as a contribution to the &quot; bene essere &quot; is of significant value. According to this concept, objectivity and certainty must be achieved to the extent that is possible for the human mind. In such work, standards of morality are out of the question, there is no question of good or bad. The evaluation of what happened is important, but it is on a different page and has to be done in a different context, from a different perspective. Patricius rejected the connection between philosophy and historiography, as it did for example Polybios; In his opinion, the historian should not philosophize about the hidden causes of the course of history, but only with facts - including the recognizable motives of actors - deal.

As the subject of historical scientific research in this sense, Patricius determined the documented and remembered processes in the world of the sensible in their entirety. He called them &quot;effetti&quot; (&quot;effects&quot;), by which he meant the individual concrete realities over time. It is the singular and contingent facts that enter through the senses and are then processed by the mind and assigned to their reasons. They are effects in contrast to the general causes and purely spiritual conditions with which philosophy deals. The work of the historian is not limited to the collection and documentation of the &quot; effetti &quot;; rather, he can also use meticulous research to determine the reasons for their origin, to recognize the intentions and motives behind them. The possibility to explain the empirical historical facts causally justifies the claim of historical research to be a science.

According to this definition of the research object, the historian&#x27;s field of work is the universal history of the empirically found. Patricius thus opposed the usual limitation to the actions of people and the further narrowing of the field of vision to the deeds of kings, statesmen and generals. From his point of view, the universal history also extends beyond the human world to the processes in nature, that is, the natural history. He also called for the full inclusion of cultural history, that is, intellectual achievements, technical achievements, discoveries of unknown countries and peoples, and the history of individual estates such as artisans, farmers, and shipmen. The Constitutional History deserves special attention; Always ask about the cause of constitutional changes. Patricius considered the intellectual history, which deals with ideas, ideas, opinions and attitudes &quot; (concetti dell&#x27;animo)&quot;, to be more important than the history of deeds. In addition to customs and customs, he also included products such as clothing, structures and ships, as well as all devices manufactured for work and everyday life, as relevant in terms of cultural history.

Patricius also called for economic history to be included, which historians had completely neglected. Without considering the economic and financial situation of a state, the representation of its history is empty and airy, because the economy is the basis for the life of every community. Precise information on the state budget is important.

Another field that Patricius has complained about so far is peace research. He remarked that he had never heard of a history of peace, even though this area in particular would be a particularly worthwhile topic.

==== The method ====
With regard to the method, Patricius insisted on clear criteria of source criticism. One shouldn&#x27;t rely on any established authority, but rather to check everything oneself. Even the agreement of the information of several authors is not proof of the correctness, it could also be a mere rumor. The best sources are the accounts of historians who themselves were involved in the events. However, they would have to be compared with representations from the opponent&#x27;s perspective. Secondly, other contemporary reports are relatively credible. Third is information from authors who wrote about the past, but who should nevertheless be given a certain amount of expertise because they themselves belonged to the people in question. Patricius cautioned particularly with historians who report on foreign peoples and deal with events that were long ago. In his opinion, the value of general historical works such as World Chronicle only lies in the fact that the processing of the compiled material from older sources can be examined. One must always ask oneself what expertise the respective rapporteur could have had, to what extent he could be expected to be impartial and what should be said about his guarantors. Patricius annalistic sources are considered to be particularly reliable, provided they are in the original, unadulterated version. In addition, one should pay due attention to the texts created without the intention of tradition, according to the terminology of modern historical science.

Patricius compared the historian&#x27;s penetration from the circumstances of the action to the cause of the action by separating the individual onion skins, which gradually leads to the core of the onion. He also used the metaphor of the anatomist, which is similar to that of the historian. Like the anatomist with the body, the historian has to deal with the action he is investigating. Every action has a main actor &quot; (principal attore)&quot;, the reason for which must be revealed by cutting.

==== The story of the future ====
The determination of the object of investigation as a whole of the temporal processes led Patricius to assume that historical research could even be extended to the future. He considered it fundamentally possible to write a story of the future, that is, to make serious scientific forecasts based on recognized laws. The background was his understanding of the statesman&#x27;s art, according to which it relies on the ability to anticipate and achieve what is not yet. Accordingly, a ruler empowered to do so would be able to keep records of the correctly foreseen. Then a story of the future lies in the realm of the imaginable.

==== The military system ====
Patricius paid particular attention to the military. He found it unsatisfactory to show the military forces of a state only through reports of battles, conquests, sieges, victories or defeats. Rather, an understanding of the military organization is necessary. You need precise knowledge of the structure and management of the armed forces, weapons, ammunition and Besoldung.

Following Machiavelli, Patricius extensively criticized the use of foreign mercenaries, the disadvantages of which he emphasized. You can only rely on a force of citizens and volunteers. It is fatal to neglect one&#x27;s armament and to give up the illusion that peace can be maintained through alliances, negotiations and payments instead of securing one&#x27;s own clout. The belief that an enemy invasion can be stopped with fortresses is also completely wrong.

Patricius emphasized the crucial role of the infantry, which is usually crucial. Only in three battles - including the Battle of Ravenna 1512 - did the use of artillery lead to the decision. In general, Patricius&#x27;s military science statements are characterized by an underestimation of the artillery and the Arquebus n. Therefore, his &quot; Paralleli militari &quot; were outdated from a technical point of view as soon as they appeared. After all, he recognized the value of guns in naval battles and sieges.

=== Poetry Theory ===
==== The determination of the object ====
With his poetry theory, Patricius distanced himself from traditional guidelines, both from ancient definitions and from the approaches developed in the Renaissance. Above all, he opposed Aristotle&#x27;s poetics. His protest was directed against all conventional determinations of the nature and meaning of poetry, which impose formal or content-related limits on poetic work and thereby limit the poetic design possibilities. First and foremost, he opposed the ancient thesis, taken up by the influential contemporary Aristotle commentator Lodovico Castelvetro, that the task of the poet was to imitate natural or historical facts. Castelvetro claimed that poetry takes all of its light from history. He believed that poetry needed credibility and should therefore, at least in the main story, only represent relationships and events that were in harmony with natural processes and that could be imagined as historical facts. Patricius contrasted this with his concept of universal poetry, the subject matter of which encompasses the divine as well as the human and the natural. Any material can be the subject of poetic design if it is treated poetically. As a formal definition, he only accepted the verse form. The verse belongs to the essence of poetry and distinguishes it from prose. The Aristotelian definition of poetry by its alleged character as imitation is unusable, since Aristotle himself uses the term &quot;imitation&quot; in different meanings.

==== The peculiarity and function of poetry ====
A central concept of Patricius&#x27;s poetics is the &#x27;mirabile&#x27;, the &#x27;wonderful&#x27;, that is, what arouses astonishment or admiration in the reader because it stands out from the mass of ordinary, uniform and self-evident phenomena. According to the understanding of the humanist philosopher, the &quot; mirabile &quot; is the defining characteristic of poetry, through which it is defined in terms of content. When determining the function of this wonderful thing, there is an analogy between the peculiarity and position of man in the cosmos and the specific nature and task of poetry in culture. According to an anthropological premise common in the Renaissance, man stands as a mediating and connecting entity between the world of the spiritual and that of the physical. This enables him to bring the spiritual into the physicalwear and also depict physical in the spiritual. It transfers from one area to another, transforming and transfiguring. For Patricius, this role of man in creation corresponds to the task of poetry in the field of &quot;art&quot; &quot; (arte)&quot;, human products: Poetry mediates in an analogous way between the purely spiritual and the material. The analogy thus established also extends to the factor that makes the mediating entity what it is. The peculiarity of man, which determines his nature and from which his special position results, is the spirit &quot; (mente) &quot; or reason. What the spirit is in relation to man is, according to Patricius&#x27;s explicit statement, the &quot; mirable &quot; in poetry. Just as reason is the universal form of man, which constitutes him as man, so the wonderful is the specific quality that makes every poem such. This also results in an analogy in the order of rank of those who work: Just as the exercise of reason places man above all other animated beings, so the linguistic design of the &quot; mirabile &quot; elevates the poet above all others who write texts of any kind .

The determining factor is the &quot; mirable &quot; form principle of what it designs. His function is thus comparable to that of the soul in man. Just as the soul penetrates and shapes all parts of the body, the &quot; mirabile &quot; exerts its shaping power on the whole of a seal. We can only speak of poetry where the effective presence of the wonderful is palpable and gives the entire product the appropriate quality. Thus three aspects determine the poetic: firstly, the influence of its specific principle of form, secondly, the dignity that corresponds to the high rank of this creative principle, and thirdly, the universal presence of the principle of form in what it has shaped. This results in the need for the verse form, since according to Patricius&#x27;s judgment it is the only linguistic form that is appropriate to the content quality made possible by the &quot; mirabile &quot;.

One of the common connotations of the miraculous in the Renaissance is that it not only arouses astonishment and admiration, but also enables knowledge by leading into the world of the new and amazing. According to Patricius&#x27;s teaching in the field of poetry, this refers to a special being, an independent reality, which the poet created through his shaping &quot; (formazione) &quot;. The peculiarity of the &quot; mirabile &quot; in poetry for the humanist thinker is that it shows itself in a successful mixture &quot; (mescolanza) &quot; of the familiar and the unfamiliar. A poet may and should exceed the limits of what is allowed by the theoreticians, he should consciously disregard norms such as imitation of the natural and conformity with normal life experience and include the unusual and improbable. Since he has to present to the public both familiar and credible effects as well as new and incredible things, he has to mix opposites, and his mastery of this task shows his art. The poetic act takes place on the border of being and not being, of possible and real, of believable and unbelievable, but does not let this border exist, but gives the unbelievable the &quot;face&quot; of the believable and vice versa. The success of this mixing creates the &quot; mirabile &quot; in the product, which turns it into poetry.

The universal conception of Patricius&#x27;s poetics excludes narrowing the poetic productivity by one-sided standards. A preference for certain role models such as Homer or trends such as Petrarcism is therefore not an option.

In Patricius&#x27;s poetry, particular emphasis is placed on the requirement that the aim of poetry should not be to create affects, not to enchant and deceive, but to redirect the soul of the listener or reader through the insight conveyed to him. The mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar, the understood and the misunderstood should create a tension in the reader that drives him to do soto want to understand what is not understood. It should initiate a learning process. The role of the &quot; mirabile &quot; as the central principle of the action of poetry is therefore not an expression of a subjectivist aesthetic of Patricius or an orientation towards the irrational; rather, it results from the didactic concern of poetry to bring about a transition from ignorance to knowledge. This occurs through an impetus for reflection.

An important goal of Patricius&#x27;s poetics is the defense of Theory of inspiration, according to which significant poets share in a Transcendent reality and their productivity is the fruit of divine inspiration. The inspiration is shown in the &quot; furore poetico&quot;, the ecstatic enthusiasm for poetic production that can only be explained as a result of the influence of a deity. Patricius&#x27;s remarks are a response to Aristotelian Lodovico Castelvetro&#x27;s fundamental criticism of enthusiasm. In Castelvetro&#x27;s opinion, the &quot; furore poetico &quot; only exists in a naive popular belief, which is fueled by the poet&#x27;s addiction to self-validation and self-mystification. Accordingly, it is a list of poets who claim to be inspired to gain prestige and hearing. In contrast, Patricius&#x27;s plea stands for the authenticity of the emotion. It tries to invalidate the physiological reasoning of Aristotelians, according to which the &quot;obsession&quot; of what is seized by the &quot;furore&quot; can be interpreted as a symptom of a temperament. However, according to Patriciuss, the &quot; furore &quot; was only at work with authors of past ages, not in the Petrarchist poetry of his own time. The successful contemporary poems are not divinely inspired, but products of talent and artistry.

Patricius also appeared in the field of love theory as an innovator, he announced a &quot;new philosophy of love&quot;. However, the core components of his concept were already known, were based on ancient ideas or had already been presented by other humanists. The teaching presented in Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot; Symposium &quot; and &quot; Phaidros &quot; served as the starting point. Like Plato, Patricius saw love as an inclination to the divine beauty, which gives the soul the &quot;wings&quot; with which it can rise to its transcendent home. It was a performance familiar to the educated audience. Two other theses of the humanist were less conventional: he claimed that love does not belong to the nature of man, but comes from outside as Accidents, and that all kinds of love are from love itself itself, the &quot;philautia&quot;. However, these ideas were not new either. They had been brought forward by Mario Equicola in the early 16th century, and Aristotle had already attributed love for others to self-love.

At the time, however, this was a subversive concept, because the appreciation of love for oneself was unusual and offensive to large groups. It was particularly provocative that the Christian love of neighbor and love of God of the believer were also interpreted as variations of self-love. In the Platonic and Stoic as well as in the Christian tradition, self-love was considered suspect. The suspicion of a justification of selfishness or an Epicurean way of thinking was obvious. However, Patricius&#x27;s thesis was not meant that way because he did not take self-love in the sense of selfish preference. Rather, he also referred to an aspect that compensates for self-reference: the enviousness of good that was already thematized by Plato. According to Platonic understanding, this inevitably causes the good altruistic to be communicated. A real innovation was the insertion of sexuality into the old concept of the ascent of the lover driven by Eros. According to the conventional Platonic view, Patricius said that human love begins with the sight of physical beauty and then rises to the spiritual beauty of the loved one, and so one gradually moves towards divine love. In contrast to tradition, however, the humanist theorist assumed that the erotic then descended again over several levels to sensual love until he reached the bottom and last level, and that was the physical union. Patricius thus shifted the end point of the erotic movement from transcendence to sexuality.

Following the Platonic tradition, Patricius also assigned a metaphysical and cosmological dimension to love. He saw in it not only a phenomenon of the human world, but a real principle in the cosmos, which he believed to be inspired. On the cosmic level, according to his philosophy of love, the function of holding together the individual components of the world as a connecting force and ensuring the continuity of being exists. Accordingly, it is the foundation of the existence of all things. Their universal presence permeates all life in the universe. Here too, it is originally self-love, because God created creation out of love for himself, and he loves things because they are aspects of himself. So he loves himself in them. Accordingly, as an image of God, man also loves himself first. This is the prerequisite for his love for others and especially for God. According to this understanding, every human or divine love for others is a self-communication, which presupposes that the lover affirms his own being and his self-identity. Self-love understood in this way is a manifestation of unity as a self-reference. Then when the love of the individual turns to the outside world, his self-preservation efforts are extended there. In addition, self-love is the source and foundation of all human feelings, thoughts and actions, including religious ones. The background to this concept is Patricius&#x27;s conviction that the being of all being is characterized by the basic structure of the self-relationship. In this context, he coined the Latin expression &quot; persentiscentia &quot; (&quot;self-awareness&quot;), with which he described the experience of staying with one another, the awareness of permanent self-identity.

== Reception ==
=== Early Modern times ===
After a long period of unsuccess, Patricius was finally able to gain respect in science, as the establishment of two chairs at important universities shows for him. His proposal to replace the Aristotelian program with a Platonic one in church educational institutions was not heard by Pope Clement VIII. The demise of the two chairs for Platonic philosophy tailored to him after his departure shows that his philosophy was considered out of date. The Roman chair was closed in 1600.

Patricius&#x27;s theory of nature and criticism of Aristotle were strongly received in the late 16th and 17th centuries, although his main work was on the index of forbidden books, from which it was only removed in 1900. Even in Italy, the ban on the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia &quot; could initially not be enforced across the board: a new edition with the wrong date 1593 appeared in Venice, pretending that it had already been printed before the ban in 1594. This issue was distributed in Protestant Northern and Central Europe, where at that time a Catholic condemnation acted as an advertisement.

==== Positive reception ====
Patricius&#x27;s philosophy of nature was well received by anti-Aristotelian thinkers who liked to use his arguments. An early recipient was the English natural philosopher Nicholas Hill, who took up the ideas of the Italian humanist in his &quot;Philosophia Epicurea&quot; printed in 1601, without naming him. Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), who wrote a book against Aristotelianism wanted to write, gave up his project when he discovered the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia&quot;. Gassendi&#x27;s concept of space clearly shows the influence of this work. Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639) positively received Patricius&#x27;s theory of principles, Johann Amos Comenius (1592–1670) linked to his light metaphysics. Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) appreciated the metaphysics and natural science of the Venetian philosopher. He considered him an important thinker and said that the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia &quot; reveals the very admirable depth of mind of its author. Patricius&#x27;s main work was also appreciated in the 17th century by the Cambridge Platonists n, especially by Henry More, who wrote the further developed the space concept presented there.

The dialogues about history and its research met with a considerable response. A Latin translation, &quot; De legendae scribendaeque historiae ratione dialogi decem&quot;, appeared in Basel in 1570, one of English abstract, Thomas Blundeville, `` The true order and method of wryting and reading hystories&quot;, 1574 in London. Patricius&#x27;s concept met with enthusiastic approval from the Italian emigrant living in England, Jacopo Aconcio, a friend of Blundeville. It was taken up by Paolo Beni and Tommaso Campanella in the early 17th century.&quot;

==== Critical voices ====
Defenders of Aristotelism like Teodoro Angelucci and Jacopo Mazzoni were among the contemporary opponents of the Venetian Platonist, but also Giordano Bruno, who, like Patricius, fought Aristotelism, but did not believe in the &quot; Discussiones peripateticae &quot;. He described this work as pedant manure and regretted that the author had stained so much paper with his effusions. Later, however, Bruno seems to have passed a milder judgment. He is said to have said that Patricius was an incredulous philosopher and still succeeded as the Pope&#x27;s favorite in Rome. Judging very disparagingly Francis Bacon, a younger contemporary. He found that Patricius had recently made nonsensical and fantastic claims in a state of contempt.

Sharp criticism came from the astronomical side. Tycho Brahe complained in a letter to Johannes Kepler in December 1599 that his position in the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia &quot; was misrepresented. This is true; Patricius had criticized Brahe&#x27;s view on the basis of an incorrect second-hand presentation, since his treatise on Comet of 1577 was not accessible to him. Kepler then violently attacked Patricius in his 1600/1601 &quot; Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum&quot;, a defense document for Tycho. He accused him of not distinguishing between real and apparent movements. Kepler&#x27;s criticism, however, was based on the fact that he had misunderstood Patricius&#x27;s model.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz also had an unfavorable opinion. He described Patricius as a man of considerable talent, but who had spoiled his mind by reading the writings of &quot;pseudoplatonists&quot;. By this Leibniz meant above all the ancient Neoplatonists. The Venetian recognized defects in geometry, but was unable to fix them.

==== The philosopher as a dialogue figure ====
The writer Annibale Romei had Patricius appear as a dialogue figure in his &quot; Discorsi&quot;, which was completed in 1586. There the Venetian philosopher presents his cosmology and beauty theory and takes part in the dispute over honor, duel, nobility and wealth. On the seventh and last day of the dialogues, he discussed with the experienced courtier Giulio Cesare Brancaccio whether philosophy or military service should be given priority.

=== Modern ===

In the very rich modern research literature, Patricius is often recognized as an independent, innovative thinker and his performance is considered important. This refers to the philosophical and literary theoretical works, to the historical theory and philological competence of the humanist, but not to his mathematical ideas. Hanna-Barbara Gerl describes him as an ingenious thinker of genuinely Renaissance philosophy who has the unconditional will to represent the method and the uniform explanatory ground for everything real. After the judgment of Thomas Leinkauf he was the most important Platoniker of the early modern period after Marsilio Ficino. However, it is also pointed outthat his strength lay in criticizing the conventional, not in developing viable alternatives. In this sense, Benedetto Croce already expressed itself in 1903.

The natural philosophy model, above all the theory of space, receives attention and recognition. Thus, Ernst Cassirer in 1911 ruled that the &quot; Nova de universis philosophia&quot;, along with Telesio&#x27;s main work &quot; De rerum natura&quot;, was the most important attempt at a uniform and independent explanation of nature in philosophy at the time. Paul Oskar Kristeller expressed a widespread opinion when he 1964 stated that there were good reasons to count Patricius among the natural philosophers who &quot;paved the way for the new science and philosophy of the 17th century and modernity&quot;. As a thinker of a transition period, he tried to develop a systematic explanation of the physical universe in a new and original way. This is a mixture of science and speculation. His work represents a great attempt at system formation, but at the same time reveals a number of gaps and discrepancies.

The poetry theory of the humanist is regarded as an exceptional achievement, whose special position in the extensive literature of Cinquecento on this subject is emphasized. Patricius&#x27;s struggle against Aristotelian poetics is seen as an innovative, albeit little after-effect, impulse that could hardly have affected Aristotelian dominance in this area in the 17th and 18th centuries. George Saintsbury found in 1902 that as a literary critic Patricius was two centuries ahead of his time. Rainer Stillers highlighted the highly developed methodological awareness in 1988, which is reflected in Patricius&#x27;s careful consideration of tradition and his methodical progression from facts to theory show. On the other hand, Bernard Weinberg, who raised the accusation of a lack of consistency in 1961, and the antiaristoteli rejected the argumentation as not valid.

History theory is also highly valued. For example, Franz Lamprecht wrote in 1950 that Patricius was in the middle of an empty formalism, frozen mindset &quot;preserves the pure basic idea of the humanistic world view&quot;. He was a main representative of the current, which &quot;was looking for a way to a more comprehensive and scientifically based conception of history&quot;. In his concept, history has become science in the modern sense for the first time. Similar comments were made on Patricius&#x27;s pioneering role in the establishment of scientific history research u. a. Giorgio Spini (1948), Rüdiger Landfester (1972) and Thomas Sören Hoffmann ( 2007). Thomas Leinkauf (2017) said that Patricius had probably the most interesting and bold concept of history in the 16th Century.

The diligence of the humanistic scholar, his thorough knowledge of the history of philosophy and his precise textual work are emphasized. However, criticism is given to the bias, which is sometimes regarded as fanatical, in his polemical efforts to refute and discredit Aristotle in all areas.

There is general agreement that Patricius&#x27;s attempt to re-establish geometry was unsuccessful. From a mathematical-historical point of view, it is found that he actually found a weakness in Euclid &quot; Elements &quot; &#x27;, but that he was unable to fix it with his own approach. His design of an alternative to Euclidean geometry is already a step backwards seen in ancient times. Even though some of the relevant assumptions were correct, his astronomical view of the world has also proved unsuitable. The reason for this failure is given in research as his purely philosophical approach to scientific problems.

Patricius&#x27;s diverse impulses are answered differently to the question of the classification of intellectual history. Some researchers such as Cesare Vasoli and Lina Bolzoni locate his ideas in the middle of the Cinquecento world of ideas. Others, especially Giorgio Spini, Stephan Otto and Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli, emphasize the revolutionary potential of his theses, which point beyond the Renaissance into the future. You see him as an exponent of an epochal upheaval, a forerunner of the rationalistic discourse that subsequently strengthened and aimed at scientific precision. Carolin Hennig locates him in a zone of upheaval between Renaissance and Baroque and registers &quot;proto-baroque tendencies&quot;. Because of his philosophical orientation, even his affiliation with Renaissance humanism is not unanimously accepted.

<doc id="293376" wikidata="Q483049" url="?curid=293376" title="Uisang">
<text>Uisang (; 625–702) was one of the most eminent early Silla Korean scholar-monks, a close friend of Wonhyo (元曉).

He traveled to China, studying at Mount Zhongnan as a student of the influential Huayan master Zhiyan (智儼) and as a senior colleague of Fazang (法藏), with whom he established a lifelong correspondence. He became an expert in Huayan (華嚴) doctrine and was the founder of the Korean Hwaeom school. Most well known among his writings is the &quot;Beopseongge&quot; or &quot;Hwaeom ilseung beopgye do &quot;(&quot;Diagram of the Avataṃsaka Single Vehicle Dharmadhātu&quot;) (華嚴一乘法界圖). This is a commentary on his mandala-like diagram &quot;haein do&quot; (&#x27;Ocean Seal&#x27;), which consists of 210 Chinese characters that express the essence of the Huayan doctrine. A full translation can be found in the appendix to Odin, 1982.

Little is known of his early life other than his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim.

He is famous for his travel to Táng China with his friend, Wonhyo. At one point they were captured by border guards and held for ten days as suspected spies but were subsequently released and expelled. Late, Wonhyo left Uisang, after unknowingly drinking water from a skull in the dark. The shock of this brought about an enlightenment experience such that he felt it was unnecessary to continue to China in search of wisdom. Dismayed, but nonetheless determined, Uisang continued on his journey eventually reaching China by sea.

A Korean folk story relates how, when he was young, Uisang fell in love with a beautiful girl, Myo Hwa (&quot;Delicate Flower&quot;) but she was chosen by the king of Silla to be sent as a gift to the Chinese Emperor thus thwarting their relationship. This turned Uisang to the religious life and he became a monk. Myo Hwa in desperation tried to commit suicide on the journey in China by throwing herself in the river. However, she was rescued and nursed back to health by a family who subsequently adopted her. Many years later she met Uisang on his travels to China but he explained that he was now a monk and could not go back with her to Silla as she wished. However, he said he would visit her when his studies in China were complete. This he did ten years later. Unfortunately, Myo Hwa was not at home so Uisang left her a note and hurried to get his ship back to Silla. Myo Hwa returned and realized she had just missed him and ran down to the sea to try and catch him before he left. The ship however had already left the shore and in desperation she leapt in the water. As she hit the water she was magically transformed into a dragon by the strength of her love and she was able to follow the ship back to Silla.

Safely arrived in Silla, Uisang went on to found Buseoksa, a temple in the Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang) mountains. The temple name means &quot;Floating Rock&quot; and is derived from an incident in which Myo Hwa, as a dragon, scares away some bandits by magically raising a boulder into the air. She is said to have transformed herself into a rock to continue protecting the site and her lover, Uisang. (Story related by Mu Soeng Sunim, 1987).

Uisang is often referred to as the &quot;Temple Builder&quot; because of the number of temples he established or extended during his lifetime.

<doc id="293377" wikidata="Q76156" url="?curid=293377" title="B. J. Habibie">
<text>Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (; 25 June 1936 – 11 September 2019) was an Indonesian politician, engineer and scientist who served as the third president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999. Less than three months after his inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto, who resigned after 32 years in office, thereby being the only vice president to assume the presidency in such a manner. Originating from Sulawesi with Bugis-Gorontalese and Javanese ancestry, his presidency was seen as a landmark and transition to the Reform era. 

Upon becoming president, he liberalized Indonesia&#x27;s press and political party laws; ended Indonesian occupation of East Timor, which led to that country&#x27;s independence; and held an early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in the end of his presidency. His 517-day presidency and 71-day vice presidency were each the shortest in Indonesian history. Before entering government, Habibie contributed to the making of Indonesia&#x27;s first domestic airplane, the IPTN N-250. As a result, he was granted the title &quot;Father of Technology.&quot;

==Early life and family==
Habibie was born in Parepare, South Sulawesi. His parents, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, an agriculturist from ethnic Bugis-Gorontalese descent, from Gorontalo, and R. A. Tuti Marini Puspowardojo, a Javanese noblewoman from Yogyakarta, who met while studying in Bogor. 

Habibie&#x27;s paternal family comes from Kabila, just to the east of the town of Gorontalo in northern Sulawesi. He was the fourth of eight children. Habibie&#x27;s father died when he was 14 years old. 

In 2018, the Gorontalo provincial government agreed to support the construction of the B. J. Habibie&#x27;s Monument in front of the main gate of Djalaluddin Airport in Gorontalo Regency. In addition, it was proposed that State University of Gorontalo be renamed in honour of Habibie although in the end, the suggestion was not adopted.

==Education==
Habibie went to Delft, the Netherlands, to study aviation and aerospace at the Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft University of Technology), but for political reasons (the West New Guinea dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia), he had to continue his study at the Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen University) in Aachen, Germany. In 1960, Habibie received an engineer&#x27;s degree in Germany with the title &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot;. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.

==Engineering career==
In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie had known Hasri Ainun in childhood, junior high school and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago Christian Senior High School), Bandung. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards.
Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie.

Habibie later found employment with the railway stock firm Waggonfabrik Talbot, where he became an advisor in designing train wagons. Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train construction offered his position to Habibie upon retirement three years later, but Habibie refused the position.

In 1965, Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of &quot;very good,&quot; giving him the title &quot;Doktoringenieur&quot; (Dr.-Ing.). The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner&#x27;s offer to continue his research on and work toward his habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined.

Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor (thermodynamics), Habibie Theorem (construction), and Habibie Method (aerodynamics), respectively. He worked for Messerschmitt on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft. In 1974, he was promoted to vice president of the company.

In 1974, Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (, BPPT). Two years later, Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise &quot;Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio&quot; (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry), which in 1985 changed its name to &quot;Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara&quot; (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000.

==Political career==
===Cabinet minister (1978–1998)===

In 1978, he was appointed as state minister of research and technology (, Menristek). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other &quot;strategic&quot; industries in this post. By the 1980s, IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie&#x27;s leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure. In developing Indonesia&#x27;s aviation industry, he adopted an approach called &quot;Begin at the End and End at the Beginning&quot;. In this method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective.
By 1991, Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train building, steel, arms, communications, and energy. A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2 billion a year in state funding, although the government&#x27;s opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known.

As minister, Habibie created the OFP (Overseas Fellowship Program), STMDP (Science Technology and Manpower Development Program) and STAID (Science and Technology for Industrial Development). These three programs provided scholarships to thousands of high school graduates to earn their bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the STEM fields and for other technical professionals to continue their study for master&#x27;s and doctorate programs in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other countries.

In Suharto&#x27;s regime, as was expected of senior government executives, Habibie became a member of the Golkar organisation. Suharto appointed him as deputy daily coordinator for the chairman of the executive board in 1992, and the following year he became the daily coordinator.

While serving in cabinet, Habibie was also elected as the first Chair of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) in 1990. This modernist Muslim organization provided him with a political base, linked to but independent of the Suharto administration.

===Vice presidency (1998)===

In January 1998, after accepting nomination for a seventh term as president, Suharto announced the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind.

In that year, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, this suggestion was received badly, causing the rupiah to fall. Despite this, Habibie was elected as vice president in March 1998.

==Presidency (1998–1999)==
On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie&#x27;s vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto&#x27;s last cabinet while maintaining others, with no major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners.

===East Timor referendum===
Habibie was opposed to East Timorese independence but did offer East Timor special autonomy.

Timorese independence forces led by the National Council of Timorese Resistance had been calling for a referendum in the territory for some time. Its chief diplomat, José Ramos-Horta, proposed a transitional period of autonomy leading up to a referendum. In late 1998, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, sent a letter to Habibie suggesting that Indonesia defuse the East Timorese issue by providing autonomy to be followed by the promise of a referendum in the long run, following the method used by France to settle New Caledonian demands for independence. Wishing to avoid the impression that Indonesia ruled East Timor as a colony, Habibie surprised some by announcing that a referendum, offering a choice between special autonomy and independence, would be held immediately in East Timor. Leaders of the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) were not consulted on this decision.

On 30 August 1999, the referendum was held and the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose independence. Subsequently, pro-Indonesian militias killed and displaced large numbers of people during the 1999 East Timorese crisis. On 10 September, General Wiranto allegedly threatened to stage a military coup if Habibie allowed in peacekeeping forces, causing Habibie to back down. On 12 September, however, Habibie accepted a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to halt violence. A period of UN administration followed and East Timor became independent in May 2002.

===Suharto&#x27;s corruption charge===
The MPR Special Session in November 1998 decried the presence of corruption in Indonesia, focusing particularly on Suharto. In response to this, Habibie then appointed Andi Muhammad Ghalib as Attorney General. A tape of a telephone conversation between Habibie and Ghalib was made public. It raised concerns about the veracity of the investigation by suggesting that the interrogation of Suharto was intended only for public appearances.

Under Habibie, the Indonesian government also began investigating and prosecuting Suharto&#x27;s youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (commonly known as Tommy Suharto). Ghalib charged Tommy in December 1998 in conjunction with the Goro scandal, where the government, under pressure from Tommy, allegedly gave him a desirable parcel and below-market loan for the construction of a Goro supermarket. However, Tommy was found innocent in the case after several key witnesses, including Habibie aide Rahardi Ramelan, changed their testimony and declared that the deal did not cause losses to the state.

===Economy and the Chinese Indonesians===
Habibie&#x27;s government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few months of Suharto&#x27;s presidency. Habibie&#x27;s government began to make conciliatory gestures towards Chinese-Indonesians who, because of their elite status, were targeted in the riots of 1998. In September 1998, Habibie issued a &#x27;Presidential Instruction&#x27; forbidding use of the terms &quot;pribumi&quot; and &quot;non-pribumi&quot; to differentiate indigenous and non-indigenous Indonesians.

In May 1999, Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous requirement for a &#x27;Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship&#x27; (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese.

===Political reform===
Under Habibie, Indonesia made significant changes to its political system that expanded competition and freedom of speech. Shortly after taking office, in June 1998, Habibie&#x27;s government lifted the Suharto-era restriction on political parties and ended censorship by dissolving the Information Ministry. He also quickly committed to holding democratic elections, albeit on an initially vague timetable. In December, he proposed political reform laws that were passed by the legislature and MPR. These laws set elections for December 1999, reduced the number of seats in parliament held by the military, and barred political activity by civil servants.

However, political opponents criticized Habibie for allowing the military to retain some seats in parliament, and taking little action on other military and judicial reforms.

Habibie&#x27;s government also passed laws which granted significant autonomy to regional governments, namely at the regency and city level. The laws resulted in indirect elections for mayors and regents, and allowed local legislatures to hold said executives accountable, though it was not implemented until after his presidency.

===End of presidency===
Although he had been viewed as leading a transitional government, Habibie seemed determined to continue as president. He was initially unclear about whether he would seek a full term as president when he announced parliamentary elections in June 1998. Habibie faced opposition from many within the government party, Golkar; in July 1998, he struggled to win control of Golkar by appointing Akbar Tandjung as chair of the party, but was ultimately able to defeat a rival camp including former vice president Try Sutrisno, defense minister Edi Sudradjat, Siswono Yudo Husodo, and Sarwono Kusumaatmadja. Habibie began to lose support from Akbar Tandjung and a faction in Golkar, composed of both reformers and hardliners, that wanted to oust him. In March 1999, Golkar put forth five presidential nominees: Habibie, Tandjung, Wiranto, Hamengkubuwono X, and Ginandjar Kartasasmita. In May 1999, after extensive lobbying, Golkar announced that Habibie would be their presidential candidate, but a large faction in the party remained loyal to Tandjung and opposed to Habibie. His political credibility was tarnished by the exposure of the 1999 Bank Bali scandal, in which banking funds were funneled to members of Habibie&#x27;s re-election team.

At the 1999 MPR General Session in October, Habibie delivered an accountability speech. MPR members then began voting to decide if they would accept or reject his speech. Habibie attempted to win the support of the military by offering the vice presidency to General Wiranto, but his offer was declined. Tandjung&#x27;s Golkar faction broke ranks and voted against him, so his accountability speech was rejected by 355 votes to 322 and Habibie withdrew his nomination as president. He was succeeded by Abdurrahman Wahid.

==Post-presidency==

===Post-presidency activities===
After relinquishing the presidency, Habibie spent more time in Germany than in Indonesia, though he was active during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&#x27;s presidency as a presidential adviser. During this time, he established the Habibie Centre, an independent think tank.

In September 2006, he released a book called (Decisive Moments: Indonesia&#x27;s Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998, which led to his rise to the presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto&#x27;s son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d&#x27;état against him in May 1998.

===Illness and death===
In early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems, namely cardiomyopathy, and died on 11 September 2019. He became the first president of Indonesia to be buried at the Kalibata Heroes&#x27; Cemetery, next to his wife&#x27;s grave.

In response to his death, the Government of Indonesia announced a three-day national mourning period starting on 12 September, and announced that the Indonesian flag is to be flown at half-staff during the period.

Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad was saddened by the loss of his old friend, Habibie. He described his demise as a considerable loss.

On 12 September 2019, a video was released showing East Timor&#x27;s former president, Xanana Gusmão, visiting Habibie in hospital on 22 July 2019. Gusmão is shown talking briefly to Habibie while crying, then kissing Habibie on the forehead and lowering his face to Habibie&#x27;s chest, with the other holding his head. A wreath in Gusmão&#x27;s name was at the funeral, with a sign reading: &quot;Profound Condolences - With heartfelt sympathy for the loss of Big Brother President B.J. Habibie - Timorese people will remember you forever - Rest in Peace - Xanana Gusmão.&quot;

==Personal life==

Habibie was married to Hasri Ainun Besari, a medical doctor, from 12 May 1962 until her death on 22 May 2010. Their wedding was held according to Javanese and Gorontalese culture. The couple had two sons, Ilham Akbar Habibie and Thareq Kemal Habibie.

B. J. Habibie&#x27;s brother, Junus Effendi Habibie, was Indonesian ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. After his wife&#x27;s death, Habibie published a book titled &quot;Habibie &amp; Ainun&quot; which recounts his relationship with Hasri Ainun from their courtship until her death. The book was adapted into a film of the same name which was released on 20 December 2012.

<text>Riḥla () refers to both a journey and the written account of that journey, or travelogue. It constitutes a genre of Arabic literature. Associated with the medieval Islamic notion of &quot;travel in search of knowledge&quot; (الرحلة في طلب العلم), the &quot;riḥla&quot; as a genre of medieval and early-modern Arabic literature usually describes a journey taken with the intent of performing the Hajj, but can include an itinerary that vastly exceeds that original route. The classical &quot;riḥla&quot; in medieval Arabic travel literature, like those written by Ibn Battuta (known commonly as &quot;The Rihla&quot;) and Ibn Jubayr, includes a description of the &quot;personalities, places, governments, customs, and curiosities&quot; experienced by the traveler, and usually within the boundaries of the Muslim world. However, the term rihla can be applied to other Arabic travel narratives describing journeys taken for reasons other than pilgrimage; for instance, the 19th–century &quot;riḥla&quot;s of Muhammad as-Saffar and Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi both follow conventions of the riḥla genre by recording not only the journey to France from Morocco and Egypt, respectively, but also their experiences and observations.

== As travel ==
The &quot;Rihla&quot; travel practice originated in Middle Ages Morocco and served to connect Muslims of Morocco to the collective consciousness of the &quot;ummah&quot; across the Islamic world, thereby generating a larger sense of community. &quot;Rihla&quot; consists of three types:
#&quot;Rihla&quot; — journey within Morocco, typically to meet with other pilgrims before traveling beyond the local area.
#&quot;Rihla hijaziyya&quot; - journey to the &quot;Hejaz&quot; which would be transmitted via an oral or written report.
#&quot;Rihla sifariyya&quot; — journey to foreign lands including to embassies and missions in territories in &quot;Dar al-Harb&quot;. Events on these journeys would be the basis of the extant travel literature.
The performance of &quot;Rihla&quot; was considered in Moorish al-Andalus as a qualifier for teachers and political leaders. These journeys also coincided with the end of the Mongol invasions and a new opportunity for Islamic expansion.

==As literature==
The travel narratives of Ibn Jubayr and Ibn Battuta are perceived as &quot;archetypical exponents of the flowering of [the &quot;riḥla&quot;] genre,&quot; but should not be perceived as its founders. Concerning Ibn Jubayr&#x27;s voyage to Mecca in 1183, one writer claimed that &quot;...his two-year journey made a considerable impact on literary history. His account of his travels and tribulations in the East served as the foundational work of a new genre of writing, the rihla, or the creative travelogue: a mix of personal narrative, description, opinion and anecdote. In following centuries, countless people emulated and even plagiarized him.&quot; Travel narratives were written prior to Ibn Jubayr&#x27;s; for example, the 12th–century &quot;riḥla&quot; of Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, and accounts of foreign lands visited by merchants and diplomats (such as the 9th century accounts of India and China by Abu Zayd al-Sirafi, and the 10th–century &quot;riḥla&quot; by Ibn Fadlan with the Abbasid mission to the Volga) long predate Ibn Jubayr&#x27;s travelogue.

The best-known &quot;rihla&quot; narrative is Ibn Battuta&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling&quot; (, or ), often referred to as the &quot;Travels of Ibn Battuta&quot; (, or ). The &quot;Travels&quot; was dictated to Ibn Juzayy on orders from the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris, who was impressed by the story of Ibn Battuta. Although Ibn Battuta was an accomplished and well-documented explorer, his travels had been unknown outside the Islamic world for many years.

The &quot;Rihla&quot; of Abdallah al-Tijani describes his 970-day round trip from Tunis to Tripoli between 1306 and 1309.

<text>Bernardino Telesio (; 7 November 1509 – 2 October 1588) was an Italian philosopher and natural scientist. While his natural theories were later disproven, his emphasis on observation made him the &quot;first of the moderns&quot; who eventually developed the scientific method.

==Biography==
Telesio was born of noble parentage in Cosenza, a city in Calabria, Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples). He was educated in Milan by his uncle, Antonio, himself a scholar and a poet of eminence, and afterwards in Rome and Padua. His studies included a wide range of subjects, classics, science and philosophy, which constituted the curriculum of the Renaissance savants. Thus equipped, he began his attack upon the medieval Aristotelianism which then flourished in Padua and Bologna and he wrote some short poems, brought back to light by Luca Irwin Fragale in 2010. In 1553 he married and settled in Cosenza, becoming the founder of the Cosentian Academy. From 1544 to 1550 and after 1565 he lived in the household of Alfonso III Carafa, Duke of Nocera.

In 1565 appeared his great work &quot;De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles&quot;) and the complete edition of nine books was published in 1586. This was followed by a large number of scientific and philosophical works of subsidiary importance, added to bolster his major work.

In 1552 Telesio married Diana Sersale, a widow with two children, with whom he had four children, the eldest of whom, Prospero, was mysteriously killed in 1576. After the death of his wife, Pope Pius IV offered him the Archbishopric of Cosenza, but Telesio refused in favour of his brother Tommaso. Bernardino spent the last years of his life in Cosenza where he took over the philosophical-scientific &quot;Telesian&quot; Academy that had been started by Aulo Giano Parrasio.

He died in Cosenza in 1588, famous among scholars and his students, but opposed by the Church for the heterodox views which he maintained against the established Aristotelianism, and a short time after his death Pope Clement VIII put his books on the Index of prohibited books of 1596.

==Theory of matter, heat and cold==
Instead of postulating matter and form, he bases existence on matter and force. This force has two opposing elements: heat, which expands, and cold, which contracts. These two processes account for all the diverse forms and types of existence, while the mass on which the force operates remains the same. The harmony of the whole consists in this, that each separate thing develops in and for itself in accordance with its own nature while at the same time its motion benefits the rest. The obvious defects of this theory, (1) that the senses alone cannot apprehend matter itself, (2) that it is not clear how the multiplicity of phenomena could result from these two forces, though it is no less convincing than Aristotle&#x27;s hot/cold, dry/wet explanation, and (3) that he adduced no evidence to substantiate the existence of these two forces, were pointed out at the time by his pupil, Patrizzi.

Moreover, his theory of the cold earth at rest and the hot sun in motion was doomed to disproof at the hands of Copernicus. At the same time, the theory was sufficiently coherent to make a great impression on Italian thought. It should be mentioned, though, that his obliteration of a distinction between superlunar and sublunar physics was certainly quite prescient though not acknowledged by his successors as particularly worthy of note. When Telesio went on to explain the relation of mind and matter, he was still more heterodox. Material forces are, by hypothesis, capable of feeling; matter also must have been from the first endowed with consciousness. For consciousness exists, and could not have been developed out of anything. This leads him to a form of hylozoism. Again, the soul is influenced by material conditions; consequently, the soul must have a material existence. He further held that all knowledge is a sensation (&quot;non-ratione sed sensu&quot;) and that intelligence is, therefore, an agglomeration of isolated data, given by the senses. He does not, however, succeed in explaining how the senses alone can perceive difference and identity.

At the end of his scheme, probably in deference to theological prejudices, he added an element which was utterly alien, namely, a higher impulse, a soul superimposed by God, in virtue of which we strive beyond the world of sense. This divine soul is hardly a completely novel concept if viewed in the context of Averroestic or Thomasian perceptual theory.

The whole system of Telesio shows gaps in his argument, and ignorance of essential facts, but at the same time it is a forerunner of all subsequent empiricism, scientific and philosophical, and marks clearly the period of transition from authority and reason to experiment and individual responsibility.

==Reliance on sensory data==

Telesio was the head of the great Southern Italian movement which protested against the accepted authority of abstract reason, and sowed the seeds from which sprang the scientific methods of Tommaso Campanella and Giordano Bruno, of Francis Bacon and René Descartes, with their widely divergent results. He, therefore, abandoned the purely intellectual sphere and proposed an inquiry into the data provided by the senses, from which he held that all true knowledge really comes (his theory of sense perception was essentially a reworking of Aristotle&#x27;s theory from &quot;De Anima&quot;).

Telesio writes in the beginning of the Proem of the first book of the third edition of &quot;De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia Libri Ix&quot;... &quot;That the construction of the world and the magnitude of the bodies contained within it, and the nature of the world, is to be searched for not by reason as was done by the ancients, but is to be understood by means of observation.&quot; (&quot;Mundi constructionem, corporumque in eo contentorum magnitudinem, naturamque non-ratione, quod antiquioribus factum est, inquirendam, sed sensu percipiendam.&quot;) This statement, found on the very first page, summarizes what many modern scholars have generally considered to be Telesian philosophy, and it often seems that many did not read any further for on the very next page he sets up his hot/cold theory of informed matter, a theory that is clearly not informed by our modern idea of observation. For Telesio, observation (&quot;sensu percipiendam&quot;) is a much larger mental process than simply recording data, observation also includes analogical thought.

Though Francis Bacon is generally credited nowadays with the codification of an inductive method that wholeheartedly endorses observation as the primary procedure for acquiring knowledge, he was certainly not the first to suggest that sensory perception should be the primary source for knowledge. Among natural philosophers from the Renaissance, this honour is generally bestowed upon Telesio. Bacon himself acknowledges Telesio as being &quot;the first of the moderns&quot; (&quot;De Telesio autem bene sentimus, atque eum ut amantem veritatis, &amp; Scientiis utilem, &amp; nonnullorum Placitorum emendatorem &amp; novorum hominum primum agnoscimus.&quot;, from Bacon&#x27;s &quot;De principiis atque originibus&quot;) for putting observation above all other methods for acquiring knowledge about the natural world. This frequently quoted phrase from Bacon, though, is misleading, for it oversimplifies and misrepresents Bacon&#x27;s opinion of Telesio. Most of Bacon&#x27;s essay is an attack on Telesio and this phrase, invariably taken out of context, has facilitated a general misconception of Telesian natural philosophy by giving it a Baconian stamp of approval, which was far from Bacon&#x27;s original intentions. Bacon sees in Telesio an ally in the fight against ancient authority, but he has little positive to say about Telesio&#x27;s specific theories.

What is perhaps most striking about &quot;De rerum natura&quot; is Telesio&#x27;s attempt to mechanize as much as possible. Telesio clearly strives to explain everything in terms of the matter informed by hot and cold and to keep his arguments as simple as possible. When his discussions turn to human beings he introduces an instinct of self-preservation to account for their motivations. And when he discusses the human mind and its ability to reason in the abstract about immaterial and divine topics, he adds a soul. For without a soul, all thought, by his reasoning, would be limited to material things. This would make God unthinkable and clearly, this was not the case, for observation proves that people think about God.

==Works==

Besides &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot;, he wrote:
* &quot;De Somno&quot;
* &quot;De his quae in aere fiunt&quot;
* &quot;De Mari&quot;
* &quot;De Cometis et Circulo Lactea&quot;
* &quot;De usu respirationis&quot;

<doc id="293381" wikidata="Q4771493" url="?curid=293381" title="Anthea Turner">
<text>Anthea Turner (born 25 May 1960) is an English television presenter. She was a host of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 1992 until 1994, and of &quot;GMTV&quot; from 1994 until 1996.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and educated at the Roman Catholic girls&#x27; school St Dominic&#x27;s Grammar School in Stoke. She was one of three daughters born to her parents Brian and Jean Turner. One of her sisters, Ruth, died aged 15. Her other sister is presenter Wendy Turner-Webster.

==Career==
Turner joined BBC Radio Stoke as a runner, eventually joining breakfast show presenter Bruno Brookes as part of his rap crew. The couple became romantically involved and employed Peter Powell as an agent through his management company.

===Television===
Turner moved into television through Sky Channel and Music Box presenting live music programmes from July 1986 to 1989. Her debut on national television was with the BBC on &quot;But First This&quot;, which led to her fronting two series for the BBC on the Saturday morning show &quot;UP2U&quot;.

During a motorbike stunt that went wrong on &quot;UP2U&quot;, Turner suffered burns and temporary hearing loss, which led to a successful lawsuit against the BBC.

She presented &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; from October 1988 to May 1991, and, for the final 18 months of this period, was the only non-Radio 1 DJ to do so regularly.

Turner presented the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 27 June 1992 to 29 June 1994, and around this time was also associated with publicising The Y Plan, a system of exercise developed by the London YMCA. She moved on to presenting on &quot;Totally Live&quot; on pan-European music channel Music Box, followed by &quot;GMTV&quot;, which she presented from July 1994 to 24 December 1996.

Turner was also a host on the first National Lottery draw on BBC One on 19 November 1994 with Noel Edmonds and Gordon Kennedy. She remained as sole host of the National Lottery Live until 20 April 1996, when she joined ITV and the travel show &quot;Wish You Were Here...?&quot;, becoming the second-highest-paid female television presenter in the UK, after Cilla Black. She was replaced on The National Lottery Live by Bob Monkhouse.

The relationship between Turner and her &quot;GMTV&quot; co-presenter Eamonn Holmes was frosty, with Holmes issuing an ultimatum to the &quot;GMTV&quot; management that he would leave if they did not sack his colleague: as a result, Turner lost her job. After Bovey left his wife Della for Turner, with ensuing tabloid interest, Turner&#x27;s career went into a decline. Her autobiography &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, for which she was paid an estimated £400,000 advance, sold 451 copies in its first week of release in November 2000 and entered the bestseller charts at No. 531.

Attempting to revive her career, Turner presented BBC One&#x27;s short-lived Saturday-evening programme &quot;Your Kids Are in Charge&quot; in 2000 with her sister Wendy Turner-Webster. The following year, she participated in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, and was the third contestant to be evicted, after Chris Eubank and Vanessa Feltz.

In February 2006, Turner made a television comeback on BBC Three in &quot;Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife&quot;, where she taught disorganised-house women and men how to clean and run their houses. The series was accompanied by three related books. Later in 2006, she appeared as a guest on BBC Two&#x27;s music-based panel show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

In April 2009, Turner appeared on the ITV reality show &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; with Marco Pierre White, alongside her then husband Grant Bovey. Turner also presented the show &quot;Help Me Anthea, I&#x27;m Infested&quot; for BBC Three, as she advised people whose homes have been overrun by pests. Turner took part in the first series of the Channel 4 game show &quot;The Jump&quot; in 2013. The show saw twelve celebrities take part in winter sports. The show is set in a mountainside in Austria.

On 23 August 2015, she replaced Anne Diamond and Sian Welby as the host of the Health Lottery draws on Channel 5. Welby later returned on 2 October and Anthea Turner was dropped from the line-up.

Turner took part in a special celebrity edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;First Dates&quot; on 12 October 2015, in aid of Stand Up to Cancer.

On 20 November 2017, Turner appeared on the BBC show &quot;Celebrity Antiques Road Trip&quot; in an episode set in Staffordshire and Cheshire. In 2018, she appeared on the Channel 5 show &quot;Celebs in Solitary&quot;, where she attempted to spend five days in solitary confinement.

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===

In 2013, Turner appeared as a contestant in the eighth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, where she finished in ninth place out of twelve celebrity skaters. She participated in the show with her professional skating partner Andrew Buchanan. In the third week she performed to the Donny Osmond song &quot;Puppy Love&quot;, and ended up in the skate-off against Keith Chegwin. They lost the skate-off and were the fourth couple to be eliminated from the series.
*Note: Week 3 was a duel, in which the judges did not give scores, instead the celebrities were paired up and the judges chose which performance they preferred, making them immune from the public vote.

==Personal life==
Turner&#x27;s private life has been covered in the tabloid press. The then-editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Piers Morgan, admitted in April 2003 that the interest of the popular press in Turner&#x27;s private life had seriously damaged her career.

After her long relationship with one-time DJ co-worker Bruno Brookes, she married her manager, former DJ Peter Powell in 1990; the couple divorced in 1998.

The year of her divorce from Powell, Turner moved in with the CEO of Imagine Homes, Grant Bovey. Bovey left his wife, Della, to move in with Turner. He was later reconciled with Della, before leaving her again to return to Turner. Turner and Bovey married on 23 August 2000. Turner was keen to start her own family with Bovey, who has three daughters from his previous marriage.

&quot;OK!&quot; magazine was sold exclusive rights to the Bovey-Turner wedding for an amount that Turner described as &quot;substantial&quot;. The only photograph released to the media was of Bovey and Turner biting into a Cadbury Snowflake chocolate bar, which had been provided by the magazine. Several tabloids ran critical stories, but Turner wrote in her autobiography that she believed that the photo that would be released to the media would be a &quot;traditional wedding-day shot&quot; and &quot;OK!&quot; confirmed that neither Turner nor Bovey had been involved in the picture&#x27;s release.

Turner further wrote &quot;The whole thing smacked of us selling our souls for sponsorship, which could not have been further from the truth. We&#x27;d never entered into any discussion or financial agreement with the chocolate company: our only link with them had been the box of confectionery that they had sent for the reception. Indeed, the whole concept was absolutely abhorrent to us both. To say I was gutted would be a gross understatement. It just goes to show that even the most experienced of us can be lulled into a false sense of security and caught off guard.&quot;
Turner and Bovey split up in 2012, due to Bovey&#x27;s extramarital affair with a much younger woman. After an initial reconciliation, they separated again in August 2013, this time permanently and they divorced in October 2015.
