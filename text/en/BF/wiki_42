==Etymology==
&quot;Bacólod&quot; (), is derived from &quot;bakólod&quot; (Old Spelling: &quot;bacólod&quot;), the Old Hiligaynon (Old Ilonggo) (Old Spelling: &quot;Ylongo and Ilongo&quot;) word for a &quot;hill, turtle, mound, rise, hillock, down, any small eminence or elevation&quot;, since the resettlement was founded on a stony, hilly area, now the barangay of Granada. It was officially called &quot;Ciudad de Bacólod&quot; (City of Bacolod) when &quot;Municipalidad de Bacólod&quot; (Municipality of Bacolod) was converted into a city in 1938.

==History==

===Spanish colonial period===
Historical church accounts provide a glimpse of the early years of Bacolod as a mere small settlement by the riverbank known as &quot;Magsungay&quot; (translated as &quot;horn-shaped&quot; in English). When the neighboring settlement of Bago was elevated into the status of a small town in 1575, it had several religious dependencies and one of which was the village of Magsungay. The early missionaries placed the village under the care and protection of Saint Sebastian sometime in the middle of the 18th century. A &quot;corregidor&quot; () by the name of Luis Fernando de Luna, donated a relic of the saint for the growing mission, and since then, the village came to be known as &quot;San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay&quot;.

Bacolod was not established as a town until 1755 or 1756, after the inhabitants of the coastal settlement of &quot;San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay&quot;, were attacked by forces under Datu Bantílan of Sulu on July 14, 1755, and the villagers transferred from the coast to a hilly area called &quot;Bacólod&quot; (which is now the barangay of Granada). Bernardino de los Santos became the first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; (). The town of Bacolod was constituted as a &quot;parroquia&quot; () in 1788 under the secular clergy, but did not have a resident priest until 1802, as the town was served by the priest from Bago, and later Binalbagan. By 1790, slave raids on Bacolod by Moro pirates had ceased.
On February 11, 1802, Fr. Eusebio Laurencio became acting parish priest of Bacolod. In September 1806, Fr. León Pedro was appointed interim parish priest and the following year became the first regular parish priest. In September 1817, &quot;Fray&quot; () Julián Gonzaga from Barcelona was appointed as the parish priest. He encouraged the people to settle once again near the sea. He also encouraged migration to Bacolod and the opening of lands to agriculture and industry.

In 1846, upon the request of Romualdo Jimeno, bishop of Cebu and Negros at that time, Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa sent to Negros a team of Recollect missionaries headed by priest Fernando Cuenca. A decree of June 20, 1848, by &quot;Gobernador General&quot; Clavería ordered the restructuring of Negros politically and religiously. The following year (1849), Negros Island &quot;Gobernadorcillo&quot; Manuel Valdevieso y Morquecho transferred the capital of the Province of Negros from Himamaylan to Bacolod and the Augustinian Recollects were asked to assume spiritual administration of Negros, which they did that same year. Transfer of Bacolod to the Recollects, however, took place only in 1871. &quot;Fray&quot; Mauricio Ferrero became the first Augustinian Recollect parish priest of Bacolod and successor to the secular priest, Fr. Mariano Ávila. In 1863, a compulsory primary public school system was set up.

In 1889, Bacolod became the capital of &quot;Occidental Negros&quot; when the province of Negros was politically divided into the separate provinces of &quot;Occidental Negros&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Negros Occidental&quot;) and &quot;Oriental Negros&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Negros Oriental&quot;).

===Revolution and Republic of Negros===

The success of the uprising in Bacolod and environs was attributed to the low morale of the local imperial Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in Panay and Luzon and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the &quot;Negrense Revolucionarios&quot; (), armed with knives, bolos, spears, and rifle-like nipa palm stems, and pieces of &quot;sawali&quot; or &quot;amakan&quot; mounted on carts, captured the convent, presently &quot;Palacio Episcopal&quot; (), where Colonel Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed &quot;cazadores&quot; () and platoons of &quot;Guardias Civiles&quot; (), surrendered.

On November 7, 1898, most of the revolutionary army gathered together to establish a provisional junta and to confirm the elections of Aniceto Lacson as president, Juan Araneta as war-delegate, as well as the other officials. For a brief moment, the provinces of &quot;Occidental Negros&quot; and &quot;Oriental Negros&quot; were reunited under the cantonal government of the &quot;Negrense Revolucionarios&quot;, from November 6, 1898, to the end of February 1899, making Bacolod the capital. In March 1899, the American forces led by Colonel James G. Smith occupied Bacolod, the revolutionary capital of &quot;República Cantonal de Negros&quot; (). They occupied Bacolod after the invitation of the Republic of Negros which sought protectorate status for their nation under the United States.

===American colonial period===

The Cantonal Republic of Negros became a U.S. territory on April 30, 1901. This separated Negros Island once again, reverting Bacolod to its status as the capital of &quot;Occidental Negros&quot;.

The public school of &quot;Instituto Rizal&quot; () opened its doors to students on July 1, 1902. &quot;Colegio de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación&quot; (), the first private institution in the province of Negros Occidental, was established in Bacolod by the Augustinian sisters on March 11, 1919, and opened in July 1919.

A historic event took place in 1938 when Municipality of Bacolod was elevated into a city through Commonwealth Act No. 326 passed by the 1st National Assembly of the Philippines creating the City of Bacolod. Assemblyman Pedro C. Hernáez of the second district of Negros Occidental sponsored the bill. The law was passed on June 18, 1938. Bacolod was formally inaugurated as a chartered city on October 19, 1938, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 404, highlighted by the visit of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. President Quezon appointed Alfredo Montelíbano, Sr. as the first city mayor of Bacolod.

===Japanese occupation and allied liberation===
In World War II, Bacolod was occupied by the Japanese forces on May 21, 1942. Lieutenant General Kawano &quot;Kono&quot; Takeshi, the Japanese commanding officer of the 77th Infantry Brigade, 102nd Division, seized the homes of Don Generoso Villanueva, a prominent sugar planter—whose home, the Daku Balay served as the &quot;seat of power&quot; (occupational headquarters for the Japanese Forces in Negros and all of the Central Visayan region of the Philippines) and being the tallest building of Bacolod it served as the city&#x27;s watchtower—and the home of his brother-in-law, Don Mariano Ramos, the first appointed Municipal President of Bacolod. The home of Don Generoso was lived in by Lt. General Takeshi throughout the duration of the war and also served as his office and the home of Don Mariano was occupied by a Japanese Colonel serving under the command of Lt. General Takeshi. The city was liberated by joint Philippine and American forces on May 29, 1945. It took time to rebuild the city after liberation. However, upon the orders of Lt. General Takeshi, both the homes of Villanueva and Ramos were saved from destruction by the retreating Japanese forces.

In March 1945, upon the invasion of the American and Philippine Commonwealth forces, the withdrawal of the Japanese army into the mountains and the temporary occupation of Bacolod by the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces, the house of Villanueva was then occupied by Major General Rapp Brush, commander of the 40th Infantry Division, known as the &quot;Sun Burst&quot; Division, for approximately five months. The local Philippine military built and established the general headquarters and camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army which was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946. The 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was also active from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and was stationed in Bacolod during and after World War II.

===Independent Philippines===

When the country finally gained independence from the United States, the city&#x27;s public markets and slaughterhouses were rebuilt during the administration of then Mayor Vicente Remitió from 1947 to 1949. In 1948, a fire razed a portion of the records section of the old city hall that consumed the rear end of the building and with it, numerous priceless documents of the city.

Bacolod was classified as a highly urbanized city on September 27, 1984, by the provision of Section 166 and 168 of
the Local Government Code and the DILG Memo Circular No. 83-49.

In January 1985, the original hardwood and coral structure of &quot;Palacio Episcopal&quot; was almost entirely destroyed by a fire. Among the damage of the raging fire were items of significant historical value. The reconstruction of &quot;Palacio&quot; which took more than two years, was completed in 1990.

In 2008, Bacolod topped a survey by &quot;MoneySense Magazine&quot; as the &quot;Best Place to Live in the Philippines&quot;. The city has also been declared by the Department of Science and Technology as a &quot;center of excellence&quot; for information technology and business process management operations. In 2017 &amp; 2019, Bacolod was awarded the &quot;Top Philippine Model City&quot; as the most livable urban center in the country by The Manila Times. In 2021, Bacolod received the &quot;2021 Most Business-Friendly Local Government Unit (LGU) Award&quot; under the category of highly urbanized cities outside the National Capital Region (NCR) in the search organized by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI).

<text>Ghost marks are trademarks which closely simulate ordinary words or phrases used in the course of trade, and which are not intended to be used as genuine trade marks. This is not to be confused with the usage of &quot;ghost brand&quot; to refer to the revival of an abandoned trademark by a new company.

== Examples ==
In the case of &quot;Imperial Group v. Philip Morris&quot; 1982 FSR 72, the plaintiff endeavored to register the trade mark &quot;MERIT&quot; for cigarette products, but was unable to do so on the grounds that the trade mark was too descriptive. Instead, it registered the mark &quot;NERIT&quot;, without any intention of using the mark, but in order to prevent other traders from using the mark &quot;MERIT&quot; because it would be considered too similar to the registered mark &quot;NERIT&quot;. The intention was the obtain a de facto monopoly over the unregisterable mark &quot;MERIT&quot;. 

The defendant began using the mark &quot;MERIT&quot; for cigarettes and was sued by the plaintiff for infringing its mark &quot;NERIT&quot;.

The court struck down the registration for &quot;NERIT&quot; on the basis that the plaintiff had no genuine intention to use the mark (despite some &quot;trivial and insubstantial&quot; efforts at launching a NERIT-branded product).

Prior to the decision in &quot;Imperial Group&quot;, ghost marks were a commonplace tactical procedure for trade mark owners. Ghost marks are now rarely filed following this decision. A somewhat similar protection to that offered by ghost marks are available through the use of defensive trade marks.

<text>Rosalind Hursthouse (born 10 November 1943) is a British-born New Zealand moral philosopher noted for her work on virtue ethics. She is one of the leading exponents of contemporary virtue ethics, though she has also written extensively on philosophy of action, history of philosophy, moral psychology, and biomedical ethics. Hursthouse is Professor Emerita of Philosophy at the University of Auckland and Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

Hursthouse&#x27;s book &quot;On Virtue Ethics&quot; (1999) has been a seminal contribution to the contemporary revival of virtue theory (&quot;aretaic turn&quot;) and is often cited as the definitive exposition of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics, which links morally right action, virtuous character, and human flourishing. Her book has been described by Roger Crisp as &quot;the comprehensive statement modern virtue ethics has been awaiting for forty years.&quot; According to Simon Blackburn, &quot;With this book virtue ethics finally comes of age... This volume will effortlessly take its place as the defining exposition of the view.&quot; Hursthouse has also made significant contributions to current debates on moral status, ethical dilemmas, moral emotions, ethical naturalism, human nature, and practical wisdom.

Hursthouse was a student of Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot, from whom she draws inspiration for much of her work in virtue ethics. Indeed, many consider &quot;On Virtue Ethics&quot; to be the spiritual successor to Anscombe&#x27;s 1958 article &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; as well as Foot&#x27;s manuscript on ethical naturalism, which has since been published as &quot;Natural Goodness&quot; (2001).

==Early life and education==
Rosalind Hursthouse (née Mary Rosalind) was born in Bristol, England on 10 November 1943 to William (Bill) Weldon Oliver Hursthouse (10 July 1914 – 19 April 2017) and Jessie (Jay) Hursthouse (née Jessie E. Simmonds) (19 May 1914 – 26 October 1987), but she and her younger brother, William, grew up in Wellington, New Zealand. She is a member of the notable Atkinson–Hursthouse–Richmond family of New Zealand and a descendant of the Hursthouse family of England, which traces back to the first John Hursthouse who immigrated from Holland in the 1600s.

As a 17-year-old, Hursthouse was inspired to study philosophy by her aunt, Mary Fearon Hursthouse, after an argument at the dinner table. She enrolled the next year at Victoria University of Wellington and then transferred to the University of Auckland, where she earned her BA (1964) and MA (1965) in Philosophy and was subsequently appointed as Junior Lecturer in Philosophy.

In 1966, Hursthouse (as Rosalind Mary Hursthouse) went up to the University of Oxford to read for the BPhil (1968) on a postgraduate scholarship, going on to read for the DPhil (1974) at Somerville College while working as Stipendiary Lecturer in Philosophy at Corpus Christi College, making her the first woman to teach at an all men&#x27;s college in Oxford. While at Somerville, Hursthouse was mentored by Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot, both of whom would become for her lifelong friends and sources of philosophical inspiration.

==Career==
After teaching at the University of Auckland and Corpus Christi College, Hursthouse joined the ranks of the founding faculty of the Open University to work with disadvantaged students and adult learners who had little to no background in philosophy. In 1975, she was appointed as lecturer at the Open University, where she remained for the next 25 years, eventually as Senior Lecturer and as Head of Department (1991–1997). By 1991, Hursthouse had &quot;burst upon the international philosophical scene for the first time&quot; with the following three articles:

While Hursthouse has applied virtue ethics to practical issues in &quot;Beginning Lives&quot; and &quot;Ethics, Humans, and Other Animals,&quot; her most important contribution to philosophy is &quot;On Virtue Ethics.&quot; In the first section, she shows how neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics provides action guidance and illuminates ethical dilemmas. In the second section, Hursthouse offers the first virtue-based account of acting &quot;from a sense of duty,&quot; bringing out the significance of moral emotions. In the third and final section, she considers the question, &quot;Which character traits are the virtues?&quot; This is the most controversial and widely discussed part of her book. Hursthouse&#x27;s answer is that the virtues are the character traits which tend to not only benefit their possessor but also, relatedly, make their possessor a good human being — based, in part, on quasi-scientific &quot;ethical but non‐evaluative beliefs about human nature and how human life goes&quot; (&quot;Plato&#x27;s Requirement on the Virtues&quot;). At the end of her book, Hursthouse says, &quot;Atheists may find it hard to recognise the point nowadays, but believing that human nature is harmonious is part of the virtue of hope. Something at least very like it used to be called belief in (God&#x27;s) Providence; to believe in Providence was part of the virtue of hope; to doubt it is to fall prey to the vice of despair. And that seems to me to be right.&quot; Despite this, she is an atheist.

Since writing &quot;On Virtue Ethics&quot;, Hursthouse has held visiting positions at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California, San Diego, the University of Auckland, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Stanford University, and the University of California, Berkeley (Mills Distinguished Visiting professor in Moral and Intellectual Philosophy and Civil Polity). In 2002, Hursthouse accepted an appointment as Professor of Philosophy at the University of Auckland (serving as Head of department until 2005) in order to return home to New Zealand and be with her aging father. In 2016, she was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and retired from her academic career at the University of Auckland, where she is now Professor Emerita of Philosophy.

<doc id="298863" wikidata="Q3302175" url="?curid=298863" title="Paramount Parks">
<text>Paramount Parks was a subsidiary of National Amusements-owned Viacom, headquartered at its Paramount&#x27;s Carowinds amusement park in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the time of its acquisition, the company owned and operated five amusement park/water parks, which annually attracted 13 million patrons. Viacom assumed control of the company as part of its acquisition of Paramount Pictures in 1994. 

On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair acquired the company, and the deal included a ten-year license to use the Paramount Parks name and theme, and a four-year license to use Nickelodeon names and themes.

Cedar Fair declined to exercise the Paramount licenses and they dropped Paramount and CBS-licensed names from the parks after the 2007 season, but opted to retain Nickelodeon names and themes until after the 2009 season when this license expired.

==Holdings==
The company once owned and operated Paramount&#x27;s Kings Island, Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion, Paramount&#x27;s Great America, Paramount&#x27;s Carowinds, and Paramount Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and managed Bonfante Gardens in Gilroy, California. From late 2001 until late 2004, Paramount Parks also managed Terra Mítica, an amusement park in Benidorm, Valencia, Spain.

==History==
Paramount Communications, previously known as Gulf+Western, in turn had acquired the parks from Nelson Schwab and his management group. Schwab and his KECO Entertainment acquired the group in a management-led LBO from the Taft Broadcasting Company, which had built Kings Island in Cincinnati using rides that were moved from the Coney Island amusement park in Cincinnati, Ohio Taft had just closed.

The parks were part of Viacom&#x27;s Blockbuster Entertainment division until 2002 when they were moved back to Paramount Pictures. After another Viacom corporate shuffle in 2004 the parks became part of Viacom Recreation, a division of Nickelodeon and MTV Networks.

On December 31, 2005, as Viacom went through a corporate split (creating a new version of Viacom and renaming the original company CBS Corporation), Paramount Parks was assigned to CBS Corporation. CBS Corporation, in order to &quot;toss overboard&quot; any unnecessary company assets, sought to sell the parks during the 2006 season, planning to continue their operation until a buyer was found. Cedar Fair, owners of more well known Cedar Point and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm theme parks approached the company in 2006. Within the acquisition, there was a license for ten years of use of the Paramount prefix on the parks and Paramount properties at the former Paramount parks, and a four year license for the use of Nickelodeon names and properties. Cedar Fair opted to remove all mentions of Paramount and Paramount intellectual properties by mid-2007. The only references to a Viacom property remaining were the characters and titles used in Nickelodeon Universe (Kings Island) and Nickelodeon Central (Kings Dominion, Carowinds, Great America, and Canada&#x27;s Wonderland), all of which were rethemed to Peanuts for the 2010 season, to match the children&#x27;s areas of Cedar Fair&#x27;s other parks.

In June 2007, it was revealed that a Paramount Theme Park was to be developed and opened at the Dubailand complex (which itself is currently on hold) in the United Arab Emirates. No further developments were made, and the project was abandoned in 2016.

In October 2011, plans for a new Paramount theme park to be developed in Alhama, Murcia were revealed in Madrid. The resort to be called Paramount Park was to be the second-largest theme park in Europe after Disneyland, Paris. Projects to continue with the construction of the park have been scrapped.

In December 2018, it was announced that Paramount Pictures signed a deal with Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment to install the first Paramount-branded theme park in Incheon, South Korea. It is slated to open in 2025, three years after Inspire Integrated Entertainment Resort&#x27;s opening. Paramount and Daewoo Motor Sales previously announced in 2008 that it will build Paramount Movie Park Korea in Songdo near Incheon, but the plans was never announced due to financial problems of Daewoo Motor Sales.

In December 2019, it was announced that Paramount Pictures with London Resort Company Holdings Paramount-theme in London United Kingdom The London Resort will open in 2024 and start construction in 2021.

== Acquisitions ==
The Paramount Parks were not built by Paramount, but rather were pre-existing and purchased as a whole, rebranded with the Paramount name. Effectively, it seems, Paramount was attempting to enter into the movie-based theme-park business popularized by amusement park and resort companies, such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment, Six Flags Theme Parks, Cedar Fair, Warner Bros. Themed Entertainment and Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Taft Broadcasting created a division called KECO Entertainment (King&#x27;s Entertainment Company), which was formed in order to build theme parks nationwide. In 1972 and 1975, KECO built Kings Island and Kings Dominion respectively. In 1975, KECO led a forced purchase on the Carowinds Corporation, a bankrupt company, leaving them no choice but to sell Carowinds theme park in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1981, KECO opened Canada&#x27;s Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada.

In 1984, hotel company Marriott, owner of two parks named Great America, was looking to divest itself of its parks. One of the parks was located in Silicon Valley in the exurbs of San Francisco and the other was located in the North Shore suburbs of Chicago. The California park was purchased by KECO, while the Illinois Park became part of the Six Flags chain.

In 1992, after 22 years of international operations, KECO Entertainment sold five of their parks to Paramount Communications (which was later purchased by Viacom). The remaining property, Australia&#x27;s Wonderland, was not fully owned by Kings Entertainment and the minor stake they owned was sold to various Australian investor groups as the stake was not opted to be purchased by Paramount. Subsequently, in 1993, the &quot;Paramount&#x27;s&quot; prefix was added to the parks, excluding Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, which was renamed to &quot;Paramount Canada&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, to avoid the use of a double possessive noun. Thus, the first five parks of the Paramount Parks were established: Paramount&#x27;s Kings Island, Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion, Paramount&#x27;s Great America, Paramount&#x27;s Carowinds, and Paramount Canada&#x27;s Wonderland.

In 2000, Paramount Parks purchased the majority of shares in Spanish theme park Terra Mitica (Land of Myth), branding it Terra Mitica: A Paramount Park. In 2004, Viacom dropped its shares in the park, and the name was reverted without the Paramount suffix.

== Theme ==
Paramount Parks were one of the few remaining seasonal park operators to exclusively use themed layouts and rides (a practice usually observed only by annual park operators such as Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences, Six Flags, SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts). This aspect likely helped the parks stand out against other regional competitors such as Cedar Fair (who later purchased the parks), who ran lightly themed amusement parks exclusively.

For example, while Cedar Fair&#x27;s flagship park Cedar Point debuted Wicked Twister and Top Thrill Dragster in 2002 and 2003, respectively, Kings Island opened Tomb Raider: The Ride and Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Mansion. These two attractions, while costing only slightly less than Cedar Point&#x27;s additions, were indoor, highly themed, immersive rides with synchronized musical scores and Hollywood special effects. The same can be said of Paramount&#x27;s last additions to their parks, The Italian Job: Stunt Track, which are family-oriented roller coasters that also feature flames, water, synchronized music, and many movie props.

When Cedar Fair acquired the Paramount Parks, they revolutionized their own season pass system using Paramount&#x27;s as a blueprint, and also absorbed some of Paramount&#x27;s theme-focused entertainment, combining it with their own well-proven thrills to create some of their most famous attractions: Maverick at Cedar Point and Diamondback at Kings Island, among others.

Without the Paramount Pictures film licenses, many of the rides at the Paramount Parks were renamed to more generic names so as not to infringe on Paramount&#x27;s copyrights. Many of these changes were &quot;in name only&quot;, having no actual bearing on the ride&#x27;s appearance. Because of the level of theme involved in Paramount&#x27;s later rides, though, (such as The Italian Job: Stunt Track and Tomb Raider: The Ride) some rides did lose core elements, such as synchronized musical scores, special effects, and pre-shows (thereby eliminating story lines).

* Drop Zone: Stunt Tower was renamed Drop Tower at all five former Paramount parks.
* Top Gun was renamed Afterburn at Carowinds and Flight Deck at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and California&#x27;s Great America. The ride at Kings Island was also first renamed Flight Deck from 2008 to 2013 then renamed The Bat (in honor of a previous suspended roller coaster at the park) in 2014.
* Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed Invertigo.
* The Italian Job: Stunt Track at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island were all renamed Backlot Stunt Coaster.
* Tomb Raider: The Ride and Tomb Raider: FireFall at Kings Island and Kings Dominion respectively were both renamed The Crypt. Both have since been removed as of 2020.
** The roller coaster at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland was renamed Time Warp.
* Days of Thunder go-kart tracks were renamed Thunder Alley.
* Paramount Action-FX Theater was renamed Action Theater.
* The Paramount Theatre was renamed after each park it was located in (e.g. &quot;Kings Island Theatre&quot;).
* BORG Assimilator at Carowinds was renamed Nighthawk.
* Cliffhanger was renamed Riptide at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland.
* Scooby Doo and the Haunted Mansion at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion &amp; Kings Island was renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill with the Scooby Doo theme removed.
* The Nickelodeon and Hanna-Barbera children&#x27;s areas in all of the parks remained dormant until after the 2009 season, when they rethemed to Cedar Fair&#x27;s Peanuts characters, under the name Planet Snoopy. In 2018, Carowinds rethemed their Planet Snoopy area to Camp Snoopy.
* There were two &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; themed lands at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. While Hurler continues to operate at Carowinds, its Kings Dominion counterpart was rebuilt by Rocky Mountain Construction and reopened in 2018 as Twisted Timbers.
Perhaps the most notable change between park owners, Kings Island&#x27;s $20 million indoor Tomb Raider: The Ride had its water effects, lasers, Hollywood lighting, pre-show, synchronized musical score, film props, artificial fog, and flame effects removed. Notably, The Crypt at Kings Dominion, similar to the ride at Kings Island with the exception that it was outdoors, retained all of its original theming, music, film props, lighting, fog, and flames.

== Sale to Cedar Fair ==
On January 27, 2006, the then-newly minted CBS Corporation announced its intent to sell Paramount Parks due to the fact that it did not fit well within the company&#x27;s core business (producing and distributing television content). A number of groups expressed interest in purchasing the company, several placed bids, and on May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion. Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.

==Removal of references==
The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season. After 14 years of operation under Paramount, Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the main parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount&#x27;s prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to Paramount Pictures from all parks.

Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee for all properties besides Nickelodeon as the deal included a four-year license for the latter brand&#x27;s associated names and icons, which was terminated during 2009. The process of removing references to Paramount/CBS properties began in the parks during the beginning of the 2007 season and by the 2008 season most of the major references were completely removed from the parks, besides some minor remnants and logos occasionally found in the park.

==Europe==
On October 10, 2011, it was reported that Paramount would develop a theme park in Murcia, Spain with work set to start in 2012. The $1.5 billion Paramount Murcia park was hoped to rival Disneyland Paris as a European tourist destination. The resort would have featured 30 attractions with an adjacent shopping center, hotels and casino.

Following further set backs such as the death of the promoting companies CEO (Jesus Samper) and a High Court ruling, the construction of this park did not continue, and the area was instead expected to be reclassified for agricultural purposes.

===London Resort===

In the summer of 2017, a deal between Paramount and developer London Resort Company Holdings to build a resort collapsed, partly for the latter&#x27;s wish to work with other media and broadcasting companies alongside Paramount. In June 2019, they relaunched the project, named London Resort and scheduled to open in 2025.

<text>Caraga, officially the Caraga Administrative Region (or simply known as Caraga region) and designated as Region XIII, is an administrative region in the Philippines occupying the northeastern section of Mindanao. The region was created through &quot;Republic Act No. 7901&quot; on February 23, 1995. The region comprises five provinces: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur; six cities: Bayugan, Bislig, Butuan (a highly-urbanized city), Cabadbaran, Surigao and Tandag; 67 municipalities and 1,311 barangays. Butuan, the most urbanized city in Caraga, serves as the regional administrative center.

==Etymology==
Caraga is named after the Kalagan people (Spanish &quot;Caragan&quot;), a Mansakan subgroup (related to Visayans) native to the regions of Davao and parts of Caraga who speak the Kalagan languages. The name itself is from &quot;kalagan&quot; (literally &quot;[strong] spirited&quot;) which means &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;brave&quot;; from &quot;kalag&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;) in the native animistic &quot;anito&quot; religions. Hence, the whole &quot;Provincia de Caraga&quot; of AD 1622 was called &quot;region de gente animosa&quot;, that is &quot;region of spirited folk&quot;.

==History==
During pre-colonial times, the Rajahnate of Butuan ruled in what is now Agusan del Norte and Butuan. It had much influence on all of Caraga, portions of northern Mindanao, and the western side of Bohol. According to records, Butuan was in conflict with the Sultanate of Ternate in present-day Moluccas of Indonesia. The Ternateans would attack and ransack Butuan and its wealth, but Butuan always prevailed. Butuan had friendly relations with the Rajahnate of Cebu which it considered an ally. It became a powerful Hindu state much known for its goldsmithing and boat-making. Its people used gigantic boats known as balangay which carried numerous men. Relics of these gold crafts and giant boats have been unearthed and preserved by the National Museum of the Philippines and other museums. Butuan also had cordial relations with the Kingdom of Champa in what is now central Vietnam. The Butuan people managed to cross the Sulu Sea and the South China Sea to reach Champa for trade. While the Rajahnate of Butuan was at large, the indigenous lumads of the inner sections of Caraga were free and had their own highly advanced democratic societies, known for their knowledge of nature, medicine, mythology, and warfare. Chinese traders eventually came into Butuan and the Sino-Butuan trade became the focal point of Champa-Butuan relations, where the two nations competed against one another for better trade with the Chinese. Eventually, Butuan started to weaken due to massive attacks from Ternate. Cebu was unable to help at the time because it was also being attacked by Ternate. Likewise, the Kedatuan of Dapitan in Bohol, &quot;The Venice of the Visayas&quot;, was also destroyed by an attack from Ternate.

Rajah Siawi and Rajah Kulambo, members of the nobility of the Surigaonon and Butuanon people, respectively, were encountered by the Magellan expedition in 1521 on the island of Limasawa (a hunting ground for the rulers). Antonio Pigafetta describes them as tattooed and covered in gold ornaments. Pigafetta also records the name of the Surigao region as &quot;Calagan&quot;. He also describes the &quot;balanghai&quot; (&quot;balangay&quot;) warships they sailed.
Linguist R. David Zorc suspects that the Tagalogs originated either in the general area of Caraga or Eastern Visayas. He traced the origins and prehistory of the Tagalogs based on linguistic evidence. Tagalog is classified as a Central Philippine language, and is therefore closely related to the Bisayan, Mansakan, and Bikol languages.

When the Spaniards returned and subjugated the Rajahante of Butuan, already weak due to tensions with the Sultanate of Ternate, the boat-making and goldsmithing traditions were eradicated and relations between coastal Butuan and the lumads of the interior became less known. The lumads of the interior were also converted to Christianity, which diminished some of their traditions on nature worship. The Spanish attacked the Sultanate of Ternate to negate any future attacks on Caraga, in which they succeeded, due to their much greater firepower. With the Spaniards having full control of Caraga, they started establishing Spanish-modeled centers to maximize their coverage and control over the territory, in which they succeeded. The Spaniards ruled the country until the United States defeated them in the Spanish-American War which led to the entire archipelago falling into American hands.

The &quot;Kalagan&quot;, called &quot;Caragan&quot; by the Spaniards, occurred in the two provinces of Surigao, the northern part of Davao Oriental and eastern Misamis Oriental. In 1635, Caraga was fortified by 45 additional Spanish soldiers and household heads from Mexico, in 1670 a further 81 soldiers, and in 1672 still another 81. By the end of the 1700s, Caraga had 3,497 native families, protected by a company of Mexican soldiers. The two Agusan provinces were later organized under the administrative jurisdiction of Surigao and became the independent Agusan province in 1914. In 1960, Surigao was divided into Norte and Sur, and in June 1967, Agusan followed suit. While Butuan then was just a town of Agusan, the logging boom in the 1950s drew business to the area. On August 2, 1950, by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 523&quot;, the City Charter of Butuan was approved.

In the early years of the Caraga Region, its inhabitants reportedly came from mainland Asia, followed by Malayans, Arabs, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and Americans. Migrants from the Visayan and Luzon provinces later settled in the area. Most of its inhabitants speak Cebuano and live in rural areas.

On February 23, 1995, the Caraga Region was created through Republic Act No. 7901 in the administration of President Fidel Ramos. The creation of Caraga Region is the revival of the Spanish province of the same name. The provinces of Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Norte (of the former Northern Mindanao region) and Surigao del Sur (of the former Southern Mindanao region) were annexed as part of the newly created region. The purpose of creating Caraga is accelerating social and economic development and delivery and distribution of public services.

==Geography==
Caraga Region, situated in the northeast section of Mindanao, is between 8 00&#x27; to 10 30&#x27; N. latitude and 125 15&#x27; to 126 30&#x27; E. longitude.

==Economy==

From 2001 to 2003, Caraga Region consistently maintained its performance vis-à-vis other regions in Mindanao. Caraga posted a 0.9% growth rate compared to the 9.5% growth rate of Region 12 and the 2.6% growth rate of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Caraga&#x27;s growth rate in 2001–2002 and the 2002–2003 period was the same (0.9%). This was much less than the growth of the population. This performance was better however than the region&#x27;s performance in the 2000–2001 period, where the region&#x27;s economy declined by 1.4%.

The region&#x27;s contribution to Mindanao&#x27;s domestic product is 7.58% in 2003. Caraga has the second lowest per capital income among Mindanao regions and nationwide. In 2003, the region accounted for 1.35% of the country&#x27;s GNP.

===Poverty rate===
Poverty in the region decreased by 1.7% from 44.7% in 1997 to 42.9% in 2000. Another positive development is the increase in the regional annual family income based on the 1997 and 2000 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, which increased by 13.65% from ₱71,7126.00 in 1997 to ₱81,519.00 in 2000. Regional annual family expenditures also posted a 16.65% increase, from ₱61,815.00 in 1997 to ₱72,108.00 in 2000. The average annual savings slipped by 5% from ₱9,911.00 to ₱9,411.00. Poverty incidence data for 2003 is not yet available.

On a national and Mindanao-wide perspective, Caraga Region is one of the most impoverished regions in the country. The region has the fourth highest poverty incidence level of families among all the regions in the country for years 1997 and 2000 while among Mindanao regions, Caraga has the third highest poverty incidence (in terms of incidence of families).

===Gross regional domestic product (GRDP)===
The region performed fairly well in terms of regional output contributing 8.01% in 1998, 8.25% in 1999 and 8.29% in 2000 to the Mindanao GRDP. The region contributed 1.44% in 1998, 1.48% in 1999 and 1.50% in 2000, to the Philippine economy. In terms of growth rate, the region accelerated faster and outpaced the other regions in Mindanao from 1998 to 2000, except for the Southern Mindanao Region which posted a 6.06% increase in 1999–2000. Caraga Region recorded a 5.42% increase during the same period.

GRDP in 2000 amounted to P14.336 billion as against the 1999 performance of P13.599 billion. The deceleration of the region&#x27;s economy from 6.03% in 1999 to 5.42% in 2000 was attributed to the slowdown of the agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) and services sectors. The improved performance of the Industry sector, from 5.69% in 1999 to 6.69% in 2000, cushioned the effects of what could have been a slowdown of the region&#x27;s economy.

From the 1.4% decrease in the GRDP in 2000–2001, the GRDP bounced back in 2001–2002 by a 0.9% growth. The positive trend was maintained in 2002–2003, with the region&#x27;s GRDP growing by 0.9%, the same growth rate from the previous year.

The agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) sector is Caraga&#x27;s banner economic sector, exhibiting an increasing growth trend of 3.8% and 6.8% growth rates in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Despite the decreasing growth trend of the agriculture and fishery subsectors, the sizeable growth rate of the forestry subsector more than compensated for the decrease. The forestry subsector grew by 36.3% in 2003, the highest growth rate for any subsector in the region. Caraga Region has the highest GVA in the forestry subsector among all regions in the Philippines.

The services sector is also one of the bright spots in the region&#x27;s economy. After experiencing a decelerated growth rate in 2002 compared to the previous year&#x27;s 6.1% growth rate, the sector bounced back in 2003 with a 5.6% growth rate. Moreover, the trade subsector continued to be the dominant subsector posting a 5.6%, 6.6% and 6.3% growth rate in 2001 to 2003 respectively. It is significant to note that all the subsectors posted positive growth rates in 2001 and 2003. The transportation, communication and storage sub-sector posted the highest growth rate of 8.4% among the sub-sectors in the services sector.

The industry sector was the worst performing sector of the regional economy with a continuous decline from 2001 to 2003. Although the sector&#x27;s slide slightly decelerated in 2002 (-6.7% in 2002 from -13.3% decline in 2001), it contracted by -12.1% in 2003. The construction subsector had the largest decline of 16.6%, 11.3% and 33.5% in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. The mining subsector also posted negative growth rates but the decreasing trend in this subsector decelerated. The manufacturing offset the decrease in the two sub-sectors by growing at 8.9% in 2003, making it the biggest contributor to this sector. Even with the negative performance of the mining and quarrying sector, Caraga was the second highest producer of metallic minerals, with metallic mineral productions valued at PhP 1.25 billion in 2001 (Philippine Yearbook, 2003).

===Exports and investments===

Investments in the region fell by 25.4% from PhP 6.3 billion in 2002 to PhP 4.6 billion in 2003. All provinces in the region posted a negative growth rate in investments, with Agusan del Sur posting the biggest year-on-year decline of 62.6% for the 2002–2003 period. Agusan del Norte&#x27;s percentage share on investments increased from 64.8% to 79.5% despite an 8.5% decline. Per advice of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-Caraga office, the data on investments are partial at best and is not reflective of the whole investment level in the region. DTI Caraga&#x27;s data does not include public investment figures.

Exports decreased by 19.08% in the 2000–2001 period and 57.52% in 2001–2002. Agusan Norte, Surigao Norte and Surigao Sur posted negative growth rates in the 2000–2001 period, with Surigao Sur posting the biggest decrease in exports (81.31%). In 2002, Agusan Norte posted an impressive 741.04% increase in exports, a harbinger of increased economic activity in the province. Surigao Norte posted the biggest decrease in exports for 2002 (63.17%).

In 2000, the region contributed 1.87% to Mindanao&#x27;s exports; this expanded to 2.68% in 2001 only to decrease to 0.77% in 2002.

===Natural resources===
The region is noted for its wood-based economy, its extensive water resources and its rich mineral deposits such as iron, gold, silver, nickel, chromite, manganese and copper. Its leading crops are palay (rice), banana and coconut.

The region features several beaches, abundant seafood, hot and cold springs, evergreen forests and balmy weather. Caraga&#x27;s most famous attraction today is Siargao Island, a surfing destination in Dinagat Islands.

===Major products===
Major agricultural products of the region include palay, corn, coconut, gold, banana, rubber, oil palm, calamansi, prawns, milkfish, crabs, seaweeds and mango. Caraga&#x27;s proximity to Cebu and Manila makes it a favorable shipping point for products to and from these markets. Nasipit Port can serve as a secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases. With a roll-on, roll-off (RORO) ferry service now in place, Surigao City serves as a vital transportation link for trucks and buses bound for Luzon.

==Environment and wildlife==

The region contains one of the last ecological frontiers of the Philippines. It is home to 12 Key Biodiversity Areas identified by Haribon Foundation and the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The Key Biodiversity Areas include: Mt. Kambinliw and Mt. Redondo in Dinagat Islands which is home to the critically endangered Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat which was recently rediscovered after decades of disappearance, the endangered Dinagat hairy-tailed rat, Dinagat Gymnure which has been declared by the EDGE Species Programme of the Zoological Society of London as one of the top 100 most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species in the world, and a strange sub-species of the Philippine tarsier which is unusually larger and darker in color than the common Philippine tarsier; Siargao Island Protected Landscape and Seascape in Surigao del Norte which is the surfing capital of the country; Carrascal Bay in Surigao del Sur; Consuelo and General Islands in Surigao del Sur; Mt. Hilong-hilong which is shared by Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur and is regarded as one of the most expansive home of the critically endangered Philippine Eagle; Magsaysay in Agusan del Norte; Mt. Kaluayan-Mt. Kinabalian which is shared between Agusan del Sur and Northern Mindanao&#x27;s Bukidnon province; Cagwait in Surigao del Sur; Mt.

==Tourism==
===Surfing===
Siargao, popularly known as the &quot;surfing capital of the Philippines&quot;, hosts an annual international surfing event. The huge &quot;pacific rollers&quot; have been ranked among the top five breaks in the world, including the &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; considered one of the world&#x27;s top surfing waves. Other breaks, which offer exploratory surfing without crowds, are found in the towns of Cantilan, Tandag and Lanuza.

===Islands===
The islets and islands of Guyam, Daku, Naked or Pansukian, La Janosa, Pig-ot, Dinagat, Bucas Grande, Britania and the General Island in Cantilan feature white-sand beaches which are ringed by coral reefs suitable for swimming and snorkeling.

Other attractions include naturally-carved water channels amidst mangrove forests in Barangay Manjagao; the floating village of Barangay Dayasan, the Buenavista Cave; and the tropical white sand beaches in Sagisi island. The Britania in San Agustin-Surigao del Sur features 25 islets and islands of white sand and clusters of limestone hills.

===Mountain-biking===
Biking trails within Kawas, Alabel City, Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte and Siargao play host to cross-country and downhill competitions participated by local and international bikers.

===Trekking===

Mt. Mas-ai and Mt. Hilong-Hilong features panoramic views of the vast lower Agusan Valley. Close to Mt. Mas-ai lies Lake Mainit, the fourth-largest lake in the country, with an area of . Through the years, the lake has been a known lair for pidjanga, tilapia, kasili, banak, haw-an, gingaw, saguyon and igi. Migratory birds, pagosi and tabokali flowers are its intermittent added attractions.

The mangrove forests in Del Carmen form one of the largest contiguous mangrove forests in the Philippines. Sohoton Cave and Lagoon in Bucas Grande Island, which is more than an hour boat ride from Siargao, features limestone formations to a point where one enters a narrow channel which soon becomes a cave.

===Caves===
The limestone karst bedrock of some areas in Surigao and Agusan provinces (particularly in the towns of San Agustin, Tagbina, Lianga, Rosario, and Bislig) features several caves, but none of these are regular destinations for recreational cavers. Located within the towns of Tagbina and Bislig, Banbow and Tatol caves (which are ranked the 6th and 9th longest caves in the Philippines) have recently been declared by the Japanese cave explorers as the third longest cave in the country. Some of the most frequently visited and accessible caves in the region are the Buenavista and Silop Caves in Surigao City and the Libas Cave in Jabonga-Agusan del Norte. These caves have limestone formations and naturally carved stalagmites, stalactites and columns.

===Agusan Marsh===
The Agusan Marsh in Agusan del Sur is one of the biggest wetlands in the country and is host to diverse species of birds.

===Events and festivals===

Festivals include the Naliyagan Festival of Agusan del Sur, Kahimunan, Balangay, Kaliguan Festival of Cagwait in Surigao del Sur, Lisagan and the most famous in the region, the Bonok-Bonok Maradjaw Karadjaw festivals, in honor of its Patron Saint San Nicolas de Tolentino. Surfers from around the world converge in Siargao during the annual international surfing competition.

==Facilities==
The entire region is connected by roads from and to the major commercial, trading and processing centers of Cagayan de Oro and Davao. Butuan is being developed as the regional center with modern facilities and big commercial centers. There are secondary seaports and airports in the region. It has an increasing number of telecommunication facilities and the presence of the Verano Seaport in Surigao City as the major baseport in the region.

==Social development==

===Education and skills development===
The region&#x27;s literacy rate of 93% in 1990 was marginally higher than the National Average of 92.57%. Supporting the education of the region in 1997 were the 1,478 public and 49 private elementary schools, 110 public and 71 private secondary schools, 26 secondary school annexes, and 7 vocational schools.

The region has a total of 49 higher education institutions comprising 45 private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and 4 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). Among the Higher Education Institutions, San Nicolas College (now St. Paul University-Surigao and first university established in the entire region) is identified as the center for development in teacher education and the regional center for Gender and Development, it being the seat of Caraga Women&#x27;s resources center.

The Caraga State University (CSU) formerly known as Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology (NORMISIST), is among the 112 state-funded universities and colleges in the Philippines. It is identified by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as the Center of Development (COD) in Information Technology, COD in Biology, and COD in Mathematics. It is the seat of the Caraga Center for Research in Environmental Management and Eco-governance (CREME), formerly known as the Caraga Center for Environmental Studies and Management (CCESM), which acts as the focal point of capability building and coordination for environmental efforts in the region. The university, through the Caraga Center for Geo-informatics (CCGeo), is also the lead implementing agency of the Geo-SAFER Mindanao (Geo-informatics for the Systematic Assessment of Flood Effects and Risks for a Resilient Mindanao), a research program that utilizes LiDAR data for mapping flood risk areas towards building a resilient Mindanao. CSU is producing Board Topnotchers in Forestry, Geodetic Engineering, Mining Engineering, and Agricultural Engineering, and has strengthened its research and innovation system through the years which resulted to its recent status as a Level IV State University, recognized by CHED as excellent in Teaching and Research.

Father Saturnino Urios University, was founded by Caraga&#x27;s most loved Spanish missionary, Fr. Saturnino Urios S.J. in 1990. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) recognized Father Saturnino Urios University as one of the best schools in the region producing top notchers in national board examinations in Nursing, Engineering, and Accountancy. Its performance in the Licensure Examinations for Teachers (LET) and the Philippine Bar (BAR) is also relatively high. On July 12, 2006, Urios College formally announced its elevation into a university and is now renamed Fr. Saturnino Urios University (FSUU), the first home-grown university in Caraga.

For the school year 1996–1997, the participation rate for public elementary schools was 93.65%. Public secondary schools registered a lower rate, 56%. The teacher-to-pupil ratios for both levels were within the standard of one teacher per 40 pupils. Cohort survival rates were considered low for both the elementary and secondary levels at 66.23% and 68.93%, respectively. For the school year 1996–97, dropout rate at the secondary level was high, especially in Butuan (9.5%) and Surigao Del Sur (7.8%). This can be one of the causes why the majority of the population finished only up to the elementary school level.

===Health and nutrition===

All the vital health indicators from 1992 to 1997 showed a decreasing trend except for maternal mortality rate. The crude birth rate decreased from the 1992–1996 five-year average of 21.02 to 18.71 in 1997. The crude death rate also decreased from 3.60 in the 1992–1996 average to 3.0 in 1997. The infant mortality rate increased from an average of 1.33 in 1992–1996 to 1.56 in 1997.

All of the leading causes of morbidity from 1992 to 1997 were communicable diseases, and showed a reduction in rates for every 1,000,000 population, except for pneumonia (836.30 to 1,200.23), diarrhea (1,059.40 to 1,133.11), influenza (655.36 to 926.74), and malaria (216.80 to 366.5). With regards to the leading causes of mortality, lifestyle-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and cancer top the list, replacing the communicable diseases.

The region is faced with problems of endemic diseases like schistosomiasis and malaria. Although there was a slight reduction in its prevalence for the past three years, still Caraga ranked as number two in schistosomiasis cases and number six in malaria cases nationwide.

Malnutrition rates were posted at 49.25%, of which 34.05% were classified as mildly underweight, 11.66% as moderately underweight, 1.43% as severely underweight and 3.60% as overweight.

Life expectancy for the region, based on the 1995 census, was 65.73 years old for males and 70.98 years old for females.

As of 1997, there were 62 hospitals in the region, of which 35 were government and 27 were private. Out of the 27 private hospitals, 20 were primary, 4 secondary and 3 tertiary. Out of the 35 government hospitals, 18 were primary, 14 were secondary and 3 were tertiary. There were 73 main health centers, 489 barangay health stations staffed by 76 doctors, 147 nurses, 35 medical technologists, 45 dental aides, 52 dentists, 608 midwives and 137 sanitary inspectors. All of these were devolved to the local government units in accordance with the 1991 local Government code.

===Social welfare services===
In 1996, Caraga had 1,619 welfare facilities of which 1,238 were Day care Centers; 8 were Senior Citizens&#x27; Center; 3 were Productivity Skills capability Building for Disadvantaged Women (PSCBDW); and with 1 each were the child Learning and Resource Center, Women Center, Home for the Girls, Regional Rehabilitation Center for Youth, Lingap Center, Balay Silongan, Foster Home for Exploited Children And Women, and Halfway Home for Improved Mental Patients.

On the community-based services, only the PSCBDW is being managed by DSWD while the rest are managed by the LGUs.

===Housing===
The region had unique housing profile in 1990. While other areas complained of housing shortage, a significant number of houses, particularly in Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Norte were vacant. However, available statistics do not give the magnitude of substandard of units to be replaced and current housing backlog. Currently, the cities of Butuan and Surigao and other municipalities are not spared from housing problems, i.e. squatters bought by urbanization.

==Infrastructure==
===Roads and bridges===

Caraga Region has the first and only cable-stayed bridge in the entire Mindanao island, the Macapagal Bridge in Butuan connecting the Butuan Bypass Road over Agusan River.

The region is connected to the major centers of its neighboring regions by the Maharlika Highways that runs from the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Surigao. The provinces are interlinked with concrete roads, except for a very few parts in Surigao del Sur which is still partially concreted in select areas and is on its nearing completion. Total road length of the region runs to 7,515.596 km. Road density was at 0.3988 as of 1995. There were 1,325.558 km classified as national roads in the region and 1,289.774 km of city and provincial roads. The total municipal road length for the region was 696.46 km.

The region had bridges with the combined length of 23,775.49 meters linear. Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur had the longest bridge length 9,288.520 m linear and 7,853.4 m linear, respectively.

A project called &#x27;East-West Lateral Road&#x27; forms part of the total regional connectivity between the Region XIII and Northern Mindanao. It foresees to promote development in different fields such as eco-tourism, agriculture, industry, and domestic trade. It will also provide an accessible route for the remote area settlers, thus uplifting their economic growth.

===Seaports and airports===
As the overland gateway to Visayas and Luzon, the region is accessible by sea through the baseport of Verano Port and Lipata Ferry Terminal in Surigao City that connects the neighboring province of Southern Leyte. Other terminal ports are in Dapa in Siargao, Surigao del Norte, San Jose in Dinagat Islands, Tandag and Bislig in Surigao del Sur and Nasipit Port in Agusan del Norte. Fast craft ferry services used to ply the Surigao City-Cebu City route every day. Private ports can also be found in the different municipalities and cities of the region, however, only three of these 42 ports are operational.

The region is serviced by commercial flights to and from Manila and Cebu through the airports of Butuan, Surigao and Siargao in Surigao del Norte and Tandag Airport in Surigao del Sur. The Bislig Airport used to service commercial flights before its operations were suspended. Proposed airports in Agusan del Sur and Dinagat are being studied if viable for commercial operations. There are six other private owned airports in the region among them is the PHILNICO airport located in Nonoc Island in Surigao City. The ports and airports are supported by the road networks that connect the provinces within and outside the region.

<doc id="298877" wikidata="Q849404" url="?curid=298877" title="Copa Airlines">
<text>Compañía Panameña de Aviación, S.A., branded as Copa Airlines, is the flag carrier of Panama. It is headquartered in Panama City, Panama, with its main hub at Tocumen International Airport. Copa is a subsidiary of Copa Holdings and a member of the Star Alliance. The airline is owned by Copa Holdings, which also owns Colombian airline AeroRepública, which operates under the brands Wingo and Copa Airlines Colombia.

Copa was founded in 1947 and it began domestic operations to three cities in Panama shortly afterwards. The airline abandoned its domestic operations in 1980, in favor of international flights. In 1998, Copa formed a partnership with Continental Airlines, adopting a similar brand image.

== History ==
=== Inauguration ===
On June 21, 1944, Panamanian investors joined forces with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) to launch , soon known simply by its acronym, Copa. Pan Am took a 32% stake in the company. Operations started on August 15, 1947, with three Douglas C-47 aircraft on domestic routes in Panama. The 1960s marked Copa&#x27;s entry into the international arena, offering flights to Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Colombia. Pan Am divested its stake in Copa in 1971, leaving the airline under Panamanian control.

The 1980s saw a strategic shift for Copa as they discontinued domestic flights to focus solely on international travel and acquired its first jet, a Boeing 737-100. Until the early 1980s, the airline had significant competition from Air Panamá Internacional, which had a higher profile.

=== Expansion years ===
Expansion continued during the 1990s, when it began service to Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Bogotá, Colombia; Havana, Cuba; Guayaquil, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; Mexico City, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela; and many other important Latin American cities.

In 1992, Copa Airlines signed a strategic alliance with TACA Airlines (now Avianca El Salvador), and the airline began flying from Tocumen International Airport, making it the first flight connection center in Latin America. As a result, Tocumen was dubbed the “Hub of the Americas,” and several Latin American airlines such as LACSA of Costa Rica, Aviateca of Guatemala, and NICA of Nicaragua joined the alliance. The alliance ended in 1998 when the six-year agreement expired.

A defining moment arrived in 1998 with a significant investment by Continental Airlines. This led to the formation of Copa Holdings, a holding company for Copa Airlines, which was 49% owned by Continental. The investment also included a strategic alliance, fostering code-sharing, marketing initiatives, and technical collaboration. Since then, Copa&#x27;s fleet has grown significantly, boasting 97 aircraft . Copa has adopted a livery and corporate logo similar to Continental&#x27;s (now United). Copa participated in the OnePass frequent flyer program until Continental&#x27;s merger with United Airlines. Continental gradually reduced its ownership, eventually exiting entirely by 2008.

In 2000, Copa Airlines inaugurated service to Los Angeles, Cancún, and Orlando, as well as to São Paulo; in 2001, it began service to Quito, Ecuador. In 2004, it began service to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Copa also announced in August of that year a codeshare agreement with Mexico&#x27;s Mexicana de Aviación, which lasted until 2007.

On June 1, 2005, Copa Airlines acquired 90% of the Colombian domestic air carrier AeroRepública, having earlier announced a codeshare plan with the carrier. Copa rebranded AeroRepública to Copa Airlines Colombia in 2010, increased destinations and modernized the fleet. On December 15, 2005, parent company Copa Holdings, S.A., launched an IPO of 14 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange thus becoming the fourth Latin American airline to be traded on the exchange, after LAN Airlines of Chile and Brazilian carriers Gol Transportes Aéreos and TAM Airlines.

In 2006, Copa Airlines began service to six new destinations: Manaus, Brazil; Maracaibo, Venezuela; Montevideo, Uruguay; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; San Pedro Sula, Honduras; and Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic. In addition, Copa Airlines took delivery of six Embraer 190s and two Boeing 737s. In 2007, Copa Airlines added services to Córdoba, Argentina; Guadalajara, Mexico; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; and Washington, D.C. Copa Airlines added four Embraer 190s and two Boeing 737s (-800 series). That same year, the airline joined the SkyTeam alliance as an associate member.

During 2008, Copa Airlines added five new destinations and received four Embraer 190s and one Boeing 737-800. The new destinations are Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Valencia, Venezuela; Oranjestad, Aruba; and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. In May 2008, Continental Airlines sold its remaining 4.38 million shares of Copa Airlines for $35.75 a share, yielding a net profit of approximately $149.8 million.

That same year, Copa Airlines&#x27; CEO Pedro Heilbron announced on the ALTA airline leaders forum in Cancún that the airline had decided to leave SkyTeam and were in exclusive talks with Star Alliance.

In 2009, Copa Airlines announced it would withdraw from SkyTeam on October 24, the same date that partner Continental Airlines left the alliance. The company added two Boeing 737-800s. and announced a firm order for 13 Boeing 737-800s with the new Boeing signature &quot;Sky Interior&quot;.

In 2010, Copa Airlines began service to St. Maarten, received nine Boeing 737-800s and announced that it would join Star Alliance in mid-2012 to rejoin old partner Continental Airlines (now United). That same year, Copa Airlines announced a firm order to purchase 32 Boeing 737-800 planes valued at $1.7 billion, thus becoming the largest plane order in the airline&#x27;s history. The Boeing 737-800 are set for delivery between 2015 and 2018, with an option to acquire ten additional 737-800 aircraft.

In 2011, Copa Airlines began service to Toronto; Brasília and Porto Alegre, Brazil; Chicago; Cúcuta, Colombia; Montego Bay, Jamaica; Monterrey, Mexico and Asunción, Paraguay; and Nassau, The Bahamas. It also passed from a four bank hub to a six bank hub and increased frequencies to several destinations.

That same year, Copa Airlines launched a mobile version of its website (), giving passengers the chance to get a mobile pass and check flight status and other services. Additionally, the airline announced a new codeshare agreement with TAME, which became effective in January 2012. Copa Airlines also became the first airline in Latin America to have the new Boeing 737-800NG Sky Interior with improved performance in its fleet.

In 2012, the company announced five new destinations: Las Vegas, United States; Recife, Brazil; Willemstad, Curaçao; Liberia, Costa Rica; and Iquitos, Peru. In June of the same year, Copa Airlines became an official member of Star Alliance along with AviancaTaca.

Copa also increased flight frequencies to several destinations and inaugurated an interline agreement with Air Panama (Panama&#x27;s second-largest airline) which consists of the linkage of all tourist destinations in Panama with those in Latin America. The agreement became effective June 1, 2012, when Air Panama began flights from Tocumen airport to Isla Colón, Bocas del Toro.

In 2013, Copa increased the frequency to several destinations and included two new destinations in the United States: Boston and Tampa.

Aviation Partners Boeing (APB) announced on 10 October 2013, that Copa Airlines placed an order to retrofit some of its existing Boeing Next Generation 737s&#x27; blended winglets with APB&#x27;s new split scimitar winglets, as part of its environmental strategy. The new APB winglet technology will save Copa more than $21 million in jet fuel costs fleetwide and more than 63,000 tons of carbon dioxide outputs per year.

In January 2014, Copa Airlines announced three new destinations and revealed its business strategy for the year, which included the delivery of eight new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the increase of flight frequencies to some destinations. The new destinations are Montreal, Canada; Fort Lauderdale, United States and Georgetown, Guyana. In July, it added Campinas, Brazil; and Santa Clara, Cuba. In April 2014, Copa Airlines became the first airline in Latin America and the third in the world to implement the Split Scimitar Winglets on its Boeing 737 NG fleet.

In November 2003, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Panama, Copa Airlines adorned its fleet of Boeing 737-700s with a special livery depicting the official centennial logo and portrait of the first president of Panama, Manuel Amador Guerrero.

On 6 March 2012, a new Copa Airlines Boeing 737-800 (registered HP-1728CMP) carried the Star Alliance livery. Also, it introduced a redesigned font style in the Copa Airlines&#x27; logo. This plane was inactive until 21 June, when it was exhibited in the celebration of the company&#x27;s official integration to Star Alliance. The aircraft began service six days later, making the first scheduled non-stop passenger flight from Panama to Las Vegas.

<text>The little stint (Calidris minuta or &quot;Erolia minuta&quot;) is a very small wader. It breeds in arctic Europe and Asia, and is a long-distance migrant, wintering south to Africa and south Asia. It occasionally is a vagrant to North America and to Australia. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;minuta&quot; is Latin for &quot;small.

==Description==
Its small size, fine dark bill, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints. It can be distinguished from these in all plumages by its combination of a fine bill tip, unwebbed toes and long primary projection. The call is a sharp &quot;stit&quot;.

The breeding adult has an orange wash to the breast, a white throat and a strong white V on its back. In winter plumage identification is difficult. Juveniles have pale crown stripes and a pinkish breast.

An apparent hybrid between this species and Temminck&#x27;s stint has been reported from the Netherlands.

==Population dynamics==
The numbers of this species (and of curlew sandpiper) depend on the population of lemmings. In poor lemming years, predatory species such as skuas and snowy owls take Arctic-breeding waders instead.

It is gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks with other &quot;Calidris&quot; waders, particularly dunlin, on coastal mudflats or the edges of inland pools.

The little stint is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Nesting==
This bird nests on a scrape in bare ground, laying 3–5 eggs. It is polygamous, and males and females may incubate separate clutches.
==Food==
Food is small invertebrates picked off the mud.

<text>The Korean People&#x27;s won, more commonly known as the North Korean won (Symbol: ₩; Code: KPW; ) and sometimes known as the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea won (), is the official currency of North Korea. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;chon&quot;. The currency is issued by the Central Bank of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, based in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Won&quot;, like Japanese yen, is borrowed from Chinese yuan, written Hanja (), which means &quot;round shape&quot;. The won is subdivided into 100 chon ().

== History ==


=== 1947–2009 ===
After the division of Korea, North Korea continued using the Korean yen for two years, until the Central Bank of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea was established on 6 December 1947 and the first North Korean won was issued. In February 1959, the second North Korean won was introduced, equal to 100 old won.

From 1978 on, the North Korean government maintained an iconic rate of 2.16 won to the US dollar (which is said to have been based upon Kim Jong Il&#x27;s birthday, 16 February).
Over the decades, however, rampant inflation eroded the currency&#x27;s value, and from 2001 the government abandoned the rate in favor of those closer to the black market&#x27;s. A report by defectors from North Korea claimed the black market rate was ₩570 to the Chinese yuan (about ₩4,000 per U.S. dollar) in June 2009.

=== 2009 revaluation ===
The third North Korean won was introduced in a revaluation , the first in 50 years. North Koreans were given seven days to exchange a maximum of ₩100,000 (worth approximately US$40 on the black market) in ₩1,000 notes for ₩10 notes, but after protests by some of the populace, the limit was raised to ₩150,000 in cash and ₩300,000 in bank savings. The official exchange rate at this time was around $740, but black market value of the ₩150,000 was estimated to be near $30. The revaluation, seen as a move against private market activity, wiped out many North Koreans&#x27; savings. &quot;The Times&quot; speculated that the move may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to control price inflation and destroy the fortunes of local black market money traders. The announcement was made to foreign embassies but not in North Korean state media.

As part of the process, the old notes ceased to be legal tender on 30 November 2009, but notes valued in the new won were not distributed until 7 December 2009. North Koreans were thus unable to exchange any money for goods or services for a week, and most shops, restaurants and transport services were shut down. The only services that remained open were those catering to the political elite and foreigners who both continued to trade exclusively in foreign currency. The measure led to concerns amongst North Korean officials that the move would result in civil unrest. China&#x27;s Xinhua news agency described North Korean citizens as being in a &quot;collective panic&quot;; army bases were put on alert and there were unconfirmed reports of public protests in the streets in a handful of North Korean cities and towns, forcing authorities to slightly increase the amount of currency people were allowed to exchange. Piles of old bills were also set on fire in separate locations across the country, old paper notes were dumped in a stream (against laws of the desecration of images of Kim Il Sung), and two black market traders were shot dead in the streets of Pyongsong by local police, according to international reports. Authorities threatened &quot;merciless punishment&quot; for any person violating the rules of the currency change.

Pictures of the new notes were published on 4 December 2009 in the &quot;Chosun Shinbo&quot;, a North Korean newspaper based in Japan. The paper claimed that the measure would weaken the free market and strengthen the country&#x27;s socialist system. However, the won plummeted 96 percent against the U.S. dollar in the ensuing days after revaluation. Authorities eventually raised the limit to 500,000 won, &quot;Chosun&quot; reported, and promised no probes into savings of up to one million won, and unlimited withdrawals if savings of more than one million were properly accounted for.

In February 2010, some of the curbs on the free market were eased, and a senior party official was sacked after incidents of unrest. Pak Nam-gi, the director of the Planning and Finance Department of North Korea&#x27;s ruling Workers&#x27; Party, was executed later in 2010. North Korea denied any serious crisis relating to the revaluation.

== Coins ==
=== First Won ===
No coins were issued under the first won of 1947–1959.

=== Second Won ===
The first North Korean coins for circulation were minted in 1959 in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 chon. These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years; however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the Chollima Statue and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of &quot;small change&quot; coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the Grand People&#x27;s Study House were introduced, but did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender.

When the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater convertibility the coins began to lose value. After 2003, these coins were rarely seen in circulation but were still redeemable. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design. All circulation coins of the Second Won were struck in aluminum.

Following other socialist economies like Cuba and China, North Korea developed a special system of marking coins for two groups of foreign visitors. Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the &quot;Pakkundon&quot; convertible series. Coins with no &quot;stars&quot; were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for &quot;socialist visitors&quot;, and coins marked with two stars were designated for &quot;capitalist visitors&quot;. A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word &quot;specimen&quot; or &quot;example&quot; in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen/example set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there is an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them, are sold to foreign numismatists. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.

=== Third Won ===
Coins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002, and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the Kimjongilia and the Kimilsungia, on the reverse of the 10 and 50 chon coins. A magnolia adorns the 1 won coin.

Initially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. The 50 chon and 1 won coins were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon coin was the same size as the old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009, but due to the flawed nature of the revaluation, these coins again have very little value, the 1 and 5 chon coins in particular being virtually irrelevant.

== Banknotes ==

The first banknotes of &quot;North Korea&quot; were issued in 1945 by the Soviet-backed provisional government above the 38th parallel. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.

=== First Won ===
This currency was issued in all-banknote form, with the first banknotes of this issue in denominations of 15, 20, and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. The chon notes had stylized art designs, while the won denominations were fairly uniform in design, featuring a farmer and a worker standing together and holding the symbolic tools. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won to curb the inflation that had occurred as a result of the Korean War.

=== Second Won ===
In 1959, the old won was replaced with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were much larger than the previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the North Korean economy.

In 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il Sung featuring for the first time on the 100 won note.

In 1992, another redesign was carried out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won banknotes were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote that same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1,000 and 5,000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing in colors and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. From 1998 onwards, all notes were dated using the Juche year (Juche year) along with the standard dating.

In 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea issued commemorative 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won notes to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an overprint on its regular issue notes.

In 2007, a commemorative version of this banknote series was released, stamped &quot;Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung&#x27;s 95th Birthday&quot; on all denominations.

Banknotes in circulation for the second won, up to December 2009, were as follows:

=== Third won ===
In 2009, was initiated to tackle hyperinflation and black market activities. Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.

Like the coins for this series, some of the denominations were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation much earlier than 2009 that was never carried out.

The current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 won. Kim Il Sung is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the Magnolia (National Flower) and other notes depicting North Koreans of different professions and various monuments in North Korea. The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.

Unlike all previous series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered in size from smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il Sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early notes or printing materials, resulting in a total redesign of the two denominations in question.

In 2012, another commemorative series of banknotes was released, this time in the 2002–2009 series but similarly stamped &quot;Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung&#x27;s 100th Birthday&quot;. Once again this stamp appeared on all denominations.

In 2018, 1,000 and 2,000 won notes were released with an overprint referencing the 70th Anniversary of its independence.

On 25 July 2014, a new 5,000 won note dated 2013 was released into circulation. Instead of depicting the portrait of North Korea&#x27;s founder Kim Il Sung, the note depicts an image of his birthplace in Mangyondae and on the back the International Friendship Exhibition in Myohyangsan that displays gifts he and his son Kim Jong Il received from foreign leaders. There has been ongoing speculation that this could indicate plans for higher denominations to be released later which would depict Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, or possibly both. However the official reason behind the change was to combat counterfeiters.

=== &quot;Donpyo&quot; emergency currency ===

Lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused shortages in ink and paper used to print regular KPW banknotes, resulting in the issuance in the second half of 2021 of an emergency currency printed with the word &quot;donpyo&quot; (돈표 or &quot;money coupon&quot;). The coupons are in denominations of 5,000 won, printed in red ink, and 50,000 won, printed in green ink, both on white paper of poor quality.

Shortages in regular KPW banknotes after 2020 have also resulted in a premium in their exchange values in the black markets. The &quot;donpyo&quot; is discounted versus regular banknotes at only 3,800-4,000 KPW, and KPW banknotes have even appreciated versus the US dollar from 8,000 KPW to 5,200 KPW/USD.

== Exchange rates ==
The North Korean won is not traded in the international markets. It is traded in the unofficial black markets at around US$1 = 8,000 KPW as of 2019. It is believed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing the (mostly illegal) trading activities with the outside world, the valuation of KPW had risen to around $1 = 5,000 KPW as of 2021. The North Korean won has experienced fluctuations in its exchange rate throughout 2024. Initially, the KPW saw a dramatic increase against the US dollar, trading at approximately 16,100 KPW per dollar, which represented a substantial rise of about 92% over the previous year. However by November 2024, the black market value of the KPW fell to around 18,000 KPW per dollar, indicating a period of hyperinflation. 
== Concurrent use with foreign currencies ==
=== Before 2009 ===
North Korean won are intended exclusively for North Korean citizens, and the Bank of Trade () issued a separate currency (or foreign exchange certificates) for visitors, like many other socialist states. However, North Korea made two varieties of foreign exchange certificates, one for visitors from &quot;socialist countries&quot; which were colored red and hence nicknamed &quot;red won&quot;, and the other for visitors from &quot;capitalist countries&quot; which were colored blue/green and hence known as &quot;blue won&quot;.

For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called &quot;Pakkundon&quot;, meaning &quot;exchangeable money&quot; were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect the value of the national currency in North Korea&#x27;s command economy. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for &quot;socialist visitors&quot; which had a red stamp, and one for &quot;capitalist visitors&quot; which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red Guilloché style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the ₩100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreign visitors to North Korea would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il Sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.

In 1988, the Bank of Trade () (as opposed to the Central Bank) issued two unique series of foreign certificates. They both included 1 chon, 5 chon, 10 chon, 50 chon, ₩1, ₩5, ₩10, and ₩50. The series for &quot;capitalist visitors&quot; was blue-green, while the series for &quot;socialist visitors&quot; was pink. The chon notes had a simple design of patterns and corresponding values, while the socialist won notes depict the International Friendship Exhibition, and the capitalist won notes depict the Chollima Statue.

FECs were used until 1999, then officially abolished in 2002, in favor of visitors paying directly with hard currencies.

=== Since 2009 ===
After the 2009 revaluation, the BBC reported that in some department stores in Pyongyang, the North Korean won was not accepted; the stores take only Japanese yen and U.S. dollars. As of 2018, it had evolved to most North Korean stores accepting U.S. dollars, euros and Chinese yuan/renminbi, with change from transactions primarily returned in renminbi or U.S. dollars.

Foreign visitors (and privileged locals) can buy goods priced in &#x27;tied&#x27; won using a local debit card, which is credited when exchanging foreign currency at the official bank rate of around 104 won/USD or 130 won/EUR (as of 2012). This card can be used for instance at the famous Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes, and is effectively a separate currency and accounting unit for sales involving foreign exchange.

In normal stores and markets, goods are priced in what has been called the &#x27;untied&#x27; won or free market rate which is represented by regular KPW banknotes. At for instance the Tongil Market and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 8,000 KPW/USD or 10,000 KPW/EUR to locals and foreign visitors alike (as of 2012, or 77 times the tied or official rate). The untied KPW is used for prices in normal shops outside restricted state shops/tied won shops.

<text>The South Korean won (Symbol: ₩; Code: KRW; ) is the official currency of South Korea. A single won is divided into 100 jeon, the monetary subunit. The jeon is no longer used for everyday transactions, and it appears only in foreign exchange rates. The currency is issued by the Bank of Korea, based in the capital city of Seoul.

==Etymology==
The old &quot;won&quot; was a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, which were both derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar. It is derived from the hanja (, ), meaning &quot;round&quot;, which describes the shape of the silver dollar.

The won was subdivided into 100 (), itself a cognate of the East Asian unit of weight mace and synonymous with money in general. The current won (1962 to present) is written in hangul only and does not officially have any hanja associated with it.

==First South Korean won==
===History===
The Korean won, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen were all derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar, a coin widely used for international trade between Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries.

During the colonial era under the Japanese (1910–45), the won was replaced by the Korean yen which was at par with the Japanese yen.

After World War II ended in 1945, Korea was divided, resulting in two separate currencies, both called won, for the South and the North. Both the Southern won and the Northern won replaced the yen at par. The first South Korean won was subdivided into 100 &quot;jeon&quot;.

The South Korean won initially had a fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 15 won to 1 dollar. A series of devaluations followed, the later ones, in part, due to the Korean War (1950–53). The pegs were:

The first South Korean won was replaced by the &quot;hwan&quot; on February 15, 1953, at a rate of 1 hwan = 100 won.

===Banknotes===
In 1946, the Bank of Joseon introduced 10 and 100 won notes. These were followed in 1949 by 5 and 1,000 won notes.

A new central bank, the Bank of Korea, was established on June 12, 1950, and assumed the duties of Bank of Joseon. Notes were introduced (some dated 1949) in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 jeon, and 100 and 1,000 won. The 500 won notes were introduced in 1952. In 1953, a series of banknotes was issued which, although it gave the denominations in English in won, were, in fact, the first issues of the hwan.

==Second South Korean won==
===History===
The won was reintroduced on June 10, 1962, at a rate of 1 won = 10 hwan. It became the sole legal tender on March 22, 1975, with the withdrawal of the last circulating hwan coins. Its ISO 4217 code is KRW. At the reintroduction of the won in 1962, its value was pegged at 125 won = . The following pegs operated between 1962 and 1980:

On February 27, 1980, efforts were initiated to lead to a floating exchange rate. The won was finally allowed to float on December 24, 1997, when an agreement was signed with the International Monetary Fund. Shortly after, the won was devalued to almost half of its value, as part of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

===Coins===
Until 1966, 10 and 50 hwan coins, revalued as 1 and 5 won, were the only coins in circulation. New coins, denominated in won, were introduced by the Bank of Korea on August 16, 1966, in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 won, with the 1 won struck in brass and the 5 and 10 won in bronze. These were the first South Korean coins to display the date in the Gregorian calendar, earlier coins having used the Korean calendar. The 10 and 50 hwan coins were demonetized on March 22, 1975.

In 1968, as the intrinsic value of the brass 1 won coin far surpassed its face value, new aluminium 1 won coins were issued to replace them. As an attempt to further reduce currency production costs, new 5 and 10 won coins were issued in 1970, struck in brass. Cupronickel 100 won coins were also introduced that year, followed by cupronickel 50 won coins in 1972.

In 1982, with inflation and the increasing popularity of vending machines, 500 won coins were introduced on June 12, 1982. In January 1983, with the purpose of standardizing the coinage, a new series of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won coins was issued, using the same layout as the 500 won coins, but conserving the coins&#x27; old themes.

The Bank of Korea announced in early 2006 its intention to redesign the 10 won coin by the end of that year. With the increasing cost of production, then at 38 won per 10 won coin, and rumors that some people had been melting the coins to make jewelry, the redesign was needed to make the coin more cost-effective to produce. The new coin is made of copper-coated aluminium with a reduced diameter of , and a weight of . Its visual design is the same as the old coin. The new coin was issued on December 18, 2006.

The 1 and 5 won coins are rarely in circulation since 1992, and prices of consumer goods are rounded to the nearest 10 won. However, they are still in production, minting limited amounts of these two coins every year, for the Bank of Korea&#x27;s annual mint sets.
In 1998, the production costs per coin were: 10 won coins each cost 35 won to produce, 100 won coins cost 58 won, and 500 won coins cost 77 won.

===Banknotes===
The Bank of Korea designates banknote and coin series in a unique way. Instead of putting those of similar design and issue dates in the same series, it assigns series number X to the Xth design of a given denomination. The series numbers are expressed with Korean letters used in alphabetical order, e.g. . Therefore, 1,000 won issued in 1983 is series II () because it is the second design of all 1,000 won designs since the introduction of the South Korean won in 1962.

In 1962, 10 and 50 jeon, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 won notes were introduced by the Bank of Korea. The first issue of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 won notes was printed in the UK by Thomas De La Rue. The jeon notes together with a second issue of 10 and 100 won notes were printed domestically by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation.

In 1965, 100 won notes (series III) were printed using intaglio printing techniques, for the first time on domestically printed notes, to reduce counterfeiting. Replacements for the British 500 won notes followed in 1966, also using intaglio printing, and for the 50 won notes in 1969 using lithoprinting.

With the economic development from the 1960s, the value of the 500 won notes fell, resulting in a greater use of cashier&#x27;s checks with higher fixed denominations as means of payment, as well as an increased use of counterfeited ones. In 1970, the 100 won notes were replaced by coins, with the same happening to the 50 won notes in 1972.

Higher-denomination notes of 5,000 and 10,000 won were introduced in 1972 and 1973, respectively. The notes incorporated new security features, including watermark, security thread, and ultraviolet response fibres, and were intaglio printed. The release of 10,000 won notes was planned to be at the same time as the 5,000 won notes, but problems with the main theme delayed it by a year. Newly designed 500 won notes were also released in 1973, and the need for a medium denomination resulted in the introduction of 1,000 won notes in 1975.

In 1982, the 500 won note was replaced by a coin. The following year, as part of its policy of rationalizing the currency system, the Bank of Korea issued a new set of notes, as well as a new set of coins. Some of the notes&#x27; most notable features were distinguishable marks for the blind under the watermark and the addition of machine-readable language in preparation for mechanization of cash handling. They were also printed on better-quality cotton pulp to reduce the production costs by extending their circulation life.

To cope with the deregulation of imports of color printers and the increasing use of computers and scanners, modified 5,000 and 10,000 won notes were released between 1994 and 2002 with various new security features, which included color-shifting ink, microprint, segmented metal thread, moiré, and EURion constellation. The latest version of the 5,000 and 10,000 won notes are easily identifiable by the copyright information inscribed under the watermark: &quot;&quot; and year of issue on the obverse, &quot;© The Bank of Korea&quot; and year of issue on the reverse.

The plates for the 5,000 won notes were produced in Japan, while the ones for the 1,000 and 10,000 won notes were produced by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation. They were all printed in intaglio.

==New security features==
In 2006, it became a major concern that the South Korean won banknotes were being counterfeited. This led the government to issue a new series of banknotes, with the 5,000 won note being the first one to be redesigned. Later in 2007, the 1,000 and 10,000 won notes were introduced.

On June 23, 2009, the Bank of Korea released the 50,000 won note. The obverse bears a portrait of Shin Saimdang, a prominent 16th-century artist, calligrapher, and mother of Korean scholar Yulgok, also known as Yi I, who is on the 5,000 won note. This note is the first Korean banknote to feature the portrait of a woman. The release of the 50,000 won note stirred some controversy among shop owners and those with visual impairments due to its similarity in color and numerical denomination with the 5,000 won note.

New 100,000 won notes were also announced, but their release was later cancelled due to the controversy over the banknote&#x27;s planned image, featuring the Daedongyeojido map, and not including the disputed Dokdo islands. Also of controversy was the appearance of Kim Ku on the note, who is controversial among the South Korean right.

The banknotes include over 10 security features in each denomination. The 50,000 won note has 22 security features, the 10,000 won note 21, the 5,000 won note 17, the 2,000 won note 10 and the 1,000 won note 19. Many modern security features that can be also found in euros, pounds, Canadian dollars, and Japanese yen are included in the banknotes.
Some security features inserted in won notes are:
* Holograms with three-dimensional images that change colors within the metallic foil on the obverse side of the notes (except ₩1,000)
* Watermark portraits of the effigy of the note are visible when held to the light in the white section of the note.
* Intaglio printing on words and the effigy give off a raised feeling, different from ordinary paper
* Security thread in the right side of the obverse side of the note with small lettering &quot; Bank of Korea&quot; and its corresponding denomination
* Color-shifting ink on the value number at the back of the note:
For the first time in the world, KOMSCO, the Korean mint, inserted a new substance in the notes to detect counterfeits. This technique is being exported, such as to Europe and North America.

==Future==

===Coinless trials===
As the South Korean economy is evolving through the use of electronic payments, coins of the South Korean won are becoming less used by consumers. The Bank of Korea began a trial which would result in the total cessation of the production of coins by depositing change into prepaid cards. As of 2019, however, public participation in this program has decreased.

===Redenomination proposals===
There have been recurring proposals in the South Korean National Assembly to redenominate the won by introducing a new won or new unit, equal to 1,000 old won, and worth nearly one U.S. dollar. While proponents cite a more valuable currency unit better projects the strength of the nation&#x27;s economy, a majority remain opposed to the idea. Reasons cited are: economic harm if done immediately, no issues on public confidence in the won and its inflation rate, limited cost savings, and the presence of more urgent economic issues.

==Currency production==
The Bank of Korea is the only institution in South Korea with the right to print banknotes and mint coins. The banknotes and coins are printed at the KOMSCO, a government-owned corporation, under the guidance of the Bank of Korea.
After the new banknotes and coins are minted, they are bundled or rolled and shipped to the headquarters of the Bank of Korea. When delivered, they are deposited inside the bank&#x27;s vault, ready to be distributed to commercial banks when requested.
Every year, around Seollal and Chuseok, two major Korean holidays, the Bank of Korea distributes large amounts of its currency to most of the commercial banks in South Korea, which are then given to their customers upon request.

<text>Soccsksargen (officially stylized in all caps; ), formerly known as Central Mindanao, is an administrative region of the Philippines, designated as Region XII. Located in south-central Mindanao, its name is an acronym that stands for the region&#x27;s four provinces and one highly urbanized city ([[Soccsksargen|So]]uth [[Soccsksargen|C]]otabato, [[Soccsksargen|C]]otabato, [[Soccsksargen|S]]ultan [[Soccsksargen|K]]udarat, [[Soccsksargen|Sar]]angani and [[Soccsksargen|Gen]]eral Santos). The regional center is in Koronadal, located in the province of South Cotabato, and the center of commerce and industry is General Santos, which is the most populous city in the region.

==Geography==
The region is bounded on the north by the province of Bukidnon in Northern Mindanao, on the east by the Davao Region, on the northwest and west by the Bangsamoro region, and on the southwest by the Celebes Sea. The region also shares a maritime border with Gorontalo and North Sulawesi provinces of Indonesia.

The region has extensive coastlines, valleys and mountain ranges. Known for its river system, the region is the drainage basin of Mindanao, particularly at the Cotabato Basin, a large depression surrounded by mountain ranges on three sides. Within the basin runs the Rio Grande de Mindanao, the longest river in Mindanao and the second longest in the Philippines. The river empties into Illana Bay of the larger Moro Gulf to the west of Cotabato City.

At the south of the basin lie the Tiruray Highlands, a moderately high mountain range blocking the basin from the southern coastline. Southeast of the mountains lies Sarangani Bay.

===Administrative divisions===
====Provinces====
Soccsksargen comprises 4 provinces, 1 &quot;highly urbanized&quot; city, 3 &quot;component&quot; cities, 45 municipalities and 1,195 barangays.

=====Governors and vice governors=====
===Cities===
====Component cities====
* Kidapawan — the only city of Cotabato province
* † Koronadal — the political regional center of Soccsksargen
* Tacurong — only city of Sultan Kudarat

====Highly urbanized city====
* &quot;General Santos&quot; — a highly urbanized city, it serves as the center of the Metropolitan and Regional Center for trade and industry of Soccsksargen.


==History==
The oldest civilization in the region is located in Maitum, Sarangani, where the Maitum Anthropomorphic Pottery were found. The jars have been declared as National Cultural Treasures, and are subject to the high protections ensured by Philippine and international laws.

From around 14th century until the early 20th century, the Muslim sultanates of Maguindanao and Buayan dominated the large parts of Soccsksargen region, influencing the local datus in the area as well as having General Santos City under their direct control as a port. 

===Central Mindanao===
The region used to be named &quot;Central Mindanao&quot;. Prior to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), it comprised the following provinces:
* Maguindanao
* North Cotabato
* Sultan Kudarat
* Lanao del Norte
* Lanao del Sur

With the creation of ARMM, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao (excluding Cotabato City), and Sultan Kudarat were removed from the region, leaving Lanao del Norte and Cotabato, and Iligan, Marawi and Cotabato City as constituent provinces and cities. Lanao del Norte and Iligan were later transferred to Northern Mindanao, while Marawi became part of the ARMM.

On December 18, 1998, Sultan Kudarat was transferred back to Central Mindanao through Republic Act No. 8744.

===Soccsksargen===
In September 2001, &quot;Executive Order No. 36&quot; was signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo transferring South Cotabato, Sarangani, General Santos (also known as the &quot;SocSarGen&quot; District), from Southern Mindanao to Region XII, and renaming the region, from &quot;Central Mindanao&quot;, to &quot;Soccsksargen&quot;.

===Koronadal as new regional center===
By virtue of Executive Order No. 304 signed by then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Koronadal was named as the regional political and socio-economic center of Soccsksargen on March 30, 2004. Regional departments, bureaus and offices were ordered to move from Cotabato City, the former regional center of the region.

===Special Cotabato barangays and Cotabato City exit===
Traditionally resisting efforts for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite serving as the government center of the ARMM, the January 21, 2019 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region creation plebiscite resulted in the surprise ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law in Cotabato City. This means the city may now formally serve as the capital of the region and the offices of the former ARMM will be retained for use by the Bangsamoro Regional Government and now formally no longer constitutes part of the Soccsksargen Region.

In addition to Cotabato City, 63 barangays in Cotabato province opted to join Bangsamoro, thus exiting the region as well.

==Demographics==
Soccsksargen is home to diverse ethnolingustic and cultural backgrounds, both native and non-native residents, making it a melting pot of cultures. The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous B&#x27;laans, T&#x27;bolis, Manobos, Tedurays and the Muslim Iranuns and Maguindanaons – large parts of the region itself historically were part of the Maguindanao and Buayan sultanates. Christian migrants from Luzon and Visayas (and their native-born descendants) also settled in the area by the early 20th century seeking better opportunities, mainly from agriculture. Most of these non-native settlers mainly came from Ilocandia, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol and Siquijor who call Soccsksargen and Mindanao as a whole their new home and are responsible for spreading Christianity throughout the region over the years. Today, Hiligaynons make up the majority of the region&#x27;s non-native Christian population; while the Cebuanos dominantly inhabit the entirety of Sarangani, General Santos and its neighboring municipalities of South Cotabato and the areas in the region that border Bukidnon and Davao Region; and Ilocanos who form the majority in Kabacan (North Cotabato), Tampakan, Tantangan (both in South Cotabato), Lambayong, Senator Ninoy Aquino, President Quirino, Columbio (all in Sultan Kudarat) and Kiamba (Sarangani, though most of the municipality&#x27;s inhabitants now spoke Cebuano instead of Ilocano). Moreover, intermarriage between ethnolinguistic groups is relatively not uncommon in Soccsksargen. 

==Economy==
The region contributes to the national GDP with 2.6% with 5% growth compared to 2016. 18.3% of Mindanao Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP).
In the most recent contest during the 2024 Philippine Coffee Quality Competition, it showcased Region 12&#x27;s development as a dominant force in coffee quality. Renowned for its superb beans, the region wowed both enthusiasts and experts with its distinct flavors, superior farming techniques, and commitment to quality. The event demonstrated Region 12&#x27;s ability to produce coffee that stands out in both national and international markets, establishing its position as a premier producer of high-quality coffee. This newfound reputation promises to raise the region&#x27;s prominence in the coffee industry, attracting more buyers and lovers from around the world.

==Musical heritage==
The artistic cultural heritage of the native Maguindanao people, among other regional groups—both Muslims and Catholics—revolves around &quot;kulintang&quot; music, a specific type of gong music. Unique to the Soccsksargen, elements of kulintang may be loosely compared to Indonesia’s &quot;gamelan&quot; music, and other related traditional performance arts.

==Government==
* Cotabato – Gov. Nancy A. Catamco (PDP-Laban)
* South Cotabato – Gov. Reynaldo S. Tamayo Jr. (Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP)
* Sultan Kudarat – Gov. Datu Suharto &quot;Teng&quot; T. Mangudadatu (NUP)
* Sarangani – Gov. Ruel D. Pacquiao (PCM)
* General Santos (HUC) – Mayor Lorelie &quot;Lor&quot; Pacquiao

<text>The IBM RS64 is a family of microprocessors introduced in the mid 1990s, and used in IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 and AS/400 servers.

These microprocessors implement the &quot;Amazon&quot;, or &quot;PowerPC-AS&quot;, instruction set architecture (ISA). Amazon is a superset of the PowerPC instruction set, with the addition of special features not in the PowerPC specification, mainly derived from POWER2 and the original AS/400 processor, and has been 64-bit from the start. The processors in this family are optimized for commercial workloads (integer performance, large caches, frequent branches) and do not feature the strong floating point performance of the processors in the POWER family, its sibling.

The RS64 family was phased out soon after the introduction of the POWER4, which was developed to unite the RS64 and POWER families.

==History==
In 1990, the AS/400 engineering team at IBM Rochester began work on a new architecture known as &quot;C-RISC&quot; (Commercial RISC) to replace the IMPI architecture of the AS/400. C-RISC was an evolution of the IMPI instruction set, extending the address space to 96 bits and adding some RISC instructions to speed up the more computationally intensive commercial applications that were being created for AS/400s. IBM president Jack Kuehler wanted them to use PowerPC, but they resisted, arguing that the existing 32/64-bit PowerPC instruction set would not enable a viable transition for OS/400 software and that the existing instruction set required extensions for the commercial applications on the AS/400. At Kuehler&#x27;s insistence, a team at Rochester led by Frank Soltis investigated the feasibility of extending the PowerPC instruction set to support the needs of the AS/400 platform. These extensions became known as Amazon and were selected by IBM executive management for further development over continued development of C-RISC.

At the same time, the RS/6000 developers were broadly expanding their product line to include systems which spanned from low-end workstations, to mainframe-competitor large enterprise SMP systems, to clustered RS/6000-SP2 supercomputing systems. PowerPC processors developed in the AIM alliance suited the low-end RISC workstation and small server space well. But mainframe and large clustered supercomputing systems required more performance and reliability, availability and serviceability features than processors designed for Apple Power Macs. Multiple processor designs were required to simultaneously meet the requirements of the cost-focused Apple Power Mac, high-performance and RAS RS/6000 systems, and the AS/400 transition to PowerPC.

Amazon was extended to support those features as well, so that processors could be designed for use in both high-end RS/6000 and AS/400 machines.

The project to develop the first such processor was &quot;Bellatrix&quot; (the name of a star in the Orion constellation, also called the &quot;Amazon Star&quot;). The Bellatrix project was extremely ambitious in its pervasive use of self-timed &amp; pulse-based circuits and the EDA tools required to support this design strategy, and was eventually terminated. To address technical workstation, supercomputer, and engineering/scientific markets, IBM Austin (the home of the RS/6000s) then started developing a time-to-market single-chip version of the Power2 (P2SC) in parallel with the development of a sophisticated 64-bit PowerPC processor with the POWER2 extensions and twin sophisticated MAF floating-point units (the POWER3/630). To address RS/6000 commercial applications and AS/400 systems, IBM Rochester (the home of the AS/400s) started developing the first of the high-end 64-bit PowerPC processors with AS/400 extensions, and IBM Endicott started developing a low-end single-chip PowerPC processor with AS/400 extensions.

==Cobra and Muskie==

In 1995, IBM released the Cobra, or A10 processor, the first full implementation of PowerPC AS, for the IBM AS/400 systems. It was a single-chip processor running at 50-77 MHz. It was designed with a semi-custom methodology, as a consequence of time-to-market constraints. The die contains 4.7 million transistors and measures 14.6 mm by 14.6 mm (213 mm2). It was fabricated by IBM in their CMOS 5L process, a 0.5 μm, four-layer-metal CMOS process. It used a 3.0 V power supply and dissipated 17.7 W maximum, 13.4 W minimum at 77 MHz. It was packaged in a 625-contact ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) that measured 32 mm by 32 mm.

Cobra was preceded by a simplified implementation known as Cobra-Lite in 1994, which was used in the first IBM Advanced/36 systems. It lacked 17 instructions from the full PowerPC AS ISA which were not needed for the Advanced/36.

In 1996, IBM released the high-end, 4-way SMP, multi-chip version called Muskie, A25 or A30 in AS/400 systems. It ran at 125-154 MHz. It was manufactured on a BiCMOS fabrication process.

These processors were only used in AS/400 and Advanced/36 machines.

==RS64==

The RS64 or Apache was introduced in 1997. It was developed from &quot;Cobra&quot; and &quot;Muskie&quot; but included a more complete PowerPC ISA and was therefore set to be used in RS/6000 machines as well as in AS/400 systems. It featured 128 KB total on-die L1 cache, 4 MB full speed off-chip L2 on a 128-bit bus, and a clock of 125 MHz. It scaled to a 12-processor SMP configuration in IBM&#x27;s machines.

RS64 was called A35 in AS/400 and was one time referred to as the PowerPC 625, between the defunct PowerPC 620 and the PowerPC 630 (later renamed POWER3).

It was manufactured with a BiCMOS fabrication process.

==RS64-II==

The RS64-II or Northstar was introduced at 262 MHz in 1998 with 8 MB of full speed L2 on a 256 bit 6XX bus (also used in PowerPC 620 and POWER3). Processor boards containing 4 RS64-II&#x27;s could be swapped into machines designed for similar 4-way RS64 boards, avoiding a &quot;fork lift upgrade&quot;. The RS64-II contained 12.5 million transistors, was 162 mm² large and drew 27 watts maximum power. Manufacturing changed to a 0.35 μm CMOS fabrication.

RS64-II was the first mass-market processor to implement multithreading. Essentially, each chip stores state information for 2 threads at any given time and appears to be two processors to the OS. One logical processor runs what is called the foreground thread. When this thread encounters a high-latency event (L2 cache miss, etc.) the background thread is switched to, on the second logical processor from the OS&#x27;s point of view. In the event of a &quot;less long&quot; latency event (L1 miss, etc.), thread switching will only occur if the background thread is ready to execute. If the background thread is also waiting for a miss, thread switching will not occur. IBM calls this scheme &quot;coarse grained multithreading&quot;. It is not exactly the same thing as simultaneous multithreading as found on later Pentium 4 processors. An IBM paper notes that the coarse grained scheme is a better fit for an in-order microarchitecture like RS64.

RS64-II was called A50 in AS/400 systems.

==RS64-III==

The RS64-III or Pulsar was introduced in 1999 at 450 MHz. Key changes included larger 128 KiB L1 instruction and data caches, improved branch prediction accuracy and reduced branch misprediction penalties of zero or one cycle. The RS64-III has a five-stage pipeline and a 256-bit wide L2 cache bus, which provided the processor with 14.4 GB/s of bandwidth from the 8 MiB L2 cache, implemented with 225 MHz DDR SRAMs.

The RS64-III has 34 million transistors, a die size of 140 mm², and is manufactured on the 0.22 μm CMOS 7S process with six levels of copper interconnect.

In 2000, IBM launched a refined version called IStar manufactured with a SOI fabrication process with copper interconnects, which increased the processor&#x27;s clock frequency to 600 MHz. This was the first processor implemented in this process. Architecturally however, the IStar was identical to Pulsar.

==RS64-IV==

The RS64-IV or Sstar was introduced in 2000 at 600 MHz, later increased to 750 MHz. Up to 16 MB DDR L2 cache was supported in the same manner as the RS64-III (19.2 GB/s bandwidth). The RS64-IV had 44 million transistors and was 128 mm² large manufactured on a 0.18 μm process. Unlike POWER, energy consumption remained low, at under 15 watts per core.

For a time, while the POWER line stagnated at half the clock speed of its competitors, the RS64 family was at the top of the IBM large SMP UNIX server line. The integer / commercial workload performance of the RS-64 IV was similar to the Sun Microsystems processors with which it competed, though its floating point power was not comparable to the contemporary POWER3-II, which remained reasonably competitive throughout its lifecycle.

<text>Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen (13 January 191123 April 2005) was an Australian politician and farmer who served as premier of Queensland between 1968 and 1987, for almost 20 years, as state leader of the National Party (earlier known as the Country Party). 

Bjelke-Petersen was born in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island to Danish immigrant parents. His family moved back to Australia when he was a child and settled on farming property near Kingaroy, Queensland. He left school at the age of 14 and went into farming. Bjelke-Petersen was elected to the Kingaroy Shire Council in 1946 and to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the 1947 state election. He would serve in state parliament for over 40 years, holding the seats of Nanango (1947–1950) and Barambah (1950–1987).

Bjelke-Petersen was appointed as a government minister in 1963 and succeeded as premier and Country Party leader in 1968 following the death of Jack Pizzey. He would lead the party to seven consecutive election victories, governing in coalition with the Liberal Party until 1983. His first three electoral victories saw his party benefit from a system of rural malapportionment later nicknamed the &quot;Bjelkemander&quot;, which allowed him to remain premier despite frequently receiving a smaller number of votes than the state&#x27;s two other major parties. The system earned Bjelke-Petersen the nickname &quot;the Hillbilly Dictator&quot;. Regardless, he was a highly popular figure among conservative voters and over the course of his 19 years as premier he tripled the number of Country/National voters and doubled the party&#x27;s percentage vote. After the Liberal Party pulled out of the Coalition government in 1983, Bjelke-Petersen reduced his former partners to a mere eight seats in an election held later that year. In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen launched a campaign to move into federal politics to become prime minister, though the campaign was eventually aborted.

Bjelke-Petersen earned himself a reputation as a &quot;law and order&quot; politician with his repeated use of police force against street demonstrators and strongarm tactics with trade unions, leading to descriptions of Queensland under his leadership as a police state. Starting in 1987, this administration came under the scrutiny of a royal commission into police corruption and its links with state government ministers. Bjelke-Petersen was unable to recover from the series of damaging findings and after initially resisting a party vote that replaced him as leader, retired from politics on 1 December 1987. Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke-Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict as the jury foreman was a member of the Young Nationals and a member of the &quot;Friends of Joh&quot; group, and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial.

During the Bjelke-Petersen era the state underwent considerable economic development. He was one of the most well-known and controversial figures of 20th-century Australian politics because of his uncompromising conservatism (including his role in the downfall of the Whitlam federal government), political longevity, and the institutional corruption of his government.

==Early life==
Bjelke-Petersen was born on 13 January 1911 in Dannevirke, a town in the North Island of New Zealand. He was the second of three children born to Maren () and Carl George Bjelke-Petersen. His parents were both Danish emigrants to Australia; his mother had arrived in Queensland as a child while his father moved to Australia as a young man. His father&#x27;s siblings included prominent novelist Marie Bjelke-Petersen and physical culture advocate Christian Bjelke-Petersen.

Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s parents had moved from Queensland to New Zealand in 1903, where his father, a Lutheran minister, was posted to the originally Scandinavian settlement of Dannevirke. The family returned to Australia in 1913 to aid his father&#x27;s health, settling on a farming property named &quot;Bethany&quot; near Kingaroy, Queensland. Bjelke-Petersen was raised in a conservative religious household, with the Sabbath strictly observed and daily Bible readings; his mother ran a Sunday school from the family home. At their father&#x27;s insistence, he and his siblings were raised speaking Danish as their home language, something atypical of Scandinavian immigrants in Australia who more often rapidly adopted English.

The young Bjelke-Petersen suffered from polio, leaving him with a lifelong limp. The family was poor, and his father was frequently in poor health. Bjelke-Petersen left formal schooling at age 14 to work with his mother on the farm, though he later enrolled in correspondence school and undertook a University of Queensland extension course on the &quot;Art of Writing&quot;. He taught Sunday school, delivered sermons regularly in nearby towns and joined the Kingaroy debating society.

In 1933, Bjelke-Petersen began work land-clearing and peanut farming on the family&#x27;s newly acquired second property. His efforts eventually allowed him to begin work as a contract land-clearer and to acquire further capital which he invested in farm equipment and natural resource exploration. He developed a technique for quickly clearing scrub by connecting a heavy anchor chain between two bulldozers. By the time he was 30, he was a prosperous farmer and businessman. Obtaining a pilot&#x27;s licence early in his adult life, Bjelke-Petersen also started aerial spraying and grass seeding to further speed up pasture development in Queensland.

After failing in a 1944 plebiscite against the sitting member to gain Country Party endorsement in the state seat of Nanango, based on Kingaroy, Bjelke-Petersen was elected in 1946 to the Kingaroy Shire Council, where he developed a profile in the Country Party. With the support of local federal member and shire council chairman Sir Charles Adermann and state opposition leader Sir Frank Nicklin, he gained Country Party endorsement for Nanango and was elected a year later at age 36, going on to give regular radio talks and becoming secretary of the local Nationals branch. He would hold this seat, renamed Barambah in 1950, for the next 40 years. The Labor Party had held power in Queensland since 1932 and Bjelke-Petersen spent eleven years as an opposition member.

==Rise to power==

On 31 May 1952, Bjelke-Petersen married typist Florence Gilmour, who would later become a significant political figure in her own right.

In 1957, following a split in the Labor Party, the non-Labor parties came to power for the first time in 32 years and only the second time in 42 years. Nicklin became premier, with the Liberal Party as junior partner in a non-Labor Coalition. This was a reversal of the situation at the national level. At the federal level and in most states where a Coalition existed in the normal sense, the Liberals were the senior partner in the Coalition. However, Queensland, then as now, was Australia&#x27;s least centralised mainland state; the provincial cities between them have more people than the Brisbane area. In these areas, the Country Party was stronger than the Liberal Party. As a result, the Country Party had historically won more seats than its urban counterpart, and had been senior partner in the Coalition (until the parties merged) since 1925.

In 1963 Nicklin appointed Bjelke-Petersen as minister for works and housing, a portfolio that gave him the opportunity to bestow favours and earn the loyalty of backbenchers by approving construction of schools, police stations and public housing in their electorates. At various times, he also served as acting minister for education, police, Aboriginal and Island Affairs, local government and conservation and labour and industry. He would serve in cabinet without interruption until his retirement in 1987. Only Thomas Playford IV, who served in the South Australian cabinet without interruption from 1938 to 1965, served longer as a federal or state cabinet minister.

==Premiership (1968-1987)==
Nicklin retired in January 1968 and was succeeded as Premier and Country Party leader by Jack Pizzey; Bjelke-Petersen was elected unopposed as deputy Country Party leader. On 31 July 1968, after just seven months in office, Pizzey suffered a heart attack and died. Deputy Premier and Liberal leader Gordon Chalk was sworn in as caretaker premier until the Country Party could elect a new leader, with Bjelke-Petersen as deputy premier. The Country Party had 27 seats in Parliament; the Liberals had 20. Nonetheless, there was some dispute over whether the Liberals should take senior status, which would have made Chalk premier in his own right. Matters were brought to a head when Bjelke-Petersen—elected Country Party leader within days of Pizzey&#x27;s death—threatened to pull the Country Party out of the Coalition unless he became Premier. After seven days Chalk accepted the inevitable, and Bjelke-Petersen was sworn in as Premier on 8 August 1968. He remained Police Minister.

===First Ministry and conflict of interest===

Within months of becoming premier, Bjelke-Petersen encountered his first controversy over allegations of conflict of interest. In April 1959, while still a backbencher, he had paid £2 for an Authority to Prospect, giving him the right to search for oil over near Hughenden in far north Queensland. The next month he incorporated a company, Artesian Basin Oil Co. Pty Ltd, of which he was sole director and shareholder, and the same day entered an agreement to sell 51% of the company&#x27;s shares to an American company for £12,650. The following day he sought the consent of Mines Minister Ernie Evans to transfer the oil search authority to Artesian for £2; the consent was given a week later.

When the Taxation Commissioner ruled that the £12,650 windfall from the £2 authority was a taxable profit, Bjelke-Petersen appealed, eventually taking the matter to the High Court. The appeal was dismissed, with Justice Taylor ruling that Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s six million percent gain from the £2 authority arose from &quot;a profit-making undertaking&quot;. In 1962 Artesian transferred its Authority to Prospect to a new company, Exoil NL, for £190,000, and Bjelke-Petersen in turn bought a million shares in Exoil.

On 1 September 1968, three weeks after becoming premier, Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s government gave two companies, Exoil NL and Transoil NL—in both of which he was a major shareholder—six-year leases to prospect for oil on the Great Barrier Reef north of Cooktown. Opposition Leader Jack Houston revealed the Premier&#x27;s financial involvement in the companies at a press conference in March 1969, where he asserted Bjelke-Petersen had gained &quot;fabulous wealth&quot; from the £2 prospecting authority, which had now mushroomed into Exoil shares worth AU$720,000. Bjelke-Petersen said he had done nothing wrong, but resigned his directorship of Artesian in favour of his wife.

The Country-Liberal coalition was returned to power at the 1969 Queensland election, with the state&#x27;s system of electoral malapportionment delivering the Country Party 26 seats—a third of the parliament&#x27;s 78 seats—from 21.1% of the primary vote, the Liberals taking 19 seats from 23.7% of the vote and the Labor Party&#x27;s 45.1% share of the vote leaving it with 31 seats.

Further controversy followed. In June 1970 it was revealed that a number of Queensland government ministers and senior public servants, as well as Florence Bjelke-Petersen, had bought shares in the public float of Comalco, a mining company that had direct dealings with the government and senior ministers. The shares finished their first day of trading at double the price the ministers had paid. Bjelke-Petersen again rejected claims of a conflict of interest, but the Country Party state branch changed its policy to forbid the acceptance of preferential share offers by ministers or members of parliament.

In October, the Country Party lost a by-election in the Gold Coast seat of Albert, prompting several nervous MPs to make plans to oust Bjelke-Petersen and replace him with deputy leader Ron Camm. Bjelke-Petersen spent the night and the next morning calling MPs to bolster support, surviving a party room vote by a margin of one, after producing a proxy vote of an MP who was overseas and uncontactable. Plans by dissident Country Party members to support a Labor vote of no confidence on the floor of the legislature were quashed after the intervention of party president Robert Sparkes, who warned that anyone who voted against Bjelke-Petersen would lose Country Party preselection at the next state election.

===1971 state of emergency===
Bjelke-Petersen seized on the controversial visit of the Springboks, the South African rugby union team, in 1971 to consolidate his position as leader with a display of force.

Springboks matches in southern states had already been disrupted by anti-apartheid demonstrations and a match in Brisbane was scheduled for 24 July 1971, the date of two Queensland by-elections. On 14 July Bjelke-Petersen declared a month-long state of emergency covering the entire state, giving the government almost unlimited power to quell what the government said was expected to be &quot;a climax of violent demonstrations&quot;. Six hundred police were transported to Brisbane from elsewhere in the state.

In the week before the match, 40 trade unions staged a 24-hour strike, protesting against the proclamation. A crowd of demonstrators also mounted a peaceful protest outside the Springboks&#x27; Wickham Terrace motel and were chased on foot by police moments after being ordered to retreat, with many police attacking the crowd with batons, boots and fists. It was one of a series of violent attacks by police on demonstrators during the Springboks&#x27; visit to Queensland.
The football game was played to a crowd of 7000 behind a high barbed-wire fence without incident. The state of emergency, which gave the government the appearance of being strong-willed and decisive, helped steer the government to victory in both by-elections held on match day. Police Special Branch member Don Lane was one of those elected, becoming a political ally of the Premier.

Bjelke-Petersen praised police for their &quot;restraint&quot; during the demonstrations and rewarded the police union for its support with an extra week&#x27;s leave for every officer in the state. He described the tension over the Springboks&#x27; tour as &quot;great fun, a game of chess in the political arena&quot;. The crisis, he said, &quot;put me on the map&quot;.

The following May—six months before the Labor Party&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1972 Australian federal election under Gough Whitlam—the Country-Liberal coalition gained another comprehensive win at the 1972 Queensland state election: Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s party took 26 seats with 20% of the vote, the Liberals took 21 seats with a 22.2% share and Labor got 33 seats from 46.7%. It was the first state election to be fought following a 1971 electoral redistribution that added four seats to the parliament and created four electoral zones with a weightage towards rural seats, with the result that while Brisbane electorates averaged about 22,000 voters, some rural seats such as Gregory and Balonne had fewer than 7000.

===The 1970s===

From 1971, under the guidance of newly hired press secretary Allen Callaghan, a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation political journalist, Bjelke-Petersen developed a high level of sophistication in dealing with news media. He held daily media conferences where he joked that he &quot;fed the chooks&quot;, established direct telex links to newsrooms where he could feed professionally written media releases and became adept at distributing press releases on deadline so journalists had very little chance to research news items. The Premier&#x27;s public profile rose rapidly with the resulting media coverage. Bjelke-Petersen began regular media and parliamentary attacks on the Whitlam Labor government, vowing to have it defeated, and he and Whitlam exchanged frequent verbal barbs, culminating in the prime minister&#x27;s 1975 description of the Queensland premier as &quot;a Bible-bashing bastard ... a paranoic, a bigot and fanatical&quot;. The pair clashed over federal plans to halt the sale of Queensland coal to Japan, take over the administration of Aboriginal affairs, remove outback petrol subsidies and move the Australian border in the Torres Strait southwards to a point midway between Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Bjelke-Petersen also vehemently opposed the Whitlam government&#x27;s proposal for Medicare, a publicly funded universal health care system. The battles helped to consolidate Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s power as he used the media to emphasise a distinctive Queensland identity he alleged was under threat from the &quot;socialist&quot; federal government.

The Queensland government bought a single-engine aircraft for the Premier&#x27;s use in November 1971, upgrading it to a twin-engine aircraft in 1973 and even bigger model in 1975. Bjelke-Petersen, a licensed pilot, used it often to visit far-flung parts of the state to campaign and boost his public profile.

In April 1974, in a bid to broaden its appeal beyond rural voters, the Country Party changed its name to the National Party.

===The Gair affair===

In April 1974 Bjelke-Petersen outmanoeuvred Whitlam after the prime minister offered Democratic Labor Party senator Vince Gair, a bitter opponent of the government, the position of ambassador to Ireland as a way of creating an extra vacant Senate position in Queensland. Whitlam, who lacked a majority in the Senate, hoped Gair&#x27;s seat would be won by his Labor Party. But when the arrangement was disclosed by newspapers before Gair had resigned from the Senate, the Opposition conspired to keep Gair away from the Senate President (to whom Gair had not yet given his resignation) and ensured he voted in a Senate debate late that night to avoid any move to backdate the resignation. At 5.15pm the Queensland Cabinet met to pass a &quot;flying minute&quot; and advised the Governor, Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for five, rather than six, vacancies, denying Labor the chance of gaining Gair&#x27;s Senate spot. The intention was to have Gair&#x27;s seat declared a casual vacancy, allowing Bjelke-Petersen to fill the vacancy until the next election.

Labor argued that Gair&#x27;s appointment, and hence his departure from the senate, was effective from no later than when the Irish government accepted his appointment, in March. This was a matter of protracted debate in the Senate over many days, and was never resolved, but it was rendered irrelevant when Whitlam called a double dissolution of both Houses, in an election gamble he only narrowly won.

===1974 state election===

In October 1974 Bjelke-Petersen called an early election, setting the 1974 Queensland election for 7 December, declaring it would be fought on &quot;the alien and stagnating, centralist, socialist, communist-inspired policies of the federal Labor government&quot;. The premier visited 70 towns and cities in the five-week campaign and attracted record crowds to public meetings. The result was a spectacular rout for the Labor Party, which was left with just 11 of the legislature&#x27;s 82 seats after a 16.5 percent swing to the Coalition, leading observers to call Labor&#x27;s caucus a &quot;cricket team.&quot; The only seat Labor retained north of Rockhampton was Cairns, by fewer than 200 votes. The National Party, contesting its first state election under the new name and fielding candidates in just 48 seats, lifted its vote from 19.7 percent to 28 percent, creating a threat for the Liberal Party, and also picked up a number of city seats including its first in Brisbane, the eastern suburbs seat of Wynnum. The Nationals even managed to oust Labor leader Perc Tucker in his own seat. &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper named Bjelke-Petersen, whom it described as the &quot;undistinguished&quot; Queensland premier, &quot;Australian of the Year&quot;, citing &quot;the singular impact he has exerted on national political life&quot;.

===Role in the Whitlam dismissal===
In 1975, Bjelke-Petersen played what turned out to be a key role in the political crisis that brought down the Whitlam government. When Queensland Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly in June 1975, Bjelke-Petersen requested from the Labor Party a short list of three nominees, from which he would pick one to replace Milliner. The ALP refused to supply such a list, instead nominating Mal Colston, an unsuccessful Labor candidate in the 1970 election, whom Bjelke-Petersen duly rejected. On 3 September Bjelke-Petersen selected political novice Albert Field, a long-time ALP member who was critical of the Whitlam government. Field&#x27;s appointment was the subject of a High Court challenge and he was on leave from October 1975. During this period, the Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser declined to allot a pair to balance Field&#x27;s absence. This gave the Coalition control over the Senate. Fraser used that control to obstruct passage of the Supply Bills through Parliament, denying Whitlam&#x27;s by now unpopular government the legal capacity to appropriate funds for government business and leading to his dismissal as Prime Minister. During the tumultuous election campaign precipitated by Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal by the governor-general John Kerr, Bjelke-Petersen alleged that Queensland police investigations had uncovered damaging documentation in relation to the Loans Affair. This documentation was never made public and these allegations remained unsubstantiated.

===Taxation reform===
Queensland was renowned for being the lowest taxed state in Australia for much of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s tenure. Over heated objections by Treasurer Gordon Chalk, Bjelke-Petersen in 1977 announced the removal of state death duties, a move that cost his state $30 million in revenue. So many New South Wales and Victorian residents sought to establish their permanent address in Queensland as a result, boosting state coffers with stamp duty from property transactions, that other states followed suit within months and also abolished the tax. To help compensate for lost revenue, the government introduced football pools; four years later the government granted a casino licence on the Gold Coast, although this too was mired in allegations of corruption and favouritism.

===Restriction of civil liberties and alleged authoritarianism===

Issues of police powers and civil liberties, first raised at the time of the 1971 Springboks tour, resurfaced in July 1976 with a major street demonstration in which more than a thousand university students marched towards the Brisbane city centre to demand better allowances from the federal government. Police stopped the march in Coronation Drive and television cameras captured an incident during the confrontation in which a police inspector struck a 20-year-old female protester over the head with his baton, injuring her. When Police Commissioner Ray Whitrod announced he would hold an inquiry, a move supported by Police Minister Max Hodges, Bjelke-Petersen declared there would be no inquiry. He told reporters he was tired of radical groups believing they could take over the streets. Police officers passed a motion at a meeting commending the premier for his &quot;distinct stand against groups acting outside the law&quot; and censured Whitrod. A week later Bjelke-Petersen relieved Hodges of his police portfolio. Secure in the knowledge that they had the Premier&#x27;s backing, police officers continued to act provocatively, most notably in a military-style raid on a hippie commune at Cedar Bay in Far North Queensland late the following month. The police, who had been looking for marijuana, set fire to the residents&#x27; houses and destroyed their property.

Bjelke-Petersen rejected calls for an inquiry into the raid, declaring the government would believe the police and claiming the public clamour was &quot;all part of an orchestrated campaign to legalise marijuana and denigrate the police&quot;. In defiance of the premier, Whitrod went ahead with an inquiry anyway and on 16 November ordered summonses be issued against four police officers on more than 25 charges, including arson. He chose the same day to announce that he was quitting his post. Whitrod claimed his resignation marked a victory for the forces of corruption, but said he had decided to quit rather than tolerate further political interference by the premier and new Police Minister Tom Newbery. Whitrod said Queensland showed signs of becoming a police state and he compared the growing political interference in law enforcement to the rise of the German Nazi state. Whitrod was replaced by Assistant Commissioner Terry Lewis, despite Whitrod&#x27;s warning to the Police Minister that he was corrupt.

In 1977, Bjelke-Petersen announced that &quot;the day of street marches is over&quot;, warning protesters, &quot;Don&#x27;t bother applying for a march permit. You won&#x27;t get one. That&#x27;s government policy now!&quot; Liberal parliamentarians crossed the floor defending the right of association and assembly. One Liberal MP, Colin Lamont, told a meeting at the University of Queensland that the premier was engineering confrontation for electoral purposes and was confronted two hours later by an angry Bjelke-Petersen who said he was aware of the comments. Lamont later said he learned the Special Branch had been keeping files on Liberal rebels and reporting, not to their Commissioner, but directly to the Premier, commenting: &quot;The police state had arrived.&quot; When, after two ugly street battles between police and right-to-march protesters, the Uniting Church Synod called on the government to change the march law, Bjelke-Petersen accused the clergy of &quot;supporting communists&quot;. His attack sparked a joint political statement by four other major religious denominations, which was shrugged off by the premier.

The government&#x27;s increasingly hardline approach to civil liberties prompted Queensland National Party president Robert Sparkes to warn the party that it was developing a dangerous &quot;propaganda-created&quot; ultra-conservative, almost fascist image. He told a party conference: &quot;We must studiously avoid any statements or actions which suggest an extreme right-wing posture.&quot; Bjelke-Petersen ignored the advice. He condemned the use of Australian foreign aid to prop up communist regimes, urged Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to stop criticising the governments of South Africa and Rhodesia and from 1977 proposed Queensland secede from Australia and establish its own currency. He also accused political opponents of being covert communists bent on chaos, observing: &quot;I have always found ... you can campaign on anything you like but nothing is more effective than communism ... If he&#x27;s a Labor man, he&#x27;s a socialist and a very dangerous man.&quot;

Three weeks before the 1977 Queensland election, 400 demonstrators were arrested in what a Melbourne newspaper called &quot;Joh&#x27;s War&quot;. Aided by an electoral redistribution that removed two Liberal-held seats, the Nationals won 35 out of 82 seats, compared with 24 for the Liberals and 23 for a resurgent Labor Party. It was the first time in Queensland political history the Nationals had outpolled the Liberals. Bjelke-Petersen used the party&#x27;s strength to move key Cabinet posts that had long held by the Liberals into the hands of National Party ministers. In October 1978 thousands of demonstrators again attempted to defy anti-march laws with a protest march in Albert St, Brisbane, which was again repulsed by police lined five deep. In a Brisbane byelection a month later National Party support slumped to just 10 percent, half of what party strategists had expected. But by the end of 1978, both the state Liberal and Labor parties had new parliamentary leaders—the fourth Labor opposition leader during Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s reign and the third Liberal leader.

===Disintegration of the State Coalition, seventh ministry===
Florence Bjelke-Petersen was elected to the Senate in October 1980 as a National Party member and six weeks later Joh was successful for a fifth time as premier at the 1980 Queensland election, with the Nationals converting a 27.9 percent primary vote—their highest ever—into 35 of the parliament&#x27;s 82 seats, or 43 percent of seats. It also created a record 13-seat lead over their coalition partners, the Liberals, who had campaigned by offering Queenslanders an alternative style of moderate government.

The Nationals picked up all four Gold Coast seats and all those on the Sunshine Coast. Once again the premier took advantage of his party&#x27;s dominance over the Liberals in Cabinet, this time demanding that the seven Liberal ministers sign a coalition agreement in which they promised unquestioned allegiance to Cabinet decisions. The move turned the Nationals&#x27; 35 votes to a guaranteed majority of 42 in the House, effectively neutralising any potential opposition by the 15 Liberal backbenchers.

Bjelke-Petersen began making appointments, including judges and the chairmanship of the Totalisator Agency Board, that had traditionally been the domain of Liberal ministers, and accusations arose of political interference and conflicts of interest as mining contracts, casino licences and the rights to build shopping complexes were awarded to business figures with National Party links. Accusations of political interference also arose when police released without charge TAB chairman Sir Edward Lyons, a National Party trustee and close friend of Bjelke-Petersen, after a breathalyser test showed he was driving with more than double the legal blood alcohol limit.

Relations with the Liberal Party continued to deteriorate. By August 1983, after 26 years of coalition, they had reached their nadir. Bjelke-Petersen was angered by a Liberal Party bid to establish a public accounts committee to examine government expenditure. Shortly afterward, Liberal leader Llew Edwards was ousted in a party room coup by Terry White, who had long advocated a greater role for the Liberals in the Coalition. Bjelke-Petersen refused to give Edwards&#x27; old post of deputy premier to White, choosing instead to adjourn parliament—which had sat for just 15 days that year—declined to say when it would sit again, and insisted he could govern alone without the need of a coalition, commenting: &quot;The government of Queensland is in very, very good hands.&quot; Labor leader Tom Burns said the closure of parliament showed &quot;that no rules exist in the state of Queensland.&quot; In a fortnight of political crisis, Bjelke-Petersen defied an ultimatum by Liberal parliamentarians to accept their leader in Cabinet, prompting White to tear up the Coalition agreement and lead the Liberals to the crossbench.

Watching with satisfaction as the Liberal Party engaged in vitriolic infighting, Bjelke-Petersen called an election for 22 October, claiming: &quot;I really believe we can govern Queensland in our own right.&quot; The campaign coincided with the launch of an &quot;official&quot; Bjelke-Petersen biography, &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, which lauded him as a &quot;statesman extraordinaire&quot; and &quot;protectorate of Queensland and her people&quot;. Further rubbing salt in the wounds of his former coalition partners, his campaign was boosted by the support of prominent Liberals from other states including Tasmanian premier Robin Gray and former Victorian and NSW premiers Sir Henry Bolte and Tom Lewis. The Nationals also poured significant resources into Brisbane-area Liberal seats, seeing a chance to not only win government in their own right, but destroy their former Liberal partners.

Three months before his 73rd birthday, Bjelke-Petersen and his party recorded a resounding victory, attracting 38.9 percent of the primary vote to give them exactly half the parliament&#x27;s 82 seats, just one short of a majority. The Keith Wright-led Labor Party, with 44 percent of the vote, won 32 seats. The Liberals were decimated, losing all but eight of their 21 seats. Bjelke-Petersen openly urged Liberals to cross the floor to the Nationals in hopes of getting an outright majority. Just three days later, two Liberals—former ministers Don Lane and Brian Austin—took up Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s offer and joined the Nationals in return for seats in cabinet. With Lane and Austin&#x27;s defections, the National Party was able to form a majority government for the first time at the state level in Australia.

In 1984 Bjelke-Petersen was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for &quot;services to parliamentary democracy&quot;. Author Evan Whitton suggests the premier had made the nomination himself.

In 1986 Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke discontinued knighthoods in Australia and it was largely in response to Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s knighthood. When Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott brought back knighthoods in 2014 he insisted that politicians would not be eligible citing Sir Joh as a reason for the ineligibility. 

In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen unveiled plans for another electoral redistribution to create seven new seats in four zones: four in the state&#x27;s populous south-east (with an average enrolment of 19,357 electors per seat) and three in country areas (with enrolments as low as 9386). The boundaries were to be drawn by electoral commissioners specially appointed by the government; one of them, Cairns lawyer Sir Thomas Covacevich, was a fundraiser for the National Party. The malapportionment meant that a vote in the state&#x27;s west was worth two in Brisbane and the provincial cities. A University of Queensland associate professor of government described the redistribution as &quot;the most criminal act ever perpetrated in politics ... the worst zonal gerrymander in the history of the world&quot; and the most serious action of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s political career.

A &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaign was conceived in late 1985, driven largely by a group of Gold Coast property developers, promoting Bjelke-Petersen as the most effective conservative challenger to Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and at the 1986 Queensland election he recorded his biggest electoral win ever, winning 49 of the state&#x27;s 89 seats with 39.6 percent of the primary vote. The ALP&#x27;s 41.3 percent share of the vote earned it 30 seats, while the Liberal Party won the remaining 10 seats. In his victory speech, Bjelke-Petersen declared the Nationals had prevailed over the &quot;three forces&quot; who had opposed it: &quot;We had the ALP organisation with its deceits, deception and lies, we had the media encouraging and supporting them, and we had the Liberal Party ... our assault on Canberra begins right now.&quot;

It was the seventh and final electoral victory of the Bjelke-Petersen era. In January 1987 the premier handed control of the state to Deputy Premier Bill Gunn and announced he would seek election to the House of Representatives, formally embarking on his &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; push. By early 1987 the campaign, with its promise of a 25 percent flat tax, was attracting the support of 20 per cent of voters in opinion polls.

===Police inquiry, downfall and resignation===

In late 1986, two journalists, the ABC&#x27;s Chris Masters and &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;&#x27;s Phil Dickie, independently began investigating the extent of police and political corruption in Queensland and its links to the National Party state government. Dickie&#x27;s reports, alleging the apparent immunity from prosecution enjoyed by a group of illegal brothel operators, began appearing in early 1987; Masters&#x27; explosive &quot;Four Corners&quot; investigative report on police corruption entitled &quot;The Moonlight State&quot; aired on 11 May 1987. Within a week, Acting Premier Gunn decided to initiate a wide-ranging Commission of Inquiry into police corruption, despite opposition from Bjelke-Petersen. Gunn selected former Federal Court judge Tony Fitzgerald as its head. By late June, the terms of inquiry of what became known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry had been widened from members of the force to include &quot;any other persons&quot; with whom police might have been engaged in misconduct since 1977.

On 27 May 1987, Prime Minister Hawke called a federal election for 11 July, catching Bjelke-Petersen unprepared. The premier had flown to the United States two days earlier and had not yet nominated for a federal seat; on 3 June he abandoned his ambitions to become prime minister and resumed his position in the Queensland government. The announcement came too late for the non-Labor forces, as Bjelke-Petersen had pressured the federal Nationals to pull out of the Coalition. Due to a number of three-cornered contests, Labor won a sweeping victory.

Fitzgerald began his formal hearings on 27 July 1987, and a month later the first bombshells were dropped as Sgt Harry Burgess—accused of accepting $221,000 in bribes since 1981—implicated senior officers Jack Herbert, Noel Dwyer, Graeme Parker and Commissioner Terry Lewis in complex graft schemes. Other allegations quickly followed, and on 21 September Police Minister Gunn ordered Lewis—knighted in 1986 at Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s behest and now accused of having taken $663,000 in bribes—to stand down.

The ground had begun to shift out from under Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s feet even before the hearings began. The first allegations of corruption prompted the Labor opposition to ask the Governor, Sir Walter Campbell, to use his reserve power to sack Bjelke-Petersen. His position deteriorated rapidly; ministers were openly opposing him in Cabinet meetings, which had been almost unthinkable for most of his tenure.

Throughout 1986, Bjelke-Petersen had pushed for approval of construction of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper in the Brisbane CBD, which had been announced in May. The project, which had not been approved by the Brisbane City Council, enraged his backbenchers. During a party meeting, MP Huan Fraser confronted Bjelke-Petersen, saying &quot;I know there is a bloody big payoff to you coming as a result of this. You&#x27;re a corrupt old bastard, and I&#x27;m not going to cop it.&quot;

By this time, Sparkes had also turned against Bjelke-Petersen, and was pressuring him to retire. On 7 October, Bjelke-Petersen announced he would retire from politics on 8 August 1988, the 20th anniversary of his swearing-in.

Six weeks later, on 23 November 1987, Bjelke-Petersen visited Campbell and advised him to sack the entire Cabinet and appoint a new one with redistributed portfolios. Under normal circumstances, Campbell would have been bound by convention to act on Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s advice. However, Campbell persuaded Bjelke-Petersen to limit his demand to ask for the resignations of those ministers he wanted removed. Bjelke-Petersen then demanded the resignation of five of his ministers, including Gunn and Health Minister Mike Ahern. All refused. Gunn, believing Bjelke-Petersen intended to take over the police portfolio and terminate the Fitzgerald Inquiry, announced he would challenge for the leadership. Bjelke-Petersen persisted regardless and decided to sack three ministers—Ahern, Austin and Peter McKechnie—on the grounds of displaying insufficient loyalty.

The next day, Bjelke-Petersen formally advised Campbell to sack Ahern, Austin and McKechnie and call an early election. However, Ahern, Gunn and Austin told Campbell that Bjelke-Petersen no longer had enough parliamentary support to govern. While Campbell agreed to the ouster of Ahern, Gunn and Austin, he was reluctant to call fresh elections for a legislature that was only a year old. He thus concluded that the crisis was a political one in which he should not be involved. He also believed that Bjelke-Petersen was no longer acting rationally. After Bjelke-Petersen refused numerous requests for a party meeting, the party&#x27;s management committee called one for 26 November. At this meeting, a spill motion was carried by a margin of 38–9. Bjelke-Petersen boycotted the meeting, and thus did not nominate for the ensuing leadership vote, which saw Ahern elected as the new leader and Gunn reelected as deputy.

Ahern promptly wrote to Campbell seeking to be commissioned as premier. This normally should have been a pro forma request, given the Nationals&#x27; outright majority. However, Bjelke-Petersen insisted he was still premier, and even sought the support of his old Liberal and Labor foes in order to stay in office. However, even with the combined support of the Liberals and Labor, Bjelke-Petersen would have needed at least four other Nationals to cross the floor if he hoped to keep his post. Despite Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s seemingly tenuous position, Campbell had received legal advice that he could only use his reserve power to sack Bjelke-Petersen and appoint Ahern only if Bjelke-Petersen tried to stay in office after being defeated in the legislature. This was per longstanding constitutional practice in Australia, which calls for a first minister (Prime Minister at the federal level, premier at the state level, chief minister at the territorial level) to stay in office unless he resigns or is defeated in the House.

The result was a situation in which, as the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; put it, Queensland had a &quot;Premier who is not leader&quot; and the National Party a &quot;Leader who is not Premier&quot;. The crisis continued till 1 December, when Bjelke-Petersen resigned as premier and member for Barambah and retired from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter to the floor of State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.

==Post-government (1988-2003)==

In February 1988, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal announced a hearing into the suitability of entrepreneur Alan Bond, the owner of the Nine TV network, to hold a broadcasting licence. The investigation centred on the network&#x27;s $400,000 payout to Bjelke-Petersen in 1985 to settle a defamation action launched by the premier in 1983. Bond had made the payment (negotiated from an initial $1 million claim) soon after buying the network and a major Queensland brewery and claimed in a later television interview that Bjelke-Petersen told him he would need to make the payment if he wished to continue business in Queensland. (In April 1989 the broadcasting tribunal found that Bjelke-Petersen had placed Bond in a position of &quot;commercial blackmail&quot;.)

Bjelke-Petersen was called to the Fitzgerald corruption inquiry on 1 December 1988, where he said that, despite allegations raised in the media and parliament, he had held no suspicion in the previous decade of corruption in Queensland. He said a Hong Kong businessman&#x27;s 1986 donation of $100,000 to an election slush fund—delivered in cash at the premier&#x27;s Brisbane office—was not unusual, and that he did not know the identity of other donors who had left sums of $50,000 and $60,000 in cash at his office on other occasions. Questioned by barrister Michael Forde, Bjelke-Petersen—whose citation for his 1984 knighthood noted that he was &quot;a strong believer in historic tradition of parliamentary democracy&quot;—was also unable to explain the doctrine of separation of powers under the Westminster system.

Under Ahern (1987–89) and Russell Cooper (1989), the Nationals were unable to overcome the damage from the revelations about the massive corruption in the Bjelke-Petersen government. At the 1989 state election, Labor swept the Nationals from power in a 24-seat swing—at the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government since responsible government was introduced in Queensland.

As a result of the Fitzgerald inquiry, Lewis was tried, convicted, and jailed on corruption charges. He was later stripped of his knighthood and other honours. A number of other officials, including ministers Don Lane and Austin were also jailed. Another former minister, Russ Hinze, died while awaiting trial.

In 1991 Bjelke-Petersen faced criminal trial for perjury arising out of the evidence he had given to the Fitzgerald inquiry (an earlier proposed charge of corruption was incorporated into the perjury charge). Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s former police Special Branch bodyguard Sergeant Bob Carter told the court that in 1986 he had twice been given packages of cash totalling $210,000 at the premier&#x27;s office. He was told to take them to a Brisbane city law firm and then watch as the money was deposited in a company bank account. The money had been given over by developer Sng Swee Lee, and the bank account was in the name of Kaldeal, operated by Sir Edward Lyons, a trustee of the National Party. John Huey, a Fitzgerald Inquiry investigator, later told &quot;Four Corners&quot;: &quot;I said to Robert Sng, &#x27;Well what did Sir Joh say to you when you gave him this large sum of money?&#x27; And he said, &quot;All he said was, &#x27;thank you, thank you, thank you&#x27;.&quot; The jury could not agree on a verdict. In 1992 it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, was a member of the Young Nationals and was identified with the &quot;Friends of Joh&quot; movement. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Bjelke-Petersen, then aged 81, was too old. Developer Sng Swee Lee refused to return from Singapore for a retrial. Bjelke-Petersen said his defence costs sent him broke.

Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry About That: The Joh Bjelke-Petersen Memoirs&quot;, were published the same year. He retired to Bethany where his son John and wife Karyn set up bed and breakfast cottages on the property. He developed progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In 2003, he lodged a $338 million compensation claim with the Queensland Labor government for loss of business opportunities resulting from the Fitzgerald inquiry. The claim was based on the assertion that the inquiry had not been lawfully commissioned by state cabinet and that it had acted outside its powers. The government rejected the claim; in his advice to the government, tabled in parliament, Crown Solicitor Conrad Lohe recommended dismissing the claim and said Bjelke-Petersen was &quot;fortunate&quot; not to have faced a second trial.

==Electoral history==
==Death==
Bjelke-Petersen died in St Aubyn&#x27;s Hospital in Kingaroy on 23 April 2005, aged 94, with his wife and family members by his side. He received a State Funeral, held in Kingaroy Town Hall, at which the then Prime Minister, John Howard, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie were speakers.

Beattie, who had been sued by Bjelke-Petersen for defamation and was arrested during the 1971 Springbok tour protests, said: &quot;I think too often in the adversarial nature of politics we forget that behind every leader, behind every politician, is indeed a family and we shouldn&#x27;t forget that.&quot;

As the funeral was taking place in Kingaroy, about 2000 protesters gathered in Brisbane to &quot;ensure that those who suffered under successive Bjelke-Petersen governments were not forgotten&quot;. Protest organiser Drew Hutton said &quot;Queenslanders should remember what is described as a dark passage in the state&#x27;s history.&quot;

Bjelke-Petersen was buried &quot;beside his trees that he planted and he nurtured and they grew&quot; at the Kingaroy
family property, called &quot;Bethany&quot;.

The Bjelke-Petersen Dam in Moffatdale in the South Burnett Region is named after him.

==Malapportionment==

Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s government was kept in power in part due to an electoral malapportionment where rural electoral districts had significantly fewer enrolled voters than those in metropolitan areas. This system was introduced by the Labor Party in 1949 as an overt electoral fix in order to concentrate its base of voters in regional towns and rural areas in as many districts as possible. Under Nicklin the bias in favour of rural constituencies was maintained, but reworked to favour the Country and Liberal parties by carving new Country-leaning seats in the hinterlands of provincial areas and Liberal-leaning seats in Brisbane.

The bias worked to Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s benefit in his first election as premier, in 1969. His Country Party won only 21 percent of the primary vote, finishing third behind Labor and the Liberals. However, due to the Country Party&#x27;s heavy concentration of support in the provincial and rural zones, it won 26 seats, seven more than the Liberals. Combined, the Coalition had 45 seats out of 78, enough to consign Labor to opposition even though it finished percentage points ahead of the Coalition on the two-party vote. While in opposition, Bjelke-Petersen had vehemently criticised the 1949 redistribution, claiming that Labor was effectively telling Queenslanders, &quot;Whether you like it or not, we will be the government.&quot;

In 1972, Bjelke-Petersen strengthened the system to favour his own party. To the three existing electoral zones—metropolitan Brisbane, provincial and rural—was added a fourth zone, the remote zone. The seats in this area had even fewer enrolled electors than seats in the rural zone—in some cases, as few as a third of the enrolled electors in a typical Brisbane seat. This had the effect of packing Labor support into the Brisbane area and the provincial cities. On average, it took only 7,000 votes to win a Country/National seat, versus 12,000 for a Labor seat. This gross distortion led to his opponents referring to it as the &quot;Bjelkemander&quot;, a play on the term &quot;gerrymander&quot;. The 1985 proposal would have made the malapportionment even more severe, to the point that a vote in Brisbane would have only been worth half a country vote. The lack of a state upper house (which Queensland had abolished in 1922) allowed legislation to be passed without the need to negotiate with other political parties.

==Personality and leadership style==
===Authoritarianism===
Queensland political scientist Rae Wear described Bjelke-Petersen as an authoritarian who treated democratic values with contempt and was intolerant and resentful of opposition, yet who also demonstrated a down-home charm and old-fashioned courtesies as well as kindness to colleagues. Those who worked closely with him described him as stubborn with a propensity to fly into rages in which he would &quot;rant and rave like Adolf Hitler&quot;, creating &quot;fantastic performances&quot; as he shook with rage, becoming increasingly incoherent. Many of his National Party colleagues were in terror of him on such occasions. Raised by migrant parents in spartan rural surroundings, he combined a strong work ethic with an ascetic lifestyle that was strongly shaped by his Lutheran upbringing. As a young man Bjelke-Petersen lived alone for 15 years in an old cow bail with a leaky bark roof and only the most basic of facilities. He had a lifelong habit of hard work and long days and while premier often slept for just four hours a night. He valued &quot;the School of Life, the hard knocks of life&quot; more than formal education and showed little respect for academics and universities, although he accepted an honorary doctorate of Laws from the University of Queensland in May 1985, prompting criticism from both students and staff. Wear dismissed Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s claim that he was a reluctant and accidental entrant into state politics, concluding that he &quot;seized opportunity whenever it presented and held tenaciously to power&quot;, and was later willing to use any device to remain premier. She said that although Bjelke-Petersen denied ever knowing anything about corruption, &quot;the evidence suggests this is untrue. He ignored it because to acknowledge its presence was to hand a weapon to his political enemies and because he was prepared to trade off corruption for police loyalty&quot;.

Biographers have suggested that Bjelke-Petersen, raised under a resented patriarch, himself came to play the strong patriarch, refusing to be accountable to anyone: &quot;Rather than explaining himself or answering questions, he demanded to be taken on trust.&quot; He believed God had chosen him to save Australia from socialism and also had a profound sense of Christian conscience that he said guided political decisions, explaining, &quot;Your whole instinct cries out whether it&#x27;s good or bad.&quot; A cousin of Bjelke-Petersen said the premier &quot;has an inner certainty that he knows the answers to our political and social woes&quot; and as a good Christian expected to be trusted, thus needing no constitutional checks and balances.

===Relations with the media===
Guided by media adviser Allen Callaghan, with whom he worked from 1971 to 1979, Bjelke-Petersen was an astute manager of news media. He made himself available to reporters and held daily press conferences where he &quot;fed the chooks&quot;. Callaghan released a steady stream of press releases, timing them to coincide with periods when news editors were most desperate for news. For most of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s premiership, Queensland newspapers were supportive of his government, generally supporting the police and government on the street march issue, while Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; endorsed the return of the coalition government at every state election between 1957 and 1986.

According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total loyalty of the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if reporting was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; by switching the government&#x27;s million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival &quot;Daily Sun&quot;. He banned a &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that &quot;leaks&quot; from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s increasing use of defamation actions in order to try to &quot;stop talk about a corrupt government&quot;. Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; in 1986: &quot;The greatest thing that could happen to the state and the nation is when we get rid of the media. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and no one would know anything.&quot;

Callaghan&#x27;s advice to Bjelke-Petersen included the recommendation that he maintain his rambling style of communication with mangled syntax, recognising it added to his homespun appeal to ordinary people and also allowed him to avoid giving answers. His catchphrase response to unwelcome queries was, &quot;Don&#x27;t you worry about that&quot;, a phrase that was used as the title of his 1990 memoir. Wear wrote: &quot;His verbal stumbling communicated decent simplicity and trustworthiness and, in order to enhance his popular appeal, Bjelke-Petersen appears to have exaggerated, or at least not tried to rid himself of, his famous speaking style.&quot;

===Heritage and environment===

The premier showed little concern for heritage and environmental issues, attracting widespread public fury over the 1979 demolition of Brisbane&#x27;s historic Bellevue Hotel and favouring oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef and sand mining on Moreton Island. He opposed the expansion of Aboriginal land rights, barred state officials from meeting World Council of Churches delegates who were studying the treatment of Aborigines in Queensland and demonstrated a strong moralistic streak, banning &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, opposing school sex education and condom vending machines and in 1980 proposing a ban on women flying south for abortions. In May 1985 the government conducted a series of raids on so-called abortion clinics.

===Industrial relations===
Bjelke-Petersen had a confrontational approach to industrial relations. As a backbencher he had made clear his opposition to unions and the 40-hour week and in 1979 he pushed for legislation that would lead to the lifetime loss of a driver&#x27;s licence for union members using their own vehicles to organise strikes.

For four days in 1981, Queensland power workers had been using rotating blackouts and restrictions as a means of pressure. Bjelke-Petersen responded by closing licensed clubs and hotels and publishing the names and addresses of the 260 involved workers, with the aim of inspiring members of the public to harass them. The intimidation tactic worked and the union resumed normal work schedules within 15 minutes of government ads arriving in Brisbane newspapers. &quot;I believe the Government now knows how in the future to approach such disputes in essential services&quot;, said Bjelke-Petersen.

In 1982 he ordered the dismissal of teachers who were conducting rolling stoppages on the issue of class sizes. The same year he invoked the Essential Services Act to declare a state of emergency when government blue-collar workers launched industrial action to support a 38-hour week.

His biggest showdown with unions came in February 1985 when electrical workers, opposing the increasing use of contract labour in their industry, placed a ban on performing routine maintenance. Bjelke-Petersen ordered the shutdown of several of the states generators. That led to two weeks of blackouts. The government declared a state of emergency on 7 February, sacked as many as 1100 striking workers but offered their jobs back if they would sign a no-strike clause and work a 40-hour week; most accepted but 400 lost their jobs and superannuation. Labor compared the government with the Nazi regime, calling the new laws &quot;police-state legislation&quot;.

===Aboriginal people===
Bjelke-Petersen believed that he and his government knew what was best for Aboriginal Australians. He excused racially discriminatory legislation as a protective measure and generally supported Aboriginal self-determination at least partly as striking a blow against the monolithic centralism of Canberra under Labor.

In June 1976, Bjelke-Petersen blocked the proposed sale of a pastoral property on the Cape York Peninsula to a group of Aboriginal people, because according to cabinet policy, &quot;The Queensland Government does not view favourably proposals to acquire large areas of additional freehold or leasehold land for development by Aborigines or Aboriginal groups in isolation.&quot; This dispute resulted in the case of &quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot;, which was decided partly in the High Court in 1982, and partly in the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1988. The courts found that Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s policy had discriminated against Aboriginal people.

In 1978, the Uniting Church supported Aborigines at Aurukun and Mornington Island in their struggle with the Queensland Government after it granted a 1900 square kilometre mining lease to a mining consortium under extremely favourable conditions. The Aurukun people challenged the legislation, winning their case in the Supreme Court of Queensland but later losing when the Queensland Government appealed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

Bjelke-Petersen was opposed by Sir Robert Sparkes, church groups and the federal government over a 1982 push to abolish Aboriginal and Islander community reserves and to give title to the reserve lands to local councils elected by communities—titles that could be revoked by the government for unspecified reasons. Bjelke-Petersen claimed there were over-riding issues of defence and security because of fears of a communist plot to create a separate black nation in Australia.

In 1982, Bjelke-Petersen also denied John Koowarta, an Aboriginal Wik man, the sale of the Archer River cattle station that covered large amounts of the Wik ancestral homeland, due to Aboriginal people &#x27;not being allowed to buy large areas of land&#x27;. Koowarta appealed the decision to the High Court, arguing that the Queensland Government could not do this under the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).&quot; The High Court overruled Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s decision, allowing the Wik nation&#x27;s traditional land to be bought by Koowarta. The sale was to proceed, but at the last minute, Bjelke-Petersen, in an act described by Australian Conservation Foundation councillor Kevin Guy as one of &quot;spite and prejudice,&quot; declared the Archer River property a national park, the Archer Bend National Park (now known as Oyala Thumotang National Park), to ensure that no one could ever own it. However, on 6 October 2010 Premier Anna Bligh announced that a portion of the park would be given over to the Wik-Mungkana peoples as freehold land. On 22 May 2012 Campbell Newman handed the park to the Oyala Thumotang Land Trust representing the Wik Mungkan, Southern Kaanju and Ayapathu and transferred a portion of land revoked from the park as freehold land.

===Anti-homosexual remarks===
During his period in office Bjelke-Petersen frequently raised fears of a conspiracy of &quot;southern homosexuals&quot; to gain electoral advantage and to oppose the policies of the federal government or other states.

===State development===
Considerable development of the state&#x27;s infrastructure took place during the Bjelke-Petersen era.
He was a leading proponent of Wivenhoe and Burdekin Dams, encouraging the modernising and electrifying of the Queensland railway system, and the construction of the Gateway Bridge. Airports, coal mines, power stations, and dams were built throughout the state. James Cook University was established. In Brisbane, the Queensland Cultural Centre, Griffith University, the Southeast Freeway, and the Captain Cook, Gateway and Merivale bridges were all constructed, as well as the Parliamentary Annexe that was attached to Queensland Parliament House. Bjelke-Petersen was one of the instigators of World Expo 88 (now South Bank Parklands) and the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games.

His government worked closely with property developers on the Gold Coast, who constructed resorts, hotels, a casino and a system of residential developments. In one controversial case, the Queensland government passed special legislation, the Sanctuary Cove Act 1985, to exempt a luxury development, Sanctuary Cove, from local government planning regulations. The developer, Mike Gore, was seen as a key member of the &quot;white shoe brigade&quot;, a group of Gold Coast businessmen who became influential supporters of Bjelke-Petersen. The &quot;white-shoe&quot; nickname was a contemptuous allusion to the nouveau riche origins revealed by their gaudy and tasteless choice of clothing, which included brightly coloured or patterned shirts, slacks with white stripes or in pastel shades, and shoes and belts of white leather, these often having gold or gilt buckles. They became known for shady deals with the government concerning property development, often with dire consequences for heritage buildings. A similar piece of legislation was passed to allow a Japanese company, Iwasaki Sangyo, to develop a tourist resort near Yeppoon in Central Queensland.

===Personal associations===
He was an associate of Milan Brych, who had previously been removed from the New Zealand Medical Register for promoting unproven cancer cures.

<doc id="298901" wikidata="Q2407366" url="?curid=298901" title="Merchant Ivory Productions">
<text>Merchant Ivory Productions is a film company founded in 1961 by producer Ismail Merchant (1936–2005) and director James Ivory (b. 1928). Merchant and Ivory were life and business partners from 1961 until Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005. During their time together, they made 44 films. The films were for the most part produced by Merchant and directed by Ivory, and 23 of them were scripted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (1927–2013) in some capacity. The films were often based upon novels or short stories, particularly the work of Henry James, E. M. Forster, and Jhabvala herself.

The initial goal of the company was &quot;to make English-language films in India aimed at the international market&quot;. The style of Merchant Ivory films set and photographed in India became iconic. The company also went on to make films in the United Kingdom and America.

Some actors and producers associated with Merchant Ivory include Maggie Smith, Leela Naidu, Madhur Jaffrey, Aparna Sen, Shashi Kapoor, Jennifer Kendal, Hugh Grant, James Wilby, Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Anthony Hopkins, Glenn Close, Uma Thurman, Emma Thompson, Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Ralph Fiennes, Colin Firth, Richard Hawley and Helena Bonham Carter.

Of this collaboration, Merchant once commented: &quot;It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory... I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American. Someone once described us as a three-headed god. Maybe they should have called us a three-headed monster!&quot;

The expression &quot;Merchant–Ivory film&quot; has made its way into common parlance, to denote a particular genre of film rather than the actual production company. While 1965&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; put this genre on the international map, its heyday was the 1980s and 1990s with such films as &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985) and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992). A typical &quot;Merchant–Ivory film&quot; would be a period piece, based on a classic novel, set in the early 20th century, usually in Edwardian England, featuring lavish sets and top British actors portraying genteel characters who suffer from disillusionment and tragic entanglements. The main theme often surrounded a house, which took on a particular importance in many Merchant Ivory films.

==History==
Merchant Ivory Productions was founded in 1961 by Ismail Merchant and James Ivory in India to produce English language films.

After early, modest successes with films such as &quot;The Householder&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot;, and &quot;Bombay Talkie&quot;, Merchant and Ivory suffered a lean period during the 1970s. Films such as &quot;Jane Austen in Manhattan&quot; and &quot;The Wild Party&quot; failed to find an audience. Their fortunes revived dramatically in 1979 when they made an adaptation of Henry James&#x27; novel &quot;The Europeans&quot;. Their film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983) was an art-house hit in Europe, particularly in England. However, it was not until their work together on &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985) that they broke out from the art house into broader success.

In 1985, Merchant Ivory Productions was signed by film distributor Cinecom International Films in order to gave Cinecom access to the 11 Merchant Ivory productions at that time as Cinecom had to increase its distribution schedule. In 1986, Merchant Ivory and Cinecom begin their co-production lineup with the film &quot;The Deceivers&quot;. In 1987, after 25 years as an independent producer, Merchant Ivory Productions declined offers by Hollywood power brokers and deep-pocketed investors, mesmerized by the success of the triple-Oscar winning &quot;A Room with a View,&quot; to take the company public.

Around 1990, they moved their productions to England and the United States. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala became their frequent collaborating writer. Major film studios sought them out; Disney signed Merchant Ivory Productions to a three-year distribution deal in 1991.

In October 2015, Cohen Media Group acquired the Merchant Ivory brand and library, 21 films and 9 documentaries including worldwide distribution, for restoration and rerelease as a part of the Cohen Film Collection. Ivory would be creative director on the films&#x27; restoration, re-release and promotion.

<doc id="298906" wikidata="Q42691" url="?curid=298906" title="Korat">
<text>The Korat cat (, ) is a silver-tipped blue-grey, short-haired breed of domestic cat with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat. Its body is semi-cobby, and unusually heavy for its size. It is an intelligent and playful active cat that forms strong bonds with people and is very vocal, with a sound different from other breeds. Among the Korat&#x27;s distinguishing characteristics are its heart-shaped head, its large green eyes. Its front paws are shorter than the back paws.

The Korat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds, and one of the very few that has not changed its appearance throughout centuries. Originating in Phimai, Thailand, it is named after its province of origin, Nakhon Ratchasima Province (typically called &quot;Korat&quot; by the Thai people). In Thailand, the breed is known as &quot;Si sawat&quot;, meaning &quot;colour of the sawat seed&quot;. The Korat is known colloquially as the &quot;good luck cat&quot;. Traditionally, they are given in pairs to newlyweds or people who are highly esteemed, for good luck. Until recently, Korats were not sold, but only given as gifts.

== History ==
The probable first allusion to the breed is in the Thai &quot;Tamra Maew&quot; (&quot;The Cat-Book Poems&quot;), authored between 1350 and 1767 CE and now in the National Library of Thailand. However, the illustration of the Korat in this book is not detailed enough to be definitive as to the breed portrayed. In recent years, the Korat was pictured on a postage stamp in Thailand. An example hangs in the city of Korat&#x27;s post office.

Korats first appeared in Britain under the name &quot;Blue Siamese&quot; in 1889 and 1896, but these solid blue cats did not conform to the cat show judges&#x27; perception of a Siamese cat, and they disappeared by 1901. One early import, &quot;Dwina&quot;, owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs. Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Cat&quot; (1903), reputedly produced a large number of &quot;Siamese&quot; kittens; the other, Mrs. B. Spearman&#x27;s Blue Siamese male, &quot;Nam Noi&quot;, was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, &quot;Around the Pens&quot;, July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these &quot;Blue Siamese&quot;.

Korats first appeared in the US in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the US for breeding: a male named Nara and a female named Darra. In 1966, the Korat was accepted into championship status, through the efforts of a breeder from Maryland.

== Appearance ==
The Korat&#x27;s unusual colour is actually a silver-tipped blue that appears to shimmer. The Thais refer to this colour as &quot;rain-cloud grey&quot;, and the shimmer as &quot;sea foam&quot;. This cat has a single coat that is short, with roots of a lighter silver blue. The hair shaft colour increases to deeper blue and the tips are silver, especially on the muzzle and toes. This is the only colour accepted for a Korat. The eyes are large and green in an adult cat, but kittens have muddy, amber or golden-green coloured eyes which gradually change as they become adults, at two to four years.

Although it is rare, Korats occasionally have striking or faint white markings or spots or even very faint grey stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size with age. These are seen as flaws, and the cats are disqualified from competing in cat shows. However, such markings have no effect on personality or health.
==Thai Lilac, Thai Blue Point and Thai Lilac Point==


The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy recognizes Korat-type cats differing from the traditional solid blue appearance of the Korat on their experimental register. Such cats are registered as Thai Lilac if they are solid lilac. A Thai Blue Point exhibits the colourpoint pattern also seen in Siamese. A Thai Lilac Point also exhibits the colourpoint pattern also seen in Siamese, but in addition exhibits the Chocolate gene. These should not be confused with the Thai cat, a new name for the original (traditional or classic) Siamese cat type, with a rounder face and thicker body than modern &quot;ultra-typed&quot; Siamese.

The policy for full registration of Korats only allows blue cats of full-registered parents or third-generation supplementary-registered parents. It also requires genetic testing for gangliosidosis to be carried out to ensure that the breed remains free of this inherited disease which once existed in some Korat and Thai breeding lines.

The genes responsible for Pointeds and Lilacs were introduced into the Korat breed when new Korat breeding stock carrying the recessive genes was imported from Thailand. The first recorded Thai Lilac kitten was born to the Jenanca line in 1989, when &quot;Jenanca Lilac Lillee&quot; was born from two Korat parents in the U.K.. In 1990, Lillee&#x27;s parents were re-mated with more lilac kittens resulting. A young male lilac was then born to another pair, also in the U.K., allowing more crossings without inbreeding too closely.

The first recorded Thai Lilac Point was born to the Clairabelle line in 2014 when Clairabelle Pixie Dust was born from two Korat parents in the U.K.. A re-mating from the same parents resulted in another Thai Lilac Point, this time a boy, Clairabelle Ninja Rococoa. A third and fourth Thai Lilac Point has recently been born into the Jusarka line.

==Health==
The Korat is one of the more commonly affected breeds for gangliosidosis 1 and gangliosidosis 2. An autosomal recessive mutation in the GBL1 and HEXB gene respectively is responsible for the conditions in the breed.

Atherosclerosis conditions, typically never seen in cats, similar to human atherosclerosis, were also seen in Korat cats. A genetic predisposition is assumed rather than an underlying condition or medical treatment for these conditions in the cats.

<text>Western Visayas (; ; ) is an administrative region in the Philippines, numerically designated as Region VI. The region comprises the islands of Panay and Guimaras. It consists of five provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo on Panay, and the island province of Guimaras. The region also includes one highly urbanized city, Iloilo City, which is the largest city and serves as the regional center.

The Hiligaynon language, native to Iloilo City, is the region&#x27;s lingua franca. The region is also dominated by the native speakers of three Visayan languages: Kinaray-a, Aklanon and Capiznon. The land area of the region is , and with a population of 4,730,771 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The region&#x27;s current name is in reference to its geographic position in the greater Visayas area.

==History==

Regions first came into existence on September 24, 1972, when the provinces of the Philippines were organized into 11 regions by &quot;Presidential Decree No. 1&quot; as part of the &quot;Integrated Reorganization Plan&quot; by President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. The provinces of Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo (including its then-subprovince of Guimaras), and Negros Occidental were grouped together to form the Western Visayas region.

The province of Palawan was transferred to Region VI (Western Visayas) on May 23, 2005, by &quot;Executive Order 429&quot;. The Department of the Interior and Local Government announced in June 2005 that the transfer had been completed.
However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, &quot;Administrative Order No. 129&quot; was issued on August 19, 2005, to address this backlash. This Order directed the abeyance of &quot;Executive Order 429&quot; pending the approval of an implementation plan for the orderly transfer of Palawan from Region IV-B to Region VI. Hence, Palawan is currently still part of Region IV-B.

By virtue of &quot;Executive Order No. 183&quot; issued on May 29, 2015, by President Benigno Aquino III, the province of Negros Occidental and its capital, Bacolod, were both removed from Western Visayas in order to form the Negros Island Region along with Negros Oriental. But later regained Negros Occidental and its capital, Bacolod City back into Western Visayas on August 9, 2017, when President Rodrigo Duterte dissolved the Negros Island Region, revoking Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015 through the signage of Executive Order No. 38, citing the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management.

On June 13, 2024, the region again lost Negros Occidental and Bacolod when the Negros Island Region was reestablished under Republic Act No. 12000 signed by President Bongbong Marcos

=== Roads ===

Western Visayas is interconnected by major inter-provincial roads that facilitate travel across its provinces. Iloilo City, the region&#x27;s primary urban center, relies heavily on various public transportation options, including passenger jeepneys, modern Public Utility Jeepneys (modern PUJs), white metered taxis, and tricycles within city limits. In other cities and municipalities, such as Roxas City, Kalibo, and San Jose de Buenavista, tricycles are the primary mode of transport for short distances. Travel between cities and municipalities across Panay Island is typically facilitated by jeepneys, vans, and buses operated by companies like Ceres.

In March 2019, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) launched a Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service in Iloilo City, providing express bus services to airports in Cabatuan, Kalibo, and Caticlan (Boracay).

===Airports===

Western Visayas is served by two international airports and three domestic airports. Iloilo International Airport, located in Cabatuan, Iloilo, serves the general area of Metro Iloilo–Guimaras as well as the entire province of Iloilo, and a gateway into the region. Kalibo International Airport serves the general area of Aklan and is one of the two airports serving Boracay, the other being the domestic Godofredo P. Ramos Airport in Caticlan, Malay, Aklan. The other domestic airports are Roxas Airport, serving the general area of Roxas City and the province of Capiz, and Evelio B. Javier Airport, serving the general area of the province of Antique.

The other airports and airstrips in the region include Semirara Airport on Semirara Island in Caluya, Antique; Sicogon Airport on Sicogon Island in Carles, Iloilo; and Guimaras Airstrip.

<text>Nurmijärvi () is a municipality in Finland, located in the southern interior of the country. Nurmijärvi is situated in the Uusimaa region. The population of Nurmijärvi is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland and the most populous municipality without city status (). Nurmijärvi is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, which has approximately  million inhabitants. 

Nurmijärvi is located north of the capital, Helsinki. Nurmijärvi&#x27;s neighbouring municipalities are Espoo, Vantaa, Tuusula, Hyvinkää and Vihti. In recent decades, Nurmijärvi has been one of the fastest growing municipalities in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area and in Finland as a whole. The proximity to Helsinki has led to significant growth in the main villages such as Klaukkala, Rajamäki and Röykkä. Klaukkala is the largest built-up area in Nurmijärvi, which is now considered a suburb of Helsinki. The Nurmijärvi church village is the administrative centre of the parish, although population growth is clearly concentrated in Klaukkala.

Nurmijärvi literally means &quot;lawn lake&quot; although the lake that gave the municipality its name was drained in the early 20th century and is now nothing more than some flat fields near the village centre. Nurmijärvi is one of three municipalities in the Uusimaa region that does not have a Swedish name, the others being Askola and Mäntsälä.

The area of what is now Nurmijärvi was inhabited in prehistoric times, which refers to archaeological finds dating back to 4500–3500 BC. At the time of the Middle Ages there was no permanent settlement in the area, but later the settlement spread from both Tavastia and the coast to 15 villages in 1540 with 115 houses.

Administratively, Lake Nurmijärvi has been formed by combining the districts of Loppi, Vihti and Helsinki parish. The earliest documentary mention of Nurmijärvi dates back to 1488, when the village of Uotila was mentioned. According to the land register of 1539, Nurmijärvi had 15 villages with a total of 113 houses. An independent congregation had already been formed in 1605 and the administrator of Nurmijärvi was born in 1775, when the area had a population of 1471.

The first church in Lake Nurmijärvi, which must have been St. Martin&#x27;s Church in 1565, was built at the end of the Middle Ages. It was demolished on the way to a new church, completed in 1692, and the present church, completed in 1793 and designed by master builder Matti Åkerblom, is the third in order.

Lake Nurmijärvi has long been a strong farmer, and the share of fields in the total municipal area is almost one third, which is more than in many other municipalities in Finland. Horticultural crops have also been heavily cultivated and, for example, almost half of the wild cabbage harvest in Finland is produced in Nurmijärvi. Nevertheless, the municipality has not carried out further processing of agricultural products; for example, there has been no dairy.

The first industrial plants were born in the late 19th century, including Finland&#x27;s first pharmaceutical factory founded by pharmacist Albin Koponen in Nurmijärvi in 1899. The main products of the drug plant were filizine extracted from male fern root rhizomes, which were sold as &quot;Diphyllobothrium latum&quot; and cestoda medicines called Filisin and Filicon. The factory-produced filicin was sold encapsulated all the way to China and America. Today, trade, transport and other services account for two thirds, industry and construction for less than one third and agriculture for over 3% of the population. The largest individual employers are Altia Oyj and Teknos Oy in Rajamäki, Polimoon Oy in Klaukkala and Korsisaari Oy.

In the early 1960s, the settlement of Nurmijärvi was evenly distributed in different parts of the municipality. However, migration to Nurmijärvi began to accelerate around the middle of the decade and the focus of settlement shifted to the southern parts of the municipality. Already in 1970 the majority (65%) of the inhabitants of Nurmijärvi lived in urban settlements. The largest agglomerations at that time were Klaukkala (3,500 inhabitants), Rajamäki (3,400 inhabitants) and church village (2,800 inhabitants). Of these, the growth of Klaukkala and church village, in particular, has been based almost exclusively on the vicinity of the Helsinki metropolitan area. The most prominent farms on Lake Nurmijärvi have been the manors of Numlahti and Raala. Before the departure of Hyvinkää in 1917, the Kytäjä Manor as well as the whole of the Kytäjä village, were part of the Nurmijärvi parish.

== Geography ==

Nurmijärvi is located in the central part of Uusimaa. Salpausselkä passes through the northern part of the municipality via Röykkä, Kiljava and Rajamäki, and the River Vantaa flows through the Nukari and Palojoki rivers in the eastern part of the municipality. Nurmijärvi&#x27;s lowest terrain is in the Luhtajoki valley at Klaukkala and the highest in Salpausselkä near Herunen.

There are few watercourses in the Nurmijärvi area. The municipality is located along the middle course of the River Vantaa and there are two large rapids, the Nukarinkoski and the Myllykoski. The Kuhakoski rapids, located in the village of Perttula and flowing into Lake Valkjärvi, is also significant in terms of industrial history and at the same time a popular attraction with its waterfall. The River Vantaa is joined by the Palojoki River from Hyvinkää and Tuusula, near the Palojoki village. The Lepsämä River and the Luhtajoki River flowing in the southern part of the municipality join the Vantaa town side near the Keimola village before joining the River Vantaa. The largest lake in Nurmijärvi is the Lake Sääksi (which is partly situated on the northwest side of Hyvinkää), which is known for one of the most popular beaches in Finland, being located in the Kiljava village. The other lakes are Lake Vaaksi near Röykkä and Lake Valkjärvi between Klaukkala and Perttula.

==Demographics==
===Population and immigration===
The municipality of Nurmijärvi has inhabitants, making it the most populous municipality in Finland. The municipality of Nurmijärvi is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, which is the largest urban area in Finland with inhabitants. In Nurmijärvi, 7% of the population has a foreign background, which is below the national average.

== Transport ==
The most important traffic route through Nurmijärvi is Finnish national road 3 (Vt 3; E12) between cities of Helsinki and Tampere. The highway was built as a motorway in the 1990s, and the old highway next to it between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was numbered as Regional Road 130. Highway 3 is joined by Finnish national road 45 (Kt 45) on the Hyvinkää side from Hyrylä in Tuusula and through the eastern part of Nurmijärvi, and Finnish national road 25 (Vt 25) between Hanko and Porvoo passes through the northern part of the municipality near the Röykkä village. Other important roads are the Regional road 132 to Loppi and Karkkila via Klaukkala, Perttula and Röykkä and the connecting road 1311 to Rajamäki via the Nurmijärvi church village. The Hanko–Hyvinkää railway, which currently has only freight train traffic, also passes through Rajamäki and Röykkä. In Nurmijärvi, especially from Klaukkala, there are frequent bus services via Kivistö and Keimola of Vantaa to the Central Bus Terminal of Kamppi Center in Helsinki.

With the growth of Klaukkala, traffic congestion between Regional road 132 and Highway 3 has worsened so much over the years that the construction of a bypass road on the northside of Klaukkala as a new continuation of the regional road began in 2019. Although it was tentatively scheduled to be completed only in fall 2021, it is likely to be completed in summer and for traffic road may open as early as the end of 2020.

<text>Emigre, Inc., doing business as Emigre Fonts, is a digital type foundry based in Berkeley, California, that was founded in 1985 by husband-and-wife team Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko. The type foundry grew out of &quot;Emigre&quot; magazine, a publication founded by VanderLans and two Dutch friends who met in San Francisco, CA in 1984. Note that unlike the word &quot;émigré&quot;, Emigre is officially spelled without accents.

==History==

Emigre Fonts was founded as an independent foundry in 1985 quickly following the release of the first issue of Emigre magazine in 1984.

In a 2002 interview with Rhonda Rubinstein for Eye Magazine, Licko recalled the early days of her type design and the important relationship between the magazine and the foundry: “When I started building Macintosh bitmap fonts in 1984, it was a purely experimental endeavour. I didn’t have a client for these fonts, nor did I plan to start a type foundry. It was &quot;Emigre&quot; magazine that opened up these options. Rudy had started it (with two Dutch artists) as a showcase for émigré artists. Issue #3 was the turning point for my typeface experiments and for the magazine, as it was typeset entirely using my first Lo-Res fonts. We had a lot of inquiries about the availability of these typefaces that no one had seen before. It was the start of Emigre Fonts.&quot;Coinciding with the advent of the Macintosh computer, Emigre took advantage of the new medium to design digital typefaces without requiring the equipment or manufacturing infrastructure of a traditional type foundry. Rather than adhering to the aesthetics of metal type optimized for letterpress printing, Licko began designing fonts that embraced the limitations of bitmap graphics endemic to early PCs and the idiosyncrasies of dot matrix printing. Robin Kinross analyzed these fonts in a 1992 article for Eye Magazine: &quot;The early productions were rationalised by reference to the requirements of low-memory computing and low-resolution screen display and printer output, and show considerate ingenuity in juggling with a heavily reduced formal repertoire, to make coherent sets of characters.&quot; Continuing to embrace advances in technology, Licko later produced vector-based design. In addition to being one of the first companies to design original fonts made on and for a computer, Emigre Fonts was the first to sell licenses and transfer digital fonts online. Created by long-time Emigre collaborator, Tim Starback, the original system – called &quot;Now Serving&quot; – was built using FirstClass. Downloads could take up to one hour, requiring four to six modems (phone lines) to handle the demand. In time, a 56K &quot;digital&quot; connection to the Internet was added, which allowed customers all over the world to connect without long distance rates. Starback recalls those early days: &quot;Eventually we figured out how to get the web server to talk to our database and then authorize a credit card, still done with a dial-up modem. At that point, we had an automated system that could process orders and give the customer access to the font automatically. All the tech stuff was new to everyone, so we were all learning together.&quot;In the process, Emigre created the &quot;perfect model of an autonomous foundry run by designers. Many designers followed Emigre&#x27;s lead, joining their library or launching their own foundries.&quot;

Emigre Fonts developed or released some of the most cutting-edge typefaces of the late 1980s and 1990s. Their success as pioneers in the digital type industry is in no small part credited to their eager adoption of new technologies and ability to recognize skill in contemporary designers, as expressed in a 2016 interview of Licko by Sally Kerrigan for Adobe Typekit:“Each of our font families exudes a certain quality that is either tied to the technology of the time, the level of craftsmanship of the designer, or the prevailing aesthetic preferences of the time. Because the Emigre library developed over the past 30 years, alongside and in reaction to evolving technologies, each typeface is like a snapshot in time.”During this early digital period when design professionals were combining analog and digital production methods, Emigre’s print magazine (known for featuring graphic design criticism and experimental layouts) doubled as an advertising venue for Emigre’s typefaces by showcasing their fonts in use off-screen. Though many of Emigre&#x27;s fonts are considered icons of Postmodern design, Emigre didn’t limit themselves. Licko’s popular revivals, Mrs Eaves (based on Baskerville) and Filosofia (based on Bodoni), were a departure from this style.

In an interview in Emigre No. 15, in response to a question about the legibility of her experimental bitmap fonts, Licko stated that &quot;You read best what you read most,&quot; indicating that fonts such as Helvetica and Times Roman are not intrinsically legible but become so through repeated use. This was a highly contested opinion within the world of type design that generated heated discussion in the pages of Emigre magazine and elsewhere. This was later referred to as the “Legibility wars” – a term coined in 2004 by Robin Kinross in his book &quot;Modern Typography: an Essay in Critical History&quot;.

Emigre was often criticized for rejecting Modernist design rules. Massimo Vignelli, a prominent designer and voice in the graphic design field, was highly critical of the foundry. Vignelli famously called Emigre a “typographic garbage factory,” insinuating that they were either a threat to the dominant graphic design ideals or insignificant as an “aberration of culture” in a typography panel discussion reported on in a 1991 issue of Print Magazine. This sparked an intense debate in the industry for much of the 1990s. To Vignelli&#x27;s later collaboration with Emigre to directly promote the release of Licko’s Filosofia typeface by designing the poster to announce the release, Licko responded: “Massimo’s willingness to collaborate on our announcement reflects Emigre’s ability to bridge different approaches.”

In 2011, The Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired five Emigre typeface families. The digital fonts are Keedy Sans by Mr. Keedy, Mason Serif by Jonathan Barnbrook, Template Gothic by Barry Deck, Oakland (a.k.a Lo-Res) by Zuzana Licko, and Dead History by P. Scott Makela. They were added to the Architecture and design Collection as part of a selection of 23 digital typefaces documenting milestone designs covering the twentieth century. The acquisition followed in the footsteps of the Museum&#x27;s first ever typeface acquisition, a case of 36-point Helvetica Bold lead type designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman in 1957 for the Haas type foundry in Münchenstein, Switzerland. The typefaces were on display as part of the exhibit “Standard Deviations: Types and Families in Contemporary Design.”

Emigre remained faithful to their belief that legibility is a byproduct of exposure or practice. “People read best what they read most,” was a manifesto that encouraged VanderLans and Licko to continue exploring new designs. The idea that new typefaces or layouts could become not just more legible but better for their intended uses and technologies than old ones gave birth to a full library of new designs for a new digital era. Refusing to waver in the wake of criticism, Licko and VanderLans forged their own path, revolutionizing design aesthetics and becoming one of the most influential digital type foundries.

<text>The Interpretation of Music is a book by Thurston Dart. It is described by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;the best direct and concise account of the issues of performance&quot;.

This book deals with correct performance conventions and procedures relevant to different periods and styles (for example Gregorian intonation, divisions upon parts, French baroque over-dotting, etc.). It covers these various topics in a chronological order, also giving descriptions of period instruments and their uses. It is a book useful for those wishing to compose in a more authentic antiquated style, and for those wishing to make performances more historically &quot;correct&quot;.

<doc id="298925" wikidata="Q1146315" url="?curid=298925" title="Take the Money and Run (film)">
<text>Take the Money and Run is a 1969 American mockumentary crime comedy film directed by Woody Allen. Allen co-wrote the screenplay with Mickey Rose and stars alongside Janet Margolin. The film chronicles the life of Virgil Starkwell, an inept bank robber.

Filmed in San Francisco and San Quentin State Prison, &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; received Golden Laurel nominations for Male Comedy Performance (Woody Allen) and Male New Face (Woody Allen), and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen (Woody Allen, Mickey Rose).

==Plot==
Virgil Starkwell&#x27;s story parodies prison documentary style, using &quot;archival footage&quot; and &quot;interviews&quot; with people who knew him. Virgil&#x27;s parents are so ashamed that they wear Groucho glasses during their interviews to hide their identity. As a child, Virgil is a frequent target of bullies, who take his glasses and stamp on them on the floor. In school, he scores well on an IQ test, but his teacher relates that when he stole a fountain pen, she instructed the class to close their eyes so the thief could return it. While all eyes were closed, Virgil returned the pen, but took the opportunity to &quot;feel&quot; all the girls.

As an adult, Virgil is clumsy and socially awkward. Stealing a gun to rob an armored truck, during a shootout with the guards, he finds that his gun is a cigarette lighter. Arrested, Virgil attempts an escape from prison using a bar of soap carved to resemble a gun, but his &quot;gun&quot; dissolves in the rain. He was sentenced to an additional two years but was released on bail after he volunteered to receive an experimental vaccine, following which he briefly became an ultra-Orthodox Jew.

Out on parole, Virgil&#x27;s attempt to rob a local pet shop fails when a gorilla chases him away. In the park, he meets Louise; Virgil recounts that after 15 minutes he knew he was in love and wanted to marry her, after 30 minutes he gave up the idea of snatching her purse. Virgil steals coins from a gumball machine (parody of &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;), paying for dinner with nickels.

Virgil&#x27;s attempt to rob a bank is stymied by an argument about his handwriting on a demand note. The cashier asks what &quot;I am pointing a &#x27;gub&#x27; at you&quot; means, and Virgil insists it says &quot;gun&quot;; the cashier&#x27;s supervisor asks what &quot;Abt natural&quot; means. Virgil insists it&#x27;s &quot;act natural&quot;. While over a dozen bank employees attempt to decipher the note, the police arrive. Virgil is sentenced to 10 years in maximum security. He asks Louise to bake him a cake with a gun in it and a dozen chocolate cookies with a bullet in each (she does not). Virgil joins a mass breakout plan, but the guards become suspicious when all their uniforms are missing from the laundry. The breakout is called off, and Virgil is the only inmate not informed, but manages to escape anyway.

Virgil marries Louise, but finds it difficult to support his family. Lying about his background, he is hired in the mailroom. In a parody of &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, he is blackmailed by a fellow employee, Miss Blair, who forces him into a romantic relationship. Deciding to kill his blackmailer, he disguises sticks of dynamite as candles. He attempts to run her over with his car, but she evades it. He attempts to stab her with a knife, but grabs a turkey leg by mistake and stabs her with it. She finally lights the &quot;candles&quot; that explode.

Another bank robbery is botched when a second gang also holds up the bank, and the customers vote that they prefer the other gang to rob the bank. Virgil is sentenced to 10 years on a chain gang, where he is tortured in a penalty box with an insurance salesman. In a parody of &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, Virgil asks another prisoner whether his aim is good enough to smash his chain with a sledgehammer; his aim misses and Virgil&#x27;s foot is hit instead. In a parody of &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, Virgil and 5 other prisoners—including two black prisoners—all chained together make a break for it while on work detail. Attempting to scatter, they don&#x27;t get very far. They take an old woman hostage, telling her to pretend to the police that they are her cousins and attempting to hide their chains by standing close together and moving in unison. They knock out the officer and escape, hiding out with Louise.

An FBI agent relates that Virgil is recaptured attempting to rob a former friend who is now a policeman. Virgil is tried on 52 counts of robbery and sentenced to 800 years, but remains optimistic reasoning, &quot;with good behavior, I can get that cut in half.&quot; In the final scene, Virgil is carving a bar of soap and asking the interviewer if it is raining outside.

==Cast==
==Production==
This was the second film directed by Woody Allen, and the first with original footage (after &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot;, which consisted of visuals taken from a Japanese James Bond knockoff). He had originally wanted Jerry Lewis to direct, but when that did not work out, Allen decided to direct it himself. Allen&#x27;s decision to become his own director was partially spurred on by the chaotic and uncontrolled filming of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), in which he had appeared two years previously. This film marked the first time Allen would perform the triple duties of writing, directing, and acting in a film. The manic, almost slapstick style is similar to that of Allen&#x27;s next several films, including &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973).

Allen discussed the concept of filming a documentary in an interview with Richard Schickel:

The film was shot on location in San Francisco, including scenes filmed at a Bank of America branch on the 4th of July 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;diva.sfsu/185966&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ernie&#x27;s restaurant, whose striking red interior was immortalized in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958). Other scenes were filmed at San Quentin State Prison, where 100 prisoners were paid a small fee to work on the film. The regular cast and crew were stamped each day with a special ink that glowed under ultra-violet light so the guards could tell who was allowed to leave the prison grounds at the end of the day. (One of the actors in the San Quentin scenes was Micil Murphy, who knew the prison well: he had served five and a half years there, for armed robbery, before being paroled in 1966.)

Allen initially filmed a downbeat ending in which he was shot to death, courtesy of special effects from A.D. Flowers. Reputedly the lighter ending is due to the influence of Allen&#x27;s editor, Ralph Rosenblum, in his first collaboration with Allen.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened on August 18, 1969 at the 68th St. Playhouse in New York City and grossed a house record $33,478 in its first week and even more in its second week with $35,999.

By 1973, the film had earned rentals of $2,590,000 in the United States and Canada and $450,000 in other countries. After all costs were deducted, it reported a loss of $610,000.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly positive reviews. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy—something very special and eccentric and funny&quot;, even though toward the end &quot;a certain monotony sets in&quot; with Allen&#x27;s comedy rhythm. In his later review of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, Canby revised his opinion of &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, stating &quot;&quot;Annie Hall&quot; is not terribly far removed from &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, his first work as a triple-threat man, which is not to put down the new movie but to upgrade the earlier one&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; found the film to have many funny moments, but &quot;in the last analysis it isn&#x27;t a very funny movie&quot;, with the fault lying with its visual humor and editing. In October 2013, the film was voted by the &quot;Guardian&quot; readers as the sixth best film directed by Allen.

Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote: 

On the review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% positive rating with an average rating of 6.9/10, based on 23 reviews.

===Awards and honors===
* Golden Laurel Nomination for Male Comedy Performance (Woody Allen)
* Golden Laurel Nomination for Male New Face (Woody Allen)

<doc id="298926" wikidata="Q711172" url="?curid=298926" title="W. Ross Ashby">
<text>William Ross Ashby (6 September 1903 – 15 November 1972) was an English psychiatrist and a pioneer in cybernetics, the study of the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things. His first name was not used: he was known as Ross Ashby.

His two books, &quot;Design for a Brain&quot; and &quot;An Introduction to Cybernetics&quot;, introduced exact and logical thinking into the brand new discipline of cybernetics and were highly influential. These &quot;missionary works&quot; along with his technical contributions made Ashby &quot;the major theoretician of cybernetics after Wiener&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
William Ross Ashby was born in 1903 in London, where his father was working at an advertising agency. From 1921 he studied at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he received his B.A. in 1924 and his M.B. and B.Ch. in 1928. From 1924 to 1928 he worked at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. Later on he also received a Diploma in Psychological Medicine in 1931, and an M.A. 1930 and M.D. from Cambridge in 1935.

==Career==

Ashby started working in 1930 as a Clinical Psychiatrist at the London County Council. From 1936 until 1947 he was a Research Pathologist at St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital in Northampton in England. From 1945 to 1947 he served in India where he was a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps.

When he returned to England, he served as Director of Research of the Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester from 1947 until 1959. For a year, he was Director of the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol. In 1960, he went to the United States and became Professor, Depts. of Biophysics and Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, until his retirement in 1970.

Ashby was president of the Society for General Systems Research from 1962 to 1964. After retiring in August 1970, he became an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the University of Wales in 1970 and a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971. In June 1972 he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, and he died on 15 November.

== Work ==
Despite being widely influential within cybernetics, systems theory and, more recently, complex systems, Ashby is not as well known as many of the notable scientists his work influenced, including Herbert A. Simon, Norbert Wiener, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Stafford Beer, Stanley Milgram, and Stuart Kauffman.

=== Journal ===
Ashby kept a journal for over 44 years in which he recorded his ideas about new theories. He started May 1928, when he was medical student at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. Over the years, he wrote down a series of 25 volumes totaling 7,189 pages. In 2003, these journals were given to The British Library, London, and in 2008, they were made available online as The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive. Ashby initially considered his theorizing a private hobby, and his later decision to begin publishing his work caused him some distress. He wrote: 
My fear is now that I may become conspicuous, for a book of mine is in the press. For this sort of success I have no liking. My ambitions are vague—someday to produce something faultless.

Ashby found writing so difficult that he took correspondence courses in &quot;Effective English and Personal Efficiency&quot; to prepare to write his first book.

=== Adaptation ===
Ashby was interested in mechanistic explanations for adaptive behavior, especially in the brain. By 1941, he had developed a coherent theory and written a 197-page booklet, titled &quot;The Origin of Adaptation&quot;. This hand-written monograph was made publicly available in January 2021. In it, he expressed his opinion that &quot;there is an abstract science of organisation, in the sense that there are laws, theories and discoveries to be made about organisation as such without asking what it is that is organised.&quot;

In 1948 Ashby built a machine, the homeostat, to demonstrate his theories. The machine used a simple mechanical process to return to equilibrium states after disturbances at its input. Earlier, in 1946, Alan Turing had written a letter to Ashby suggesting that Ashby use Turing&#x27;s Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) for his experiments instead of building a special machine. Norbert Wiener, describing the appearance of purposeful behavior in the Homeostat&#x27;s random search for equilibrium, called it &quot;one of the great philosophical contributions of the present day&quot;. Ashby&#x27;s first book, &quot;Design for a Brain&quot;, was published in 1952 and recapitulated this line of research.

=== Cybernetics ===
Ashby was one of the original members of the Ratio Club, a small informal dining club of young psychologists, physiologists, mathematicians and engineers who met to discuss issues in cybernetics. The club was founded in 1949 by the neurologist John Bates and continued to meet until 1958.

The title of his book &quot;An Introduction to Cybernetics&quot; popularised the usage of the term &#x27;cybernetics&#x27; to refer to self-regulating systems, originally coined by Norbert Wiener in &quot;&quot;. The book gave accounts of homeostasis, adaptation, memory and foresight in living organisms in Ashby&#x27;s determinist, mechanist terms.

Ashby&#x27;s 1964 paper &quot;Constraint Analysis of Many-Dimensional Relations&quot; began the study of reconstructability analysis, a multivariate systems modeling methodology based on set theory and information theory, which would later be developed by Klaus Krippendorff, George Klir, and others.

In 1970, Ashby collaborated on simulation experiments regarding the stability of large interconnected systems. This work inspired Robert May&#x27;s studies of stability and complexity in model ecosystems.

=== Variety ===
In &quot;An Introduction to Cybernetics&quot;, Ashby used set cardinality, or variety, as a measure of information. With this he formulated his Law of Requisite Variety. Mathematically, the law is a statement about how &quot;in a two-person game the variety possible is determined by the number of possible choices open to the two players&quot;. When regulation is seen as a game between a regulator formula_1 and source of disturbances formula_2, &quot;only variety in formula_1 can force down the variety due to formula_2; &quot;only variety can destroy variety.&quot;&quot;

In work with Ashby, Conant augmented this with the &quot;Good Regulator theorem&quot; stating that &quot;every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system&quot;. Stafford Beer applied the law of variety to the practice of management, founding management cybernetics and developing the Viable System Model.

A popular paraphrasing of the law is &quot;only complexity absorbs complexity&quot;. However, while a web search reveals many attributions to Ashby, it appears such attribution is in error. The phrase is not listed by the Cybernetics Society.

== Legacy ==
The Papers of William Ross Ashby are housed at the British Library. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.

On 4–6 March 2004, a W. Ross Ashby centenary conference was held at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Presenters at the conference included Stuart Kauffman, Stephen Wolfram and George Klir. In February 2009, a special issue of the International Journal of General Systems was specifically devoted to Ashby and his work, containing papers from leading scholars such as Klaus Krippendorff, Stuart Umpleby and Kevin Warwick.

Ashby&#x27;s work on the law of requisite variety has influenced scholars within the field of management studies.

<doc id="298931" wikidata="Q11181633" url="?curid=298931" title="Jujube">
<text>Jujube (UK ; US or ), sometimes jujuba, scientific name Ziziphus jujuba, and also called red date, Chinese date, and Chinese jujube, is a species in the genus &quot;Ziziphus&quot; in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae. It is often confused with the closely related Indian jujube, &quot;Z.mauritiana&quot;. The Chinese jujube enjoys a diverse range of climates from temperate to tropical, whereas the Indian jujube is restricted to warmer subtropical and tropical climates.

==Description==
It is a small deciduous tree or shrub reaching a height of , usually with thorny branches. The leaves are shiny-green, ovate-acute, long and wide, with three conspicuous veins at the base, and a finely toothed margin. The flowers are small, wide, with five inconspicuous yellowish-green petals. The fruit is an edible oval drupe deep; when immature it is smooth-green, with the consistency and taste of an apple with lower acidity, maturing brown to purplish-black, and eventually wrinkled, looking like a small date. There is a single hard kernel, similar to an olive pit, containing two seeds.
=== Chemistry ===
Leaves contain saponin and ziziphin, which suppresses the ability to perceive sweet taste.

Flavinoids found in the fruits include Kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside, Quercetine 3-O-robinobioside, Quercetine 3-O-rutinoside. Terpenoids such as colubrinic acid and alphitolic acid were found in the fruits.

==Taxonomy==
The ultimate source of the name is Ancient Greek &quot;zízyphon&quot;. This was borrowed into Classical Latin as (used for the fruit) and (the tree). A descendant of the Latin word into a Romance language, which may have been French or medieval Latin , in turn gave rise to the common English &quot;jujube&quot;. This name is not related to jojoba, which is a loan from Spanish , itself borrowed from &quot;hohohwi&quot;, the name of that plant in the Oʼodham language.

The binomial name has a complex history, due to a combination of botanical naming regulations, and variations in spelling. It was first named in the binomial system by Carl Linnaeus as &quot;Rhamnus zizyphus&quot;, in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753). Philip Miller, in his &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, considered that the jujube and its relatives were sufficiently distinct from &quot;Rhamnus&quot; to be placed in a separate genus (as it had already been by the pre-Linnaean author Tournefort in 1700), and in the 1768 edition he gave it the name &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot; (using Tournefort&#x27;s spelling for the genus name). For the species name, he used a different name, as tautonyms (repetition of exactly the same name in the genus and species) are not permitted in botanical naming. However, because of Miller&#x27;s slightly different spelling, the combination of the earlier species name (from Linnaeus) with the new genus, &quot;Ziziphus zizyphus&quot;, is &quot;not&quot; a tautonym, and was therefore permitted as a botanical name. This combination was made by Hermann Karsten in 1882. In 2006, a proposal was made to suppress the name &quot;Ziziphus zizyphus&quot; in favor of &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot;, and this proposal was accepted in 2011. &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot; is thus the correct scientific name for this species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Its precise natural distribution is uncertain due to extensive cultivation. However, its origin is thought to be in southwest Asia, between Lebanon, northern India, and southern and central China, and possibly also southeastern Europe though more likely introduced there. It grows wild but is also a garden shrub, kept for its fruit.

The tree tolerates a wide range of temperatures and rainfall, though it requires hot summers and sufficient water for acceptable fruiting. Unlike most of the other species in the genus, it tolerates fairly cold winters, surviving temperatures down to about , and the tree is, for instance, commonly cultivated in Beijing. This wide tolerance enables the jujube to grow in mountain or desert habitats, provided there is access to underground water throughout the summer. The jujube (&quot;Z. jujuba&quot;) grows in cooler regions of Asia. Five or more other species of &quot;Ziziphus&quot; are widely distributed in milder climates to hot deserts of Asia and Africa.

This plant has been introduced in Madagascar and grows as an invasive species in the western part of the island, threatening mostly protected areas. It is cultivated in parts of southern California.

==Ecology==
Witch&#x27;s broom, prevalent in China and Korea, is the main disease affecting jujubes, though plantings in North America currently are not affected by any pests or diseases. In Europe, the last several years have seen some 80%–90% of the jujube crop eaten by insect larvae (see picture), including those of the false codling moth, &quot;Thaumatotibia (Cryptophlebia) leucotreta&quot;.

In Madagascar, it is widely eaten by free-ranging zebus, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces.
== Cultivation ==
Jujube was domesticated in South Asia by 9000 BC. Over 400 cultivars have been selected.

The fruit, when the plant is kept as a garden shrub, is picked in the autumn.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
The freshly harvested, as well as the candied dried fruit, are often eaten as a snack, or with coffee. Smoked jujubes are consumed in Vietnam and are referred to as black jujubes. A drink can be made by crushing the pulp in water. Both China and Korea produce a sweetened tea syrup containing jujube fruit in glass jars, and canned jujube tea or jujube tea in the form of teabags. To a lesser extent, jujube fruit is made into juice and jujube vinegar (called or in Chinese). They are used for making pickles (কুলের আচার) in west Bengal and Bangladesh. In Assam it is known as &quot;Bogori&quot; and the pickle, Bogori aachar (বগৰি আচাৰ), is famous. In China, a wine made from jujube fruit is called &quot;hong zao jiu&quot; (红枣酒).

Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with &quot;baijiu&quot; (Chinese liquor), which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time, especially through the winter. Such jujubes are called &quot;zui zao&quot; (醉枣; literally &quot;drunk jujube&quot;). The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies (e.g. 甑糕 jing gao, a steamed rice cake).

In Vietnam and Taiwan, fully mature, nearly ripe fruit is harvested and sold on the local markets and also exported to Southeast Asian countries. The dried fruit is used in desserts in China and Vietnam, such as &quot;ching bo leung&quot;, a cold beverage that includes the dried jujube, longan, fresh seaweed, barley, and lotus seeds.

In Korea, jujubes are called &quot;daechu&quot; (대추) and are used in &quot;daechucha&quot;, &quot;yakshik&quot; and &quot;samgyetang&quot;.

On his visit to Medina, the 19th-century English explorer, Sir Richard Burton, observed that the local variety of jujube fruit was widely eaten. He describes its taste as like &quot;a bad plum, an unripe cherry, and an insipid apple&quot;. He gives the local names for three varieties as &quot;Hindi (Indian), Baladi (native), Tamri (date-like).&quot; A hundred years ago, a close variety was common in the Jordan valley and around Jerusalem. The bedouin valued the fruit, calling it &quot;nabk&quot;. It could be dried and kept for winter or made into a paste which was used as bread.

In Persian cuisine, the dried drupes are known as &quot;annab&quot;, while in neighboring Armenia, it is commonly eaten as a snack, and is known as &quot;unab&quot;. Confusion in the common name apparently is widespread. The &quot;unab&quot; is &quot;Z. jujuba&quot;. Rather, &quot;ber&quot; is used for three other cultivated or wild species, e.g., &quot;Z. spina-christi&quot;, &quot;Z. mauritiana&quot; and &quot;Z. nummularia&quot; in parts of India and is eaten both fresh and dried. The Arabic name &quot;sidr&quot; is used for &quot;Ziziphus&quot; species other than &quot;Z. jujuba&quot;.

Traditionally in India, the fruits are dried in the sun and the hard seeds removed, after which the dried flesh is pounded with tamarind, red chillies, salt, and jaggery. In some parts of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, fresh whole ripe fruit is crushed with the above ingredients and sun-dried to make cakes called &quot;ilanthai vadai&quot; or &quot;regi vadiyalu&quot; (Telugu). It is also commonly consumed as a snack.

In Northern and Northeastern India the fruit is eaten fresh with salt and chilli flakes and also preserved as candy, jam or pickle with oil and spices.

In Madagascar, jujube fruit is eaten fresh or dried. People also use it to make jam. A jujube honey is produced in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.

Italy has an alcoholic syrup called &quot;brodo di giuggiole&quot;.

In Croatia, especially Dalmatia, jujubes are used in marmalades, juices, and &quot;rakija&quot; (fruit brandy).

In Senegal and The Gambia, Jujube is called Sii dem or Ceedem, and the fruit is used as snack and also turned into a dried paste favoured as a sweetmeat by schoolchildren. More recently it has been processed and sold in Dakar by women.

In Australia jujube beer is made.

The commercial jujube candy popular in movie theaters originally contained jujube juice but now uses other flavorings.

In Laoling, China, jujube juice and wine are made.

===Traditional Chinese medicine===
The fruit and its seeds are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Kampo for many purposes. Some investigational research indicates possibilities related to their traditional use to alleviate stress and for sedation. In these systems, it is also believed to have uses as an antiseptic/antifungal agent, anti-inflammatory, contraceptive, and muscle relaxer. It is also thought to help in regulation of blood pressure, stimulate the immune system, prevent ulcers and aid in wound healing. Jujube fruit is also combined with other herbs to treat colds and influenza. It is used to protect and heal the kidneys, heart, and spleen. Jujube is also one of the ingredients used in Chinese medicine to modulate the effects of other herbs, preventing overpowering effects or clashing properties.

The fruit contains many different healthy properties like vitamins and amino acids.

===Other uses===
In Japan, the &quot;natsume&quot; has given its name to a style of tea caddy used in the Japanese tea ceremony, due to the similar shape. Its hard, oily wood was, along with pear, used for woodcuts to print books starting in the 8th century and continuing through the 19th in China and neighboring countries. As many as 2000 copies could be produced from one jujube woodcut.

The timber is sometimes used for small items, such as tuning pegs for instruments. Select grade Jujube timber is often used in traditional Asian instruments for fingerboard, pegs, rests &amp; soundposts, ribs &amp; necks etc. It has a medium to hard density similar to luthier grade European maple and has excellent tonal qualities. Jujube Wood can be found in local folk instruments from Ceylon/India thru to China/Korea; it is also commonly used in China in violin &amp; cello making for overseas export, though usually stained black to imitate the look of ebony.

== Culture ==
In Arabic-speaking regions the jujube and alternatively the species &quot;Z. lotus&quot; are closely related to the lote-trees (sing. سدرة &quot;sidrah&quot;, pl. سدر &quot;sidr&quot;) which are mentioned in the Quran, while in Palestine the species &quot;Z. spina-christi&quot; is called &quot;sidr&quot;.

An ancient jujube tree in the city Al-Qurnah, Iraq, is claimed by locals as the Tree of Knowledge mentioned in the Bible. Local tradition holds that the place where the city was built was the original site of the Garden of Eden (a passage in the Book of Genesis creation narrative says that a river flowed from the garden and split into Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where the city is currently). The tree is a tourist spot in the town.

Jujube tree is important in Hinduism too as Vishnu is worshipped in a major temple, in Badrinath, from the Sanskrit compound Badarīnātha, consisting of the terms &quot;badarī&quot; (jujube tree) and &quot;nātha&quot; (lord), an epithet of Vishnu. It is also known as Badarikashrama.

<doc id="298937" wikidata="Q13708" url="?curid=298937" title="Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao">
<text>The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (; &quot;Al-ḥukm adh-dhātī al-&#x27;iqlīmī li-muslimī Mindanāu&quot;; ARMM) was an autonomous region of the Philippines, located in the Mindanao island group of the Philippines, that consisted of five predominantly Muslim provinces: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. It was the only region that had its own government. The region&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; seat of government was Cotabato City, although this self-governing city was outside its jurisdiction.

The ARMM included the province of Shariff Kabunsuan from its creation in 2006 until July 16, 2008, when Shariff Kabunsuan ceased to exist as a province after the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the &quot;Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act 201&quot;, which created it, unconstitutional in &quot;Sema v. COMELEC and Dilangalen&quot;.

On October 7, 2012, President Benigno Aquino III said that the government aimed to have peace in the autonomous region and that it would become known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, a compound of &quot;bangsa&quot; (nation) and &quot;Moro&quot;. On July 26, 2018, Aquino&#x27;s successor, President Rodrigo Duterte, signed the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which paved the way for the establishment of a new autonomous political entity in the area, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

ARMM was nominally disestablished after the ratification of BOL and will be effectively replaced by the BARMM upon the constitution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, an interim government for the region. The law was &quot;deemed ratified&quot; on January 25, 2019, following the January 21 plebiscite.

==Geography==
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was situated in mainland Mindanao in the southern Philippines and was created by virtue of the Republic Act No. 6734 which signed into law by President Corazon Aquino on August 1, 1989. The plebiscite was conducted in the proposed area of ARMM on November 17, 1989, in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

The region was strengthened and expanded through the ratification of Republic Act No. 9054, amending for the purpose of Republic Act No. 6734, entitled &quot;An Act Providing for the ARMM&quot; as amended in September 2001. The plebiscite paved the way for the inclusion of the province of Basilan and the city of Marawi as part of ARMM.

==History==
For the most part of Philippines&#x27; history, the region and most of Mindanao have been a separate territory, which enabled it to develop its own culture and identity. The region has been the traditional homeland of Muslim Filipinos since the 15th century, even before the arrival of the Spanish, who began to colonize most of the Philippines in 1565. Muslim missionaries arrived in Tawi-Tawi in 1380 and started living in the area and the conversion of the native population to Islam. In 1457, the Sultanate of Sulu was founded, and not long after that, the sultanates of Maguindanao and Buayan were also established. At the time when most of the Philippines was under Spanish rule, these sultanates maintained their independence and regularly challenged Spanish domination of the Philippines by conducting raids on Spanish coastal towns in the north and repulsing repeated Spanish incursions in their territory. It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that the Sultanate of Sulu formally recognized Spanish suzerainty, but these areas remained loosely controlled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements in Zamboanga and Cotabato, until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War.

The Moros had a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for over 400 years. The violent armed struggle against the Japanese, Filipinos, Spanish, and Americans is considered by current Moro Muslim leaders as part of the four centuries long &quot;national liberation movement&quot; of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro Muslims persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state.

In 1942, during the early stages of the Pacific War of the Second World War, troops of the Japanese Imperial Forces invaded and overran Mindanao, and the native Moro Muslims waged an insurgency against the Japanese. Three years later, in 1945, combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth Army troops liberated Mindanao, and with the help of local guerrilla units, ultimately defeated the Japanese forces occupying the region.

===Precursors===
In the 1970s, escalating hostilities between government forces and the Moro National Liberation Front prompted President Ferdinand Marcos to issue a proclamation forming an Autonomous Region in the Southern Philippines. This was, however, turned down by a plebiscite. In 1979, Batas Pambansa No. 20 created a Regional Autonomous Government in the Western and Central Mindanao regions.

===Establishment of the ARMM===
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao region was first created on August 1, 1989, through &quot;Republic Act No. 6734&quot; (otherwise known as the Organic Act), primarily authored by Aquilino Pimentel Jr., in pursuance with a constitutional mandate to provide for an autonomous area in Muslim Mindanao. A plebiscite was held in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay; and in the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Isabela, Koronadal, Iligan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa, and Zamboanga to determine if their residents wished to be part of the ARMM. Of these areas, only six provinces — Basilan (including Isabela City), Lanao del Sur (including Marawi City), Maguindanao del Norte (including Cotabato City), Maguindanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi — voted in favor of inclusion in the new autonomous region. The ARMM was officially inaugurated on November 6, 1990 in Cotabato City, which was designated as its provisional capital. Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 42, enacted on September 22, 1995, sought to permanently fix the seat of regional government at Parang in Maguindanao del Norte, pending the completion of required buildings and infrastructure. However, the move to Parang was never made. Until the passage of Republic Act No. 9054 in 2001, which directed the ARMM Regional Government to once again fix a new permanent seat of government in an area within its jurisdiction, Cotabato City remained the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of ARMM&#x27;s government.

===2001 expansion of the ARMM===
A new law, &quot;Republic Act No. 9054&quot;, was passed by Congress on February 7, 2001, with a view to expand the territory and powers of the ARMM by amending the original Organic Act (&quot;R.A. No. 6734&quot;) and calling for a plebiscite to ratify the amendments and confirm which other provinces and cities would like to join the region. RA 9054 lapsed into law on March 31, 2001, without the signature of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. A plebiscite was held on August 14 in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, and Zamboanga Sibugay, and the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Iligan, Kidapawan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa, Digos, Koronadal, Tacurong, and Zamboanga. In the plebiscite, a majority of votes cast in the original four provinces were in favor of the amendments; outside these areas, only Marawi and the province of Basilan (excluding Isabela City) opted to be included in the ARMM.

===Creation and disestablishment of Shariff Kabunsuan===

The ARMM&#x27;s sixth province, Shariff Kabunsuan, was carved out of Maguindanao on October 28, 2006. However, on July 16, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines voided the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan, declaring unconstitutional Section 19 in RA 9054 which granted the ARMM Regional Assembly the power to create provinces and cities. The Supreme Court held that only Congress was empowered to create provinces and cities because the creation of such necessarily included the power to create legislative districts, which explicitly under the Philippine Constitution was within the sole prerogative of Congress to establish.

===Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain===
On July 18, 2008, Hermogenes Esperon, peace advisor to then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, in his talks with Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels in Malaysia, revealed the planned expansion of the region. The deal, negotiated in secret talks with the MILF and subject to approval, would give the ARMM control of an additional 712 villages on the south west portion of Mindanao, as well as broader political and economic powers.

Massive protests, however, greeted the move of the Philippine government and MILF panels in signing a Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain as a majority of the local government units where these barangays are connected have already opted not to join the ARMM in two instances, 1989 and 2001.

On August 4, 2008, after local officials from Cotabato asked the Supreme Court to block the signing of the agreement between the Philippine government and MILF, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) between the Philippine government and the MILF rebels in Malaysia. Several lawmakers had filed petitions with the Supreme Court to stop the Philippine government from concluding the MOA-AD due to lack of transparency and for MILF&#x27;s failure to cut ties with the al-Qaeda-linked terrorist network Jemaah Islamiyah, which aims to establish a pan-Islamic state in Southeast Asia using MILF camps in southwestern Mindanao as training grounds and staging points for attacks.

On October 14, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, by a vote of 8–7, declared “contrary to law and the Constitution” the Ancestral Domain Aspect (MOA-AD) of the Tripoli Agreement on Peace of 2001 between the Philippine government and the MILF. The 89-page decision, written by Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales ruled: “In sum, the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process committed grave abuse of discretion when he failed to carry out the pertinent consultation process, as mandated by EO No. 3, RA 7160, and RA 8371. The furtive process by which the MOA-AD was designed and crafted runs contrary to and in excess of the legal authority, and amounts to a whimsical, capricious, oppressive, arbitrary and despotic exercise thereof. It illustrates a gross evasion of positive duty and a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined.”

===Bangsamoro state===
Due to the challenges in establishing the Bangsamoro entity in the previous administrations, then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City announced his intent to establish a federal form of government which would replace the unitary form of government in his campaign speeches for the 2016 Philippine presidential election, which he subsequently won. In his plan, ARMM, along with the areas that voted to be included in ARMM in 2001, plus Isabela City and Cotabato City, will become part of a federal state. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., a Duterte ally and advocate for federalism, said in an interview that Isabela City, Basilan, Lamitan, Sulu, and Tawi-tawi may become a single federal state, while Lanao del Sur, Marawi, Cotabato City, and Maguindanao may become a single federal state as well because the Muslims of the Sulu archipelago have a different heritage from the Muslims in mainland Mindanao.

==Demographics==

==Administrative divisions==
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao consisted of 2 &quot;component&quot; cities, 116 municipalities, and 2,490 barangays. The cities of Isabela and Cotabato were not under the administrative jurisdiction of the ARMM despite the former being part of Basilan and the latter geographically considered but not politically part of Maguindanao province.

==Government==

===ARMM organizational structure===
====Executive====
The region was headed by a Regional Governor. The Regional Governor and Regional Vice Governor were elected directly like regular local executives. Regional ordinances were created by the Regional Assembly, composed of Assemblymen, also elected by direct vote. Regional elections were usually held one year after general elections (national and local) depending on legislation from Congress. Regional officials had a fixed term of three years, which could be extended by an act of Congress.

The Regional Governor was the chief executive of the regional government, and was assisted by a cabinet not exceeding 10 members. The top official was tasked to appoint the members of the cabinet, subject to confirmation by the Regional Legislative Assembly and also had control of all the regional executive commissions, agencies, boards, bureaus, and offices.

====Executive council====

The executive council advises the Regional Governor on matters of governance of the autonomous region. It was composed of the regional governor, 1 regional vice governor, and 3 deputy regional governors (each representing the Christians, the Muslims, and the indigenous cultural communities). The regional governor and regional vice governor had a 3-year term, maximum of 3 terms; deputies&#x27; terms are coterminous with the term of the regional governor who appointed them.

====Legislative====
The ARMM had a unicameral &quot;Regional Legislative Assembly&quot; headed by a Speaker. It was composed of three members for every congressional district. The membership at the time of ARMM&#x27;s abolition was 24, where 6 are from Lanao del Sur including Marawi City, 6 from Maguindanao, 6 from Sulu, 3 from Basilan, and 3 from Tawi-Tawi.

The Regional Legislative Assembly was the legislative branch of the ARMM government. The regular members (3 members/district) and sectoral representatives, had three-year terms; maximum of three consecutive terms. It exercised legislative power in the autonomous region, except on the following matters: foreign affairs, national defense and security, postal service, coinage and fiscal and monetary policies, administration of justice, quarantine, customs and tariff, citizenship, naturalization, immigration and deportation, general auditing, national elections, maritime, land, and air transportation, communications, patents, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, foreign trade, and may legislate on matters covered by the Sharia, the law governing Muslims.

===ARMM powers and basic principles===
RA 9054 provided that ARMM &quot;shall remain an integral and inseparable part of the national territory of the Republic.&quot; The President exercised general supervision over the Regional Governor. The Regional Government had the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges, subject to Constitutional provisions and the provisions of RA 9054. The Sharia applied only to Muslims; its applications are limited by pertinent constitutional provisions (prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment).

==Cultural heritage==

The people of the Bangsamoro region, including Muslims and non-Muslims, have a culture that revolves around kulintang music, a specific type of gong music, found among both Muslim and non-Muslim groups of the Southern Philippines. Each ethnic group in ARMM also has their own distinct architectures, intangible heritage, and craft arts. A fine example of a distinct architectural style in the region is the Royal Sulu architecture which was used to make the Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) in Maimbung, Sulu. The palace was destroyed during the American period due to a typhoon in 1932, and was never rebuilt. It used to be the largest royal palace built in the Philippines. A campaign to faithfully re-establish it in Maimbung town has been ongoing since 1933. A very small replica of the palace was made in a nearby town in the 2010s, but it was noted that the replica does not mean that the campaign to reconstruct the palace in Maimbung has stopped as the replica does not manifest the true essence of a Sulu royal palace. In 2013, Maimbung was officially designated as the royal capital of the Sultanate of Sulu by the remaining members of the Sulu royal family.

<doc id="298938" wikidata="Q289250" url="?curid=298938" title="Shinano Province">
<text>or is an old province of Japan that is now Nagano Prefecture.

Shinano bordered Echigo, Etchū, Hida, Kai, Kōzuke, Mikawa, Mino, Musashi, Suruga, and Tōtōmi Provinces. The ancient capital was located near modern-day Matsumoto, which became an important city of the province.

The World War II-era Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shinano&quot; was named after this old province.

==Historical record==
In 713, the road that traverses Mino and Shinano provinces was widened to accommodate increasing numbers of travelers through the Kiso District of modern Nagano Prefecture.

In the Sengoku period, Shinano Province was often split among fiefs and castle towns developed, including Komoro, Ina, and Ueda. Shinano was one of the major centers of Takeda Shingen&#x27;s power during his wars with Uesugi Kenshin and others.

During the Azuchi–Momoyama period, after Nobunaga&#x27;s assassination at Honnō-ji Incident, the province was contested between Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Go-Hōjō clan based in Odawara castle. The Tokugawa clan, The Uesugi clan and the Hōjō clan each aspired to seize the vast area in Shinano Province, Ueno region, and Kai Province, which ruled by the remnants of the many small clans formerly serving the Takeda clan. Following of disorder post death of Nobunaga, at the same time with Ieyasu departure an army of 8,000 soldiers to those disputed region. This caused the triangle conflict between those three factions in the event which dubbed by historians as Tenshō-Jingo War broke out. As the war turned in favor of Tokugawa clan, combined with the defection of Sanada Masayuki to the Tokugawa faction, the Hōjō clan now negotiate truce with Ieyasu and The Go-Hōjō clan then sent Hōjō Ujinobu as representative, while the Tokugawa sent Ii Naomasa as representative for the preliminary meetings. Furthermore, In October, representatives from the Oda clan such as Oda Nobukatsu, Oda Nobutaka, and Toyotomi mediated the negotiation until the truce officially concluded.

Suwa taisha was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) for the province.

In 1871, during the Meiji period, with the abolition of the han system and the establishment of prefectures (&quot;Haihan Chiken&quot;) after the Meiji Restoration, Shinano Province&#x27;s ex-domains/1871 prefectures and ex-shogunate territories/1868 prefectures (mainly Ina [merger of several shogunate demesne administrations with parts of Matsumoto], Okutono, Iwamurada, Komoro, Ueda, Matsushiro, Suzaka, Iiyama, Suwa/Takashima, Takatō, Iida, Matsumoto) and Takayama/Hida which covered Hida Province were administratively merged into Nagano (initially Nakano Prefecture in 1870) and Chikuma prefectures. The seat of the prefectural government of Nakano was Nakano town from Takai District (became Nakano City in 1954), Nagano&#x27;s prefectural capital was Nagano town in Minochi District (→Nagano City in 1897), and Chikuma&#x27;s capital was Matsumoto town, Chikuma district (Matsumoto City from 1907). In the second wave of prefectural mergers in 1875/76, Chikuma was split again: the Western part covering Hida Province was merged into Gifu, and the Eastern part in Shinano became part of Nagano. Since that time, Nagano is essentially contiguous to Shinano.

<doc id="298941" wikidata="Q13606" url="?curid=298941" title="Cordillera Administrative Region">
<text>The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR; ; ), also known as the Cordillera Region and Cordillera (), is an administrative region in the Philippines, situated within the island of Luzon. It is the only landlocked region in the archipelago, bordered by the Ilocos Region to the west and southwest, and by the Cagayan Valley Region to the north, east, and southeast. 

The region comprises six provinces: Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province. The regional center is the highly urbanized city of Baguio, which is the largest city in the region.

The region was officially created on July 15, 1987, covering most of the Cordillera Mountain Range of Luzon that is home to numerous ethnic groups. Nueva Vizcaya province has a majority Igorot population transplanted by the American colonial government in the Cagayan Valley Region instead during the early 20th century, as does Quirino.

According to the 2020 Census of Population and Housing, this region is the least populated region in the Philippines, less than that of the national capital, the City of Manila.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
During the Spanish occupation of the Philippines, Christianization and eventual subjugation of the mountain region proved difficult for the Spanish colonial government. Several &quot;comandancias&quot; were established by the Spanish colonial government in strategic areas of the mountain region. Among them were Amburayan, Cabugaoan, Kayapa, Quiangan, Itaves, Apayaos, Lepanto, Benguet, Bontoc, Banaue, and Tiagan.

On August 18, 1908, during the American regime, Mountain Province was established by the Philippine Commission with the enactment of &quot;Act No. 1876&quot;. Ifugao, which was part of Nueva Vizcaya province, and the former Spanish &quot;comandancias&quot; of Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Bontoc, Kalinga and Lepanto, were annexed to the newly created province as sub-provinces. Amburayan was later abolished in 1920 and its corresponding territories were transferred to the provinces of Ilocos Sur and La Union. Lepanto was also reduced in size and its towns were integrated into the sub-provinces of Bontoc and Benguet, and to the province of Ilocos Sur.

===Philippine independence===
On June 18, 1966, &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; was enacted to split Mountain Province and create four separate and independent provinces namely Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao, and Mountain Province. Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao were placed under the jurisdiction of the Cagayan Valley region, with Benguet and Mountain Province placed under the Ilocos Region. From that time on, Ferdinand Marcos imposed a migration policy for Ilocano settlers into those provinces.

====The Martial Law era====
After the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, the region became the focus of militarization as a result of local objections to the government&#x27;s push for the Chico River Dam Project near Sadanga, Mountain Province and Tinglayan, Kalinga. Frustrated by the project delays caused by the opposition, Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree no. 848 in December 1975, constituting the municipalities of Lubuagan, Tinglayan, Tanudan, and Pasil into a &quot;Kalinga Special Development Region&quot; (KSDR), in an effort to neutralize opposition to the Chico IV dam.

Empowered by martial law to conduct warrantless arrests, the 60th PC Brigade had arrested at least 150 locals by April 1977, accusing them of supposed subversion and of obstructing government projects, and various other offenses such as boycotting the October 1976 Constitutional Referendum. Individuals arrested included tribal &quot;papangat&quot; (leaders/elders), young couples, and in at least one case, a 12-year-old child. By December 1978, parts of the Chico IV area had been declared &quot;free fire zones&quot;, no-man&#x27;s-land areas where the army could freely shoot people without permits and animals.

On April 24, 1980, Marcos-controlled military forces assassinated Macli-ing Dulag a &quot;pangat&quot; (leader) of the Butbut tribe of Kalinga. The assassination became a watershed moment, marking the first time the mainstream Philippine press could be openly critical against Marcos and the military, and building up a sense of Igorot identity that eventually led to Cordillera autonomy.

After the end of the Marcos administration due to the 1986 People Power Revolution, the succeeding government under President Corazon Aquino secured a ceasefire with the main indigenous armed group in the Cordilleras, the Cordillera People&#x27;s Liberation Army led by Conrado Balweg. The Aquino government made a &quot;sipat&quot; or indigenous treaty, which would be known as the Mount Data Peace Accord, with the CPLA on September 13, 1986, ending hostilities.

====Creation of the region====
On July 15, 1987, President Corazon Aquino issued &quot;Executive Order 220&quot; which created the Cordillera Administrative Region. The provinces of Abra, Benguet and Mountain Province (of the Ilocos Region), and Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao (of the Cagayan Valley) were annexed as part of the newly created region. Cordillera Administrative Region is the revival of the U.S. political division of Mountain Province, with Abra which was part of Spanish province of Ilocos. Nueva Vizcaya &amp; Quirino were not included in the region despite having an Igorot majority at the time.

On February 14, 1995, Kalinga-Apayao, one of the five provinces of the region was split into two separate and independent provinces of Apayao and Kalinga with the enactment of &quot;Republic Act No. 7878&quot;.

Several attempts at legalizing autonomy in the Cordillera region have failed in two separate plebiscites. An affirmative vote for the law on regional autonomy is a precondition by the 1987 Philippine Constitution to give the region autonomy in self-governance much like the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (now the BARMM) in southern Philippines. The first law &quot;Republic Act No. 6766&quot;, took effect on October 23, 1989 but failed to muster a majority vote in the plebiscite on January 30, 1990. The second law, &quot;Republic Act No. 8438&quot; passed by Congress of the Philippines on December 22, 1997, also failed to pass the approval of the Cordillera peoples in a region-wide plebiscite on March 7, 1998.

At present, a third organic act of the Cordillera is in the offing supported by the Cordillera Regional Development Council.

===Contemporary===

In September 2000, the municipal council of Itogon, Benguet, withdrew support for the San Roque Dam project. The project had met a lot of resistance, because of the reported failure of its proponents to update its Environmental Certificate of Compliance (ECC) and to submit a watershed management plan required for a project of that magnitude. The San Roque Dam was to become one of the biggest dams in the world and would threaten the living environment of the Igorot.

The Cordillera Peoples Alliance (CPA), an indigenous rights organization in the region, in co-operation with other organizations, had highly resisted this project and thus booked a little victory. In May 2001, however, President Arroyo stated that the San Roque Dam project would proceed regardless due to the fact that it had already been initiated and therefore was difficult to stop. At the same time, she promised not to sacrifice the environment, to rehabilitate the people who will lose their homes, to compensate those who will suffer, and to not initiate any more large-scale irrigation projects in the future.

In December 2000, the Supreme Court of the Philippines dismissed a petition that questioned the constitutional legality of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA), and act which came into existence in 1997 giving the peoples of the Cordillera decisive influence over the establishment of foreign mining companies. In this act, ownership over the lands was regarded as communal, rather than individual and thus coincided more with the view on ownership of the Igorot. The IPRA was totally different in tone than the 1995 Mining Code.

Without consultation from the people of the Cordilleras, the Mining Code gave companies the freedom to devastate tribal lands, allowed 100% foreign ownership, and gave companies the right to displace and resettle people within their concessionary areas. Some influential people filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court against the IPRA, because it contradicted with the Mining Code and would therefore be unlawful. The petition was dismissed in a 7–7 vote by the Supreme Court.

A bill creating an autonomous Cordillera was filed in Congress in 2014, but it was not backed by strategic politicians in the region due to lack of support from the national government. However, in 2017, all provincial congressmen within the CAR jointly filed a new Bill creating an autonomous Cordillera, the first time in three decades where all provincial district representatives called in unison for autonomy. The move was made due to the election win of President Duterte, who publicly supported the creation of an autonomous Cordillera. However, questions lingered on the issue of Nueva Vizcaya&#x27;s exclusion from the proposed region, despite being culturally and geographically part of the Cordilleras, leaving Nueva Vizcaya Igorots left out from the proposal.

==Geography==
The region is the only landlocked region in the Philippines, bounded on the northeast and east by the Cagayan Valley, and on the southwest and west by the Ilocos Region.

The region is primarily mountainous, positioned in the Cordillera Central mountain range, which includes Mount Pulag, the highest mountain in Luzon.

Within the region are several streams and rivers including the Chico River, which is a tributary of the Cagayan River. Other major rivers include

* Abra 
* Abulog
* Agno
* Ahin
* Amburayan
* Apayao
* Bued
* Siffu 
===Administrative divisions===

Cordillera Administrative Region is politically subdivided into 6 provinces. It has 2 cities; the highly urbanized city of Baguio, and the component city of Tabuk. There are 1,178 barangays in the region. Geographically, the western half of Nueva Vizcaya is part of the main Cordilleras, while its eastern half is part of the Caraballos, the meeting point of the Cordilleras and the Sierra Madre. There have been moves to reunify Nueva Vizcaya with the Cordilleras, however, no such legislation has yet been introduced in Congress.

===Languages===
The region has been called &quot;the most diversified ethno-linguistic region in the Philippines&quot; with the many &quot;sub-dialect variations&quot; of its major languages. This diversity has been attributed to the mountainous topology of the region. However, this did not lead to variations in &quot;cultural development&quot;, and the majority of the people share a &quot;similar cultural identity&quot;. The region has been using the Ilocano language as a lingua franca across different Igorot groups. The use of Filipino and English as the official languages of the Philippines is also implemented within the Cordillera.

* Balangao, spoken in Natonin and Paracelis, Mountain Province.
* Bontoc, spoken in Bontoc, Mountain Province.
*Ga&#x27;dang, spoken in Paracelis, Mountain Province
* Ibaloi, spoken in Benguet.
* Ifugao, spoken in Ifugao.
* Ilocano, spoken in Apayao, Abra, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Benguet, and Ifugao. It is the regional lingua franca.
* Isnag, spoken in Apayao.
*Itawis, spoken in part of Apayao

*Apayao – Ilocos Norte Road – As a lateral road, the highway is a significant element of the Cordillera Roads Improvement Project (CRIP), connecting Northern Cordillera to the Ilocos Region. It traverses Apayao&#x27;s Kabugao and Calanasan municipalities and turns west to Ilocos Norte&#x27;s Solsona. This road project was started on January 7, 2013, and will be completed around December 2020.

==Culture==

The Cordillera region is known for its unique musical instruments including the gangsa kalinga, nose flute, bamboo flute, buzzer, &quot;bangibang&quot;, &quot;tongatong&quot;, &quot;diwdiw-as&quot;, &quot;saggeypo&quot;, and bamboo zither.
The region is also known for their dance, arts, and crafts like wood-carving, ibaloi basket, loom weaving, tinalik, loinclothes called ikat, amulets, tattoo, akob, bobo, suklang and ikat weaving.

The symbol of the tattoo of the Bontocs is about being brave (because of the pain while inking), a talisman or a good luck charm against evil forces, or a symbol of a status or position (ex. Chief captain, Leader, Mayor). They also use tattoos as a decoration and clothes to their body using arts by drawing or placing inks with a pattern or abstract on their skin.

It has been observed that the people in Cordillera make arts based on their emotions and belief. They use their talents in making arts and crafts as a source of income like wood-carving, basket-weaving, weaving clothes, amulets and ikat weaving. They have different patterns in weaving and they also have their own God that is called &quot;Bulul&quot;, it is the God of the rice that is made and worshipped by the Ifugaos. Aside from their tattoo art, the Bontocs are also known for their excellence in making different baskets for storage and rice.

<text>Cotabato City, officially the City of Cotabato (Maguindanaon: &quot;Kuta nu Kutawatu&quot;, Jawi: ; Cebuano: &quot;Dakbayan sa Cotabato&quot;; ), is a independent component city in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 325,079 people, making it as the most populated city under the independent component city status.

Cotabato City was formerly a part and the regional center of Region XII, but due to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, it is now part of Bangsamoro and serves as the regional center. Being an independent component city, it is not a subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Maguindanao del Norte where it is geographically located. The Philippine Statistics Authority also lists Cotabato City as statistically independent. It was the capital of the Sultanate of Maguindanao.

Cotabato City is distinct from and should not be confused with the province of Cotabato.

== History ==

Prior to the arrival of Hindus and Muslims, the city was a vast swamp and rainforest landscape where numerous ethno-linguistic groups lived. Maguindanao vernacular architecture developed during this era, which included the architectural techniques of at least 10 ethno-linguistic groups. Later on, Hindu traders arrived and the people of the area embraced the practice of Hinduism. The set of moral standards and culture of present-day people of Maguindanao are seen due to this Hindu influence.

=== Sultanate of Maguindanao ===

By 1515, after a successful Muslim establishment in Sulu, Muslim merchants went to Maguindanao and converted many Maguindanaoans to Islam. Those that did not accept the arrival of the Muslims went into higher ground or the interior of the island and became the Teduray, as well as other lumad groups. During the same year, the Sultanate of Maguindanao was formally established, with Tubok as its initial capital. However, the sultan&#x27;s seat would eventually be transferred in 1711 at around Tamontaka, a barangay within modern-day Cotabato. In 1861, Spain would eventually establish a garrison in Maguindanao and establish Kuta Watu, which was eventually renamed as Cotabato, as its new capital.

=== Spanish and American occupation ===
The Spanish Empire had defeated the Sulu Sultanate in war and forced it to sign an unfavorable peace treaty in 1851. With the Moro Gulf and Illana Bay now open to Spanish traffic as a result of their victory over the Sulu Moros, this paved the way for the first steps for the conquest of the Maguindanao Sultanate several years later. To that end, Spanish Jesuit missionaries have already made their way as early as 1859 at Polloc where they earned several hundred converts, but the place was deemed unsuitable in account of its less than optimal ecology. And so the Spanish district governor of Mindanao based in Zamboanga requested Datu Amirul, the father of present Sultan of Maguindanao Muhammad Makakua, for them to establish a military base at the stone fortress at Kota Wato in what is now Barangay Tamontaka, and Datu Amirul gave the consent. The Spanish then established themselves at the said fort, raising the Spanish flag there and renamed it Cotabato, the Hispanized form of its name, on April 30, 1861. The Spanish and the Moro chiefs and locals then had a conference later the same day which stipulated the Maguindanaoan locals of Cotabato are now subjects of the Spanish Crown but their Islamic beliefs would be respected. Thus, on April 30, 1861, in the flood plains of Tamontaka, the town of Cotabato was officially born.

Under the reign of Sultan Muhammad Makakua, who while being the nominal sultan of Maguindanao was at this point under complete Spanish vassalage, roads and wharves were built in Cotabato, specifically where the Tamontaka River was situated. Forests were felled and cleared by the new Catholic Tiruray converts of Tamontaka to make way for the expansion of the newly established town. In 1871, the capital of the Spanish military district of Mindanao was moved from Zamboanga to Cotabato, only to be moved back previously the next year when a destructive earthquake ravaged the town.

Following the Spanish evacuation in Jan. 1899, Datu Piang led the Moro&#x27;s in a massacre of the remaining Christian community, enslaving those they did not kill. Americans arrived in Mindanao in 1900 after the Spanish–American War ended in 1898. Cotabato town was part of Moro Province and of Department of Mindanao and Sulu from 1903 to 1920, when the Empire Province of Cotabato, referred to as &quot;Moroland&quot; by the Americans, was founded with the town as the capital, with Datu Piang as its first governor.

=== Cotabato ===
Several towns were carved off from Cotabato town since the year 1913, with Pikit being the first one founded by Cebuano Christian colonists. Dulawan (now Datu Piang, Maguindanao) and Midsayap were incorporated as regular municipalities in 1936. In 1942, at the beginning of the Pacific Front of World War II, the Japanese Imperial forces entered what is now Maguindanao province. In 1945, Maguindanao was liberated by allied Philippine Commonwealth troops and Muslim Maguindanaoan guerrilla units after defeating the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Maguindanao during the Second World War. On August 18, 1947, just two years after the Second World War and a year after the official inauguration of Philippine independence, the number of towns in the gigantic Cotabato province were multiplied by Executive Order No. 82 signed by President Manuel Roxas, namely: Kidapawan, Pagalungan, Buayan, Marbel, Parang, Nuling, Dinaig, Salaman, Buluan, Kiamba, and Cabacan, a total of eleven (11) towns added to the previous four towns; the newly founded towns of Kabuntalan, Pikit (conversion as regular municipality), and Glan added up on September 30, 1949. More and more newly created towns added up in the province&#x27;s number of towns as the province entered the second half of the 20th century.

===Cityhood===
The city was chartered when President Carlos P. Garcia signed into law the &quot;Republic Act No. 2364&quot; on June 20, 1959. Authored then by Senator Salipada K. Pendatun. Under the said charter, the city was politically sibdivided into five (5) Barangays namely Poblacion, Rosary Heights, Bagua, Kalanganan, and Tamontaka. In 1989, the existing Barangays were split up which resulted into 32 more Barangays, presently the City has 37 Barangays.

The city used to be part of the original Province of Cotabato and was its capital from 1920 until 1967, a year after the separation of South Cotabato; since then the city was the administrative center of the ARMM when Maguindanao was carved out in 1973.

On December 22, 1979, along with Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay, Batangas City, Lipa, Iloilo City, and other cities in the country, Cotabato became a highly urbanized city.

However, the city broke off administratively from Maguindanao as it rejoined Soccsksargen in the 1990s. Now many sources consider the city as part of the present Cotabato province, although geographically it is still considered part of Maguindanao.

=== Inclusion in the Bangsamoro region ===
The city has traditionally resisted efforts for its inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite serving as the government center of the region. Despite this, the city&#x27;s residents voted for their locality&#x27;s inclusion in the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region by voting to ratify the Bangsamoro Organic Law in the January 21, 2019 plebiscite. The city became &quot;de jure&quot; part of Bangsamoro following the plebiscite, as well as the government center of the new region. It became &quot;official&quot; part of the region after its formal turnover to the Bangsamoro regional government on December 15, 2020.
== Geography ==

Cotabato is approximately from Manila, the country&#x27;s capital, and is bounded by the municipalities of Sultan Kudarat to the north—with Rio Grande de Mindanao/Pulangi River separating the two—Kabuntalan to the east, and Datu Odin Sinsuat to the south. The city faces Illana Bay, part of the Moro Gulf, to the west.

Cotabato City has a total land area of , located at the mouth of the Rio Grande de Mindanao and Pulangi River.

===Urban Areas===
Cotabato City has 27 urban barangays that are grouped into two major urban areas, the Down Town Area and the Upper Town Area.

Down Town Area The Downtown Area encompasses the barangays of Poblacion and Bagua, with a population exceeding 150,000. Situated below sea level, it faces constant flooding risks. Serving as Cotabato City&#x27;s central hub for banking, trading, and commerce, it hosts over 20 banks and major wet markets like Mega Market and City Arcade. Additionally, prominent malls and supermarkets such as South Seas Mall, Puregold Main Branch, Sugni Super Store, and Superama (with 3 branches) are situated here, along with the upcoming KCC Mall of Cotabato. Notable educational institutions include Notre Dame University, Cotabato City Central Pilot School (the largest elementary school), STI Cotabato, and Notre Dame of Cotabato.

Upper Town Area The Upper Town Area, situated in the elevated regions of Cotabato City, encompasses all barangays of Rosary Heights and is home to the Peoples Palace (City Hall). Serving as the service center of Cotabato City, it houses Regional Government Agencies from both the Bangsamoro Region and Region 12. Additionally, it is home to Cotabato Regional and Medical Center, along with other medical facilities. Educational institutions in this area include Cotabato State University, Notre Dame-RVM, and AMA Computer College, as well as the now-closed University of Mindanao. Major shopping destinations include CityMall, Mall of Alnor, and Fiesta Mal.

Two other emerging areas include Barangays of Kalanganan, where the Seaport and Grand Mosque are situated. The primary industry here revolves around aquaculture, with proposed developments for a Public Market and Public Terminal. Additionally, construction of a coastal road is underway in this area. Another burgeoning area is the Barangays of Tamontaka, slated for the establishment of an International Airport. Tamontaka also serves as the eastern diversion road of Cotabato City.

=== Topography ===

The city is situated in the lowest portion of Maguindanao del Norte. The City of Cotabato with its 37 barangays spans an area with marked landscapes of flat, level to nearly level, very gently sloping to gently undulations to moderately sloping or rolling. It is basically a delta formed by two big rivers, the Tamontaka River and the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Basically 70% of its total land area is below sea level. There are only 2 existing elevated areas in the city, the PC Hill and the Timako Hill with an altitude of 90 and 150 feet, respectively. At the foot of PC Hill is Tantawan Park and also hosts the Kutang Bato Caves.

Concentration of settlements and other urban uses are in the central portion while the southwestern and southeastern portion have mixed uses of agricultural land settlements. The city is criss-crossed by meandering and braided creeks and rivers like the Matampay, Parang, Timako, Esteros and Miwaruy.

These water bodies serve as sources of both agricultural, industrial and domestic water requirements of some rural barangays. These rivers also serve as the natural drainage flow of the city&#x27;s wastes.

=== Barangays ===
Cotabato City is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

<text>Passing off is a common law tort which can be used to enforce unregistered trade mark rights. The tort of passing off protects the goodwill of a trader from misrepresentation.

The law of passing off prevents one trader from misrepresenting goods or services as being the goods and services of another, and also prevents a trader from holding out his or her goods or services as having some association or connection with another when this is not true.

==Passing off and trade mark law==
A cause of action for passing off is a form of intellectual property enforcement against the unauthorised use of the trade dress (the whole external appearance or look-and-feel of a product, including any marks or other indicia used) which is considered to be similar to that of another party&#x27;s product, including any registered or unregistered trademarks. Passing off is of particular significance where an action for trade mark infringement based on a registered trade mark is unlikely to be successful (due to the differences between the registered trade mark and the unregistered mark). Passing off is a common law cause of action, whereas statutory law such as the United Kingdom Trade Marks Act 1994 provides for enforcement of registered trademarks through infringement proceedings.

Passing off and the law of registered trade marks deal with overlapping factual situations, but deal with them in different ways. Passing off does not confer monopoly rights to any names, marks, get-up or other indicia. It does not recognize them as property in its own right.

Instead, the law of passing off is designed to prevent misrepresentation in the course of trade to the public, for example, that there is some sort of association between the businesses of two traders.

One recent example of its application by the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office can be found in a Trade Mark Opposition Decision in 2001. It was held that two brands of confectionery both named &quot;Refreshers&quot;, one made by Swizzels Matlow and one by Trebor Bassett, which had coexisted since the 1930s, would deceive a consumer as to their source for some items but not for others. Both coexist in the marketplace.

==Required elements==
When coming to court, there are three elements in the tort which must be fulfilled. In &quot;Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc,&quot; Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in &quot;Erven Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons Ltd.&quot; (the &quot;Advocaat Case&quot;) to three elements:

# Goodwill owned by a trader
# Misrepresentation
# Damage to goodwill

The plaintiff has the burden of proving goodwill in its goods or services, get-up of goods, brand, mark or the thing standing for itself. Goodwill normally develops alongside a brand name or brand association. It has been described as &quot;the attractive force by that brings in custom&quot; by Lord Macnaghten in the UK case IRC v Muller &amp; Co.&#x27;s Margarine [1901] AC 217.

The plaintiff also has the burden of proof to show false representation (intentional or otherwise) to the public to have them believe that goods/services of the defendant are that of the Plaintiff. There must be some connection between the plaintiff&#x27;s and defendant&#x27;s goods, services or trade. They must show likely or actual deception or confusion by the public. 

It is the court&#x27;s duty to decide similarity or identity of the marks, goods or services. The criteria are often: aural, visual and conceptual similarity (often applied in trademark infringement cases).

For the element of damage to goodwill, there may be a loss or diversion of trade or dilution of goodwill. The plaintiff need not prove actual or special damage; real and tangible probability of damage is sufficient. This damage should however be reasonably foreseeable. It is not enough just to show likelihood or actual deception or confusion.

Ultimately, the court must use common sense in determining the case, based on evidence and judicial discretion, and not witnesses.

Disclaimers may not be enough to avoid passing off or cause of action.

==Extended passing off==
One of the instances where passing off is actionable is the extended form of passing off, where a misrepresentation as to the particular &quot;quality&quot; of a product or service causes harm to another&#x27;s goodwill. An example of this is &quot;Erven Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons Ltd.&quot;, in which the makers of advocaat sued a manufacturer of a drink similar but not identical to advocaat, but which was successfully marketed as advocaat.

The extended form of passing off is used by celebrities as a means of enforcing their personality rights in common law jurisdictions. Common law jurisdictions (with the exception of Jamaica) do not recognise personality rights as rights of property. Accordingly, celebrities whose images or names have been used can successfully sue if there is a representation that a product or service is being endorsed or sponsored by them or that the use of their likenesses was authorised when this is not true.

==Reverse passing off==
Another variety, somewhat rarer is so-called &#x27;reverse passing off&#x27;. This occurs where a trader markets another&#x27;s product or service as being his own (see John Roberts Powers School v Tessensohn [1995] FSR 947). It is usually covered by the same court rulings as straight passing off. In the UK, reverse passing off exists where trader A claims that trader B&#x27;s goods are actually trader A&#x27;s. Although not expressly endorsed by the courts, reverse passing off was successfully argued by the plaintiff in Bristol Conservatories Ltd v Conservative Custom Built Ltd [1989].

== Defences ==
There are many defences that can be used by a Defendant to dismiss a claim in passing off. The most common are: 

# Delay or acquiescence 
# Bona fide use of the defendant&#x27;s name 
# Concurrent use

Delay in the claimants claim for passing off can be used by a defendant as a defence. Mostly, the claimants delay will be fatal to the grant of interim relief by a court. Essential for a Acquiescence defence is that failure of the claimant to act should have induced the defendant to believe that the wrong was being assented too. 

The second most common defence is invoked where the defendant is trading under their own name. This permits the trader to trade under his name as long as he had not been causing significant deception.

Concurrent use requires the defendant to show that he and another trader have acquired the right to use the same name. It has been used successfully whereby both the claimant and defendant trade different goods, as this would not cause confusion within the public.

== Remedies ==
There are several remedies available to a claimant. They include:

# Injunction
# Damages 
# Account for profits 
# Destruction 
# Declaration that the Defendant was passing off goods as the claimants

<doc id="298966" wikidata="Q1273334" url="?curid=298966" title="Lango people">
<text>The Lango are a Nilotic ethnic group. They live in north-central Uganda, in a region that covers the area formerly known as the Lango District until 1974, when it was split into the districts of Apac and Lira, and subsequently into several additional districts. The current Lango Region now includes the districts of Amolatar, Alebtong, Apac, Dokolo, Kole, Lira, Oyam, Otuke, and Kwania. The total population of Lango District is currently about 2,884,000.

The Lango people speak the Lango language, a Western Nilotic language of the Southern Luo group. 

==Early history==

The Lango oral tradition states that they were part of the &quot;Lango race&quot; during the migration period. This group later split into several distinct groups before entering Uganda (see Tarantino, Odwe, Crazollara, Uzoigwe). The name “Lango” is found in Teso, Kumam, Karamojong, Jie, and Labwor vocabularies, reflecting that how these groups once used to belong to the Lango race. 

Hutchinson (1902) states:

Hutchinson (1902) adds:

==Icaya (Isaya) Ogwangguji, M.B.E.==
Rwot Ogwangguji was born in 1875 in Abedpiny village in Lira District (Okino, Patrick, and Odongo, Bonney). He was the son of a Rwot (chief) – Rwot Olet Apar, the leader of the Oki clan. His first administrative chief title was the Jago (sub-chief) of Lira. In 1918, he was elected county chief (Rwot) by Erute county, Lango. He continued as Rwot of Erute county until 28 February 1951, and was later on promoted to the title of Rwot Adwong (Senior Chief). Rwot Ogwangguji is known as a chief who bridged &quot;old Lango&quot; into &quot;new Lango&quot; through his extensive work history during a period of many changes in the 20th century in Uganda. He was awarded the M.B.E. in the New Year&#x27;s Honors in 1956 and subsequently retired in December 1957.

==Military==
Driberg described Lango people as:

The Lango army was united under one military leader chosen from available men, and all had to agree to be led by him. These military leaders would lead the Lango army against other groups. Their authority ended when the war was over, and they all returned to their clans and resumed their daily occupations and were not entitled to any special benefits. Famous military leaders were Ongora Okubal, who brought the Lango to their present land, Opyen who succeeded Ongora Okubal and was followed by Arim Oroba, and Agoro Abwango. Agoro Abwango led his men to fight the Banyoro and was killed in Bunyoro. The Lango oral literature has it that as the soldiers who went to help Kabalega retreated towards the Nile, they helped Kabalega and Mwanga, the deposed King of Bunyoro and Buganda respectively cross the Nile River. They were moved along the northern corridor of Lake Kwania. At the time, a warrior called Obol Ario who had conquered much of the northern part of the lake was there. It&#x27;s believed he helped smuggle the two deposed kings towards Dokolo, where they settled at Kangai. Obol Ario of Apac Okwero Ngec Ayita Clan eventually settled at Amac where he later died and was buried.

==Land tenure==
Land in the pre-colonial era was common land, and any untilled area belonged to the first person or family who tilled it, and it was passed on to the eldest son. &quot;Land which had not been cultivated in the past could be tilled by any family, and, when once it had been tilled, the community regarded it as the property of the family whose ancestor first cultivated it.&quot; Traditional land tenure is still widely used in rural areas.

== Culture ==
Although many Lango practice Islam or Christianity, the influence of traditional beliefs still plays a significant role in the religious lives of the Lango. In traditional Lango myth, each individual has a guardian spirit and metaphysical soul. Additionally, ancestral cults and belief in the supreme god, &quot;Jok&quot;, played a large role in the religion.

Primary occupations of the Lango people include hunting, farming and raising livestock.

== Lango clans ==
The Lango people have over 148 registered clans with the Lango Cultural Foundation, an institution mandated with the powers to organize, control and represent all clans in the Lango communities.

== Lango dance ==
The Lango people have several traditional dances. These include Okeme and Abuda which are very popular and performed during cultural functions, weddings or other ceremonies.

== Notable people ==
* Milton Obote, second president of Uganda following independence
* Jane Aceng, Minister of Health of Uganda since 2016
* Betty Amongi, Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development since 2021
* Peter Ogwang, Minister of State for Sports
* Acen Dorcus, Women&#x27;s Representative of the Alebtong District since 2021
* Denis Hamson Obua, Chief Whip of the Parliament of Uganda since 2022

<doc id="298970" wikidata="Q1064071" url="?curid=298970" title="Charles Darwin University">
<text>Charles Darwin University (CDU) is an Australian public university with a main campus in Darwin and eight satellite campuses in some metropolitan and regional areas. It was established in 2003 after the merger of Northern Territory University, the Menzies School of Health Research, and Centralian College.

CDU is a member of the group of seven Innovative Research Universities in Australia, and offers academic degrees as well as vocational education.

==History==
Charles Darwin University has evolved over the years through the merging of several higher education institutions.

===Darwin Community College===
Darwin Community College, founded in 1974 and renamed Darwin Institute of Technology in 1984, was a combined College of Advanced Education and a TAFE College. It was situated on what is now the Casuarina Campus, although it used other buildings at various times in Darwin. By the time of the formation of the Northern Territory University, it gave degrees in arts, education, business and applied science.

===Menzies School of Health Research===
The Menzies School of Health Research was established in 1985 as a body corporate of the Northern Territory Government under the &quot;Menzies School of Health Research Act 1985&quot;. This act was amended in 2004 to formalise the relationship with Charles Darwin University. Menzies is now a major partner of CDU and constitutes a school within the university on campus at CDU Casuarina offering post-graduate degrees and higher degrees by research.

===University College of the Northern Territory===
On several occasions the Government of the Northern Territory requested the Australian Commonwealth Government to finance a university in the territory. The response was always that the population was too small. In 1985, it took the unusual step of financing the University College of the Northern Territory itself for a five-year period from 1987 to 1991. The college was governed by a council, chaired by Austin Asche and led by a warden, Professor Jim Thomson, from the University of Queensland. An arrangement was made with the University of Queensland that the college would award degrees from that institution. Staff were recruited in 1986 and housed in the old Darwin Primary School buildings. Just prior to taking the first students in February 1987, the college moved to converted building of the former Darwin Hospital at Myilly Point in Darwin. The former nurses&#x27; hostel became a student residence, named International House. The college had two faculties, of arts and science. It awarded, through the University of Queensland link, the first Doctor of Philosophy degrees in the Northern Territory.

===Centralian College===
Centralian College was founded in 1993 from the merger of Sadadeen Senior Secondary College and the Alice Springs College of TAFE. During its life, the college delivered senior secondary, TAFE and higher education through its main campus in Alice Springs, and to a lesser extent the whole Northern Territory.

After this body merged with NTU in 2003, a newly divested Centralian College became a senior secondary school, for students from Year 10 to Year 12. It shares its campus with the Charles Darwin University campus of Alice Springs. Centralian College uses the university&#x27;s facilities and students attending Centralian College can participate in VET courses (as early as Year 10) offered by CDU.

===Northern Territory University===
The Northern Territory University was founded in January 1989 by a merger of the Darwin Institute of Technology and the University College of the Northern Territory. The merger was controversial, but forced by the so-called Dawkins Revolution under federal Minister of Education John Dawkins. The new university started life on 1 January 1989. Degrees of the University of Queensland continued to be awarded to students who initially enrolled in them.

The first vice-chancellor was Professor Malcolm Nairn from Murdoch University in Western Australia. Under his leadership the university prospered and morale was high among both staff and students. However funding declined as student numbers rose. During his term of office the various study centres on the territory, that previously had been run directly by the NT Government, became part of the university. The Palmerston campus, for a few years previously a TAFE College, also became part of the university. The Palmerston campus is situated on University Avenue, as this was the proposed site for a new university in a submission to the federal government in 1981.

The second vice-chancellor was Professor Roger Holmes from Griffith University. After an initial excellent start to his period of office, he disappointed the university and local community by resigning after serving for only one semester to take up the post of vice-chancellor at University of Newcastle.

He was replaced as third vice-chancellor by the then deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Ron McKay. Under his leadership, the financial constraints on the university increased. The environment of having to provide as wide as possible a tertiary education to a small population living in a very large area far from alternative institutions became even more hostile and the university did not prosper. In January 2001, the Katherine Rural College, including Mataranka Station, became part of the university.

After McKay&#x27;s resignation due to ill health in 2002, an interim vice-chancellor, Professor Ken McKinnon, former vice-chancellor of the University of Wollongong was appointed. He took various actions to improve the health of the university, some controversial, such as the proposal to merge with Centralian College with a new name for the university.

===Charles Darwin University===

On 21 August 2003, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly passed the &quot;Charles Darwin University Act 2003 (NT)&quot;, merging Alice Springs&#x27; Centralian College and the Menzies School of Health Research with the Northern Territory University to form Charles Darwin University from 1 January 2004. The inaugural university council meeting was held on 26 November 2003.

== Campuses and buildings ==
The university has its main campus in Darwin, with eight satellite campuses in some metropolitan and regional areas.

==Governance and structure==

=== Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor ===
The current and fourth chancellor of the university is the Honourable Paul Henderson, inducted March 2019. The vice-chancellor and president of the university since May 2021 is Professor Scott Bowman.

===Academic structure===
CDU is made up of six Colleges:
* Asia Pacific College of Business and Law
* College of Education
* College of Engineering, IT and Environment
* College of Health &amp; Human Sciences
* College of Indigenous Futures, Arts &amp; Society
*College of Nursing &amp; Midwifery

Vocational Education and Training is embedded within the Colleges.

== Academic profile ==

Charles Darwin University is a dual-sector university, which means the university offers vocational education and training (aka VET) courses and higher education undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, covering a wide range of subjects and disciplines.

CDU is a member of the group of seven Innovative Research Universities in Australia, It has close links with Flinders University in South Australia, which itself has many students from the Northern Territory, including joint management of the Centre for Remote Health in Alice Springs and the Northern Territory Medical Program which is located on campus at Casuarina CDU.

The Australian Government&#x27;s QILT conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 86%.

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 85.9% for undergraduates and 86.1% for postgraduates. The initial full-time salary was for undergraduates and for postgraduates.

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 70.2% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 73.6%.

=== Lecture series ===

==== Vincent Lingiari Memorial Lecture ====
The Vincent Lingiari Memorial Lectures were established in 1996 to commemorate the Wave Hill walk-off, which was led by Gurindji man Vincent Lingiari in August 1966. Held annually at the Casuarina campus amphitheatre, and open to the public, the lecture now forms part of the Gurindji Freedom Day Festival events. Past lectures have been given by William Deane, Gough Whitlam, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Patrick Dodson, Malcolm Fraser, and Marcia Langton.

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the 2020 lecture was jointly presented in an online format by Pat Dodson, Marcia Langton and Bruce Pascoe.

In 2022, Torres Strait Islander man Thomas Mayo, advocate for the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot; and the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament, delivered the oration. He drew parallels between Lingiari&#x27;s struggle to be heard by governments to what Indigenous peoples of Australia are experiencing today.

<text>The University of Freiburg (colloquially ), officially the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg (), is a public research university located in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and technology and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 18.2% of total student numbers.

The University of Freiburg has been associated with figures such as Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Carnap, David Daube, Johann Eck, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Friedrich Hayek, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Meinecke, Edith Stein, Paul Uhlenhuth, Max Weber and Ernst Zermelo. As of October 2020, 22 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university.

==History==
===Foundation===

Originally Albrechts University, the university started with four faculties (theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). Its establishment belongs to the second wave of university foundings in the German-speaking world in the late Middle Ages, like the University of Tübingen and the University of Basel (Switzerland). Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the university in Freiburg actually was – like all or most universities in the Middle Ages – a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. The bishop of Basel consequently was its provost or chancellor (&quot;Kanzler&quot;), the bishop of Constance was its patron, and the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke Albert VI of Austria, being the brother of Frederick III, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. At its founding, the university was named after Albert VI of Austria. He provided the university with land and endowments, as well as its own jurisdiction. Also he declared Albrechts University as the &quot;county university&quot; (German &quot;Landesuniversität&quot;) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1490.

The university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam after having left Basel, lived and taught in Freiburg, however, never at the university. From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the &quot;Altes Collegium&quot; (&quot;Old College&quot;), today called the &quot;new town-hall&quot;. The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the &quot;University Church&quot; or &quot;Universitätskirche&quot;).

===Studium Gallicum===
In 1679, Freiburg temporarily became French territory, along with the southern parts of the upper Rhine. French King Louis XIV disliked the Austrian system and gave the Jesuits a free hand to operate the university. On 6 November 1684, a bilingual educational program was initiated. From 1686 to 1698, the faculty fled to Konstanz.

===Austrian reforms===
After Freiburg was re-conquered and appointed as capital of Further Austria, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only Roman Catholics were allowed to study) and Natural Sciences were added as well as Public Administration. Also in 1767, the university became a governmental institution despite the Church&#x27;s protests. The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the Jesuits were suppressed following a decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. Consequently, Johann Georg Jacobi (brother of the more famous philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in Freiburg.

When Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German &quot;Großherzogtum Baden&quot;) in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg. Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386).

===University of Freiburg===

The university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (&quot;Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg&quot;) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.

In the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.

In 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. Before there had been no women at German universities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as the new main building in 1911. The university counted 3,000 students just before World War I. After World War I, the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (since 1928) taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as Edith Stein. In the field of social sciences, Walter Eucken developed the idea of ordoliberalism, which subsequently is known as the &quot;Freiburg School&quot;.

===Nazi Era===
During the time of the Nazi dictatorship, the university went through the process of &quot;political alignment&quot; (&quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;) like the rest of the German universities. Under the rector Martin Heidegger, all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. He also informed the Gestapo of the pacifist leanings of a distinguished Faculty member, Hermann Staudinger. The Nazi geneticist Eugen Fischer promoted racist views while a member of the university, ideas which were used to support the notorious Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazis.

===Postwar years===

After World War II, the university was reopened. New buildings for natural sciences were erected in the &quot;Institutsviertel&quot; (&quot;institute quarter&quot;).
In the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;. Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory. He directed the Walter Eucken Institut, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university.

In the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to 11. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.

In 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the League of European Research Universities (LERU). One year later, the university was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence. However, it did not receive the third line of funding in 2012.

===University seal===

The seal of the University of Freiburg depicts Christ seated on a gothic throne holding the gospel in his right hand with the temple curtain in the background. Christ offers the teachings of the gospel to the Jewish scholars who are crouched at his feet. To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of Jerusalem. Located to the right of Christ is the coat of arms of the Austrian duchies, a banner with five eagles. The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories. The coat of arms of the city of Freiburg is located at the bottom of the seal, displaying St George&#x27;s Cross. The Latin inscription on the seal reads &quot;Sigillum universitatis studii friburgensis brisgaudie&quot;. The seal was slightly modified in 1913, but has otherwise been in continuous use since it was adopted in 1462.

==Campus==

Having grown with the city since the 15th century, the university&#x27;s buildings are deeply intertwined with the city. The three large campuses are the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter, and the engineering campus, but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg.

The university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the Jugendstil &quot;Kollegiengebäude I&quot;, built in 1911 by Hermann Billing, and the gothic revival old university library. The current University Library is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and was to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September 2008. It is one of the largest in Germany and placed fourth in an October 2007, German national ranking of university libraries.

The University Church, located across from &quot;Kollegiengebäude II&quot;, was built in 1683 by the Jesuit order. The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773. The church was destroyed in the 27 November 1944, bombing raid on Freiburg, and reconstructed in 1956.

The &quot;institute quarter&quot; (&quot;Institutsviertel&quot;) is home to the science faculties. This campus was destroyed almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After World War II, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.

The engineering campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center. The campus is home to the &quot;Institut für Mikrosystemtechnik&quot; ( Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science. With the addition of the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies.

The University Medical Center (&quot;Universitätsklinikum Freiburg&quot;) is one of Germany&#x27;s largest medical centers. It boasts 1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated as out-patients. It consists of 13 specialized clinics, five clinical institutes, and five centers (e.g. Center for Transplantation Medicine). The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart &quot;Jarvik 2000&quot; in 2002.

Most recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics, as well as history departments of the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.

In 2015, the University of Freiburg opened its new library, housed in a modern building with a large glass and chrome facade. The library features a section for quiet work and the permanent collection as well as space for group work, where collaboration is encouraged. The building also includes a student cafe and an outdoor plaza with modern sculpture.
==Students and admission==

The university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600. About 16% of these students are foreigners, from about 120 countries. Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German &quot;Abitur&quot;) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 of around 26,000 applicants were admitted: this means that the university&#x27;s acceptance rate that year was equal to 15.38%.

The University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.

As common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from 1 October to 31 March, while the summer term runs from 1 April to 30 September. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall.

As a German university, tuition is mostly free. The University of Freiburg currently has a semester fee of 180 EUR for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students. Additionally, since autumn 2017, non-EU students are charged 1500 EUR tuition fee per semester.

===Student life===
Numerous student clubs and organizations are active, among them a campus news station, uniCROSS which is a cross-media platform run by students. It consists of the &quot;uniFM&quot; team, which brings the news as a radio format, the &quot;uniTV&quot; team, producing videos and the &quot;uniONLINE&quot; team which is responsible for the magazine. Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent Black Forest, where the university owns a retreat on Schauinsland Mountain, fine opportunities exist for leisure and outdoor activities. Students come from Central and Eastern Europe for language studies, the majority demographic category is females in age range 18–25 (58%).

The university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the &quot;Studentenwerk&quot;. Additionally, further dormitories in Freiburg are operated by other institutions, such as the Catholic Archdiocese. Due to the affordable rent and limited spots, rooms in the various dormitories are very popular. Many students find private living arrangements, such as &quot;Wohngemeinschaften&quot; (shared apartments). However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time-consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms.

The university has its own career center, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the &quot;Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft&quot;.

The university scored well with its submissions to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. The university received funding in all three categories. In the first category, funding for a new graduate school, the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, was granted; in the second, funding was granted for the excellence cluster Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (&quot;bioss&quot;); and in the third category, Institutional Strategy Line of Funding, open only to institutions with submissions qualified in the first two categories, the university is receiving funding for &quot;Windows for Research&quot;, which aims to promote a high level of interdisciplinarity between research fields and attract scientists from all over the world. To that end, the university founded the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS). Being selected for the third category ranks Freiburg as one of nine &quot;excellence universities&quot; in Germany. The university is to receive over EUR 130 million in additional funds over five years (from 2007) from this third category of funding.
In 2009, the university was also successful in a nationwide competition for excellence in teaching, held by the &quot;Stifterverband der deutschen Wissenschaft&quot;. The University of Freiburg, with its plans for future innovative teaching concepts, was selected as one of 10 winners from a field of over 100 higher education institutions.

In 2012, in the third round of the Excellence Initiative, the university was able to successfully extend funding for the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, as well as &quot;bioss&quot;, while also gaining funding for a new cluster called BrainLinks-Brain Tools, an interdisciplinary neurotechnology project. Citing insufficient evidence of integration of the FRIAS concept into the university&#x27;s framework, the committee did not extend funding for the FRIAS and the institutional strategy line of funding, despite acknowledging the impressive research and advances achieved at FRIAS in the past years.

===University College Freiburg===

University College Freiburg (UCF) is the university&#x27;s central facility for promoting and administering international, interdisciplinary teaching activities. It was established in 2012 and is situated in the historical buildings of the old university, the historical site of the &quot;artes liberales&quot;. UCF serves as a lab for innovative teaching approaches and instructional design at the University of Freiburg and works in close co-operation with the faculties and the Rectorate&#x27;s departments for Instructional Development and International Relations. It is accredited by the University of Freiburg, which draws its authority from the Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency.

The four-year, English-taught Bachelor program in Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) is UCF&#x27;s major offering, the first of its kind in Germany. It emphasizes a broad interdisciplinary education, while at the same time providing for individualized academic concentrations on a high academic level. Students have to complete 240 ECTS credits and are able to major in life sciences, environmental and sustainability sciences, culture and history and governance. Electives can be taken at UCF, in the greater University of Freiburg, during studies abroad or in the form of internships and self-directed practical projects.

In order to provide a framework and didactic guidance for interdisciplinary higher education, the University of Freiburg has established two chairs at UCF: Epistemology and Theory of Science (Prof. Dr. Frieder Vogelmann, who is also the Dean of Studies) and Science and Technology Studies (Prof. Dr. Veronika Lipphardt). The College and the program are directed by Managing Director Paul Sterzel and the Academic Coordinator Thorsten Leiendecker.

UCF is a member of the European Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences and of EPICUR, a group of eight universities in six countries that explore a modern and internationally connected university experience Students are able to participate in a double degree program with the University College Maastricht.

Students at UCF organize a number of interest groups, for instance a magazine publishing group, a 3D printing group, an arts collective, and a Model United Nations team. They represented by an elected board of twelve student office holders. Alumni are a part of a subgroup within the greater University of Freiburg alumni association.

===Graduate schools===
The University of Freiburg has a variety of graduate education and research opportunities. In an evaluation of European graduate programs, Freiburg was ranked among the leading universities in several subject fields examined.

One of the notable graduate opportunities is the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies, a project funded by the German Excellence Initiative.

Apart from the many graduate programs of its faculties, Freiburg has set up additional specialized graduate schools and graduate research centers, coordinated by the newly founded International Graduate Academy (IGA) Freiburg. The IGA coordinates five graduate schools: the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine; the European Cultures and Intercultural Interweaving school; the Theology and Religious Studies school; the Hermann Paul School of Language Sciences, and the Environment, Society and Global Change graduate school of the Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences.

The IGA also coordinates 12 Graduate Research Centers (Graduiertenkolleg): Biochemistry of Enzymes; Friends, Patrons, Clients; Formation and Development of Present-Day Landscapes; Mathematical Logics and Applications; Mechanisms of Neuronal Signal Transduction; Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis (in cooperation with the University of Basel); Hadron Collider Physics; Embedded Microsystems; From Cells to Organs: Molecular Mechanisms of Organogenesis; Signal Systems in Model Organisms of Plant Origin; Micro Energy Harvesting; and PhD program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center Freiburg for Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.

Finally, the university operates three joint graduate schools with the Max Planck Society: the International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology; the International Max Planck Research School on Retaliation, Mediation and Punishment; and the International Max Planck Research School for Comparative Criminal Law.

Together with the EUCOR universities of Basel and Strasbourg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the University of Freiburg also runs the shared graduate school École supérieure de biotechnologie Strasbourg, enabling the students to obtain an international degree in biotechnology and a trilingual education, as classes are taught in English, German, and French.

===International language courses===
The University of Freiburg has offered German language courses for foreign students since 1911. The courses take place at the university&#x27;s Language Teaching Centre (&#x27;Sprachlehrinstitut&#x27;) during the semester breaks and attract students from over 50 nations.. The intensive language lessons are bolstered by a supplementary program with lectures and seminars on German culture, politics, philosophy, and art, as well as excursions to the Black Forest, the Alsace region in France, Basel (Switzerland) or Lake Constance. In addition to classes for all language levels, professional German courses (e.g. business German) are also offered.

==Sustainability==
The city of Freiburg is known for its environmentally friendly policies and focus on renewable energy and sustainability, attracting solar industry and research to the city. This environmentally conscious attitude also extends to the University of Freiburg which has founded the work group &quot;Nachhaltige Universität Freiburg&quot; (Sustainable University of Freiburg) and has drawn up environmental guidelines to be implemented in university practice.

The university has also founded the initiative Solar-Uni Freiburg in 2007, with the aim of further expanding its capabilities in sustainability and environmental research. Solar panels were installed on the roofs of university buildings. To bundle renewable energy research and teaching at the university, the Center for Renewable Energy (ZEE, Zentrum für Erneuerbare Energien), an interdisciplinary and cross-faculty facility, was founded. Aside from research in the fields of solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy efficiency and new energies, an international Master of Science degree in Renewable Energy Management is being offered.

In addition to its own expertise, the Center for Renewable Energy can draw upon the support of the renewable energy industrial sector in Freiburg, as well as the university&#x27;s cooperation with other research institutes in the area, such as the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the Öko-Institut – Institute for Applied Ecology, or the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg.

<doc id="298972" wikidata="Q155397" url="?curid=298972" title="River Monnow">
<text>The River Monnow () marks the England–Wales border for much of its length. After flowing through southwest Herefordshire, England, and eastern Monmouthshire, Wales, its confluence with the River Wye is approximately south of Monmouth.

The Monnow rises near Craswall on Cefn Hill just below the high Black Mountains, Wales. It flows southwards, gaining the waters of its tributaries the Escley Brook and Olchon Brook near Clodock and the waters of the River Honddu, from the Welsh side of the Black Mountains, near Pandy. The river then flows briefly eastwards, to Pontrilas, where it is joined by its largest tributary, the River Dore before again turning southwards. At Monmouth, the Monnow joins into the River Wye with the River Trothy. The unique medieval Monnow Bridge in Monmouth is the only remaining fortified river bridge in Great Britain with its gate tower standing on the bridge.

The long-distance Monnow Valley Walk follows the river.

==Toponymy==
The River Monnow derives its name from the Welsh &quot;Myn-wy&quot;) and translates to &quot;swift water&quot;. (&quot;myn&quot; means swift, and &quot;wy&quot; is one of the many Welsh words for water)

==Brown trout==
At one time the river was noted for its substantial brown trout population, with the length from Pontrilas to Skenfrith producing record catches. Numbers fell substantially during the 20th century and especially after the 1960s but in more recent years the trout fishing has improved dramatically and the Monnow catchment once again ranks as one of the best wild trout fisheries in England and Wales and it is now also noted for the grayling fishing. A recently opened fish pass at Monmouth allowing migratory fish to by-pass a previously impassable weir has once more given Atlantic salmon and sea trout access to the majority of the catchment and salmon were seen jumping at the now dismantled Kentchurch weir for the first time for many years in the Autumn of 2008. The Monnow Rivers Association works to improve fishing habitats on the river and to encourage responsible fishing.

==Hydroelectric power==
At Osbaston, immediately north of Monmouth, the Monmouth New Hydro Scheme harnesses the flow of the Monnow to provide 670,000 kWh of electricity per year. The Osbaston fish pass facilitates the passage of river-spawning fish and other species past what would otherwise be an obstruction.

<text>Milford is a village in the civil parish of Witley and Milford south west of Godalming in Surrey, England that was a small village in the early medieval period — it grew significantly after the building of the Portsmouth Direct Line which serves Godalming railway station and its own minor stop railway station. The village, served by a wide array of shops and amenities, has to one side an all-directions junction of the A3, one of Britain&#x27;s trunk roads. Nearby settlements are Eashing, Shackleford,
Witley and Elstead, and the hamlets of Enton and Hydestile, all of which are in the Borough of Waverley. The west of the parish is in the Surrey Hills AONB.

==Transportation==
Until the 1990s, the A3 road ran through the edge of village (it now bypasses it to the west). Milford is still an important road junction, where the A283 road and A286 roads leave the A3 and run south to West Sussex. Milford railway station is on the mainline between and .

==Education==

<doc id="298975" wikidata="Q1066433" url="?curid=298975" title="Audion">
<text>The Audion was an electronic detecting or amplifying vacuum tube invented by American electrical engineer Lee de Forest as a diode in 1906. Improved, it was patented as the first triode in 1908, consisting of an evacuated glass tube containing three electrodes: a heated filament (the cathode, made out of tantalum), a grid, and a plate (the anode). It is important in the history of technology because it was the first widely used electronic device which could amplify. A low power signal at the grid could control much more power in the plate circuit.

Audions had more residual gas than later vacuum tubes; the residual gas limited the dynamic range and gave the Audion non-linear characteristics and erratic performance. Originally developed as a radio receiver detector by adding a grid electrode to the Fleming valve, it found little use until its amplifying ability was recognized around 1912 by several researchers, who used it to build the first amplifying radio receivers and electronic oscillators. The many practical applications for amplification motivated its rapid development, and the original Audion was superseded within a few years by improved versions with a higher vacuum.

== History ==
It had been known since the middle of the 19th century that gas flames were electrically conductive, and early wireless experimenters had noticed that this conductivity was affected by the presence of radio waves. De Forest found that gas in a partial vacuum heated by a conventional lamp filament behaved much the same way, and that if a wire were wrapped around the glass housing, the device could serve as a detector of radio signals. In his original design, a small metal plate was sealed into the lamp housing, and this was connected to the positive terminal of a 22–volt battery via a pair of headphones, the negative terminal being connected to one side of the lamp filament. When wireless signals were applied to the wire wrapped around the outside of the glass, they caused disturbances in the current which produced sounds in the headphones.

This was a significant development as existing commercial wireless systems were heavily protected by patents; a new type of detector would allow de Forest to market his own system. He eventually discovered that connecting the antenna circuit to a third electrode placed directly in the space current path greatly improved the sensitivity; in his earliest versions, this was simply a piece of wire bent into the shape of a gridiron (hence &quot;grid&quot;).

The Audion provided power gain; with other detectors, all of the power to operate the headphones had to come from the antenna circuit itself. Consequently, weak transmitters could be heard at greater distances.

=== Patents and disputes ===
De Forest and everybody else at the time greatly underestimated the potential of his grid Audion, imagining it to be limited to mostly military applications. It is significant that de Forest apparently did not see its potential as a telephone repeater amplifier at the time he filed the patent claiming it, even though he had previously patented amplification devices and crude electromechanical &quot;note magnifiers&quot; had been the bane of the telephone industry for at least two decades. (Ironically, in the years of patent disputes leading up to World War I, it was only this &quot;loophole&quot; that allowed vacuum triodes to be manufactured at all since de Forest&#x27;s grid Audion patent did not mention this application).

De Forest was granted a patent for his early two-electrode diode version of the Audion on November 13, 1906 (), and the &quot;triode&quot; (three-electrode) version was patented in 1908 (). De Forest continued to claim that he developed the Audion independently from John Ambrose Fleming&#x27;s earlier research on the thermionic valve (for which Fleming received Great Britain patent 24850 and the American Fleming valve patent ), and de Forest became embroiled in many radio-related patent disputes. De Forest was famous for saying that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know why it worked, it just did&quot;.

He always referred to the vacuum triodes developed by other researchers as &quot;Oscillaudions&quot;, although there is no evidence that he had any significant input to their development. It is true that after the invention of the true vacuum triode in 1913 (see below), de Forest continued to manufacture various types of radio transmitting and receiving apparatus, (examples of which are illustrated on this page). However, although he routinely described these devices as using &quot;Audions&quot;, they actually used high-vacuum triodes, using circuitry very similar to that developed by other experimenters.

In 1914, Columbia University student Edwin Howard Armstrong worked with professor John Harold Morecroft to document the electrical principles of the Audion. Armstrong published his explanation of the Audion in &quot;Electrical World&quot; in December 1914, complete with circuit diagrams and oscilloscope graphs. In March and April 1915, Armstrong spoke to the Institute of Radio Engineers in New York and Boston, respectively, presenting his paper &quot;Some Recent Developments in the Audion Receiver&quot;, which was published in September. A combination of the two papers was reprinted in other journals such as the &quot;Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences&quot;. When Armstrong and de Forest later faced each other in a dispute over the regeneration patent, Armstrong was able to demonstrate conclusively that de Forest still had no idea how it worked.

The problem was that (possibly to distance his invention from the Fleming valve) de Forest&#x27;s original patents specified that low-pressure gas inside the Audion was essential to its operation (Audion being a contraction of &quot;Audio-Ion&quot;), and in fact early Audions had severe reliability problems due to this gas being adsorbed by the metal electrodes. The Audions sometimes worked extremely well; at other times they would barely work at all.

As well as de Forest himself, numerous researchers had tried to find ways to improve the reliability of the device by stabilizing the partial vacuum. Much of the research that led to the development of true vacuum tubes was carried out by Irving Langmuir in the General Electric (GE) research laboratories.

===Kenotron and Pliotron===
Langmuir had long suspected that certain assumed limitations on the performance of various low-pressure and vacuum electrical devices, might not be fundamental physical limitations at all, but simply due to contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process. His first success was in demonstrating that, contrary to what Edison and others had long asserted, incandescent lamps could function more efficiently and with longer life if the glass envelope was filled with low-pressure inert gas rather than a complete vacuum. However, this only worked if the gas used was meticulously &#x27;scrubbed&quot; of all traces of oxygen and water vapor.
He then applied the same approach to producing a rectifier for the newly developed &quot;Coolidge&quot; X-ray tubes. Again contrary to what had been widely believed to be possible, by virtue of meticulous cleanliness and attention to detail, he was able to produce versions of the Fleming Diode that could rectify hundreds of thousands of volts. His rectifiers were called &quot;Kenotrons&quot; from the Greek &quot;keno&quot; (empty, contains nothing, as in a vacuum) and &quot;tron&quot; (device, instrument).

He then turned his attention to the Audion tube, again suspecting that its notoriously unpredictable behaviour might be tamed with more care in the manufacturing process.

However he took a somewhat unorthodox approach. Instead of trying to stabilize the partial vacuum, he wondered if it was possible to make the Audion function with the total vacuum of a Kenotron, since that was somewhat easier to stabilize.

He soon realized that his &quot;vacuum&quot; Audion had markedly different characteristics from the de Forest version, and was really a quite different device, capable of linear amplification and at much higher frequencies. To distinguish his device from the Audion he named it the &quot;Pliotron&quot;, from the Greek &quot;plio&quot; (more or extra, in this sense meaning gain, more signal coming out than went in).

Essentially, he referred to all his vacuum tube designs as Kenotrons, the Pliotron basically being a specialized type of Kenotron. However, because Pliotron and Kenotron were registered trademarks, technical writers tended to use the more generic term &quot;vacuum tube&quot;. By the mid-1920s, the term &quot;Kenotron&quot; had come to exclusively refer to vacuum tube rectifiers, while the term &quot;Pliotron&quot; had fallen into disuse. Ironically, in popular usage, the sound-alike brands &quot;Radiotron&quot; and &quot;Ken-Rad&quot; outlasted the original names.

== Applications and use ==
De Forest continued to manufacture and supply Audions to the US Navy up until the early 1920s, for maintenance of existing equipment, but elsewhere they were regarded as well and truly obsolete by then. It was the vacuum triode that made practical radio broadcasts a reality.

Prior to the introduction of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of detectors including coherers, barretters, and crystal detectors. The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of galena crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a &quot;cat&#x27;s-whisker detector&quot;. They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat&#x27;s whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter.

The Audion was a considerable improvement on this, but the original devices could not provide any subsequent amplification to what was produced in the signal detection process. The later vacuum triodes allowed the signal to be amplified to any desired level, typically by feeding the amplified output of one triode into the grid of the next, eventually providing more than enough power to drive a full-sized speaker. Apart from this, they were able to amplify the incoming radio signals prior to the detection process, making it work much more efficiently.

Vacuum tubes could also be used to make superior radio transmitters. The combination of much more efficient transmitters and much more sensitive receivers revolutionized radio communication during World War I.

By the late 1920s such &quot;tube radios&quot; began to become a fixture of most Western world households, and remained so until long after the introduction of transistor radios in the mid-1950s.

In modern electronics, the vacuum tube has been largely superseded by solid state devices such as the transistor, invented in 1947 and implemented in integrated circuits in 1959, although vacuum tubes remain to this day in such applications as high-powered transmitters, guitar amplifiers and some high fidelity audio equipment.

<text>The Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act 1913, commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act, was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government in 1913.

The Cat and Mouse Act was passed by Parliament as a response to members of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU, commonly referred to as suffragettes) utilizing hunger strikes as a form of protest while they were imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women&#x27;s suffrage. The hunger strikers were force-fed by the prison staff, leading to a public outcry. The act allowed the prisoners temporary release when their hunger strikes began to impact their health; they then had a predetermined period of time in which to recover after which they were rearrested and taken back to prison to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release. One effect of the act was to make hunger strikes technically legal. The nickname of the act came about because of the domestic cat&#x27;s purported habit of playing with its prey, allowing it to temporarily escape a number of times, before killing it.

==Government use==
After the act was introduced, force-feeding was no longer used to combat hunger strikes. Instead, suffragettes on hunger strike were kept in prison until they became extremely weak, at which point they would be temporarily released in order to recover. This effectively allowed the government to claim that it was not responsible for any harm (or even death) which might result from the starvation. During the recovery period, any law-breaking on the part of the suffragette would see them put straight back in prison.

The time spent out of prison recovering was not counted as time served towards the hunger strikers&#x27; prison sentences. Once deemed recovered, they would be recalled to prison to continue their sentence. This meant that suffragettes could be repeatedly released and imprisoned for the same offence, without a further trial.

==Background==
To attain the goal of suffrage on the same basis as men, the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU, known colloquially as the suffragettes) engaged in acts of protest such as the breaking of windows, arson, and the &quot;technical assault&quot; (without causing harm) of police officers. Many WSPU members were jailed for these offences. In response to what the organisation viewed as brutal punishment and harsh treatment by the government at the time, imprisoned WSPU members embarked on a sustained campaign of hunger strikes. Some women were freed on taking this action, but this rendered the policy of imprisonment of suffragettes futile. The prison authorities then turned to a policy of force feeding hunger-strikers by nasogastric tube. Repeated uses of this process often caused sickness, which served the WSPU&#x27;s aims of demonstrating the government&#x27;s harsh treatment of the prisoners.

Faced with growing public disquiet over the tactic of force feeding, and the determination of the jailed suffragettes to continue their hunger strikes, the government rushed the act through Parliament. The effect of the act was to permit the release of prisoners for them to recuperate from the effects of a hunger strike whilst leaving the police free to re-imprison offenders once they had recovered. The intention of the act was to counter the tactic of hunger strikes and the damaging consequences for the government&#x27;s support among (male) voters by the force feeding of women prisoners but, if anything, it reduced support for the Liberal government.

==Women writing about the experience of being forcibly fed==
In a book called &quot;Suffrage and the Pankhursts&quot;, Jane Marcus argues that forcible feeding was the main image of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the public imagination. Women wrote about how the experience made them feel in letters, diaries, speeches and suffrage publications, including &quot;Votes for Women&quot; and &quot;The Suffragette&quot;. One of the force-fed suffragettes, Lady Constance Lytton, wrote a book that suggested that working-class women were more likely to be forcibly fed in prison than upper-class women. In general, the medical procedure of force feeding was described as a physical and mental violation that caused pain, suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, anguish and rage.

Violet Bland also wrote in &quot;Votes for Women&quot; about her experiences of being force-fed, explaining how, &quot;they twisted my neck, jerked my head back, closing my throat, held all the time as in a vice,&quot; while they tried to force feed her. She wrote how the guards were always six or seven to one and that, &quot;there was really no possibility of the victim doing much in the way of protesting excepting verbally, to express one’s horror of it; therefore no excuse for the brutality shown on several occasions.&quot; At the end of what she describes as her assault, when she didn&#x27;t get up from her chair quickly enough because of her &quot;helpless and breathless condition,&quot; they snatched the chair from under her, throwing her to the floor. She wrote that she had no doubt the attacks were made with the intention of breaking the hunger-strikers down.

==Unintended consequences==

The ineffectiveness of the act was very soon evident as the authorities experienced much more difficulty than anticipated in re-arresting the released hunger-strikers. Many of them eluded arrest with the help of a network of suffragette sympathisers and an all-women team of bodyguards, who employed tactics of misdirection, subterfuge and occasionally direct confrontation with the police. The inability of the government to lay its hands on high-profile suffragettes transformed what had been intended as a discreet device to control suffragette hunger-strikers into a public scandal.

This act was aimed at suppressing the power of the organisation by demoralising the activists, but turned out to be counter-productive as it undermined the moral authority of the government. The act was viewed as violating basic human rights, not only of the suffragettes but of other prisoners. The act&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Cat and Mouse Act&quot;, referring to the way the government seemed to play with prisoners as a cat may with a captured mouse, underlined how the cruelty of repeated releases and re-imprisonments turned the suffragettes from targets of scorn to objects of sympathy.

The Asquith government&#x27;s implementation of the act caused the militant WSPU and the suffragettes to perceive Asquith as the enemy – an enemy to be vanquished in what the organisation saw as an all-out war. A related effect of this law was to increase support for the Labour Party, many of whose early founders supported votes for women. For example, philosopher Bertrand Russell left the Liberal Party, and wrote pamphlets denouncing the act and the Liberals for making in his view an illiberal and anti-constitutional law. So the controversy helped to accelerate the decline in the Liberals&#x27; electoral position, as segments of the middle class began to defect to Labour.

The act also handed the WSPU an issue on which to campaign and rail against other parts of the British establishment, in particular the Church of England. During 1913, the WSPU directly targeted the Bishop of Winchester, Edward Talbot; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson; the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram; the Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, and the Bishops of Croydon, Lewes, Islington and Stepney. Each one was picketed by deputations at their official residences until granted an audience, during which the church leaders were asked to protest against forcible feeding. Norah Dacre Fox led many of the deputations on behalf of the WSPU, which were widely reported in &quot;The Suffragette&quot;. At one point, the Bishop of London was persuaded to visit Holloway personally in connection with allegations of female prisoners being poisoned during force feeding. The Bishop made several visits to the prison, but this came to nothing, and his public statements said that he could find no evidence of ill treatment during force feeding – indeed, he believed that force feeding was carried out &quot;in the kindest possible spirit&quot; – was seen by the WSPU as collusion with the government and prison authorities. If the WSPU had been hoping to win support from the church for their wider cause by pressing on the issue of forcible feeding, they were disappointed. The church chose not to be drawn into a battle between the WSPU and the authorities, and maintained the party line that militancy was a precursor to forcible feeding and militancy was against the will of God, therefore the church could not act against forcible feeding.

Research indicates that the act did little to deter the activities of the suffragettes. Their militant actions only ceased with the outbreak of war and their support for the war effort. However, the start of the war in August 1914, and the ending of all suffragette activities for the duration of the war, meant that the full potential impact of the Cat and Mouse Act will never be known.

<doc id="298986" wikidata="Q2621407" url="?curid=298986" title="Delta cell">
<text>Delta cells (δ-cells or D cells) are somatostatin-producing cells. They can be found in the stomach, intestine and the pancreatic islets. Delta cells comprise ca 5% of the cells in the islets but may interact with many more islet cells than suggested by their low numbers. In rodents, delta-cells are located in the periphery of the islets; in humans the islet architecture is generally less organized and delta-cells are frequently observed inside the islets as well. In both species, the peptide hormone Urocortin III (Ucn3) is a major local signal that is released from beta cells (and alpha cells in primates) to induce the local secretion of somatostatin. It has also been suggested that somatostatin may be implicated in insulin-induced hypoglycaemia through a mechanism involving SGLT-2 receptors. Ghrelin can also strongly stimulate somatostatin secretion, thus indirectly inhibiting insulin release. Viewed under an electron microscope, delta-cells can be identified as cells with smaller and slightly more compact granules than beta cells.

The δ-cells in the stomach contain CCKBR (which respond to gastrin) and M3 receptors (which respond to Ach). Respectively, these receptors will increase somatostatin output and decrease somatostatin output from the δ-cells. VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, acts positively on δ-cells resulting in more somatostatin being released.

In the stomach, somatostatin acts directly on the acid-producing parietal cells via a G-protein coupled receptor (which inhibits adenylate cyclase, thus effectively antagonising the stimulatory effect of histamine) to reduce acid secretion. Somatostatin can also indirectly decrease stomach acid production by preventing the release of other hormones, including gastrin, secretin and histamine which effectively slows down the digestive process.

==Clinical significance==
A tumor of the delta cells is called a &quot;somatostatinoma&quot;.

When a person is infected with &quot;H. pylori&quot; the lower region of the stomach, the antrum, is predominantly inflamed. This is where most of the δ-cells in the stomach are. The bacteria produce a cloud of ammonia around themselves using urease to protect them from the stomach acid; however, this reacts with the acid producing ammonium which is toxic to cells. This leads to many of the δ-cells dying, an effect that is further compounded by the low PD-L1 expression on the δ-cells as compared to gastric G cells (resulting in higher susceptibility of δ-cells to inflammatory responses). In turn, this results in a lower level of somatostatin being secreted and consequently higher release of gastrin and stomach acid. This, combined with the damage from ammonium, leads to ulceration of the stomach wall.

<text>Sir David Rowat Barclay (27 October 1934 – 10 January 2021) and Sir Frederick Hugh Barclay (born 27 October 1934), commonly referred to as the &quot;Barclay Brothers&quot; or &quot;Barclay Twins&quot;, were British billionaire brothers, of whom Frederick Barclay is now the sole survivor. They were identical twins and, until David&#x27;s death in 2021, had joint business interests primarily in media, retail and property.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List of 2020 estimated their wealth at £7 billion. They earned a reputation for avoiding publicity and have often been described as reclusive.

David&#x27;s son, Aidan, manages their UK businesses. Their businesses have been accused of tax avoidance, by placing assets under ownership of companies registered abroad and controlled through trusts. Their Press Holdings company owns &quot;Apollo&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazines and, through a wholly owned subsidiary (Press Acquisitions Limited), they also own Telegraph Group Limited, parent company of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

In 1993, the brothers bought the lease of the island of Brecqhou, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, just off the coast of Sark.

==Biography==
The Barclay brothers were born within ten minutes of each other in Hammersmith, London, to Scottish parents Beatrice Cecilia (née Taylor; died 1989) and her husband, Frederick Hugh Barclay, a travelling salesman. The couple had eight other children. Frederick Sr. died when the brothers were twelve years old, and they left school four years later in 1950 to work in the accounts department at the General Electric Company before setting up as painters and decorators.

In 1955, David married Zoe Newton, who had trained as a ballet dancer, at St John the Baptist Church, Holland Road, Kensington. Zoe Barclay pursued a modelling career and became the most photographed and highest paid model in Britain of her time, appearing on the front of popular magazines such as &quot;Picturegoer&quot;. She appeared on television and in the Dairy Council advertisements as the &quot;drinka pinta milka day&quot; girl.

By the end of the 1950s, the brothers were running Candy Corner, tobacconists and confectioners, on the edge of Kensington. However, in November 1960 the business folded when Frederick and Douglas were made bankrupt at the High Court after their landlord seized the shop because they were in breach of the terms of the lease. A notice in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; at that time announced the bankruptcies, listing a former business interest of Frederick, then aged 26, and Douglas, two years his junior, as builders and decorators called Barclay Brothers based at the Barclay family home.

Meanwhile, David was registered as a director of Hillgate Estate Agents in 1962, with his wife Zoe as a co-director (she had given up her modelling career to concentrate on her young sons, Aidan, Howard and Duncan). By 1968, however, Frederick was running the family businesses, replacing Zoe on the Hillgate board. He had obtained the discharge of his bankruptcy after David paid the creditors. During this time they redeveloped old boarding houses in London, and made them into hotels.

Between 1968 and 1974, the twins received increasingly large loans from the Crown Agents, a government agency designed to help the colonies and developing countries do business in Britain. In 1970, they bought Gestplan Hotels, which operated the exclusive Londonderry House Hotel in Park Lane, from a group of Lebanese bankers.

In the mid-1970s, Frederick met and married Hiroko Asada (née Kuzusaka), a familiar figure among Japanese society in London; she had a son from her previous marriage, Ko Asada Barclay, who is married to Sara Love.

From the late 1960s onwards, the Barclay brothers continued to build up stakes in businesses such as breweries and casinos. In 1975, they bought the Howard Hotel, overlooking the Thames at Temple Place. In 1983, they bought Ellerman, the brewing and shipping group, for £45m. They later sold its brewing division for £240m. They used the proceeds to buy the Ritz Hotel in London&#x27;s Piccadilly in 1995. They spent £370 million on Gotaas-Larsen, a Bermuda-based shipping company, and £200 million on the Automotive Financial Group, a motor retail chain in 1994. The brothers were involved in philanthropy, and were knighted in 2000 for their support of medical research, to which they have donated an estimated £40 million between 1987 and 2000.

In 2004 they were listed in 42nd place with an estimate of £750 million on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List, and in 2006 they were ranked 24th with a value of £1,800m. In 2012, they topped the Media Rich List with an estimate of £2.25 billion.

David died on 10 January 2021, after a short illness.

In May 2021, the court ordered Frederick to pay his wife, Hiroko, £100m on a divorce she had initiated; the judge criticised Frederick for selling a yacht contrary to court orders. The court said he had &quot;completely ignored those orders, sold the yacht, and applied the equity for his own use. I regarded that behaviour as reprehensible&quot; ... &quot;[He] is a public figure who should have been aware of the potential consequences of disobedience of court orders and his behaviour in the proceedings should not be allowed to pass completely under the radar”. On 28 July 2022, a high court judge ruled that Frederick&#x27;s ex-wife of 34 years had failed to prove he was in contempt of court for not paying her a £100m divorce settlement. However, he was told he faced a potential jail sentence after a judge found him in contempt of court for failing to pay his ex-wife £245,000 in legal fees and monthly maintenance costs.

==Business interests==
===Shipping===
====Ellerman Lines====
In 1983, the brothers purchased brewing and shipping group Ellerman for £45m. They later sold its brewing division (for £240m), and in late 1985 its shipping business (to its management). The Ellerman deal helped the Barclays develop the strategy of buying companies, breaking them up and profiting from the real estate. The technique of approaching an insider to obtain an advantage also set a precedent for later deals: the Barclays approached the Ellerman non-executive chairman, David Scott, at a secret meeting in Monte Carlo. Scott recalled in his memoirs that David Barclay requested an exclusive option to buy the firm, and to keep it secret from all but two directors, in return for a promise that Scott would stay on as non-executive chairman. However, moments after signing the sale document, Scott was handed a letter (by the Barclays&#x27; lawyer) demanding his immediate resignation on grounds that he had been indiscreet about the offer.

===Retail===
====The Very Group and Littlewoods====
In 2002, the brothers purchased the Liverpool-based retail company Littlewoods from its founders, the Moores family, for £750 million. The deal was bankrolled by HBOS, which also took a 5% equity stake in the brothers&#x27; bidding vehicle, LW Investments. The brothers merged the company with their earlier purchase, The Very Group, to form Littlewoods Shop Direct Home Shopping Limited, which operates a majority share of the United Kingdom&#x27;s home shopping market. They also closed and sold off the Littlewoods department store chain, with the largest parcel of 120 properties being purchased by Associated British Foods for leasing mainly to its subsidiary Primark, while other stores were leased to Marks &amp; Spencer, New Look and British Home Stores.

Two years after the brothers&#x27; acquisition of Littlewoods Ltd., HM Revenue and Customs repaid the company VAT that it had charged in breach of EU law. Since October 2004, more than £200 million in overpaid VAT and £268 million in simple interest was repaid to the company. However, Littlewoods argued that the company was owed a compounded interest rate and subsequently sued HMRC for £1 billion.

In 2024, Very Group auditors, Deloitte, resigned after stating they struggled to access &quot;appropriate and relevant information in respect of certain financing arrangements between companies in the wider group&quot;. Very Group&#x27;s ownership is spread across many different companies, some unaudited, with an ultimate offshore owner.

====Yodel====
Delivery company Yodel has received criticism for its poor service in the past, but has improved over recent years. Yodel (which operates via Home Delivery Network Ltd.) suffered a £130 million loss in 2011.

====handbag.com====
In October 2006, the Barclays sold handbag.com for £22 million. This was almost all profit: they acquired the website after it was set up as a joint venture between Hollinger International and the Boots Group in 1999. The Handbag group was a collection of four websites designed for female users: the high fashion getlippy.com, the fashion and home life-focused allaboutyou.com, a &quot;specialist pregnancy site&quot; gomamatoday.com and handbag.com.

====Woolworths and Ladybird brands====
On 2 February 2009, it was announced that the brothers&#x27; Shop Direct Group had purchased the brand names of Woolworths and Ladybird children&#x27;s clothing for an undisclosed amount, from Deloitte, the administrators of the failed Woolworths Group. In July 2021, the British and Irish Woolworths brands would be sold to Woolworth Deutschland, with The Very Group retaining the Ladybird brand.

===Newspapers===
Many of the brothers&#x27; publishing interests are owned through a Jersey company, Press Holdings.

====&quot;The European&quot;====
In 1992, the Barclay brothers entered the newspaper publishing industry by buying &quot;The European&quot; newspaper, formerly part of Robert Maxwell&#x27;s holdings. The weekly paper became a high-end business tabloid, but closed in 1998.

====&quot;The Scotsman&quot;====
In 1995, they bought &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper, and in 1996 appointed former &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor Andrew Neil to oversee their publishing interests. On 19 December 2005, the Barclays sold The Scotsman Publications Ltd, itself then part of Press Holdings Group, for £160 million to Johnston Press. The Barclays had owned these publications for a decade, and said they intended to use the capital raised on their other interests. During their ownership of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, the newspaper had seven editors in nine years (see The Scotsman: Editors).

====&quot;Sunday Business&quot;====
In 1998 they bought and relaunched the &quot;Sunday Business&quot; newspaper with editor Jeff Randall. It became a weekly magazine &quot;The Business&quot; in 2006, and was merged into &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2008.

====The Telegraph Media Group====
In July 2004, the Barclays bought The Telegraph Group (now Telegraph Media Group), which includes &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot; after months of intense bidding and lawsuits. &quot;The Telegraph Group&quot; was owned by Hollinger Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the newspaper group controlled by the Canadian-born British businessman Conrad Black. As part of a February 2004 judgment, an American judge, Leo Strine, accused the Barclay brothers of being &quot;less than fully candid&quot;, adding they had &quot;remained silent while Lord Black misled the Hollinger Inc. International board&quot;, remarks that incurred the brothers&#x27; wrath, with David branding the criticisms &quot;grossly unfair&quot;.

The brothers&#x27; period as newspaper proprietors was more tumultuous than with their property interests. At the Telegraph Group, Murdoch MacLennan made over 100 journalists redundant in 2006, prompting the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) to consider strike action. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; editor Dominic Lawson was sacked and replaced by Sarah Sands in June 2005, but Sands lasted just nine months. Patience Wheatcroft from &quot;The Times&quot; was appointed editor in March 2006. She was replaced by Ian McGregor one year later. In February 2015, Peter Oborne, the Chief Political Correspondent resigned from the newspaper in protest at its editorial direction. Jason Seiken was made editor-in-chief and chief content officer of Telegraph Media Group in October 2013, but announced his departure after 18 months in April 2015.

In October 2019, it was announced that the brothers were seeking to sell the Telegraph Group amid speculation that their business interests were in some difficulty. On 7 June 2023, after a bitter row over nearly £1bn of unpaid debts, the &quot;Daily&quot; and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, amongst others, were put up for sale by AlixPartners, who had been appointed by Bank of Scotland as official receiver to seize the shares owned by the Barclay family in the holding company that ultimately controlled the national newspapers and &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine.

==Controversies==
===Fraud and tax avoidance===
In 2024, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported on strong grounds that the Barclay brothers engaged in fraud and tax avoidance or evasion in relation to a deal in the 1970s that saved the brothers from bankruptcy. &quot;The Economist&quot; also found that Frederick Barclay concealed assets from a bankruptcy court, which is a crime.

===Tax exile accusation===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; has stated that the brothers are tax exiles, and although they reside, at least some of the time, in Monaco (giving Avenue de Grande Bretagne, Monte Carlo as their address) they operate their businesses from an office in the United Kingdom. When asked if he was a tax exile, Frederick stated that he lived abroad for health reasons. The corporate tax arrangements of the Ritz Hotel, purchased and refurbished by the brothers in 1995, were the subject of a December 2012 investigation by BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; current affairs television programme, which found the hotel had paid no corporation tax in the UK for 17 years, after legally claiming reliefs.

===Sark and Brecqhou disputes===

In 1993, the Barclay brothers bought the &quot;tenement&quot; of the island of Brecqhou, a small sister island of Sark, one of the Channel Islands. Their mock-Gothic castle on Brecqhou, designed by Quinlan Terry, features granite walls, battlements, two swimming pools and a helicopter pad. Since their purchase of the tenement of Brecqhou, the Barclays have been in several legal disputes with the government of Sark over such issues as the Barclays&#x27; violation of Sark&#x27;s law banning motor cars. They have also expressed a desire to make Brecqhou politically independent from Sark – building on the research of William Toplis, the painter, and others, who argued that Brecqhou was not a part of the fief of Sark.

In the mid-1990s, the brothers petitioned the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, challenging Sark&#x27;s inheritance law, which mandated their island be left to David&#x27;s oldest son. The brothers wanted to will their estate equally to their four children. Sark&#x27;s legislature decided to amend the inheritance law, allowing residents to leave property to any one of their children. In 2002, the brothers claimed their property tax was too high, particularly since they maintained Brecqhou&#x27;s paths and dock. Fearing more litigation, Sark officials cut the Barclays&#x27; tax rate.

In 2008 (partially due to legal activity by the Barclay brothers), Sark dismantled its 443-year-old feudal system of government on the premise that this was necessary to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. On 16 January 2008 and 21 February 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a law which introduced a 30-member chamber, with 28 members elected in Island-wide elections, one hereditary member and one member appointed for life. On 9 April 2008, the Privy Council approved the Sark law reforms, and the first elections under the new law were held in December 2008. 

On 11 December 2008, the Barclay brothers were in the news for pulling out their investments (which included hotels) from the island of Sark, causing 170 staff to be made redundant, after local voters did not support candidates championed by the Barclay brothers. The brothers had previously warned that if the voters chose to bring back the &#x27;establishment&#x27; Sark leaders that are still aligned with the feudal lord then they would pull out of Sark.

After the 2008 election, the brothers claimed that the presence of two unelected figures on Sark&#x27;s government – the seigneur and the seneschal, the local judge – was unjustifiable. They took their fight to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, arguing that the two roles break human rights laws that protect the rights of citizens to elect lawmakers. Their challenge was dismissed, but the Barclays said they would continue to fight, taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

On 28 March 2012, BBC Radio 4 dedicated part of its &quot;Today&quot; programme to analysis of the Barclay brothers&#x27; role in Sark. It reported that the islanders were protesting against bullying and intimidation by representatives of the Barclays after a story in their local paper had prompted the only doctor to leave the island. The doctor had used a boat rather than the Barclays&#x27; helicopter to transport a patient who was having a seizure to hospital on Guernsey, which was reported in the Barclays&#x27; paper as negligent. Despite support from the patient&#x27;s family and the local BMA, the doctor left Sark after the story, leaving the island without a doctor.

===Ritz Hotel bugging===
On 25 February 2020, the High Court in London was told that Frederick and his daughter Amanda were secretly recorded for several months after David&#x27;s sons Alistair, Aidan and Howard bugged the Ritz Hotel conservatory. Alistair Barclay had been seen handling an alleged bugging device. As of February 2020, Aidan Barclay, his son Andrew and two brothers face legal action for misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws. CCTV footage released by Frederick to the media on 18 May 2020 shows Alistair Barclay handling the alleged bugging device in the conservatory of the Ritz Hotel &quot;where Sir Frederick liked to conduct business meetings and smoke cigars.&quot; According to court documents, a second bug was supplied by private investigation firm Quest Global Limited.

<text>The Battle of Wimpfen took place during the Palatinate campaign period of the Thirty Years&#x27; War on 6 May 1622 near Wimpfen.

The combined forces of the Catholic League and the Spanish Empire under Marshal Tilly and Gonzalo de Córdoba defeated the Protestant forces of Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden.

== Background ==
=== Bohemian revolt ===

In the &quot;Bohemian revolt&quot; phase of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Protestant Bohemian nobility refused to confirm Catholic Ferdinand II as their king and had offered Count Frederick V of the Palatinate the crown of Bohemia. Frederick was crowned in 1619 but lost the kingdom to Catholic League troops under General Tilly at the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620.

Due to disunity among Protestant princes the Protestant Union was forced to declare its neutrality in the conflict in the Treaty of Ulm in 1620 and dissolved the following year.

=== Palatinate campaign ===

Count Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden had been one of the Protestant Union&#x27;s generals and maintained the mercenary army he had raised.

When General Tilly moved the Catholic League army from Bavaria towards the Palatinate in April 1622 to continue the war against Frederick V, Georg Friedrich declared for Frederick&#x27;s cause.
He marched his army to join General Mansfeld&#x27;s troops and met with them a few days after their victory against Tilly at the Battle of Mingolsheim on April 27.

By early May, the forces of Christian of Brunswick had arrived to the north of the Neckar River and were prepared to assist their fellow Protestants. While Mansfeld crossed the Neckar at Heidelberg to join with Brunswick and besiege the Spanish garrison at Ladenburg, Georg Friedrich pursued Tilly&#x27;s army who were retreating east towards the Neckar crossing at Wimpfen. Unknown to the Protestants, a Spanish army under General Córdoba had reinforced Tilly with several thousand men in the meantime.

Late on May 5, the Protestant troops, coming from the southwest, crossed a small creek (called &quot;Böllinger Bach&quot;) near the village of and formed up in battle lines.

== Battle ==

On May 6, both sides launched unsuccessful attacks on each other from early morning to about 11 o&#x27; clock.
Both sides had erected a wagenburg defense, fielded a strong artillery, and were cautious on the attack. Tilly held Córdobas troops in reserve at first, fearing an attack by one of the other Protestant armies in the area that wouldn&#x27;t come. As the Catholic armies began to break, Tilly&#x27;s elite regiments held their ground, forming into a tight pike formation and scaring away Georg Friedrich&#x27;s cavalry regiments.

There was a lull in fighting until early afternoon when a Catholic assault on Georg-Friedrich&#x27;s right flank sent his cavalry into flight. At about six o&#x27;clock an enemy cannon shot caused an explosion in the Protestant powder magazine, spreading panic in their ranks. Shortly afterwards, their wagenburg fell to Catholic attacks. Many died trying to escape across the &quot;Böllinger Bach&quot; creek.

== Aftermath ==

Count Georg Friedrich was injured in the face and narrowly escaped to Stuttgart, where he abdicated in favour of his eldest son. However, this did not save his family from punishment. His lands were thoroughly devastated by Catholic troops, and in August a substantial part of his domains was awarded to William, Margrave of Baden-Baden of a rival, Catholic branch of House Baden. Until 1771 the margraviate was split into Protestant &quot;Baden-Durlach&quot; and Catholic &quot;Baden-Baden&quot;.

General Tilly continued his campaign and prevailed again at the Battle of Höchst in June, then proceeded to subdue the fortified towns of the Electoral Palatinate one by one.

In 1623 the Diet of Regensburg awarded Frederick V&#x27;s lands and seat in the Electoral College to Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, an eminent leader of the Catholic League. From 1623 he styled himself Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria and his duchy Electorate of Bavaria.

<text>A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell (leukocyte) in the immune system of most vertebrates. Lymphocytes include T cells (for cell-mediated and cytotoxic adaptive immunity), B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity), and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs; &quot;innate T cell-like&quot; cells involved in mucosal immunity and homeostasis), of which natural killer cells are an important subtype (which functions in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity). They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name &quot;lymphocyte&quot; (with &quot;cyte&quot; meaning cell). Lymphocytes make up between 18% and 42% of circulating white blood cells.

==Types==
The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. 

They can also be classified as small lymphocytes and large lymphocytes based on their size and appearance. 

Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus.

===T cells and B cells===

T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific &quot;non-self&quot; antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called &quot;T helper cells&quot;, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called &quot;cytotoxic T cells&quot;, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of &quot;memory cells&quot;. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will &quot;remember&quot; each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.

===Natural killer cells===
NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and play a major role in defending the host from tumors and virally infected cells. NK cells modulate the functions of other cells, including macrophages and T cells, and distinguish infected cells and tumors from normal and uninfected cells by recognizing changes of a surface molecule called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. NK cells are activated in response to a family of cytokines called interferons. Activated NK cells release cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules which then destroy the altered cells. They are named &quot;natural killer cells&quot; because they do not require prior activation in order to kill cells which are missing MHC class I.

===Dual expresser lymphocyte – X cell===
The X lymphocyte is a reported cell type expressing both a B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor and is hypothesized to be implicated in type 1 diabetes. Its existence as a cell type has been challenged by two studies. However, the authors of original article pointed to the fact that the two studies have detected X cells by imaging microscopy and FACS as described. Additional studies are required to determine the nature and properties of X cells (also called dual expressers).

==Development==
Mammalian stem cells differentiate into several kinds of blood cell within the bone marrow. This process is called haematopoiesis. All lymphocytes originate, during this process, from a common lymphoid progenitor before differentiating into their distinct lymphocyte types. The differentiation of lymphocytes follows various pathways in a hierarchical fashion as well as in a more plastic fashion. The formation of lymphocytes is known as lymphopoiesis. In mammals, B cells mature in the bone marrow, which is at the core of most bones. In birds, B cells mature in the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid organ where they were first discovered by Chang and Glick, (B for bursa) and not from bone marrow as commonly believed. T cells migrate to the blood stream and mature in a distinct primary organ, called the thymus. Following maturation, the lymphocytes enter the circulation and peripheral lymphoid organs (e.g. the spleen and lymph nodes) where they survey for invading pathogens and/or tumor cells.

The lymphocytes involved in adaptive immunity (i.e. B and T cells) differentiate further after exposure to an antigen; they form effector and memory lymphocytes. Effector lymphocytes function to eliminate the antigen, either by releasing antibodies (in the case of B cells), cytotoxic granules (cytotoxic T cells) or by signaling to other cells of the immune system (helper T cells). Memory T cells remain in the peripheral tissues and circulation for an extended time ready to respond to the same antigen upon future exposure; they live weeks to several years, which is very long compared to other leukocytes.

==Characteristics==
Microscopically, in a Wright&#x27;s stained peripheral blood smear, a normal lymphocyte has a large, dark-staining nucleus with little to no eosinophilic cytoplasm. In normal situations, the coarse, dense nucleus of a lymphocyte is approximately the size of a red blood cell (about 7 μm in diameter). Some lymphocytes show a clear perinuclear zone (or halo) around the nucleus or could exhibit a small clear zone to one side of the nucleus. Polyribosomes are a prominent feature in the lymphocytes and can be viewed with an electron microscope. The ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis, allowing the generation of large quantities of cytokines and immunoglobulins by these cells.

It is impossible to distinguish between T cells and B cells in a peripheral blood smear. Normally, flow cytometry testing is used for specific lymphocyte population counts. This can be used to determine the percentage of lymphocytes that contain a particular combination of specific cell surface proteins, such as immunoglobulins or cluster of differentiation (CD) markers or that produce particular proteins (for example, cytokines using intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS)). In order to study the function of a lymphocyte by virtue of the proteins it generates, other scientific techniques like the ELISPOT or secretion assay techniques can be used.

In the circulatory system, they move from lymph node to lymph node. This contrasts with macrophages, which are rather stationary in the nodes.

==Lymphocytes and disease==

A lymphocyte count is usually part of a peripheral complete blood cell count and is expressed as the percentage of lymphocytes to the total number of white blood cells counted.

A general increase in the number of lymphocytes is known as lymphocytosis, whereas a decrease is known as lymphocytopenia.

===High===
An increase in lymphocyte concentration is usually a sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.

==== Lymphoproliferative disorders ====
Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) encompass a diverse group of diseases marked by uncontrolled lymphocyte production, leading to issues like lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and bone marrow infiltration. These disorders are common in immunocompromised individuals and involve abnormal proliferation of T and B cells, often resulting in immunodeficiency and immune system dysfunction. Various gene mutations, both iatrogenic and acquired, are implicated in LPD. One subtype, X-linked LPD, is linked to mutations in the X chromosome, predisposing individuals to natural killer cell LPD and T-cell LPD. Additionally, conditions like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and certain viral infections elevate the risk of LPD. Treatment methods, such as immunosuppressive drugs and tissue transplantation, can also increase susceptibility. LPDs encompass a wide array of disorders involving B-cell (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and T-cell (e.g., Sezary syndrome) abnormalities, each presenting distinct challenges in diagnosis and management.

===Low===

A low normal to low absolute lymphocyte concentration is associated with increased rates of infection after surgery or trauma.

One basis for low T cell lymphocytes occurs when the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects and destroys T cells (specifically, the CD4+ subgroup of T lymphocytes, which become helper T cells). Without the key defense that these T cells provide, the body becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections that otherwise would not affect healthy people. The extent of HIV progression is typically determined by measuring the percentage of CD4+ T cells in the patient&#x27;s blood – HIV ultimately progresses to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of other viruses or lymphocyte disorders can also often be estimated by counting the numbers of lymphocytes present in the blood.

===Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes===
In some cancers, such as melanoma and colorectal cancer, lymphocytes can migrate into and attack the tumor. This can sometimes lead to regression of the primary tumor.

<text>Mansfelder Land was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the middle of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Aschersleben-Staßfurt, Bernburg, Saalkreis, Merseburg-Querfurt, Sangerhausen and Quedlinburg. It was merged on July 1, 2007, with Sangerhausen into the new district Mansfeld-Südharz as part of a reform.

== History ==

The district was created in 1994 by merging the previous districts Hettstedt and Eisleben. These were the successors of the &quot;Mansfelder Gebirgskreis&quot; (mountain district of Mansfeld) and &quot;Mansfelder Seekreis&quot; (lake district of Mansfeld), which were renamed after World War II.

The city of Eisleben is famous, being the birthplace of Martin Luther.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the southern foothills of the Harz mountains.

<doc id="299014" wikidata="Q679690" url="?curid=299014" title="Intensive care medicine">
<text>Intensive care medicine, usually called critical care medicine, is a medical specialty that deals with seriously or critically ill patients who have, are at risk of, or are recovering from conditions that may be life-threatening. It includes providing life support, invasive monitoring techniques, resuscitation, and end-of-life care. Doctors in this specialty are often called intensive care physicians, critical care physicians, or intensivists.

Intensive care relies on multidisciplinary teams composed of many different health professionals. Such teams often include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists, among others. They usually work together in intensive care units (ICUs) within a hospital.

== Scope ==

Patients are admitted to the intensive care unit if their medical needs are greater than what the general hospital ward can provide. Indications for the ICU include blood pressure support for cardiovascular instability (hypertension/hypotension), sepsis, post-cardiac arrest syndrome or certain cardiac arrhythmias. Other ICU needs include airway or ventilator support due to respiratory compromise. The cumulative effects of multiple organ failure, more commonly referred to as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, also requires advanced care. Patients may also be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring or intensive needs following a major surgery.

There are two common ICU structures: closed and open. In a closed unit, the intensivist takes on the primary role for all patients in the unit. In an open ICU, the primary physician, who may or may not be an intensivist, can differ for each patient. There is increasingly strong evidence that closed units provide better patient outcomes. Patient management in intensive care differs between countries. Open units are the most common structure in the United States, but closed units are often found at large academic centers. Intermediate structures that fall between open and closed units also exist.

=== Types of intensive care units ===
Intensive care is usually provided in a specialized unit of a hospital called the intensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit (CCU). Many hospitals also have designated intensive care areas for certain specialities of medicine. The naming is not rigidly standardized, and types of units are dictated by the needs and available resources of each hospital. These include:

* coronary intensive care unit (CCU or sometimes CICU) for heart disease
* medical intensive care unit (MICU)
* surgical intensive care unit (SICU)
* pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
* pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU)
* neuroscience critical care unit (NCCU)
* overnight intensive-recovery (OIR) 
* shock/trauma intensive-care unit (STICU)
* neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
* ICU in the emergency department (E-ICU)

Medical studies suggest a positive correlation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients. After adjustment for severity of illness, demographic variables, and characteristics of the ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU volume was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital mortality rates. For example, adjusted ICU mortality (for a patient at average predicted risk for ICU death) was 21.2% in hospitals with 87 to 150 mechanically ventilated patients annually, and 14.5% in hospitals with 401 to 617 mechanically ventilated patients annually. Hospitals with intermediate numbers of patients had outcomes between these extremes. ICU delirium, formerly and inaccurately referred to as ICU psychosis, is a syndrome common in intensive care and cardiac units where patients who are in unfamiliar, monotonous surroundings develop symptoms of delirium (Maxmen &amp; Ward, 1995). This may include interpreting machine noises as human voices, seeing walls quiver, or hallucinating that someone is tapping them on the shoulder. There exists systematic reviews in which interventions of sleep promotion related outcomes in the ICU have proven impactful in the overall health of patients in the ICU.

== History ==
The English nurse Florence Nightingale pioneered efforts to use a separate hospital area for critically injured patients. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, she introduced the practice of moving the sickest patients to the beds directly opposite the nursing station on each ward so that they could be monitored more closely. In 1923, the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy created a three-bed unit at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In these units, specially trained nurses cared for critically ill postoperative neurosurgical patients.

The Danish anaesthesiologist Bjørn Aage Ibsen became involved in the 1952 poliomyelitis epidemic in Copenhagen, where 2722 patients developed the illness in a six-month period, with 316 of those developing some form of respiratory or airway paralysis. Some of these patients had been treated using the few available negative pressure ventilators, but these devices (while helpful) were limited in number and did not protect the patient&#x27;s lungs from aspiration of secretions. Ibsen changed the management directly by instituting long-term positive pressure ventilation using tracheal intubation, and he enlisted 200 medical students to manually pump oxygen and air into the patients&#x27; lungs around the clock. At this time, Carl-Gunnar Engström had developed one of the first artificial positive-pressure volume-controlled ventilators, which eventually replaced the medical students. With the change in care, mortality during the epidemic declined from 90% to around 25%. Patients were managed in three special 35-bed areas, which aided charting medications and other management.

In 1953, Ibsen set up what became the world&#x27;s first intensive care unit in a converted student nurse classroom in Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. He provided one of the first accounts of the management of tetanus using neuromuscular-blocking drugs and controlled ventilation. The following year, Ibsen was elected head of the department of anaesthesiology at that institution. He jointly authored the first known account of intensive care management principles in the journal &quot;Nordisk Medicin&quot;, with Tone Dahl Kvittingen from Norway.

For a time in the early 1960s, it was not clear that specialized intensive care units were needed, so intensive care resources were brought to the room of the patient that needed the additional monitoring, care, and resources. It became rapidly evident, however, that a fixed location where intensive care resources and dedicated personnel were available provided better care than &quot;ad hoc&quot; provision of intensive care services spread throughout a hospital. In 1962, in the University of Pittsburgh, the first critical care residency was established in the United States. In 1970, the Society of Critical Care Medicine was formed.

== Monitoring ==
Monitoring refers to various tools and technologies used to obtain information about a patient&#x27;s condition. These can include tests to evaluate blood flow and gas exchange in the body, or to assess the function of organs such as the heart and lungs. Broadly, there are two common types of monitoring in the ICU: noninvasive and invasive.

=== Noninvasive monitoring ===
Noninvasive monitoring does not require puncturing the skin and usually does not cause pain. These tools are more inexpensive, easier to perform, and faster to result.

* Vital signs which include heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, body temperature
* Capnography to confirm correct position of an endotracheal tube and estimate adequacy of ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients
* Echocardiogram to evaluate the function and structure of the heart
*Electroencephalography (EEG) to assess electrical activity of the brain 
*Electrocardiogram to detect abnormal heart rhythms, electrolyte disturbances, and coronary blood flow
* Pulse oximetry for monitoring oxygen levels in the blood
*Thoracic electric bioimpedance (TEB) cardiography to monitor fluid status and heart function 
*Ultrasound to evaluate internal structures including the heart, lungs, gallbladder, liver, kidneys, bladder, and blood vessels

=== Invasive monitoring ===
Invasive monitoring generally provides more accurate measurements, but these tests may require blood draws, puncturing the skin, and can be painful or uncomfortable.

* Arterial line to directly monitor blood pressure and obtain arterial blood gas measurements
*Blood draws or venipucture to monitor various blood components as well as administer therapeutic treatments 
*Intracranial pressure monitoring to assess pressures inside the skull and on the brain
*Intravesicular manometry (bladder pressure) measurements to assess for intra-abdominal pressure
* Central line and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines for drug infusions, fluids or total parenteral nutrition
* Bronchoscopy to look at lungs and airways and sample fluid within the lungs
* Pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the function of the heart, blood volume, and tissue oxygenation

== Procedures and treatments ==
Intensive care usually takes a system-by-system approach to treatment. In alphabetical order, the key systems considered in the intensive care setting are: airway management and anaesthesia, cardiovascular system, central nervous system, endocrine system, gastro-intestinal tract (and nutritional condition), hematology, integumentary system, microbiology (including sepsis status), renal (and metabolic), and respiratory system.

===Airway management and anaesthesia===

* Bag valve mask ventilation and laryngoscopy
* Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and sedation including rapid sequence induction for endotracheal intubation to facilitate mechanical ventilation.

=== Cardiovascular ===

* Point of care echocardiography
* Central venous and arterial catherisation
*Temporary cardiac pacing catheters for atrial, ventricular, or dual-chamber pacing 
*Intra-aortic balloon pumping to stabilize patients with cardiogenic shock 
*Ventricular assist device to aid in the function of the left ventricle, commonly in patients with advanced heart failure
*Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation

=== Gastro-intestinal tract ===
* Feeding tube for artificial nutrition 
* Nasogastric intubation can be used to deliver artificial nutrition, but can also be used to remove stomach and intestinal contents
* Peritoneal aspiration and lavage to sample fluid in the abdominal cavity

=== Renal ===

* Hemofiltration for acute kidney injury

=== Respiratory ===

* Mechanical ventilation to assist breathing and oxygenation through an endotracheal tube, tracheotomy (invasive) or mask, helmet (non-invasive).
* Thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy to remove fluid or air in the pleural cavity
* Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy insertion and ongoing management.
* Bronchoscopy including lavage.

=== Drugs ===
A wide array of drugs including but not limited to: inotropes such as Norepinephrine, sedatives such as Propofol, analgesics such as Fentanyl, neuromuscular blocking agents such as Rocuronium and Cisatracurium as well as broad spectrum antibiotics.

=== Physiotherapy and mobilization ===
Interventions such as early mobilization or exercises to improve muscle strength are sometimes suggested.

== Common complications in the ICU ==
Intensive care units are associated with increased risk of various complications that may lengthen a patient&#x27;s hospitalization. Common complications in the ICU include:
* Acute renal failure
* Catheter-associated bloodstream infection
* Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
* Delirium 
* Gastrointestinal bleeding 
* Pressure ulcer
* Venous thromboembolism 
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia 
* Ventilator-induced barotrauma
* Death

==Training==
ICU care requires more specialized patient care; this need has led to the use of a multidisciplinary team to provide care for patients. Staffing between Intensive care units by country, hospital, unit, or institution.

=== Medicine ===
Critical care medicine is an increasingly important medical specialty. Physicians with training in critical care medicine are referred to as intensivists.

Most medical research has demonstrated that ICU care provided by intensivists produces better outcomes and more cost-effective care. This has led the Leapfrog Group to make a primary recommendation that all ICU patients be managed or co-managed by a dedicated intensivist who is exclusively responsible for patients in one ICU.

====In Australia====
In Australia, the training in intensive care medicine is through College of Intensive Care Medicine.

==== In Germany ====
In Germany, the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine is a medical association of professionals in the anesthetics and intensive care fields. It was established in 1955 by members of the German Society of Surgery.

====In the United Kingdom====
In the UK, doctors can only enter intensive care medicine training after completing two foundation years and core training in either emergency medicine, anaesthetics, acute medicine or core medicine. Most trainees dual train with one of these specialties; however, it has recently become possible to train purely in intensive care medicine. It has also possible to train in sub-specialties of intensive care medicine including pre-hospital emergency medicine.

====In the United States====
In the United States, the specialty requires additional fellowship training for physicians having completed their primary residency training in internal medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology, surgery or emergency medicine. US board certification in critical care medicine is available through all five specialty boards. Intensivists with a primary training in internal medicine sometimes pursue combined fellowship training in another subspecialty such as pulmonary medicine, cardiology, infectious disease, or nephrology. The American Society of Critical Care Medicine is a well-established multi professional society for practitioners working in the ICU including nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians.

Intensive care physicians have some of the highest percentages of physician burnout among all medical specialties, at 48 percent.
====In South Africa====

Intensive care training is provided as a fellowship and is awarded as a Sub-Specialty certificate of Critical Care (Cert. Critical Care) which is awarded by the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa. Candidates are eligible to enter sub specialty training after completing specialty training in Anaesthetics, Surgery, Internal Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Cardiothoracic surgery or Neurosurgery.

Training usually takes place over 2 years during which time candidates rotate through different ICU&#x27;s (Medical, Surgical, Paediatric etc.)

====In India====

Intensive care medicine (ICM) in India is a rapidly evolving field, responding to the increasing demand for specialized care in critical settings. Training in ICM is offered through various recognized programs that equip healthcare professionals with the necessary skills to manage critically ill patients.

Training Programs

# DM (Doctor of Medicine):
#* A three-year postgraduate degree focusing on critical care management, typically pursued by candidates from internal medicine, anesthesia, or pediatrics.
# DrNB (Doctorate of National Board):
#* A three-year program recognized by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) that provides specialized training in critical care. The DrNB has replaced the FNB as the primary pathway for intensivist training in India.
# FNB (Fellowship of National Board):
#* Previously a one- to two-year fellowship aimed at those who had completed a postgraduate degree in related fields. It offered advanced training in critical care, focusing on protocols, advanced life support, and practical experience in critical care units. The FNB has been phased out following the introduction of the DrNB program.
# IDCCM (Indian Diploma in Critical Care Medicine):
#* A one-year diploma program designed for doctors seeking foundational knowledge in critical care. It is accessible to a broader audience, including those from emergency medicine.
# IFCCM (Indian Fellowship in Critical Care Medicine):
#* An advanced one-year fellowship for residency graduates, focusing on comprehensive critical care practices.
# CTCCM (Certificate Course in Critical Care Medicine):
#* A shorter certificate program providing essential training in critical care concepts, suitable for professionals looking to enhance their expertise.

Feeder Specialties

The feeder specialties for intensive care medicine in India include:

* Anesthesia: Provides expertise in airway management, sedation, and perioperative care.
* Pulmonology: Offers specialized knowledge in respiratory management and ventilatory support.
* Internal Medicine: Contributes a broad understanding of systemic diseases and comprehensive patient management.
* Emergency Medicine: Focuses on acute care and stabilization of critically ill patients, essential for ICM.

=== Nursing ===
Nurses that work in the critical care setting are typically registered nurses. Nurses may pursue additional education and training in critical care medicine leading to certification as a CCRN by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses a standard that was begun in 1975. These certifications became more specialized to the patient population in 1997 by the American Association of Critical care Nurses, to include pediatrics, neonatal and adult.

=== Nurse practitioners and physician assistants ===
Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are other types of non-physician providers that care for patients in ICUs. These providers have fewer years of in-school training, typically receive further clinical on the job education, and work as part of the team under the supervision of physicians.

=== Pharmacists ===
Critical care pharmacists work with the medical team in many aspects, but some include, monitoring serum concentrations of medication, past medication use, current medication use, and medication allergies. Their typically round with the team, but it may differ by institution. Some pharmacist after attaining their doctorate or pharmacy may pursue additional training in a postgraduate residency and become certified as critical care pharmacists. Pharmacists help manage all aspects of drug therapy and may pursue additional credentialing in critical care medicine as BCCCP by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties. Many critical care pharmacists are a part of the multi-professional Society of Critical Care Medicine. Inclusion of pharmacist decreases drug reactions and poor outcomes for patients.

=== Registered dietitians ===
Nutrition in intensive care units presents unique challenges due to changes in patient metabolism and physiology while critically ill. Critical care nutrition is rapidly becoming a subspecialty for dieticians who can pursue additional training and achieve certification in enteral and parenteral nutrition through the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN).

=== Respiratory therapists ===
Respiratory therapists often work in intensive care units to monitor how well a patient is breathing. Respiratory therapists may pursue additional education and training leading to credentialing in adult critical care (ACCS) and neonatal and pediatric (NPS) specialties. Respiratory therapists have been trained to monitor a patient&#x27;s breathing, provide treatments to help their breathing, evaluate for respiratory improvement, and manage mechanical ventilation parameters. They may be involved in emergency care like inserting and managing an airway, humidification of oxygen, administering diagnostic lung mechanics tests, invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation management, weaning the ventilator, aerosol therapy (pulmonary vasodilatory medications included), inhaled Nitric oxide therapy, arterial blood gas analysis, and providing physiotherapy. Additionally, Respiratory Therapists are commonly involved in ECMO management and many pursue certification in such therapies due to the intimate relationship of the heart and lungs. On-going critical care management of an ECMO patient commonly requires strict ventilator management in relation to the type of ECMO support used.

== Ethical and medicolegal issues ==
===Economics===
In general, it is the most expensive, technologically advanced and resource-intensive area of medical care. In the United States, estimates of the 2000 expenditure for critical care medicine ranged from US$19–55 billion. During that year, critical care medicine accounted for 0.56% of GDP, 4.2% of national health expenditure and about 13% of hospital costs.
In 2011, hospital stays with ICU services accounted for just over one-quarter of all discharges (29.9%) but nearly one-half of aggregate total hospital charges (47.5%) in the United States. The mean hospital charge was 2.5 times higher for discharges with ICU services than for those without.

<text>The Cotton Club is a 1984 American musical crime drama film co-written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on James Haskins&#x27; 1977 book of the same name. The story centers on the Cotton Club, a 1930s Harlem jazz club. The film stars Richard Gere, Gregory Hines, Diane Lane, and Lonette McKee, with Bob Hoskins, James Remar, Nicolas Cage, Allen Garfield, Gwen Verdon, Fred Gwynne and Laurence Fishburne in supporting roles.

The film was noted for going over budget on its production costs and taking a total of five years to complete. Despite being a disappointment at the box-office, the film received generally positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and Oscars for Best Art Direction (Richard Sylbert, George Gaines) and Best Film Editing.

==Plot==
A musician named Dixie Dwyer begins working with mobsters to advance his career but falls in love with Vera Cicero, the girlfriend of gangland kingpin Dutch Schultz.

Sandman Williams, a dancer from Dixie&#x27;s neighborhood, and his brother Clay are hired by The Cotton Club, a jazz club where most of the performers are black and the customers are white. Owney Madden, a mobster, owns the club and runs it with his right-hand man, Frenchy.

Dixie becomes a Hollywood film star, thanks to the help of Madden and the mob but angering Schultz. He also continues to see Schultz&#x27;s gun moll, Vera Cicero, whose new nightclub has been financed by the jealous gangster.

In the meantime, Dixie&#x27;s ambitious younger brother Vincent becomes a gangster in Schultz&#x27;s mob and eventually a public enemy, holding Frenchy as a hostage.

Sandman alienates his brother Clay at The Cotton Club by agreeing to perform a solo number there. While the club&#x27;s management interferes with Sandman&#x27;s romantic interest in Lila, a singer, its cruel treatment of the performers leads to an intervention by Harlem criminal &quot;Bumpy&quot; Rhodes on their behalf.

Dutch Schultz is violently dealt with by Madden&#x27;s men while Dixie and Sandman perform on The Cotton Club&#x27;s stage.

==Production==
Inspired to make &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; by a picture-book history of the nightclub by James Haskins, Robert Evans was the film&#x27;s original producer. Evans hoped the film would bring public attention to African-American history in a similar way that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; did for the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era. On December 12, 1980, it was announced that Evans and Paramount Pictures would serve as co-producers of the film while Robert Altman would direct and Mario Puzo would write. However, Evans and Altman&#x27;s film &quot;Popeye&quot; premiering that day became a box-office flop. Although Evans secured $12 million worth of financing from Saudi Business Tycoon Adnan Khashoggi, Paramount Pictures withdrew from the film in 1981. Evans worked to secure sole ownership of the film negative to recoup his losses from recent poor stock-market investments and a cocaine trafficking arrest. However, this action alienated potential investors who would be unable to profit from television and home video distribution rights. The production was finally delayed when Evans reached a plea bargain to produce an advertising campaign of anti-drug public service announcements in exchange for an expungement of his record.

In 1984, Evans, who intended to direct the film himself after Altman departed, hired William Kennedy and Francis Ford Coppola to re-write Mario Puzo&#x27;s story and screenplay. Evans eventually decided that he did not want to direct the film and asked Coppola at the last minute. Evans and Coppola had an adversarial relationship from the production of the &quot;Godfather&quot; films but Coppola accepted the jobs as screenwriter and then director because he needed the money – he was deeply in debt from making &quot;One from the Heart&quot; with his own money and his studio Zoetrope Studios went bankrupt. Richard Sylbert said that he told Evans not to hire Coppola because &quot;he resents being in the commercial, narrative, Hollywood movie business&quot;. Coppola said that he had letters from Sylbert asking him to work on the film because Evans was crazy. Coppola also said that &quot;Evans set the tone for the level of extravagance long before I got there&quot;.

By the time Evans decided not to direct and brought in Coppola, at least $13 million had already been committed. Las Vegas casino owners Edward and Fred Doumani, along with businessman Victor L. Sayyah, put $30 million into the film in exchange for a fifty-percent ownership stake in the film. Evans received further loans by mortgaging his mansion in Beverly Hills and stock in Gulf + Western as collateral. Other financial backers included Arab arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and vaudeville promoter Roy Radin, who was murdered in May 1983. The killers later alleged that they had been hired by Evans and Radin&#x27;s girlfriend Karen Greenberger, a drug dealer who felt she was cut out of profits from the film. In the 1989 &quot;&quot;Cotton Club&quot; Trial&quot;, Evans invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify.

According to William Kennedy in an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, the budget of the film was $47 million. However, Coppola told the head of Gaumont Film Company, Europe&#x27;s largest distribution and production company, that he thought the film might cost $65 million.

Evans cast Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone, and Harrison Ford to portray Dixie Dwyer before Gere was hired. Richard Pryor was considered for the role of Sandman Williams. Robert Evans wanted to cast his friend Alain Delon in a two-scene role as Lucky Luciano but this did not occur. The role of Luciano was instead portrayed by Joe Dallesandro, starting the dramatic film career for the former Warhol Superstar.

Author Mario Puzo was the original screenwriter and was eventually replaced by William Kennedy, who wrote a rehearsal script in eight days which the cast used for three weeks prior to shooting. According to actor Gregory Hines, a three-hour film was shot during rehearsals. From July 15 to August 22, 1983, twelve scripts were produced, including five during one 48-hour non-stop weekend. Kennedy estimates that between 30 and 40 scripts were turned out. Production began on August 22, 1983, at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Over 600 people built sets, created costumes and arranged music at a reported $250,000 a day. During the production many crew members were abruptly fired. Within several weeks the film was already over budget, allowing Evans to deduct from the $4 million salary of Coppola, who had not yet been fully paid because the script was still being rewritten and thus incomplete. Coppola reacted by walking off set and refusing to continue directing the film until he was fully paid.

As costs on the film continued to rise, the Doumani brothers convinced Orion Pictures to advance costs for the film on the condition that Evans step down as producer and hired mobster Joseph Cusamano to intimidate Evans into giving up his share of the partnership. Evans initially agreed but stopped them by filing a restraining order against them after learning Sayyah was not involved in the deal. On June 7, 1984, Sayyah filed a lawsuit against the Doumani brothers, their lawyer David Hurwitz, Evans and Orion Pictures for fraud and breach of contract. Sayyah invested $5 million and said that he had little chance of recouping his money because the budget escalated from $25 to $58 million. He accused the Doumanis of forcing out Evans and said that an Orion loan to the film of $15 million unnecessarily increased the budget. Evans, in turn, sued Edward Doumani to keep from acting as general partner on the film. The court ruled in favor of Evans but also gave Coppola&#x27;s close associate Barrie M. Osborne full control over post-production, essentially barring Evans from the completion of the film. Sayyah and the Doumani brothers would also be uncredited as producers.

==Music==
The soundtrack for the film was written by John Barry. It released on December 14, 1984, via Geffen Records. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band in 1986.

==Release==

===Home media===
Embassy Home Entertainment paid a record $4.7 million for North America home video rights.
The film appeared on videotape and videodisc in April 1985. It was the first to use the Macrovision copy protection system on VHS.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
In 2015, Coppola found an old Betamax video copy of his original cut that ran 25 minutes longer. When originally editing the picture, he acquiesced to distributors who wanted a shorter film with a different structure. Between 2015 and 2017, Coppola spent over $500,000 of his own money to restore the film to the original cut. This version, titled &quot;The Cotton Club: Encore&quot; and running 139 minutes, debuted at the Telluride Film Festival on September 1, 2017. Lionsgate (owner of the Zoetrope Corporation backlog, and working in association with original studio Orion Pictures) released that version theatrically, and on DVD and Blu-ray in the fall of 2019.

&quot;The Film Stage&quot; gave &quot;The Cotton Club: Encore&quot; a rating of A−, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the result of this version as &quot;eye-opening&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Cotton Club&quot; was released on December 14, 1984, in the United States and Canada on 808 screens and grossed $2.9 million on its opening weekend, fifth place behind &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;City Heat&quot; and &quot;2010&quot;. Evans took the blame for hiring Coppola while Coppola responded that if he had not been hired, the film would have never been made. Evans said that Coppola made the budget escalate dramatically by rejecting the script, hiring his own crew, and falling behind schedule. The film was a commercial failure, grossing just under $26 million against a $58 million budget. After the film&#x27;s release stock traders began selling Orion Pictures shares with the expectation that the studio would suffer financially.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 75% rating based on 32 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Energetic and brimming with memorable performers, &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; entertains with its visual and musical pizazz even as its plot only garners polite applause.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68% based on reviews from 14 critics.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film 4 out of 4 stars. The film appeared on both Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s best of 1984.

<text>The US Chess Championship is an invitational tournament organized by the United States Chess Federation to determine the country&#x27;s chess champion. 
It is the oldest national chess tournament. The event originated as a challenge match in 1845, but the champion has been decided by tournament play under the auspices of the USCF since 1936. The tournament has fluctuated between a round-robin tournament and a Swiss system. From 1999 to 2006, the championship was sponsored and organized by the Seattle Chess Foundation (later renamed America&#x27;s Foundation for Chess) and featured a larger body of competitors, made possible by the change to a Swiss-style format. After the Foundation withdrew its sponsorship, the 2007 and 2008 events were held in Stillwater, Oklahoma, still as a Swiss system, under tournament director Frank K. Berry. The Saint Louis Chess Club has hosted the championship since 2009. Since 2014, the championship has used a round-robin format. The event is often a Zonal tournament for the United States Chess Federation, providing qualifier spots to the Chess World Cup.

As of 2023, twelve players are invited to compete: the reigning US champion, as well as the respective winners of the US Open Chess Championship and the US Junior Championship. The remaining players are chosen by highest invitational rating, in addition to one organizer wildcard. Fabiano Caruana is the current US chess champion.

==By acclamation (1845–1891)==

==Match format (1891–1935)==
George Henry Mackenzie died in April 1891 and, later that year, Max Judd proposed he, Jackson Showalter and S. Lipschütz contest a triangular match for the championship. Lipschütz withdrew so Judd and Showalter played a match which the latter won. A claim by Walter Penn Shipley that S. Lipschütz became US Champion as a result of being the top-scoring American at the Sixth American Chess Congress, New York 1889, is refuted in a biography of Lipschütz.
The following US Champions until 1909 were decided by matches.

<doc id="299021" wikidata="Q740961" url="?curid=299021" title="Aztlán">
<text>Aztlán (from or romanized &quot;Aztlán&quot;, ) is the ancestral home of the Aztec peoples. The word &quot;Aztec&quot; was derived from the Nahuatl a&quot;ztecah&quot;, meaning &quot;people from Aztlán.&quot; Aztlán is mentioned in several ethnohistorical sources dating from the colonial period, and while each cites varying lists of the different tribal groups who participated in the migration from Aztlán to central Mexico, the Mexica who later founded Mexico-Tenochtitlan are mentioned in all of the accounts.

Historians have speculated about the possible location of Aztlán and tend to place it either in northwestern Mexico or the Southwestern United States, although whether Aztlán represents a real location or a mythological one is a matter of debate.

==History==
Nahuatl histories relate that seven tribes lived in Chicomoztoc, or &quot;the Place of the Seven Caves&quot;. Each cave represented a different Nahua group: the Xochimilca, Tlahuica, Acolhua, Tlaxcalteca, Tepaneca, Chalca, and Mexica. Along with these people, the Olmec-Xicalanca and Xaltocamecas are also said to come from Aztlán. Because of their common linguistic origin, those groups are termed collectively &quot;Nahualteca&quot; (Nahua people). These tribes subsequently left the caves and settled &quot;near&quot; Aztlán.

The various descriptions of Aztlán apparently contradict each other. While some legends describe Aztlán as a paradise, the Codex Aubin says that the Aztecs were subject to a tyrannical elite named the Azteca Chicomoztoca. Guided by their priest, the Aztec tribe fled. On the road, their god Huitzilopochtli forbade them to call themselves &quot;Azteca&quot;, telling them that they should be known as &quot;Mexica&quot;. Scholars of the 19th century—in particular Alexander von Humboldt and William H. Prescott—translated the word &quot;Azteca&quot;, as is shown in the Aubin Codex, to &quot;Aztec&quot;.

The southward migration is estimated to have begun on May 24, 1064 CE, based on the dates of the supernova Crab Nebula from May to July 1054. Each of the seven groups is credited with founding a different major city-state in Central Mexico.

A 2004 translation of the &quot;Anales de Tlatelolco&quot; gives the only known date related to the exit from Aztlán; day-sign &quot;4 Cuauhtli&quot; (Four Eagle) of the year &quot;1 Tecpatl&quot; (Knife) or 1064–1065, and correlated to January 4, 1065.

Cristobal del Castillo mentions in his book &quot;Fragmentos de la Obra General Sobre Historia de los Mexicanos&quot;, that the lake around the Aztlán island was called &quot;Metztliapan&quot; or &quot;Lake of the Moon.&quot; Another version reads:

One day a man heard a bird calling to him, saying, &quot;Go now, go now.&quot; When the man told the chief about the bird, the chief was relieved. He had known his people must find a new land, their own land, but had waited for a sign. So the people gathered and began a long march. They followed an idol of Huitzilopochtli that the priests carried. As they went, Huitzilopochtli spoke through the priests and prepared the people for the greatness of their empire to come. He explained that they should travel until they came to a large lake; there, they should look for another sign—an eagle in a cactus.

The journey took 200 years, and the people settled for a while in the Toltec capital of Tollan. Some people stayed in Tollan and some moved on. From time to time, Huitzilopochtli changed himself into a white eagle to inspire the people, and they traveled until they came to Lake Texcoco and saw a great eagle sitting on a cactus, holding a serpent. There they built Tenochtitlán, the city that became the capital and center of the Aztec empire.
==Places postulated as Aztlán==
Friar Diego Durán (–1588), who chronicled the history of the Aztecs, wrote of Aztec emperor Moctezuma I&#x27;s attempt to recover the history of the Mexica by congregating warriors and wise men on an expedition to locate Aztlán. According to Durán, the expedition was successful in finding a place that offered characteristics unique to Aztlán. However, his accounts were written soon after the conquest of Tenochtitlan and before an accurate mapping of the American continent was made; therefore, he was unable to provide a precise location.

During the 1960s, Mexican intellectuals began to seriously speculate about the possibility that Mexcaltitán de Uribe in Nayarit was the mythical city of Aztlán. One of the first to consider Aztlán being associated with the island was historian Alfredo Chavero towards the end of the 19th century. Historical investigators after his death tested his proposition and considered it valid, among them Wigberto Jiménez Moreno. This hypothesis is still debated.

Some scholars argue it is nearly or completely impossible to find the true location of Aztlán, due to all the conflicting accounts and narratives.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name &quot;Aztlan&quot; is uncertain. One suggested meaning is &quot;place of Herons&quot; or &quot;place of egrets&quot;—the explanation given in the &quot;Crónica Mexicáyotl&quot;—but this is not possible under Nahuatl morphology: &quot;place of egrets&quot; is &quot;Aztatlan&quot;. Other proposed derivations include &quot;place of whiteness&quot; and &quot;at the place in the vicinity of tools&quot;, sharing the &quot;āz-&quot; element of words such as &quot;teponāztli&quot;, &quot;drum&quot; (from &quot;tepontli&quot;, &quot;log&quot;).

==Used as symbolism by Chicano movement==
The concept of Aztlán as the place of origin of the pre-Columbian Mexican civilization has become a symbol for various Mexican ethno-nationalist movements.

In 1969 the notion of Aztlán was introduced by the poet Alurista (Alberto Baltazar Urista Heredia) at the National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference held in Denver, Colorado by the Crusade for Justice. There he read a poem, which has come to be known as the preamble to El Plan de Aztlán or as &quot;El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán&quot; due to its poetic aesthetic. For some Chicanos, Aztlán refers to the Mexican territories conquered by the United States as a result of the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. Aztlán became a symbol for activists who allege that they have a legal and primordial right to the land. Some promoters of the Chicanos propose that a new ethnocentric government overthrow and replace the respective United States governments in the Southwest region, a República del Norte.

&quot;Aztlán&quot; is also the name of the Chicano studies journal published by the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center.

Aztlán has been used for Chicanos to associate with their heritage and past. The myth has become a sort of shared memory that has united many people in the diasporic community. Like the Aztecs, Mexican-Americans migrated out of their homeland to seek a better life or more opportunities. Some Chicanos feel that they are repeating what their ancestors did or at least they feel a symbolic association with the myth. Many Chicanos simply consider Aztlán as a spiritual guiding force rather than a tangible location.

===Movements that use or formerly used the concept of &quot;Aztlán&quot;===
*Brown Berets
*MEChA (&quot;Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán&quot;, &quot;Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán&quot;)
*Plan Espiritual de Aztlán
*Raza Unida Party
*Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which calls for self-determination for the Chicano nation in Aztlán up to and including the right to secession.

==In popular culture==

===In literature===
&quot;Aztlán&quot; has been used as the name of speculative fictional future states that emerge in the southwestern United States or Mexico after their governments suffer a collapse or major setback; examples appear in such works as the novels &quot;Heart of Aztlán&quot; (1976), by Rudolfo Anaya; &quot;Warday&quot; (1984), by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka; &quot;The Peace War&quot; (1984), by Vernor Vinge; &quot;The House of the Scorpion&quot; (2002), by Nancy Farmer; and &quot;World War Z&quot; (2006), by Max Brooks; as well as the role-playing game &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, in which the Mexican government was usurped by the &quot;Aztechnology&quot; Corporation (1989). In Gary Jennings&#x27; novel &quot;Aztec&quot; (1980), the protagonist resides in Aztlán for a while, later facilitating contact between Aztlán and the Aztec Triple Alliance just before Hernán Cortés&#x27; arrival.

&quot;Strange Rumblings in Aztlan&quot; is an article written by Hunter S. Thompson that appeared in the April 29, 1971 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The article is about the death of civil rights activist Ruben Salazar in East Los Angeles during a Vietnam War protest.
