<text>The Agena Target Vehicle (; ATV), also known as Gemini-Agena Target Vehicle (GATV), was an uncrewed spacecraft used by NASA during its Gemini program to develop and practice orbital space rendezvous and docking techniques, and to perform large orbital changes, in preparation for the Apollo program lunar missions.
The spacecraft was based on Lockheed Aircraft&#x27;s Agena-D upper stage rocket, fitted with a docking target manufactured by McDonnell Aircraft. The name &#x27;Agena&#x27; derived from the star Beta Centauri, also known as Agena.
The combined spacecraft was a -long cylinder with a diameter of , placed into low Earth orbit with the Atlas-Agena launch vehicle. It carried about of propellant and gas at launch, and had a gross mass at orbital insertion of about .

The ATV for Gemini 6 failed on launch on October 25, 1965, which led NASA to develop a backup: the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA), a smaller spacecraft consisting of the docking target with an attitude control propulsion system but without the Agena orbital change rocket. The ATDA was used once on Gemini 9A after a second ATV launch failure on May 17, 1966, but failed as a docking target because its launch shroud failed to separate.

==Operations==

Each ATV consisted of an Agena-D-derivative upper rocket stage built by Lockheed Aircraft and a docking adapter built by McDonnell Aircraft. The Agena was launched from Cape Kennedy&#x27;s Launch Complex 14 on top of an Atlas booster built by the Convair division of General Dynamics. The Agena first burn would occur shortly after shroud jettison and separation from the Atlas over the Atlantic Ocean. Over Ascension Island, a second burn would place the Agena into a low circular orbit.

The McDonnell Gemini spacecraft would then be launched from Launch Complex 19, as soon as 90 minutes later. Both countdowns would proceed in parallel and required close synchronization. The Gemini would rendezvous and dock with the Agena as soon as Gemini&#x27;s first orbit toward the end of the program. Gemini 11&#x27;s Richard F. Gordon, Jr. compared docking with the Agena to air-to-air refueling:

Once docked, the astronaut in the right seat could control Agena&#x27;s thrusters and engine. They would fly the combined spacecraft in a stabilized mode and perform a number of experiments:
* Using the Agena&#x27;s attitude control system to stabilize the combination, which saved the Gemini&#x27;s propellants
* Extra-vehicular activity to perform practice work on a tool panel. This required installing handrails on later flights to prevent excessive astronaut exertion.
* Refiring the Agena engine to raise the spacecraft&#x27;s apogee. Gemini 11 reached a record of . The modified Bell 8247 engine was qualified for up to 15 restarts.
* Undocking, unreeling a nylon tether between the capsule and the Agena and flying in a &quot;dumbbell&quot; configuration with the Agena below the astronauts, to check the gravitational effect on the formation stability in uncontrolled mode. This technique is now known as gravity-gradient stabilization.
* Using a similar tether and a few thruster bursts to rotate the two craft around each other as an early test of artificial gravity.
* After rendezvous with its own ATV, Gemini 10 performed a second rendezvous with the ATV from Gemini 8.

After detaching from their respective Gemini capsules, Agena target vehicles continued to execute post-mission operations under ground control. For instance, GATV 5003, post-separation from Gemini 8, underwent extensive systems testing. Its main engine was fired nine times, and it executed 5,000 commands, surpassing the contractual requirement of 1,000. This allowed a detailed assessment of its command and communication systems. The vehicle was eventually placed in a circular decay orbit, facilitating its observation during the Gemini 10 mission. Similarly, GATV 5005 performed three orbital maneuvers post-Gemini 10 separation, including adjustments to study temperature effects in varying orbits and executing 1,700 commands, some of which were relayed from Gemini 10.

The first Gemini-Agena Target Vehicle (GATV) was launched on October 25, 1965, while the Gemini 6 astronauts were waiting on the pad. While the Atlas performed normally, the Agena&#x27;s engine exploded during orbital injection. Since the rendezvous and docking was the primary objective, the Gemini 6 mission was scrubbed, and replaced with the alternate mission Gemini 6A, which rendezvoused (but could not dock) with Gemini 7 in December.

An investigation into the failure concluded that it was most likely caused by design modifications to the GATV versus a standard Agena D stage. The Agena D was designed to have its engine restarted just once while the GATV would need to be restarted five times. While a standard Agena D pumped oxidizer into the combustion chamber first and then followed with the fuel, the GATV was modified to do the reverse because the normal start method had a tendency to leak oxidizer. While this would not be a problem for the Agena D with its single restart, the multi-restart GATV would eventually lose all of its oxidizer before the stage&#x27;s operating life (which would last weeks instead of hours) could be completed. Unfortunately, pumping the fuel into the combustion chamber first caused the engine to backfire and rupture from mechanical shock. It was found out that Lockheed engineers did not properly test the GATV to root out this problem (it had been tested at a simulated altitude of 21 miles up when actual Agena engine start would occur at around 75 miles up). The solution to the problem was switching back to the normal oxidizer-first engine start and also testing the GATV in appropriate conditions. Bell Aerosystems, the manufacturer of the Agena&#x27;s engine, were also instructed to perform further ground-level tests.

==Augmented Target Docking Adapter==

After the failure of the first GATV, NASA commissioned McDonnell to develop a backup docking target minus the Lockheed Agena rocket, the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA). This consisted of the Gemini docking collar and an attitude control propulsion system based on the Gemini Reentry Control System. The ATDA was long, with a mass of .
A few questions were raised about the compatibility of the ATDA with the Atlas booster, since it had much lower mass than the GATV, potentially throwing off the launch vehicle&#x27;s aerodynamics and calibrated settings. However, Convair assured McDonnell that it would pose no technical issues with the booster.

A second GATV launch failure occurred on May 17, 1966, as Gemini 9 astronauts Tom Stafford and Eugene Cernan sat on their pad awaiting launch. The Atlas–Agena lifted smoothly into a cloudy sky, vanishing from view around T+50 seconds. Shortly before Booster Engine Cutoff (BECO), the guidance control officer announced that he had lost contact with the booster.

Telemetry indicated that Agena staging had taken place on schedule at T+300 seconds. The Agena continued transmitting signals until T+436 seconds, when all telemetry ceased. Hidden behind clouds, the Atlas&#x27;s B-2 engine gimbaled hard to right starting at T+120 seconds and remained fixed in that position, flipping the launch vehicle 216° around and sending it back towards Cape Kennedy. This rotation had made it impossible for ground guidance to lock on. Radar stations in the Bahamas tracked it heading north and descending. Vehicle stability was gradually regained following BECO, however it had pitched approximately 231° from its intended flight path. Both vehicles plunged into the Atlantic Ocean downrange. The Agena&#x27;s engine did not activate since the proper altitude and velocity had not been attained, preventing the guidance system from sending the start command. While the exact cause of the engine gimbal control loss was not found, telemetry indicated that a short-to-ground occurred in the circuit for the servoamplifier output command signal, which may have been caused by cryogenic leakage in the thrust section. Substantiating this theory were abnormally low thrust section temperatures starting at T+65 seconds. The source of the cryogenic leakage was not identified. The loss of the lock on the ground prevented normal engine cutoff signals from being transmitted to the Atlas; BECO was generated by the staging backup accelerometer, SECO at T+273 seconds due to LOX depletion, and VECO and Agena staging from a backup command generated by the missile programmer. Aside from the flight control system, all Atlas systems functioned properly.

While Convair accepted responsibility for the launch failure, Lockheed engineers expressed concern about telemetry data that indicated a servo failure in the Agena, leading to doubts as to whether the stage would have still operated properly if the Atlas hadn&#x27;t malfunctioned. However, the true cause of failure surfaced when the Air Force released film taken by tracking cameras at Melbourne Beach, Florida, which showed the Atlas pitching over and heading downward. It was then determined that the Agena&#x27;s servo malfunction was caused by passing through the Atlas&#x27;s ionized exhaust trail.

The Gemini 9A modified mission launch was rescheduled for June 1, 1966, using the ATDA. However, the shroud that protected the docking adapter during launch failed to separate, due to lanyards being incorrectly secured with adhesive tape. Gemini 9A was launched on June 3, and when in orbit, the crew observed that the shroud of the ATDA had partially opened and was described by Stafford as &quot;looking like an angry alligator&quot;. Docking was not possible, but the rendezvous maneuver was practiced instead.

==Flight statistics==
==In popular culture==
Gemini 8&#x27;s docking with the Agena was shown in episode 1 &quot;Can We Do This?&quot;, of the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon,&quot; and in the 2018 Neil Armstrong biopic &quot;First Man&quot;.

Gemini 8&#x27;s docking with the Agena featured in the short science fiction drama &quot;DARKSIDE&quot; produced by nrgpix as an entry to the London Sci Fi film festival 2020.

<doc id="299034" wikidata="Q230035" url="?curid=299034" title="Joan Plowright">
<text>Joan Ann Olivier, Baroness Olivier (; 28 October 1929 – 16 January 2025), commonly known as Dame Joan Plowright, was an English actress whose career spanned over six decades. She received several accolades including two Golden Globe Awards, an Olivier Award, and a Tony Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. She was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. 

Plowright studied at the Old Vic Theatre School before acting onstage at the Royal National Theatre where she met her husband Laurence Olivier. She acted opposite him in the John Osborne play &quot;The Entertainer&quot; on the West End in 1957 and on Broadway in 1958. She earned the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961). She won the Laurence Olivier Award for &quot;Filumena&quot; (1978). 

She made her film debut in an uncredited role in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956). She later won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1991). She was BAFTA-nominated for her roles in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960) and &quot;Equus&quot; (1977). She also acted in the films &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1963), &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1970), &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990), &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996), &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; (1999), &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003) and &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; (2005). She also voiced roles for the children&#x27;s films &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000) and &quot;Curious George&quot; (2006). 

On television she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her role in the HBO television film &quot;Stalin&quot; (1992). She retired from acting due to macular degeneration in 2014. She made her final filmed appearance in the documentary &quot;Nothing Like a Dame&quot; (2018).

== Early life and education ==
Plowright was born on 28 October 1929 in Brigg, Lincolnshire, the daughter of Daisy Margaret (née Burton) and William Ernest Plowright, who was a journalist and newspaper editor. She attended Scunthorpe Grammar School and then trained at The Old Vic Theatre School.

==Career==

Plowright made her stage debut at Croydon in 1948 and her London debut in 1954. In 1956 she joined the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre and was cast as Margery Pinchwife in &quot;The Country Wife&quot;. She appeared with George Devine in the Eugène Ionesco play &quot;The Chairs&quot;, and Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;.

Plowright made her film debut in an uncredited role in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956). In 1957, Plowright co-starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in the original London production of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, taking over the role of Jean Rice from Dorothy Tutin when the play transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre. She continued to appear on stage and in films such as &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960). In 1961, she received a Tony Award for her role in &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; on Broadway.

Through her marriage to Olivier, Plowright became closely associated with his work at the National Theatre from 1963 onwards. She also acted in the films &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1963), &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1970), and &quot;Equus&quot; (1977). In the 1990s, she began to appear more regularly in films, including &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990), &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990), &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992) for which she won a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993) where she played Martha Wilson, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1995), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996), &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996) where she played the dog nanny, &quot;Dance with Me&quot; (1998), and &quot;Tea With Mussolini&quot; (1999). Among her television roles, she won another Golden Globe Award and earned an Emmy Award nomination for the HBO film &quot;Stalin&quot; in 1992 as the Soviet dictator&#x27;s mother-in-law. Her pair of 1992 performances (&quot;Enchanted April&quot; and &quot;Stalin&quot;) marked only the second time an actress (after Sigourney Weaver, for performances in 1988) won two Golden Globes in the same year; as of the January 2023 presentation, only Helen Mirren (for performances in 2006) and Kate Winslet (for performances in 2008) have duplicated this feat. In 1994, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.

In 2003, Plowright performed in the stage production &quot;Absolutely! (Perhaps)&quot; in London. She was appointed honorary president of the English Stage Company in March 2009, succeeding John Mortimer who died in January 2009. She was previously vice-president of the company. Her later films included &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2008), as well as voiced roles for the children&#x27;s films &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000) and &quot;Curious George&quot; (2006). She made her final filmed appearance in the British documentary &quot;Nothing Like a Dame&quot; (2018) with her acting Dame friends Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and family ===
Plowright was first married to the actor Roger Gage in September 1953. She later divorced him and in 1961 married Laurence Olivier shortly after the end of Olivier&#x27;s twenty-year marriage to the actress Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier had three children together, all three of whom have worked in the theatre. The couple remained married until Olivier&#x27;s death in 1989. Plowright&#x27;s younger brother, David Plowright (1930–2006), was an executive at Granada Television.

She published her memoirs, &quot;And That&#x27;s Not All&quot;, in 2001.

===Illness and death===
Plowright&#x27;s vision declined steadily during the late 2000s and early 2010s due to macular degeneration. In 2014 she officially announced her retirement from acting because she had become legally blind. 

Plowright died at Denville Hall in Northwood, London, on 16 January 2025, aged 95.

==Legacy==
The Plowright Theatre in Scunthorpe is named in Plowright&#x27;s honour.

In her obituary, &quot;Variety&quot; described Plowright as &quot;perhaps the greatest Anglophone actor of the 20th century&quot;.

==Honours==
Plowright was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 New Year Honours and was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours.

She received an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from the University of Hull in 2001.

<doc id="299035" wikidata="Q48365" url="?curid=299035" title="Strait of Magellan">
<text>The Strait of Magellan (), also called the Straits of Magellan, is a navigable sea route in southern Chile separating mainland South America to the north and the Tierra del Fuego archipelago to the south. Considered the most important natural passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the strait is approximately long and wide at its narrowest point. In 1520, the Spanish expedition of the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan, after whom the strait is named, became the first Europeans to discover it.

Magellan&#x27;s original name for the strait was &quot;Estrecho de Todos los Santos&quot; (&quot;Strait of All Saints&quot;). The King of Spain, Emperor Charles V, who sponsored the Magellan-Elcano expedition, changed the name to the Strait of Magellan in honor of Magellan.

The route is difficult to navigate due to frequent narrows and unpredictable winds and currents. Maritime piloting is now compulsory. The strait is shorter and more sheltered than the Drake Passage, the often stormy open sea route around Cape Horn, which is beset by frequent gale-force winds and icebergs. Along with the Beagle Channel, the strait was one of the few sea routes between the Atlantic and Pacific before the construction of the Panama Canal.

==History==
===Indigenous navigation===
Land adjacent to the Strait of Magellan has been inhabited by indigenous Americans for at least 13,000 years. Upon their arrival in the region, they would have encountered native equines (&quot;Hippidion&quot;), the large ground sloth &quot;Mylodon,&quot; saber toothed cats (&quot;Smilodon&quot;) the extinct jaguar subspecies &quot;Panthera onca mesembrina,&quot; the bear &quot;Arctotherium&quot;, the superficially camel-like &quot;Macrauchenia,&quot; the fox-like canid &quot;Dusicyon avus&quot; and lamine camelids, including the extant vicuña and guanaco. Evidence that &quot;Mylodon&quot;, &quot;Hippidion&quot; and the lamines were hunted has been found at some sites, such as Cueva del Medio.

Historically identifiable indigenous ethnic groups around the strait are the Kawésqar, the Tehuelche, the Selk&#x27;nam and Yaghan people. The Kawésqar lived on the western part of the strait&#x27;s northern coast. To the east of the Kawésqar were the Tehuelche, whose territory extended to the north in Patagonia. To the south of the Tehuelche across the strait lived the Selk&#x27;nam, who inhabited the majority of the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego. To the west of the Selk&#x27;nam were the Yaghan people, who inhabited the southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego.

All tribes in the area were nomadic hunter-gatherers. The Tehuelche were the only non-maritime culture in the area; they fished and gathered shellfish along the coast during the winter and moved into the southern Andes in the summer to hunt. The tribes of the region saw little European contact until the late 19th century. Later, European-introduced diseases decimated portions of the indigenous population.

It is possible that Tierra del Fuego was connected to the mainland in the Early Holocene (c. 9000 years BP) much in the same way that Riesco Island was back then. A Selk&#x27;nam tradition recorded by the Salesian missionary Giuseppe María Beauvoir relate that the Selk&#x27;nam arrived in Tierra del Fuego by land, and that the Selk&#x27;nam were later unable to return north as the sea had flooded their crossing. Selk&#x27;nam migration to Tierra del Fuego is generally thought to have displaced a related non-seafaring people, the Haush that once occupied most of the main island. The Selk&#x27;nam, Haush, and Tehuelche are generally thought to be culturally and linguistically related peoples physically distinct from the sea-faring peoples.

According to a Selk&#x27;nam myth the strait was created along with the Beagle Channel and Fagnano Lake by slingshots falling on Earth during the fight of Taiyín with a witch who was said to have &quot;retained the waters and the foods&quot;.

===Magellan===
The first European contact in this area was evidently the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan. (A report by António Galvão in 1563 that mentions early charts showing the strait as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Tail&quot; has led to speculation that there might have been earlier contact, but this is generally discounted.)

Magellan led an expedition in the service of the Spanish King, Emperor Charles V, to reach the Spice Islands. His ships became the first to navigate the strait in 1520. The five ships included &quot;La Trinidad&quot; (110 tons, 55 crew members), under the command of Magellan; &quot;La San Antonio&quot; (120 tons, 60 crew members) under the command of Juan de Cartagena; &quot;La Concepción&quot; (90 tons, 45 crew members) under the command of Gaspar de Quesada (Juan Sebastián Elcano served as boatswain); &quot;La Victoria&quot; (85 tons, 42 crew members) under the command of Luis de Mendoza; and &quot;La Santiago&quot; (75 tons, 32 crew members), under command of Juan Rodríguez Serrano (João Rodrigues Serrão). Before the passage of the strait (and after the mutiny in Puerto San Julián), Álvaro de Mesquita became captain of the &quot;San Antonio&quot;, and Duarte Barbosa of the &quot;Victoria&quot;. Later, Serrão became captain of the &quot;Concepcion&quot; (the &quot;Santiago&quot;, sent on a mission to find the passage, was caught in a storm and wrecked). &quot;San Antonio&quot;, charged to explore Magdalen Sound, failed to return to the fleet, instead sailing back to Spain under Estêvão Gomes, who imprisoned the captain Mesquita.

Magellan&#x27;s ships entered the strait on All Saints&#x27; Day, 1 November 1520. Magellan named the strait &quot;Estrecho de Todos los Santos&quot; (&quot;Strait of All Saints&quot;) and 
planted a flag to claim the land on behalf of the King of Spain. Magellan&#x27;s chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, called it the &quot;Patagonian Strait&quot;, and others &quot;Victoria Strait&quot;, commemorating the first ship that entered. Within seven years, it was being called &quot;Estrecho de Magallanes&quot; in honor of Magellan. The Spanish Empire and the Captaincy General of Chile considered the strait the southern boundary of their territory.

===16th century explorations after Magellan===
In the 1530s Charles V divided South America and whatever was to be south of it into a series of grants to different conquistadors. The strait of Magellan and the area south of it went to Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz.

In 1530 and 1531 the Fuggers held rights to trade through the strait of Magellan. While European trade with Asia through this route was thought to be possible, the Fuggers never developed this route. 

Andrés de Urdaneta who had first hand experience of the strait by his participation in the Loaísa expedition, argued before viceroy Antonio de Mendoza in the 1550s for the establishment of an Asia–Mexico trade route and presented arguments against the establishment of rival route of direct trade between Spain and Asia through the strait of Magellan. According to Urdaneta, climate would made passage through the strait possible only during summer and that therefore ships would need to stay the winter in a more northern port. Urdaneta&#x27;s preference for Mexico may have also been influenced by his links to the Pedro de Alvarado. Following Urdaneta&#x27;s plans in 1565 the first Manila galleon inaugurated European trade with Asia across the Pacific.

Pedro de Valdivia, the conquistador of Chile, managed to have Charles V extend his governorship all the way to the northern shores of the strait. Meanwhile, Sánchez de la Hoz was executed in Chile by Francisco de Villagra, one of Valdivia&#x27;s men.

The first map of the Pacific Ocean, Maris Pacifici from 1589, depicts the strait as the only route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

====The strait and the conquest of Chile====

Contemporaries differed in their estimation of the strait&#x27;s significance. In Europe it was viewed by some as an opportunity and a strategic location to facilitate long-range trade, though Antonio Pigafetta seemed to have understood his voyage through the area as an unrepeatable feat. By contrast, conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, in a letter to Charles V, considered the strait a threat through which rival conquistadors could arrive to challenge his claims.

In 1544 Valdivia commissioned Captain Juan Bautista Pastene to explore the coast from Valparaiso to the Strait of Magellan, and installed his personal secretary Juan de Cárdenas in the expedition to produce a written account of the lands discovered in order to solidify his claims before the King. Although Pastene&#x27;s expedition reached only the 41st parallel south, well short of the strait, it discovered San Pedro Bay and the mouth of Valdivia River, where Valdivia would later found the city that bears his name. As Valdivia consolidated his claims, he mentions in a 1548 letter to the Council of the Indies the possibility of establishing contacts between Chile and Seville through the strait.

García Jofré de Loaiza was the second captain to navigate the strait and the first to discover that Tierra del Fuego was an island. Valdivia then dispatched Francisco de Ulloa to survey and explore the strait, facilitating navigation from Spain to Chile. In October 1553, Ulloa sailed from the city of Valdivia in the first expedition to enter the strait from the west. Ulloa reached Woods Bay, but faced with the steep coastline and lack of provisions and fearing entrapment in the strait during the winter, he turned around, returning to Chilean ports in February 1554.

Valdivia himself never actually reached the strait, as he was killed in 1553 attempting to conquer Araucanía, about 1600 km (994 miles) north of the strait.

In October 1557, Governor García Hurtado de Mendoza sent another exploratory squad of 70 men under the command of Juan Ladrillero. They were charged with mapping the coastline and surveying the region&#x27;s flora, fauna, and ethnography. On August 16, 1558, Ladrillero arrived in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first navigator to cross the Strait of Magellan in both directions.

Colonization by the Spanish southward in Chile halted after the conquest of the Chiloé Archipelago in 1567. The Spanish are thought to have lacked incentives for further conquests south. The indigenous populations were sparse and did not engage in the sedentary agricultural life of the Spanish. The harsh climate in the fjords and channels of Patagonia may also have deterred further expansion. Even in Chiloé the Spanish encountered difficulties, having to abandon their initial economic model based on gold mining and &quot;hispanic-mediterranean&quot; agriculture.

====Spanish attempt to colonise the strait====

In 1578 English navigator Francis Drake crossed the strait, creating fear on the Pacific coast that an attack was imminent. In order to seal the passage, the Viceroy of Peru, Francisco de Toledo, sent a squadron with two ships under Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa. They carefully explored the strait, trying to ferret out English invaders, while surveying locations for future fortifications.

Pigafetta had described the strait as a hospitable area with many good ports, &quot;cedar&quot; wood, and abundant shellfish and fish.

In 1584, Sarmiento de Gamboa founded two colonies in the strait: Nombre de Jesús and Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe. The latter was established on the north shore of the strait with 300 settlers. That winter, it became known as Puerto del Hambre, or &quot;Port Famine&quot;, as most of the settlers died of cold or starvation. When Sir Thomas Cavendish landed at the site of Rey Don Felipe in 1587, he found only ruins of the settlement.

The Spanish failure to colonize the Strait of Magellan made the Chiloé Archipelago key in protecting western Patagonia from foreign intrusions. Valdivia, reestablished in 1645, and Chiloé acted as sentries, and as hubs where the Spanish collected intelligence from all over Patagonia.

In 1599 it took five ships under Simon de Cordes and his pilot William Adams four months to traverse the strait; Sebalt de Weert returned before reaching the end.

===17th century explorations===

In 1616, Dutch travelers, including Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, discovered Cape Horn and recognized the southern end of Tierra del Fuego. Years later, a Spanish expedition commanded by brothers Bartolomé and Gonzalo Nodal verified this discovery making in the way also the first circumnavigation of Tierra del Fuego. After this there would be 150 years before the next ship from Spain would traverse the strait. By 1620, one hundred years after European discovery, at least 55 ships had traversed the strait including 23 Spanish, 17 English and 15 Dutch.

John Narborough&#x27;s 1670 explorations in Patagonia caused the Spanish to launch various maritime expeditions to western Patagonia from 1674 to 1676. In the last and largest one, Pascual de Iriate led a party to Evangelistas Islets at the western entrance to the strait. At Evangelistas sixteen men of the party disappeared on February 17 including the son of Pascual de Iriarte. The ill-fated men had attempted to reach one of the islets to install a metal plaque indicating the King of Spain&#x27;s ownership of the territory. Viceroy of Peru Baltasar de la Cueva issued orders to the governments of Chile, Chiloé and Río de la Plata to inquire about the men who disappeared at Evangelistas Islets. However no information about their fate came forth and it is presumed that the boat wrecked in the same storm that forced the remaining party to leave the area. Overall a total of 16–17 men perished in it. While by 1676 rumours about English bases in Western Patagonia had been dispelled, that year new rumours appeared claiming that England was preparing an expedition to settle the Straits of Magellan. The focus of Spanish attention to repel tentative English settlements shifted from the Pacific coast of Patagonia to the Straits of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego. Such a change, from the western archipelagoes to the strait, meant that any English settlement could be approached by Spain by land from the north, which was not the case for the islands in western Patagonia.

In February 1696, the first French expedition under the command of M. de Gennes reached the Strait of Magellan. The expedition is described by the French explorer, engineer, and hydrographer in his &quot;A Relation of a Voyage&quot; (1699).

===18th century explorations===
In the 18th century further explorations were done by English explorers John Byron and James Cook. The French sent Louis Antoine de Bougainville and Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville. By 1770 the focus of a potential conflict between Spain and Britain had shifted from the strait to Falkland Islands.

===19th century===
====Explorations====
From 1826 to 1830, the strait was explored and thoroughly charted by Phillip Parker King, who commanded the British survey vessel HMS &quot;Adventure&quot;. In consort with HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, King surveyed the complex coasts around the strait. A report on the survey was presented at two meetings of the Geographical Society of London in 1831. In connection to these explorations Robert FitzRoy came to suggest the establishment of a British base in strait to aid travel between the British Isles and Australia.

The 1837 French expedition of Dumont D&#x27;Urville surveyed the area of Puerto del Hambre and the navigational conditions in the Strait of Magellan. In a report the expedition recommended that a French colony be established at the strait to support future traffic along the route.

Richard Charles Mayne commanded HMS &quot;Nassau&quot; on a survey expedition to the strait from 1866 to 1869. The naturalist on the voyage was Robert Oliver Cunningham. Charles Darwin requested the Lords of the Admiralty to ask Mayne to collect several boatloads of fossils of extinct quadruped species. Admiral Sulivan had previously discovered an astonishingly rich accumulation of fossil bones not far from the strait. These remains apparently belonged to a more ancient period than collections made by Darwin on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; and other naturalists, and therefore were of great scientific interest. Many of these fossils were collected with the aid of hydrographer Richards R. N. and deposited in the British Museum. The Admiralty compiled advice to mariners of the strait in 1871.

====Takeover during Republican Chile====

Chile took possession of the Strait of Magellan on May 23, 1843. President Manuel Bulnes ordered this expedition after consulting the Chilean libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, who feared an occupation by Great Britain or France. The first Chilean settlement, Fuerte Bulnes, was situated in a forested zone on the north side of the strait, and was later abandoned. In 1848, Punta Arenas was founded farther north, where the Magellanic forests meet the Patagonian plains. In Tierra del Fuego, across the strait from Punta Arenas, the village of Porvenir emerged during the Tierra del Fuego gold rush in the late 19th century. Until the opening of the Panama Canal, the town was an important supply stop for mariners. It has been claimed that Chile&#x27;s annexation of the area originated from a fear of occupation by Great Britain or France.

In the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina, Argentina effectively recognized Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. Argentina had previously claimed all of the strait, or at least the eastern third of it.

In the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina the conflicts between two countries were settled and Argentina ratified the strait as Chilean.

====Steamship navigation====
In 1840, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company became the first to use steamships for commercial traffic in the strait. Until the Panama Canal opened in 1914, the Strait of Magellan was the main route for steamships traveling from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It was often considered safer than the Drake Passage separating Cape Horn from Antarctica, as the Drake Passage is notorious for turbulent and unpredictable weather, and is frequented by icebergs and sea ice. Ships in the strait, protected by Tierra del Fuego to the south and the coast of continental South America to the north, crossed with relative ease, and Punta Arenas became a primary refueling port that provided coal for steamships in transit. The Strait&#x27;s curving channel, with widths varying between 1.9 and 22 miles (3 to 35 km), experiences unpredictable winds and tidal currents, leading sailing ships to prefer the Drake Passage, where they had more room to maneuver.)

=== 20th century to present ===
in 1900, Joshua Slocum was the first documented person to have single-handedly sailed the strait. He experienced a 40-day hiatus in the strait due to storms and adverse weather, while piloting the gaff-rigged sloop oyster boat &quot;Spray&quot; in the first solo global circumnavigation. He wrote about the experience in &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;.

In 1976, American open water swimmer Lynne Cox became the first person to swim across the strait. Almost 40 years later, on January 17, 2014, Hunter Wright became the youngest person to swim across the strait, at age 17.

In June 2004, the USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to navigate the strait.

==Features==

The strait is approximately long and wide at its narrowest point (Carlos III Island, west of Cape Froward). The northwestern portion of the strait is connected with other sheltered waterways via the Smyth Channel. This area is similar to the Inside Passage of Alaska. South of Cape Froward, the principal shipping route follows the Magdalena Channel. The climate is generally foggy and cold, and the course is convoluted with several narrow passages. It is several hundred miles shorter than the Drake Passage, but sailing ships, particularly clipper ships, prefer the latter. Its major port is Punta Arenas, a transshipment point for Chilean mutton situated on the Brunswick Peninsula. Exemplifying the difficulty of the passage, it took Magellan 38 days to complete the crossing.

The eastern opening is a wide bay on the border of Chile and Argentina between Punta Dúngeness on the mainland and Cabo del Espíritu Santo (&quot;Cape of the Holy Spirit&quot;) on Tierra del Fuego, the border as defined in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina. Immediately west are Primera Angostura and Segunda Angostura, narrows formed by two terminal moraines of different ages. The Primera Angostura is the closest approach of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego to mainland South America. Farther west lies Magdalena Island, part of Los Pingüinos Natural Monument. The strait&#x27;s southern boundary in the east follows first the shoreline of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, then the northern end of the Canal Whiteside and the shoreline of Dawson Island.

The western part of the strait leads northwest from the northern end of the Magdalena Channel to the strait&#x27;s Pacific entrance. This is flanked on the south by Capitán Aracena Island, Clarence Island, Santa Inés Island, Desolación Island (Cabo Pilar), and other smaller islands, and on the north by Brunswick Peninsula, Riesco Island, Muñoz Gamero Peninsula, Manuel Rodriguez Island, and other minor islands of the Queen Adelaide Archipelago. Two narrow channels connect the strait with Seno Otway and Seno Skyring. A broader channel, Smyth Channel, leads north from the strait between Muñoz Gamero Peninsula and Manuel Rodriguez Island. Francisco Coloane Marine and Coastal Protected Area, a sanctuary for humpback whales, is located in this area. This part of the strait lies on the elongated Magallanes-Fagnano Fault, which marks a plate boundary between the South American Plate and the Scotia Plate. This fault continues southward under Almirantazgo Fjord and then below Fagnano Lake. Possibly, new tourism industries could be established in the eastern part of the strait for watching southern right whales, as the number of observations in the area has increased in recent years.

In the more well-defined northeastern course of the strait various bays stand out in its geography. Pecket Bay () is a shallow and somewhat closed bay in the strait located near where Brunswick Peninsula is as narrowest. San Gregorio Bay () is an open bay located in the north coast of the strait. Opposite Pecket Bay is Gente Grande Bay () in Tierra del Fuego.

==Tides and weather==
On the Atlantic side, the strait is characterized by semidiurnal macrotides with mean and spring tide ranges of 7.1 and 9.0 m, respectively. On the Pacific side, tides are mixed and mainly semidiurnal, with mean and spring tide ranges of 1.1 and 1.2 m, respectively. There is enormous tidal energy potential in the strait. The strait is prone to Williwaws, &quot;a sudden violent, cold, katabatic gust of wind descending from a mountainous coast of high latitudes to the sea&quot;.

==Place names==
The place names of the area around the strait come from a variety of languages. Many are from Spanish and English, and several are from the Ona language, adapted to Spanish phonology and spelling. Examples include &quot;Timaukel&quot; (a hamlet at the east side of Tierra del Fuego), &quot;Carukinka&quot; (the end of the Almirantazgo Fjord), &quot;Anika&quot; (a channel located at 54° 7&#x27; S and 70° 30&#x27; W), and &quot;Arska&quot; (the north side of the Dawson Island).

Magellan named the strait &quot;Todos los Santos&quot;, as he began his voyage through the strait on November 1, 1520, the day of &quot;All Saints&quot; (&quot;Todos los Santos&quot; in Spanish). Charles V renamed it &quot;Estrecho de Magallanes&quot;. Magellan named the island on the south side of the strait &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot;, which the Yaghan people called &quot;Onaisín&quot; in the Yaghan language. Magellan also gave the name &quot;Patagones&quot; to the mainland Indians, and their land was subsequently known as Patagonia.

&quot;Bahía Cordes&quot; is named for the Dutch pirate Baltazar de Cordes.

The Strait of Magellan Park, south of Punta Arenas, is a protected area.

==Lighthouses in the strait==

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency lists 41 lighthouses in the waterway. Some of them are more than a century old, and some are declared &quot;Monumento Nacional&quot; (&quot;national monument&quot;). Among the most notable lighthouses are: &quot;County of Peebles&quot; hulk, the world&#x27;s first four-masted, iron-hulled &quot;full-rig ship&quot;, used now as a breakwater for the harbour at Punta Arenas; the &quot;San Isidro&quot; lighthouse, restored in 2004 and is now a museum and lodge; and the Evangelistas Lighthouse, located at the western mouth of the strait and built by George Slight, who wrote on his arrival in 1934:
This strait is one of the region&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Several cruise companies ply its waters, and the lighthouses, including Magdalena Island Light, are popular attractions.

==Environment==

Numerous protected systems are located around the strait (S.P.: &quot;Sistema Protegido&quot;; B.N.P: &quot;Bienes Nacionales Protegidos&quot;):

*B.N.P. Isla Carlos III
*B.N.P. Islote Rupert
*S.P. Cabo Espíritu Santo
*S.P. Cabo Froward
*S.P. Cabo Posesión
*S.P. Estepa Húmeda Kampenaiken Tres Chorrillos
*S.P. Isla Dawson
*S.P. Península Muñoz Gamero
*S.P. Reservas Biológicas de Río Cóndor
*S.P. San Gregorio
*S.P. San Juan
*S.P. Timaukel
Collisions with ships are a major threat to whales in the strait, and it has therefore been suggested that speed limits should be imposed in the area around Francisco Coloane Marine and Coastal Protected Area. Since monitoring began in 2013, most reported ship-whale collisions in the area have involved humpback whales.

==Traffic==
The strait provides a well-protected inland waterway sheltered from rough weather and high seas, allowing for safe navigation. Ships sail through the strait from the Pacific to the Atlantic and back, from the oceans to the Beagle Channel through the Magdalena Channel, Cockburn Channel, Paso Brecknock or Canal Ocasión, Ballenero Channel, O&#x27;Brien Channel, Paso Timbales, northwest arm of the Beagle Channel and the Beagle Channel and back, and also to cross the strait from north to south and back. This is the case for all traffic between the Chile and Argentina and the cities in Tierra del Fuego, Porvenir, Cerro Sombrero, Timaukel, Ushuaia, and Río Grande.

In 2008, 571 Chilean ships and 1,681 non-Chilean ships sailed through the strait. Piloting is compulsory for sailing the strait. As one authority notes, &quot;The Pilotage Regulations of the Chilean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (&#x27;the Regulations&quot;) provide that pilotage through the Magellan Strait is compulsory&quot;, with limited exceptions for local traffic. Who pays the fees for the pilot is subject to interpretation, however.

==Navigation status==

Article 35 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that &quot;Nothing in this Part affects: ... the legal regime in straits in which passage is regulated in whole or in part by long-standing international conventions in force specifically relating to such straits&quot;. Article V of the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina established a legal regime for the Strait of Magellan, and in a diplomatic letter to major shipping nations in 1873, Chile promised freedom of navigation through and neutrality within the strait.

<text>The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch ( or simply: &quot;Tánjīng&quot;) is a Chan Buddhist scripture that was composed in China during the 8th to 13th century. The &quot;platform&quot; (施法壇) refers to the podium on which a Buddhist teacher speaks.
Its key themes are the direct perception of one&#x27;s original nature, and the unity in essence of &quot;śīla&quot; (conduct), &quot;dhyāna&quot; (meditation) and &quot;prajñā&quot; (wisdom).

The text centers on the teachings and stories ascribed to the sixth Chan patriarch Huineng. It contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren (enlightenment by the non-abiding), and discourses and dialogues attributed to Huineng.

The text attributes its recollection to Fa-hai, but was probably written, or redacted, within the so-called Oxhead school, which existed along with the East Mountain School and Shenhui&#x27;s Southern School. The text attempts to reconcile the so-called Northern School with its alleged gradual enlightenment teachings, and the so-called Southern School with its alleged sudden enlightenment teachings. In effect, the text incorporates the &quot;rhetorical purity&quot; which originated with Shenhui&#x27;s attack on Shenxiu, while effectively &quot;writing him out of the story&quot;.

== History of the text ==

The &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; underwent various redactions. Though its recollection has been attributed to Fa-hai, a student of Huineng, its origins are not clear:
The Dunhuang versions are the oldest texts available, with the full title &quot;Southern School&#x27;s Sudden Doctrine, Supreme Mahayana Great Perfection of Wisdom: The Platform Sutra as Delivered by the Sixth Patriarch Huineng at the Dafan Temple in Shao Prefecture&quot; , subtitled, “one roll, recorded by the spreader of the Dharma, the disciple Fahai, who at the same time received the Precepts of Formlessness” (一卷，兼受無相戒弘法弟子法海集記).

Two copies dated to between 830 and 860 have been found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang. Both are thought to be based on an edition from about 780. The finds at Dunhuang have been very important for the historical understanding of Zen:
In 1056, the Chinese scholar-monk Qisong (契嵩, Wade-Giles: &quot;Ch&#x27;i-sung&quot;) produced a larger edition, entitled &quot;Liuzu fabao ji&quot; (法寶記 ‘Precious Record of the Dharma’).

In 1291 (during the Yuan dynasty), Zongbao (宗寶, Wade-Giles: &quot;Tsung-pao&quot;) produced the edition that became part of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) Chinese Buddhist canon. This canonical version, apparently based on the Qisong edition, is about a third longer than the Mogao Caves version, and structured differently.

==Contents==

The &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; is:
===Chapter One - Personal History===
Chapter One contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren. It is an essential part of the Traditional Zen Narrative. The Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza, but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall to remain anonymous one day at midnight about one o&#x27;clock in the morning. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza is as follows:
The Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of &quot;[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind.&quot; He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the &quot;gate of enlightenment,&quot; so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student&#x27;s mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza.

Two days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma. Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed.

According to McRae, &quot;the earliest version of the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; contains two versions of Huineng&#x27;s verse. A later version of Huineng&#x27;s stanza is different from the two older ones:

The followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng&#x27;s status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment.

According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding: 
Huineng&#x27;s verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu&#x27;s verse:
McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of &quot;absolute, relative and middle&quot;, or &quot;thesis-antithesis-synthesis&quot;. According to McRae, the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute.

===Chapter Two - Prajñā (Lecture)===
Chapter Two contains a lecture on prajñā, given after a recitation of the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;. From this chapter: 

===Chapter Three - Questions===
In Chapter Three Huineng answers questions from a lay audience. Huineng discusses the famous story of Bodhidharma telling Emperor Wu of Liang that his good deeds would bring him no merit. Next, he discusses the Pure Land of the West, asserting the greater importance of one&#x27;s inner state compared to one&#x27;s physical location. This leads to a conclusion in which Huineng asserts that lay practice outside of a monastery is preferable to following the forms of monastic renunciation without inner practice.

===Chapter Four - Meditation and Wisdom (Lecture)===
In Chapter Four, meditation and wisdom are said to be of the same essence:
===Chapter Five - Seated Meditation (Lecture)===
Chapter Five details the &quot;pureness of our fundamental nature&quot;:
===Chapter Six - Ceremony of Repentance===
Chapter Six describes a repentance-ritual.

===Chapter Seven - Key Events (Encounter stories and dialogues)===
Chapter Seven gives various stories of encounters and dialogues.

===Chapter Eight - Immediate and Gradual (Encounter stories and dialogues)===
Chapter Eight also gives various stories of encounters and dialogues.

===Chapter Nine - The Imperial Summons===
Chapter Nine describes the request of the Imperial Court for Huineng to visit the Emperor, and Huineng&#x27;s decline of this command.

===Chapter Ten - Transmission===
In the chapter on his final instructions, Huineng instructs his accomplished disciples, giving specific instructions how to &quot;preach the Dharma&quot;, which show the influence of the Buddhist teachings on the five skandhas, the concept of Namarupa, and the Yogacara-teachings:
==Scholarship and translations==

===Japanese scholarship===
In the 1920s, Japanese scholar Yabuki Keiki (矢吹慶輝 1879-1939) produced an edition based on one of the Mogao Caves texts (the only one known at the time), dividing the text into fifty-seven sections.

In 1934, D. T. Suzuki published an edition based on the Mogao Cave text, but incorporating corrections from the Tsungpao (Zongbao) edition.

In 1993, the Buddhist scholar Yang Zengwen (楊曾文, b. 1939, Shandong) published an annotated edition of the second Mogao Caves text (which has fewer errors than the first Mogao Caves text). (Pine, 2006, Introduction)

=== Translations into English ===
The first published translation into English was completed in 1930 by Wong Mou-lam (黃茂林 -1934) from Guangdong. It was based on the canonical Tsungpao edition, and published by the Yu Ching Press of Shanghai.

The Suzuki edition was translated into English by Wing-tsit Chan in 1963 and is written in his book, A source book in Chinese Philosophy.

In 1967 Philip Yampolsky published a translation based on the Mogao Cave text. This translation is a landmark in the modern Western scholarship on Zen and its history.

Charles Luk translated the sutra as &quot;The Dharma Treasure of the Altar Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch&quot; which was published in &quot;Ch&#x27;an and Zen Teachings&quot; (Third Series, 1973).

John McRae translated the longer Yuan dynasty-era composite edition. It was published by Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai.

Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua commented on the Sixth Patriarch Sutra. The sutra and commentary were published by the Buddhist Text Translation Society as The Sixth Patriarch’s Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra (1971) 1st edition Hong Kong, (1977) 2nd edition, San Francisco, (2002) 3rd edition Burlingame,

Shoemaker &amp; Hoard published a translation and commentary by the American writer Red Pine, based on the second Mogao Caves text, in 2006.

Martin Verhoeven and Rev. Heng Sure, disciples of Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua, edited an edition based on the Chinese Zongbao Taisho Volume 48, Number 2008, in August 2014.

<doc id="299044" wikidata="Q504761" url="?curid=299044" title="George Nares">
<text>Vice-Admiral Sir George Strong Nares (24 April 1831 – 15 January 1915) was a Royal Navy officer and Arctic explorer. He commanded the &quot;Challenger&quot; Expedition, and the British Arctic Expedition. He was highly thought of as a leader and scientific explorer. In later life he worked for the Board of Trade and as Acting Conservator of the River Mersey.

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
He was born on 24 April 1831, the third son and sixth child of Commander William Henry Nares, a British naval officer, and Elizabeth Rebecca Gould, at Llansenseld, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. He was baptised at the church of St Bridget, Llansanffraid on 22 May. He married Mary Grant, the eldest daughter of a Portsmouth banker, on 22 June 1858. They had four sons and six daughters. His two youngest sons, George Edward Nares and John Dodd Nares entered the Royal Navy.

=== Education and early naval career ===
He was educated at the Royal Naval School in New Cross in south London, and in 1845 joined the Royal Navy aboard HMS &quot;Canopus&quot;, an old battleship captured from the French. Following a posting to HMS &quot;Havannah&quot; on the Australian station in 1848, during which he served as both midshipman and mate, he returned in 1851 and passed his lieutenant&#x27;s exam in 1852.

=== First Arctic experience ===
While returning to England in &quot;Havannah&quot; in 1851, Nares had met Commander George Henry Richards, a future Hydrographer of the Navy, who had suggested he apply to Sir Edward Belcher for a place on his search for Sir John Franklin. Nares was accepted as the second mate of , and thus gained valuable early experience of the Arctic during the 1852–1854 expedition.

=== Gunnery specialist ===
In 1854 Nares received his promotion to lieutenant and specialised as a gunnery officer. He joined the new battleship in 1854, including service in the Mediterranean during the Crimean War. During this time he was loaned to the under the command of Captain Arthur Cumming. &quot;Glatton&quot; arrived in the Black Sea too late to see action.

=== Instructor and author ===
He served as a lieutenant in charge of training cadets in , and from 1859, in her successor, . During this time he wrote the best-selling book &quot;The Naval Cadet&#x27;s Guide&quot;, which was also republished under the title &quot;Seamanship&quot;, and was regarded as the best manual of its day. He was promoted to commander in 1862 and took command of the training ship in September 1863.

=== Surveyor ===

His next ship was the aging 4-gun wooden paddle sloop , which he commanded from 1865. Although he had served in the steam-assisted &quot;Conqueror&quot; over ten years previously, this was his first paddle steamer, and in a further departure, she was employed in surveying duties on the east coast of Australia. His duties involved keeping the communications between Sydney and Cape York Peninsula in the furthest north point of Queensland open. On the long journeys between he conducted surveys of the Great Barrier Reef. 

His next appointment was to the brand new , which he commissioned and took to the Mediterranean for survey work, including a survey of the Gulf of Suez, accessed by the newly opened Suez Canal. The Suez Canal opened in November 1869. On the morning of 17 November, a procession of ships entered the canal, officially headed by the French Imperial yacht &quot;Aigle&quot; however &quot;Newport&quot; passed through it first. On the night before the canal was due to open, Nares navigated his vessel, in total darkness and without lights, through the mass of waiting ships until it was in front of &quot;L&#x27;Aigle&quot;. When dawn broke the French were horrified to find that the Royal Navy was now first in line and that it would be impossible to pass them. Captain Nares received both an official reprimand and an unofficial vote of thanks from the Admiralty for his actions in promoting British interests and for demonstrating such superb seamanship.

Among the ships following was the &quot;Newport&quot; captained by Nares, which would survey the canal a few months later. The Admiralty required a survey and report before it would allow the canal to be used by naval vessels. G.H. Richards, Hydrographer of the Navy joined &quot;Newport&quot; in January 1870. They traversed the canal in both directions, taking soundings and checking the navigation. They approved the canal, subject to completion of improvements that were already under way.

In recognition of his work in the Gulf of Suez, Nares was promoted to the rank of captain in 1869. He commissioned in 1871 for the Red Sea, and on the outward voyage the ship conducted studies of the water currents in the Straits of Gibraltar for William Benjamin Carpenter, a biologist who believed that density differences between water masses generated ocean currents.

=== &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition ===
Charles Wyville Thomson and the Royal Society of London obtained the corvette from the Royal Navy for a 3-year expedition of scientific discovery. Although much of the world was well charted, this extended only to the coastlines and to very shallow depths – largely depths significant to the safe navigation of ships. There was a widely held consensus that the oceans were in parts very deep, but almost nothing was known of the make up of the deep oceans, the submarine landscape, nor the life contained within the deep ocean. &quot;Challenger&quot; was equipped to measure much of this, being loaded with specimen jars, chemical apparatus, trawls and dredges, thermometers and water sampling bottles, sounding leads and devices to collect sediment from the sea bed. Great lengths of rope were provided to allow the sounding of deep oceans, and of Italian hemp alone she carried a total length of .

Nares was given command of the &quot;Challenger&quot; Expedition, a recognition of his experience in this field, but also of his scientific approach to surveying and exploration. His work with William Carpenter in &quot;Shearwater&quot; had been a key factor in the choice of commanding officer. His officers were all naval surveyors, and the team of civilian scientists, led by Charles Wyville Thomson.

&quot;Challenger&quot; spent a year in the Atlantic and after turning east in early 1874 she turned south in the Indian Ocean, visiting the Prince Edward, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands. She reached as far south as before reaching the ice pack. In the process she became the first steam vessel to cross the Antarctic Circle.

Not all similar expeditions had been so successful, and in particular the easy relations between the scientific gentlemen and the naval officers was a testament to the sure leadership of George Nares. It was therefore a measure of his success as the commander of a scientific expedition that he was recalled in November 1874 to lead a similar but more arduous expedition at the opposite end of the earth.

=== British Arctic Expedition ===

Because of his previous experience in the Arctic, he was summoned from this assignment to take charge of another Arctic voyage in search of the North Pole in and in 1875, the British Arctic Expedition. On this expedition, Nares became the first explorer to take his ships all the way north through the channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island – now named Nares Strait in his honour – to the Lincoln Sea. Up to this time, it had been a popular theory that this route would lead to the supposed Open Polar Sea, an ice-free region surrounding the pole, but Nares found only a wasteland of ice. A sledging party under Albert Hastings Markham set a new record farthest north of 83° 20&#x27; 26&quot;N, but overall the expedition was a near-disaster. The men suffered badly from scurvy and were hampered by inappropriate clothing and equipment. Realising that his men could not survive another winter in the ice, Nares hastily retreated southward with both his ships in the summer of 1876. Nares wrote an account of the expedition, &quot;Narrative of a Voyage to the Polar Sea during 1875–6 by H.M. Ships &quot;Alert&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;&quot; and published by Sampson, Low, Searle &amp; Rivington of London.

Nares was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1876, received the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1877 and was awarded the Gold medal from the &quot;Société de Géographie&quot; in 1879. These scientific awards were matched by an appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1876.

=== Later life ===
In 1878 he was appointed in command of &quot;Alert&quot;, his ship from the Arctic expedition, in which he surveyed the Strait of Magellan. He left the ship on 11 March 1879, and from 1879 to 1896 was employed in the harbour department of the Board of Trade. During this period he retired from the Royal Navy, on 24 April 1886. He was promoted on the retired list twice, firstly in 1887 to rear-admiral, and secondly in 1892 to vice-admiral.

After leaving the Board of Trade in 1896 he became a conservator of the River Mersey, a post which he held until 1910. He was a member of the ship committee for Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s 1912 &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition. His wife Mary died in 1905.

Nares died at home aged 83 at Kingston upon Thames on 15 January 1915, and was buried in Long Ditton churchyard in Surrey.

<doc id="299049" wikidata="Q182573" url="?curid=299049" title="Liger">
<text>The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) and a tigress, or female tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;). The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the opposite hybrid called the tigon (of a male tiger and a lioness), and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.

==History==
The history of lion–tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The name &quot;liger&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;lion&quot; and &quot;tiger&quot;, was coined by the 1930s. &quot;Ligress&quot; is used to refer to a female liger, on the model of &quot;tigress&quot;.

In 1825, G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824. The parents and their three liger offspring are also depicted with their trainer in a 19th-century painting in the naïve style.

Two liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria. On 14 December 1900 and on 31 May 1901, Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck&#x27;s Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897.

In &quot;Animal Life and the World of Nature&quot; (1902–1903), A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck&#x27;s &quot;lion-tiger&quot; hybrids:

It has remained for one of the most enterprising collectors and naturalists of our time, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, not only to breed but to bring successfully to a healthy maturity, specimens of this rare alliance between those two great and formidable Felidae, the lion and tiger. The illustrations will indicate sufficiently how fortunate Mr. Hagenbeck has been in his efforts to produce these hybrids. The oldest and biggest of the animals shown is a hybrid born on the 11th May 1897. This fine beast, now more than five years old, equals and even excels in his proportions a well-grown lion, measuring as he does from nose tip to tail 10 ft 2 inches in length, and standing only three inches less than 4 ft at the shoulder. A good big lion will weigh about 400 lb [...] the hybrid in question, weighing as it does no less than 467 lb, is certainly the superior of the most well-grown lions, whether wild-bred or born in a menagerie. This animal shows faint striping and mottling, and, in its characteristics, exhibits strong traces of both its parents. It has a somewhat lion-like head, and the tail is more like that of a lion than of a tiger. On the other hand, it has no trace of mane. It is a huge and very powerful beast.

In 1935, four ligers from two litters were reared in the Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein, South Africa. Three of them, a male and two females, were still living in 1953. The male weighed and stood a foot and a half (45 cm) taller than a full grown male lion at the shoulder.

In 1948, LIFE magazine pictured &quot;Shasta,&quot; a liger conceived and born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City; its (future) parents had been rubbing noses through adjoining cage bars, and were permitted to cohabitate. The two-pound cub was &quot;almost completely neglected by its mother, but the zoo&#x27;s superintendent took it home and raised it, eventually returning it to the Zoo in a cage across from its parents&#x27; (separate) cages.

Although ligers are more commonly found than tigons today, in &quot;At Home in the Zoo&quot; (1961), Gerald Iles wrote &quot;For the record I must say that I have never seen a liger, a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress. They seem to be even rarer than tigons.&quot;

==Appearance==
The liger has a faint tiger-like striped pattern upon a lionesque tawny background. In addition, it may inherit rosettes from the lion parent (lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings). These markings may be black, dark brown or sandy. The background color may be correspondingly tawny, sandy or golden. In common with tigers, as an example of countershading, the underparts are pale. The specific pattern and color depend upon which subspecies the parents were and how the genes interact in the offspring.

White tigers have been crossed with lions to produce &quot;white&quot; (actually pale golden) ligers. In theory, white tigers could be crossed with white lions to produce white, very pale or even stripeless ligers. There are no black ligers. Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded, most being due to excessive markings (pseudo-melanism or abundism) rather than true melanism; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated. As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist, gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable. It is not impossible for a liger to be white, but it is very rare. The first known white ligers were born in December 2013 at Myrtle Beach Safari in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to a white male lion and a white female tiger.

==Size and growth==
The liger is often believed to be the largest cat in the world. Males reach a total length of , which means that they rival even large male lions and tigers in length. Imprinted genes may be a factor contributing to the large size of ligers. These are genes that may or may not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from, and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth. For example, in some dog breed crosses, genes that are expressed only when maternally-inherited cause the young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed. This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds, as such genes are normally &quot;counteracted&quot; by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed.

Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching . The extreme rarity of these second-generation hybrids may make it difficult to ascertain whether they are larger or smaller, on average, than the liger.

It is sometimes wrongly believed that ligers continue to grow throughout their lives because of hormonal issues. It may be that they simply grow far more during their growing years and take longer to reach their full adult size. Further growth in shoulder height and body length is not seen in ligers over six years old, as in both lions and tigers. Male ligers also have the same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion, yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane&#x27;s rule. In addition, female ligers may also attain great size, weighing approximately and reaching long on average, and are often fertile. In contrast, pumapards (hybrids between pumas and leopards) tend to exhibit dwarfism.

Ligers are about the same size as the prehistoric &quot;Smilodon populator&quot; and American lion.

===Records===
Hercules, the largest non-obese liger, is recognised by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the largest living cat on Earth, weighing . Hercules was featured on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, and in a &quot;Maxim&quot; article in 2005, when he was only three years old and already weighed .

The Valley of the Kings Animal Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over .

To compare, the records for the lion and tiger in captivity are under .

==Health and longevity==
Though ligers typically have a life expectancy of between 13 and 18 years, they are occasionally known to live into their 20s. A ligress named Shasta was born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 May 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24. Nook, a liger at a facility in Wisconsin, died in 2007, at 21 years old. Hobbs, a male liger at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, Nevada, lived to almost 15 years of age before succumbing to liver failure, and weighed .
&quot;Panthera&quot; hybrids tend to experience a higher rate of injury and neurological disorder than non-hybrids. Though not universal, ligers and tigons may develop health issues. Organ failure issues have been reported in ligers, in addition to neurological deficits, sterility, cancer, and arthritis.

==Fertility==

The fertility of hybrid big cat females is well-documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane&#x27;s rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one of the two sexes is absent, rare or sterile, it will be the heterogametic sex. Male ligers are consequently sterile, while female ligers are not.

Ligers and tigons were long thought to be totally sterile. However, in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an island tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.

In September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a &quot;liliger&quot;, the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara.

==Co-occurrence of parent species==
As with the tigon, the liger exists only in captivity. Historically, the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger co-occurred in some Asian countries, and there are legends of male lions mating with tigresses in the wilderness, or of ligers existing there. The two species&#x27; ranges are known to overlap in India&#x27;s Gir National Park, though no ligers were known to live there until the modern era. The range of the Caspian tiger has overlapped with that of the lion in places such as northern Iran and eastern Anatolia.

==Zoo policies==

The United States holds the greatest population of around 30 ligers. China holds about 20 ligers. There are some countries worldwide that hold a few, but it’s probable that fewer than 100 exist worldwide.

The breeding of ligers and other &quot;Panthera&quot; hybrids has come under fire from animal rights activists and organisations, who argue that the health problems experienced by these animals makes their creation immoral. Despite these assertions of immorality, some unlicensed zoos still breed ligers for profit.

<text>The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a multilateral export control regime and a group of nuclear supplier countries that seek to contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through the implementation of two sets of Guidelines for nuclear exports and nuclear-related exports.

== History ==

The NSG was founded in response to the Indian nuclear test in May 1974 and first met in November 1975. The test demonstrated that certain non-weapons specific nuclear technology could be readily turned to weapons development. Nations already signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) saw the need to further limit the export of nuclear equipment, materials or technology. Another benefit was that non-NPT and non-Zangger Committee nations, then specifically France, could be brought in.

A series of meetings in London from 1975 to 1978 resulted in agreements on the guidelines for export; these were published as INFCIRC/254 (essentially the Zangger &quot;Trigger List&quot;) by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Listed items could only be exported to non-nuclear states if certain International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards were agreed to or if exceptional circumstances relating to safety existed.

The name of the &quot;London Club&quot; was due to the series of meetings in London. It has also been referred to as the London Group, or the London Suppliers Group.

The NSG did not meet again until 1991. The &quot;Trigger List&quot; remained unchanged until 1991, although the Zangger list was regularly updated. The revelations about the Iraqi weapons program following the first Gulf War led to a tightening of the export of so-called dual-use equipment. At the first meeting since 1978, held at the Hague in March 1991, the twenty-six participating governments agreed to the changes, which were published as the &quot;Dual-use List&quot; in 1992, and also to the extension of the original list to more closely match the up-to-date Zangger list.

== Participating governments ==
Initially the NSG had seven participating governments: Canada, West Germany, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1976-77, participation was expanded to fifteen with the admittance of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. Germany was reunited in 1990 while Czechoslovakia broke up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. Twelve more nations joined up to 1990. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union a number of former republics were given observer status as a stage towards future membership. China became a participating government in 2004. The European Commission and the Zangger Committee Chair participate as observers. The NSG Chair for 2024 - 2025 is South Africa.

== Candidate Participants ==

===India===
During a state visit to India in November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama announced U.S. support for India&#x27;s participation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, &quot;in a phased manner,&quot; and to encourage the evolution of regime participation criteria to that end, &quot;consistent with maintaining the core principles of these regimes.&quot;

During a visit to India in December 2010, French President Sarkozy also expressed his country&#x27;s backing for India&#x27;s inclusion in Nuclear Suppliers Group. The United Kingdom has for a long time been a supporter of India&#x27;s inclusion in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. During Republic Day visit of India in January 2015, Obama said that India was ready for NSG membership. Russian president Vladimir Putin has also offered unconditional support to India&#x27;s entry into NSG.

Switzerland also announced its backing on India&#x27;s participation in 48 member group on 6 June 2016 during PM Modi&#x27;s visit to Geneva, President Obama reiterated U.S. support for India&#x27;s NSG membership on 8 June 2016 during PM Modi&#x27;s visit to Washington DC. Japan has expressed support for India&#x27;s bid for accession to the NSG.

However, China is opposing India&#x27;s accession citing Pakistan&#x27;s non-admission in the exclusive group. Other countries opposing Indian membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) on the basis of NPT non-signatory status of India included New Zealand, Ireland and Austria.

In June 2016, India got crucial support from Mexico in its bid to become a participant of the NSG ahead of a plenary meeting of the 48-nation bloc whose members are allowed to trade in and export nuclear technology. On 17 June, British Prime Minister David Cameron had assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the UK&#x27;s &quot;firm support&quot; for India&#x27;s NSG membership bid. In an interview on 18 June, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was &#x27;positive&#x27; about India&#x27;s entry into NSG. On 20 June, Canada stated that NSG will be strengthened with India&#x27;s presence. On 22 June France reiterated its support to India, and urged all the other 48 members of the NSG to allow entry for India into the atomic control body. China remains opposed to Indian membership.

In July 2016, South Africa agreed to back India&#x27;s entry into the NSG. In August 2016, Turkey confirmed support for India&#x27;s NSG membership bid. On 4 September 2016, Australia reiterated its commitment to India&#x27;s bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group just ahead of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China. On 5 September 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked Argentina for backing India&#x27;s bid.

On 17 October 2016, following the BRICS summit in Benaulim, Goa, Brazil officially backed India&#x27;s bid for NSG membership. On 26 October 2016, Prime Minister Key of New Zealand stated that &quot;New Zealand would continue to contribute constructively to the process currently underway in the NSG to consider India’s membership.&quot; Poland and Cyprus backed India&#x27;s NSG bid in April 2017. Germany reaffirmed India&#x27;s NSG membership bid in May 2017. Switzerland also showed support for India&#x27;s NSG bid. The Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pierre-Alain Eltschinger said that “We support India’s application for participation in the NSG and acknowledge India’s support to global non-proliferation efforts.” During the 15th RIC (Russia, India, China) foreign ministerial meeting Russia has said it continues to support India’s entry into the exclusive Nuclear Suppliers’ Group. Describing India as a leading power in the Indo-Pacific region, Washington&#x27;s envoy to New Delhi, Kenneth Juster reaffirmed support for India’s NSG bid in January 2018. In the joint press statement of India-Nordic countries summit, The Nordic countries welcomed India’s application for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group and reaffirmed their commitment to work constructively within the Group with the aim of reaching a positive outcome at the earliest opportunity in April 2018. On 16 April 2018 Germany supported India&#x27;s bid for NSG membership saying that India&#x27;s inclusion into the NSG will boost the global export control system. Reaffirming their commitment to global non-proliferation efforts, PM Conte reiterated Italy&#x27;s support to India&#x27;s intensified engagement for admission into the Nuclear Suppliers&#x27; Group (NSG) in Oct 2018 during the 24th edition of the India-Italy Technology Summit.

As of 2019, China has thwarted every attempt of India&#x27;s inclusion into NSG and has made it clear that status quo will remain citing &quot;lack of consensus&quot; among NSG members.

===Pakistan===

Pakistan applied for participation on 19 May 2016. Pakistan has stressed the need for NSG to adopt a non-discriminatory criteria-based approach for NSG membership of the countries, which have never been party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

Pakistan is supported by Turkey and China. Pakistan has launched a major lobbying campaign to get additional support on its NSG membership. The US has not publicly opposed Pakistan, the US State Department&#x27;s Spokesperson Mark Toner commented in May 2016: “They have made public their interest, and certainly any country can submit its application for membership. And we’ll consider [it] based on a consensus decision.” Subsequently, NSG initiated discussions on the ‘Technical, Legal, and Political aspects of participation of non-NPT states in the NSG’ in the Seoul Plenary in June 2017. China has also tied Indian bid to Pakistani bid, blocking the former&#x27;s entry repeatedly based on the argument that If India can be let in without signing NPT, then Pakistan should be granted membership as well.

In 2004, the illicit procurement network run by Pakistani scientist AQ Khan, who led Pakistan&#x27;s uranium enrichment program, was exposed. This network trafficked in nuclear and dual-use goods and supported nuclear weapons programs in Iran, Libya and North Korea as well as Pakistan itself, and included individuals and entities from over 30 countries. In 2004, Pakistan also promulgated an Export Control Act on Goods, Technologies, Materials and Equipment related to Nuclear and Biological Weapons and their Delivery Systems and published Export Control Lists in 2005, which have been frequently updated. The United States on 26 March 2018 sanctioned seven Pakistani firms for nuclear proliferation, potentially hurting its ambitions of NSG membership.

===Namibia===

Namibia applied for NSG membership in 2016. 

===Chile===
Chile has been candidate for the Nuclear Suppliers Group since 2015 as part of its national commitments with the UNSC resolution 1540 of 2004. In its 2017 report to UN about prevention of arms proliferation has presented a National Plan of Action (2017-2021) that includes as targets membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the  Wassenaar Arrangement. 
== Role in India-US nuclear agreement ==

In July 2006, the United States Congress amended U.S. law to accommodate civilian nuclear trade with India. A meeting of NSG participating governments on 21–22 August 2008 on an India-specific exemption to the Guidelines was inconclusive. Several participating governments, including Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, and New Zealand, expressed reservations about the lack of conditions in the proposed exemption. In another meeting on 6 September 2008, the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a &quot;clean waiver&quot; from its existing rules, which forbid nuclear trade with a country which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NSG&#x27;s decision came after three days of intense U.S. diplomacy. The approval was based on a formal pledge by India stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons. The pledge was contained in a crucial statement issued during the NSG meeting by India outlining the country&#x27;s disarmament and nonproliferation policies.

<doc id="299063" wikidata="Q612780" url="?curid=299063" title="Sunday Times Rich List">
<text>The Sunday Times Rich List is a list of the 1,000 wealthiest people or families resident in the United Kingdom ranked by net wealth. The list is updated annually in April and has been published as a magazine supplement by British national Sunday newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; since 1989. The editorial decisions governing the compilation of the &quot;Rich List&quot; are published in the newspaper and online as its &quot;Rules of engagement&quot;.

The &quot;Rich List&quot; is not limited to British citizens and it includes individuals and families born overseas but who predominantly work and/or live in Britain. This excludes some individuals with prominent financial assets in Britain.

The editors estimate subjects&#x27; wealth from a range of public information, based on values in January each year. They typically explain their actions by stating: &quot;We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts—to which we have no access... We try to give due consideration to liabilities.&quot;

The 2015 list marked the first year Queen Elizabeth II was not among the list&#x27;s top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989. She was number one on the inaugural &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 1989&quot;.

The most recent list was published online on 17 May 2024 and in print on 19 May 2024.

The Sunday Times Tax List was inaugurated on 27 January 2019 in the &quot;Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, using data collected for the Rich List and edited by Robert Watts.

== Giving List ==
Since 2005, as part of the &quot;Rich List&quot;, The Sunday Times has produced an annual &quot;Giving List&quot;, which tracks the most generous philanthropists in the UK as a proportion of their wealth. In 2018, it was reported that, of the 300 philanthropists listed in the &quot;Giving List&quot;, a total of £3.207 billion was given away.

Jamie Cooper, the former wife of hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Anthony Hohn, was ranked in first place with a giving index of 88.89%, which amounted to donations in 2018 of £299.6 million.

==Book version==
A fuller version of the &quot;Rich List&quot; is also published in a reference book edition, edited by Philip Beresford. This list covers the top 5,000 richest people, rather than the top 1,000, and includes their business addresses:
*&quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2006–2007&quot; was published by A &amp; C Black in December 2006 ().
*&quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2007–2008&quot; was due to be published by A &amp; C Black in November 2007 () but no book appeared due to a deadlock between the publishers and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The publisher was keen to carry on but only if a CD version was attached to the book. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; would not allow this as it would give competitors a chance to develop their own database and launch rival rich lists.

<doc id="299067" wikidata="Q184345" url="?curid=299067" title="Viña del Mar">
<text>Viña del Mar (; meaning &quot;Vineyard of the Sea&quot;) is a city and commune on central Chile&#x27;s Pacific coast. Often referred to as (&quot;The Garden City&quot;), Viña del Mar is located within the Valparaíso Region, and it is Chile&#x27;s fourth largest city with a population of 324,836 (according to the 2008 census). Viña del Mar is also part of the Greater Valparaíso area, the country&#x27;s second largest metropolitan area (pop. 935,602, 2017 census), after the Metropolitan area of Santiago.

==History==

=== Origins ===

The valley where Viña del Mar was founded was known as the valley of Peuco by the Changos, native inhabitants of the area dedicated to fishing. With the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores the valley was divided into two large haciendas. North of the Marga Marga creek up to the current location of Reñaca, Viña del Mar, and to the south up to the current Cerro Barón (Baron Hill), the Hacienda Las Siete Hermanas (The Seven Sisters).

Francisco Javier Alvares authorized the construction of a railroad through his lands to join Santiago and the port of Valparaíso. The arrival of the railroad brought a young engineer Jose Francisco Vergara who married Francisco Javier Alvares&#x27;s granddaughter, Mercedes Alvares. It was José Francisco Vergara who instigated the idea of the creation of a new city independent of Valparaíso. 

=== Arrival of the railroad and founding ===

The establishment of Refinadora de Azúcar de Viña del Mar (Sugar Refining Company), CRAV in 1873 and the foundation of the Lever, Murphy &amp; Co. by the British Richard Lever and William Murphy in 1883, that gave the necessary economic impulse to transform the young city into one of the most important cities of Chile. The building of a military installation, Regimiento Coraceros in 1917, naval facilities in Las Salinas, and the housing of military and naval personnel furthered the city&#x27;s growth. That year, also, a seaside villa was rebuilt as what is known today as Wulff Castle.

In 1925, the Teatro Municipal was opened in its current location in the eastern front of the city&#x27;s downtown square, Plaza de Viña del Mar. In 1928 president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo authorized the creation of a casino, securing the future and the touristy character of the city. The Casino Municipal de Viña del Mar was opened on December 31, 1930. On January 31, 1931, the Presidential Palace was inaugurated in Cerro Castillo (Castle Hill) as a summer residence for the Chilean President. The touristy character of the city was furthered with the inauguration of the O&#x27;Higgins Hotel in 1936 and the inauguration of the Miramar Hotel by Caleta Abarca Beach in 1945. For a few years in the early 1960s, a trolleybus line connected the city with Valparaíso, and the electric route network included three branches within Viña.

Viña del Mar was one of the four host cities of the 1962 football (soccer) World Cup. It is now home to CD Everton, a soccer team in the Chilean Premier division, which took its name from the English team.

According to the 1982 movie, Missing and other sources, Vina Del Mar was focal point for the plotters of the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état.

Viña del Mar was declared a sister city of Sausalito, California (a city north of San Francisco), in 1971. To demonstrate the sister city relationship, you can find a square (plaza) called &quot;Viña del Mar&quot; in downtown Sausalito, and a &quot;Sausalito&quot; stadium and &quot;Sausalito&quot; lagoon in Viña del Mar. Viña del Mar is also a sister city of Mar del Plata, Argentina since 1993. 

During the 1980s, a global economic downturn seriously affected the city, a number of small and medium-sized factories went bankrupt, including the stationery manufacturer Coda, and most importantly, CRAV, and Textiles Viña, two of the biggest employers in the city. Unemployment rose to alarmingly high rates. Many factories started to consolidate their operations in Santiago making the situation even worse. The city has failed to fully recover from the blows inflicted by the economic downturn of 1982, but an increase in the number of international tourists visiting the city, and the recent high prices of copper in world markets have promoted an economic recovery. 

Extensive commercial redevelopment in the 15 Norte Avenue area, previously an abandoned industrial area, has seen most of the large Chilean retail chains settling in the area, which is now covered with large shopping malls, like Marina Arauco, cinemas, fast food stores, and supermarkets.

The city has benefitted from major investments in infrastructure that have greatly improved the traffic flow in the downtown area, especially in routes connecting Viña del Mar with Santiago, Valparaíso and Quilpué. A modern and efficient subway Valparaíso Metro connects Viña del Mar with the cities of Limache and Valparaíso, following the original railroad tracks between Valparaíso and Santiago.

The city was affected by the February 27, 2010 earthquake.

==City landmarks==
Visitors and locals enjoy the parks and water fountains of the city, including a large flower clock (Reloj de Flores) with its numbers made up of flowering plants, near Caleta Abarca beach. The Valparaiso Sporting Club horse racing track is another major landmark. Jardín Botánico or Parque del Salitre, a large botanical garden on the outskirts of the city, was originally designed and built by an entrepreneur who became wealthy from exploiting saltpeter resources in northern Chile.

A few buildings from the 19th century still remain after multiple earthquakes that have destroyed most of the old areas of the city. Most of the older buildings that remain are located along Avenida Libertad (Liberty Avenue), Quillota Street and Quinta Vergara, a large park in the middle of the city. The presidential summer residence, Palacio Presidencial (Presidential Palace) is located on Cerro Castillo (Castle Hill).

The city&#x27;s casino was designed in art deco style and is surrounded by well-tended gardens (hence the city&#x27;s nickname). In 2004, a hotel (Hotel del Mar) was added to the 1931s building, resembling the architectural features of the original building.

Palacio Rioja, a mansion built by Fernando Rioja in 1907, located on Quillota Street, houses an environmental museum. The Fonck Museum, located in Cuatro Norte Street, has a large exhibition of pre-Columbian articles, and a large moai (Easter Island statue made of volcanic rock), the only one in mainland Chile, is also on display. Palacio Carrasco, built by Emilio Carrasco in 1912, now houses the Municipal Library and also is used for arts exhibitions. The building is also surrounded by nice gardens adorned with fine sculptures including a Rodin. Palacio Vergara located in Quinta Vergara was built by Blanca Vergara (daughter of José Francisco) in 1906 and it is now owned by the municipality. It currently houses the School of Fine Arts and has produced important Chilean artists like the painter Giancarlo Bertini.

Brunet Castle (also known as &quot;Castillo Yarur&quot;) was built in 1923 by Adolfo Brunet on Cerro Castillo, close to the presidential mansion. Currently it is owned by Carabineros de Chile (Chilean police) and is used as a reception center for important visitors. It was declared a national monument in 2005.

Palacio Carrasco and its surrounding park, located on Liberty Avenue #250, between 3 and 4 Norte, was completed in 1923. For years it was a private residence until it moved to the Municipality of Viña del Mar. After moving it to its current location in Arlegui street, the Palacio Carrasco became a Library Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, public library of the commune, while working as center for events, art exhibitions, and cultural workshops. It is very important to stress that the building is totally unsuitable for use as a public library and the community needs a new building for this purpose. Outside the entrance to the Palacio Carrasco there is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin called &quot;La Defensa.&quot; It was declared a national historic monument on September 8, 1986 under Supreme Decree No. 791.

Castillo Wulff, is an iconic building of the commune of neo-Tudor style, built in 1906.

<doc id="299068" wikidata="Q589185" url="?curid=299068" title="Arcot, Tamil Nadu">
<text>Arcot (natively spelt as Ārkāḍu) is a town in Ranipet district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Located on the southern banks of Palar River, the city straddles a trade route between Chennai and Bangalore or Salem, between the Mysore Ghat and the Javadi Hills (Javvadhu malai).

The sweet makkan peda is a local speciality while Arcot biryani, a rice-based traditional food, is also served here.

==Etymology==
&quot;Arcot&quot; is the anglicized form of the Tamil word &quot;ārkāḍ&quot;, which is commonly believed to have been derived from the Tamil words &quot;aaru&quot; (River) + &quot;kaadu&quot; (forest). However, &quot;arkaadu&quot; meant &#x27;a forest of fig trees&#x27;.

Jainism was flourishing in this part of Tamil Land who were otherwise known as Arugar most probably corrupted form of Arhants or the perfected souls. The word Arugar is found in many ancient literary works and places dominant with Arugars were related to them viz Arakonam, Arumbakkam, Aruvur, etc. Not far away from present day Arcot, there is a place called Arungundram. Hence Aarkaadu would have derived its name from Arugarkaadu.

==History==
===Carnatic===
The town&#x27;s strategic location has led to it being repeatedly contested and prompted the construction of a formidable fortress. The Nawabdom of the Carnatic was established by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, who in 1692 appointed Zulfiqar Ali Khan as the first Nawab of the Carnatic. In 1740, the Maratha forces came down upon Arcot. They attacked the Nawab, Dost Ali in the pass of Damalcherry. In the war that followed, Dost Ali, one of his sons Hasan Ali, and a number of prominent persons lost their lives. This initial success at once enhanced Maratha prestige in the south. From Damalcherry the Marathas proceeded to Arcot. It surrendered to them without much resistance. Chanda Saheb and his son were arrested and sent to Nagpur. In 1751, The English captured the town during the conflict between the United Kingdom and France for control of South India. The English successfully held it with only 500 men against the French and the Nawab, resisting for 56 days (23 September to 14 November 1751). The enemy army eventually dissolved and its leader, Chanda Shahib, was killed. Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah took over as Nawab who allied with the British. His successors soon ran up enormous debts at the hands of English speculators. In 1801, the town was annexed by the British East India Company.

In the 20th century, Arcot declined in importance and was incorporated into Vellore District. Arcot has the tomb of the famous 18th-century Sufi Saint Tipu Mastan Aulia. The story goes that from the blessings of Tipu Mastan Aulia, Hyder Ali had a son Tippu Sultan of Mysore, whom he appropriately named after the saint.

In Kaspa, Sri Vaikuntha Varadharaja Perumal Temple is situated. The speciality of this temple is that it is the only temple where the Lord Vishnu statue is erected in the middle with Sri Devi and Bhumadevi at its sides. This type of posture of Lord Perumal is only present in this temple. Moreover, the three statues are designed using a single stone. This temple was built during the Pallava era.

==Culture==
The people who lived in the Arcot region, especially in and near the temple town of Tiruvannamalai, belonged to a clan called the Arcots. The Nawabs fought with and ruled over them for a long period. With the establishment of the Danish Missionary Society, many of these Arcots converted Christians. The Danish Missionary Society (DMS, currently Dan Mission) established many schools and hospitals. The first missionary of the DMS was the German Rev. C.C.E. Ochs. He started his first mission station, Bethanien, at Melpattambakkam in South Arcot in 1861. Now all its activities have been transferred to the nearby town of Nellikuppam.

The second mission station of DMS was opened at Tirukkoyilur in 1869 by Rev. P. Andersen and was called &quot;Siloam&quot;. Siloam church was consecrated on 10 October 1886 and on the same day the first Indian pastors were ordained and more than 30 persons were baptized. A week later a church was consecrated in an outstation, Sengalmedu. The beautiful church in Pop ham&#x27;s Broadway in Madras was built in 1892.

Saron, a third mission station of DMS, was opened in 1882 and situated just outside the town Tiruvannamalai. In 1898 a mission station was built in the town. From 1905 it was called &quot;Carmel.&quot; The fourth mission station in the Arcot District, &quot;Bethesda,&quot; in Kallakurichi was built in 1893 by Rev. A. Larsen. Later DMS started mission stations at Panruti, Vriddhachalam, Devanampatnam, Darisanapuram, and Servaroj Hills, etc. In 1913 a church constitution was inaugurated. This church is serving the Tamil-speaking population in the districts of South and North Arcot, Tamil Nadu. Mayana Kollai is celebrated here. People paint themselves and appear as gods having goat flesh in their mouths and drumsticks in their hands. They walk over the bazaar street towards the burial ground.

<doc id="299069" wikidata="Q1344970" url="?curid=299069" title="William Crowther (programmer)">
<text>William Crowther (born 1936) is an American computer programmer, caver, and rock climber. He is the co-creator of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; from 1975 onward, a seminal computer game that influenced the first decade of video game design and inspired the text adventure game genre.

== Biography ==

During the early 1970s, Crowther worked at defense contractor and internet-pioneer Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), where he was part of the original small ARPAnet development team. His implementation of a distributed distance vector routing system for the ARPAnet was an important early step in the evolution of the Internet.

Crowther met and married Pat Crowther while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a B.S. in physics in 1958.

=== Adventure ===
Following his divorce from his wife, Crowther used his spare time to develop a text-based adventure game in Fortran on BBN&#x27;s PDP-10. He created it as a diversion his daughters Sandy and Laura could enjoy when they came to visit.

Crowther wrote:
In Colossal Cave, or more simply called &quot;Adventure&quot;, the player moves around an imaginary cave system by entering simple, two-word commands and reading text describing the result. Crowther used his extensive knowledge of cave exploration as a basis for the gameplay, and there are many similarities between the locations in the game and those in Mammoth Cave, particularly its Bedquilt section. In 1975, Crowther released the game on the early ARPAnet system, of which BBN was a prime contractor.

In the spring of 1976, he was contacted by Stanford researcher Don Woods, seeking his permission to enhance the game. Crowther agreed, and Woods developed several enhanced versions on a PDP-10 housed in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) where he worked. Over the following decade the game gained in popularity, being ported to many operating systems, including personal-computer platform CP/M.

The basic game structure invented by Crowther (and based in part on the example of the ELIZA text parser) was carried forward by the designers of later adventure games. Marc Blank and the team that created the Zork adventures cite &quot;Adventure&quot; as the title that inspired them to create their game. They later founded Infocom and published a series of popular text adventures.

=== Caving ===
The location of the game in &quot;Colossal Cave&quot; was not a coincidence. Crowther and his first wife Pat were active and dedicated cavers in the 1960s and early 1970s—both were part of many expeditions to connect the Mammoth and Flint Ridge cave systems. Pat played a key role in the September 9, 1972 expedition that finally made the connection. Indeed, even during his time working at BBN, his colleagues noticed that Crowther spent a fair amount of time doing chin-ups in doorframes, which apparently helped him concentrate.

As a member of the MIT Outing Club during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crowther also played an important role in the development of rock climbing in the Shawangunks in New York State. He began climbing there in the 1950s and continues to climb. He made the first ascent of several classic routes including Arrow, Hawk, Moonlight, and Senté. Some of these routes sparked controversy because protection bolts were placed on rappel, a new tactic that Crowther and several others began to use at the time. The community reaction to this technique was an important part of the evolution of climbing ethics in the Shawangunks and beyond.

=== Later career ===
Crowther worked at Xerox PARC from 1976 to 1983. During this period he met and married Nancy Sanders Burnes in 1980 in Palo Alto, California. The two of them did a lot of rock climbing with friends in Yosemite and elsewhere. In 1983 he left Xerox and went back to Bolt Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He became active with the Appalachian Mountain Club and every year helped teach rock climbing to beginners. He continued doing that each spring until 2013.

In the 1990s, Cisco Systems bought the part of BBN where Crowther was working. He continued to work for Cisco until his retirement in 1997 to live in Delanson, New York with his second wife Nancy.

<text>The ballade (; ; not to be confused with the ballad) is a form of medieval and Renaissance French poetry as well as the corresponding musical chanson form. It was one of the three &quot;formes fixes&quot; (the other two were the rondeau and the virelai) and one of the verse forms in France most commonly set to music between the late 13th and the 15th centuries.

The formes fixes were standard forms in French-texted song of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The ballade is usually in three stanzas, each ending with a refrain (a repeated segment of text and music).

The ballade as a verse form typically consists of three eight-line stanzas, each with a consistent metre and a particular rhyme scheme. The last line in the stanza is a refrain. The stanzas are often followed by a four-line concluding stanza (an &quot;envoi&quot;) usually addressed to a prince. The rhyme scheme is therefore usually , where the capital &quot;C&quot; is a refrain.

The many different rhyming words that are needed (the &#x27;b&#x27; rhyme needs at least fourteen words) makes the form more difficult for English than for French poets. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote in the form. It was revived in the 19th century by English-language poets including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Other notable English-language ballade writers are Andrew Lang, Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton (at Wikisource). A humorous example is Wendy Cope&#x27;s &quot;Proverbial Ballade&quot;; another, by T. S. Eliot and satirising literary critics in a way akin to Catullus&#x27; &quot;Carmen 16&quot;, is entitled &quot;Triumph of Bull$#!+&quot;.

== Musical form ==

The musical form of a ballade stanza is a bar form (AAB), with a first, repeated musical section (&quot;stollen&quot;) setting the two initial pairs of verses (rhyme scheme ), and the second section (&quot;abgesang&quot;) setting the remaining lines including the refrain verse (). The two statements of the &quot;A&quot; section often have different endings, known as &quot;ouvert&quot; and &quot;clos&quot; respectively, with the harmony of the &quot;ouvert&quot; ending leading back to the beginning and that of the &quot;clos&quot; ending leading forward into the &quot;B&quot; section. In many ballades, the final part of the &quot;B&quot; section may reintroduce melodic material referring back to the end of the &quot;A&quot; part, a feature known as &quot;musical rhyme&quot; (or, in German, &quot;Rücklaufballade&quot;). An alternative form employed by Machaut, known as &quot;ballade duplex&quot; or &quot;balladelle&quot;, has the B part also divided into two repetitions, with the refrain line sung as part of the repetition.

A famous exception to the normal form is &quot;Se la face ay pale&quot; by Guillaume Dufay, where the entire stanza is through-composed, i.e. without a repetition between the two &quot;A&quot; sections.

==Notable writers of ballades==

Guillaume de Machaut wrote 42 ballades set to music. A few of them set two or even three poems to music simultaneously, with different texts sung in different voices. Most of the others have a single texted voice with either one or two untexted (instrumental) accompanying voices. One of the most notable writers of ballades in the 15th century was François Villon.

==Variations==

There are many easy-to-identify variations to the ballade; it is in many ways similar to the ode and chant royal. Some ballades have five stanzas. A seven-line ballade, or ballade royal, consists of four stanzas of rhyme royal, all using the same three rhymes, all ending in a refrain, without an envoi.

A ballade supreme has ten-line stanzas rhyming , with the envoi . An example is &quot;Ballade des Pendus&quot; by François Villon. There are also instances of a double ballade and double-refrain ballade.

<text>Gloria Marie Steinem ( ; born March 25, 1934) is an American journalist and social-political activist who emerged as a nationally recognized leader of second-wave feminism in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Steinem was a columnist for &quot;New York&quot; magazine and a co-founder of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine. In 1969, Steinem published an article, &quot;After Black Power, Women&#x27;s Liberation,&quot; which brought her national attention and positioned her as a feminist leader. In 1971, she co-founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus which provides training and support for women who seek elected and appointed offices in government. Also in 1971, she co-founded the Women&#x27;s Action Alliance which, until 1997, provided support to a network of feminist activists and worked to advance feminist causes and legislation. In the 1990s, Steinem helped establish Take Our Daughters to Work Day, an occasion for young girls to learn about future career opportunities. In 2005, Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan co-founded the Women&#x27;s Media Center, an organization that &quot;works to make women visible and powerful in the media.&quot;

, Steinem was traveling internationally as an organizer and lecturer, and was a media spokeswoman on issues of equality.
In 2015, Steinem, alongside two Nobel Peace Laureates (Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia), Abigail Disney, and other prominent women peace activists, undertook a journey from the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang to South Korea, crossing the most heavily militarized zone in the world between the two Koreas.

== Early life ==
Steinem was born on March 25, 1934, in Toledo, Ohio, the daughter of Ruth (née Nuneviller) and Leo Steinem. Her mother was Presbyterian, mostly of German (including Prussian) and some Scottish descent. Her father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from Württemberg, Germany, and Radziejów, Poland. Her paternal grandmother, Pauline Perlmutter Steinem, was chairwoman of the educational committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association, a delegate to the 1908 International Council of Women, and the first woman to be elected to the Toledo Board of Education, as well as a leader in the movement for vocational education. Pauline also rescued many members of her family from the Holocaust.

The Steinems lived and traveled about in a trailer, from which Leo carried out his trade as a roaming antiques dealer. Before Gloria was born, her mother, Ruth, then age 34, had a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; which left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent. She changed &quot;from an energetic, fun-loving, book-loving&quot; woman into &quot;someone who was afraid to be alone, who could not hang on to reality long enough to hold a job, and who could rarely concentrate enough to read a book.&quot; Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally ill. Steinem was ten years old when her parents separated in 1944. Her father went to California to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo.

While her parents divorced under the stress of her mother&#x27;s illness, Steinem did not attribute it at all to male chauvinism on the father&#x27;s part—she claims to have &quot;understood and never blamed him for the breakup.&quot; Nevertheless, the impact of these events had a formative effect on her personality: while her father, a traveling salesman, had never provided much financial stability to the family, his exit aggravated their situation. Steinem concluded that her mother&#x27;s inability to hold on to a job was evidence of general hostility towards working women. She also concluded that the general apathy of doctors towards her mother emerged from a similar anti-woman animus. Years later, Steinem described her mother&#x27;s experience as pivotal to her understanding of social injustices. These perspectives convinced Steinem that women lacked social and political equality.

Steinem attended Waite High School in Toledo and Western High School in Washington, D.C., graduating from the latter while living with her older sister Susanne Steinem Patch. She then attended Smith College, an institution with which she continues to remain engaged, from which she received her A.B. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and graduated Phi Beta Kappa.

In 1957, Steinem had an abortion. The procedure was performed by Dr. John Sharpe, a British physician, when abortion was still illegal. Years later, Steinem dedicated her memoir &quot;My Life on the Road&quot; (2015) to him. She wrote, &quot;Dr. John Sharpe of London, who in 1957, a decade before physicians in England could legally perform an abortion for any reason other than the health of the woman, took the considerable risk of referring for an abortion a twenty-two-year-old American on her way to India. Knowing only that she had broken an engagement at home to seek an unknown fate, he said, &#x27;You must promise me two things. First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life.&#x27;&quot;

In the late 1950s, Steinem spent two years in India as a Chester Bowles Asian Fellow. After returning to the United States, she served as director of the Independent Research Service, an organization funded in secret by a donor that turned out to be the CIA. She worked to send non-Communist American students to the 1959 World Youth Festival. In 1960, she was hired by Warren Publishing as the first employee of &quot;Help!&quot; magazine.

In 1950s, she was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, and later she went ahead to model her campaign after Gandhi&#x27;s independence movement.

== Journalism ==

&quot;Esquire&quot; magazine features editor Clay Felker gave freelance writer Steinem what she later called her first &quot;serious assignment&quot;, regarding contraception; he didn&#x27;t like her first draft and had her re-write the article. Her resulting 1962 article about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded Betty Friedan&#x27;s book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; by one year.

In 1963, while working on an article for Huntington Hartford&#x27;s &quot;Show&quot; magazine, Steinem was employed as a Playboy Bunny at the New York Playboy Club. The article, published in 1963 as &quot;A Bunny&#x27;s Tale&quot;, featured a photo of Steinem in Bunny uniform and detailed how women were treated at those clubs. Steinem has maintained that she is proud of the work she did publicizing the exploitative working conditions of the bunnies and especially the sexual demands made of them, which skirted the edge of the law. However, for a brief period after the article was published, Steinem was unable to land other assignments; in her words, this was &quot;because I had now become a Bunny—and it didn&#x27;t matter why.&quot; However, on the upside, the article compelled the owner of Playboy, Hugh Hefner, to review and improve the working conditions of the Bunnies.

In the interim, she conducted an interview with John Lennon for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in 1964. In 1965, she wrote for NBC-TV&#x27;s weekly satirical revue, &quot;That Was The Week That Was (TW3)&quot;, contributing a regular segment entitled &quot;Surrealism in Everyday Life&quot;. Steinem eventually landed a job at Felker&#x27;s newly founded &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1968.

In 1969, she covered an abortion speak-out for &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, which was held in a church basement in Greenwich Village, New York. Steinem had had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22. She felt what she called a &quot;big click&quot; at the speak-out, and later said she didn&#x27;t &quot;begin my life as an active feminist&quot; until that day. As she recalled, &quot;It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: &#x27;Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament&#x27; was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn&#x27;t going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn&#x27;t tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn&#x27;t [positive].&quot; She also said, &quot;In later years, if I&#x27;m remembered at all it will be for inventing a phrase like &#x27;reproductive freedom&#x27;  ... as a phrase it includes the freedom to have children or not to. So it makes it possible for us to make a coalition.&quot;
In 1972, she co-founded the feminist magazine &quot;Ms.&quot; alongside founding editors Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Mary Thom, Patricia Carbine, Joanne Edgar, Nina Finkelstein, Dorothy Pitman Hughes, and Mary Peacock; it began as a special edition of &quot;New York&quot;, and Clay Felker funded the first issue. Its 300,000 test copies sold out nationwide in eight days. Within weeks, &quot;Ms.&quot; had received 26,000 subscription orders and more than 20,000 reader letters. In 1974, &quot;Ms.&quot; collaborated with public television to produce the television program &quot;Woman Alive!&quot;, and Steinem was featured in the first episode in her role as co-founder of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine. The magazine was sold to the Feminist Majority Foundation in 2001; Steinem remains on the masthead as one of six founding editors and serves on the advisory board.

Also in 1972, Steinem became the first woman to speak at the National Press Club.

In November 1977, Steinem spoke at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference among other speakers including Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, Lady Bird Johnson, Bella Abzug, Barbara Jordan, Cecilia Burciaga, Lenore Hershey, and Jean O&#x27;Leary.

In 1978, Steinem wrote a semi-satirical essay for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; titled &quot;If Men Could Menstruate&quot; in which she imagined a world where men menstruate instead of women. She concludes in the essay that in such a world, menstruation would become a badge of honor with men comparing their relative sufferings, rather than the source of shame that it had been for women.

On March 22, 1998, Steinem published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;Feminists and the Clinton Question&quot;) in which she claimed that Bill Clinton&#x27;s alleged behavior did not constitute sexual harassment, although she did not actually challenge the accounts by his accusers. The op-ed was criticized by various writers, as in the Harvard Crimson and in the &quot;Times&quot; itself. In 2017, Steinem, in an interview with the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stood by her 1998 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, but also said: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t write the same thing now.&quot;

== Activism ==

In 1968, Steinem signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In 1969, she published an article, &quot;After Black Power, Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot; which brought her to national fame as a feminist leader. As such she campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in its favor in 1970. That same year she published her essay on a utopia of gender equality, &quot;What It Would Be Like If Women Win&quot;, in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

On July 10, 1971, Steinem was one of more than three hundred women who founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus (NWPC), including such notables as Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, and Myrlie Evers-Williams. As a co-convener of the Caucus, she delivered the speech &quot;Address to the Women of America&quot;, stating in part:

In 1972, she ran as a delegate for Shirley Chisholm in New York, but lost.

In March 1973, she addressed the first national conference of Stewardesses for Women&#x27;s Rights, which she continued to support throughout its existence. Stewardesses for Women&#x27;s Rights folded in the spring of 1976.

Despite her influence in the feminist movement, Steinem also earned criticism from some feminists, who questioned whether she was committed to the movement or using it to promote her glamorous image. The Redstockings also singled her out for agreeing to cooperate with the CIA-backed Independent Research Service. It was also acknowledged that Steinem worked as a CIA agent when this operation was taking place.

Steinem, who grew up reading Wonder Woman comics, was also a key player in the restoration of Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers and traditional costume, which were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973). Steinem, offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered, had placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; (1972)—Warner Communications, DC Comics&#x27; owner, was an investor—which also contained an appreciative essay about the character. In doing so, however, Steinem forced the firing of Samuel R. Delany who had taken over scripting duties with issue #202. Delany was supposed to write a six-issue story arc, which would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic where Wonder Woman was to defend women trying to use their services, a critical feminist issue at the time. The story outlines and the work already done on the issues was scrapped, something that Steinem was not aware of and made no attempt to rectify.

In 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in Esther M. Broner&#x27;s New York City apartment and led by Broner, with 13 women attending, including Steinem.

In 1977, Steinem became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

In 1984, Steinem was arrested along with a number of members of Congress and civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the South African embassy while protesting against the South African apartheid system.

At the outset of the Gulf War in 1991, Steinem, along with prominent feminists Robin Morgan and Kate Millett, publicly opposed an incursion into the Middle East and asserted the ostensible goal of &quot;defending democracy&quot; was a pretense.

During the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment scandal in 1991, Steinem voiced strong support for Anita Hill and suggested that one day Hill herself would sit on the Supreme Court.

In 1992, Steinem co-founded Choice USA, a non-profit organization that mobilizes and provides ongoing support to a younger generation that lobbies for reproductive choice.

In 1993, Steinem co-produced and narrated an Emmy Award-winning TV documentary for HBO about child abuse, called, &quot;Multiple Personalities: The Search for Deadly Memories&quot;. Also in 1993, she and Rosilyn Heller co-produced an original TV movie for Lifetime, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, which examined the parallel forces that both oppose abortion and support the death penalty.

She contributed the piece &quot;The Media and the Movement: A User&#x27;s Guide&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

On June 1, 2013, Steinem performed on stage at the &quot;Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live&quot; Concert at Twickenham Stadium in London, England. Later in 2014, UN Women began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, and as part of that campaign Steinem (and others) spoke at the Apollo Theater in New York City. Chime For Change was funded by Gucci, focusing on using innovative approaches to raise funds and awareness especially regarding girls and women.

Steinem has stated, &quot;I think the fact that I&#x27;ve become a symbol for the women&#x27;s movement is somewhat accidental. A woman member of Congress, for example, might be identified as a member of Congress; it doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;s any less of a feminist but she&#x27;s identified by her nearest male analog. Well, I don&#x27;t have a male analog so the press has to identify me with the movement. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because &quot;Ms.&quot; is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, I&#x27;m more likely to be identified with the movement. There&#x27;s no other slot to put me in.&quot;

Contrary to popular belief, Steinem did not coin the feminist slogan &quot;A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle&quot;. Although she helped popularize it, the phrase is actually attributable to Irina Dunn. When &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article attributing the saying to Steinem, Steinem wrote a letter saying the phrase had been coined by Dunn.

Another phrase sometimes wrongly attributed to Steinem is: &quot;If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.&quot; Steinem herself attributed it to &quot;an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston&quot;, whom she said she and Florynce Kennedy met.

=== Steinem joins Women Cross DMZ ===
On May 24, 2015, International Women&#x27;s Day for Disarmament, thirty women— including two Nobel Peace laureates and retired Colonel Ann Wright— from 15 countries linked arms with 10,000 Korean women, stationing themselves on both sides of the DMZ to urge a formal end to the Korean War (1950-1953), the reunification of families divided during the war, and a peace building process with women in leadership positions to resolve seventy years of hostility following WWII. It was unusual for South Korea and North Korea to reach consensus on allowing peace activists to enter the tense border area, one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous places, where hundreds of thousands of troops are stationed in a heavily mined zone that divides South Korea from nuclear North Korea.

In addition to Steinem, participants in crossing the DMZ included organizer Christine Ahn from Hawaii; feminist Suzuyo Takazato from Okinawa; Amnesty International human rights lawyer Erika Guevara of Mexico; Liberian peace and reconciliation advocate Leymah Gbowee; Philippines lawmaker Liza Maza; Northern Ireland peace activist Mairead Maguire and Colonel Ann Wright, a retired officer who resigned from the U.S. military to protest the US invasion of Iraq.

Steinem was the honorary co-chairwoman of 2015 Women&#x27;s Walk For Peace In Korea with Mairead Maguire, and in the weeks leading up to the walk Steinem told the press, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine any more physical symbol of the insanity of dividing human beings.&quot; The group&#x27;s main goal is to advocate disarmament and seek Korea&#x27;s reunification. It will be holding international peace symposiums both in Pyongyang and Seoul in which women from both North Korea and South Korea can share experiences and ideas of mobilizing women to stop the Korean crisis. It is especially believed that the role of women in this act would help and support the reunification of family members divided by the split prolonged for 70 years.

She is also the chair of the advisory board of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organization fighting sex trafficking and inter-generational prostitution in India, founded by Ruchira Gupta. She has also written extensively on her travels, experiences with women and the Indian feminist movement with her colleague and friend, Ruchira Gupta.
In 2014, Steinem and Gupta traveled through India to meet the country&#x27;s young feminists, writers, and thought leaders. A diary was kept documenting their travels, &quot;Notes on A Tour of the Indian Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;.

Since 2011, Steinem has been one co-conveners of the Frontline Women&#x27;s Fund, a project of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute along with former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and Jessica Neuwirth. The Frontline Women&#x27;s Fund is a fund for women that strengthens frontline women&#x27;s rights activists around the world by increasing their access to financial resources, political leaders, and media visibility. Today they support 15 partner organizations in 13 countries and manage two thematic funds – the Gloria Steinem Equality Fund to End Sex Trafficking with 13 grantees and the Efua Dorkenoo Fund to End Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) with 5 grantees.

== Involvement in political campaigns ==
Steinem&#x27;s involvement in presidential campaigns stretches back to her support of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential campaign.

=== 1968 election ===
A proponent of civil rights and fierce critic of the Vietnam War, Steinem was initially drawn to Senator Eugene McCarthy because of his &quot;admirable record&quot; on those issues, but after meeting him and hearing him speak, she found him &quot;cautious, uninspired, and dry&quot;. As the campaign progressed, Steinem became baffled at &quot;personally vicious&quot; attacks that McCarthy leveled against his primary opponent Robert F. Kennedy, even as &quot;his real opponent, Hubert Humphrey, went free&quot;.

On a late-night radio show, Steinem garnered attention for declaring &quot;George McGovern is the real Eugene McCarthy&quot;. In 1968, Steinem was chosen to pitch the arguments to McGovern as to why he should enter the presidential race that year; he agreed, and Steinem &quot;consecutively or simultaneously served as pamphlet writer, advance &#x27;man&#x27;, fund raiser, lobbyist of delegates, errand runner, and press secretary&quot;.

McGovern lost the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and Steinem later wrote of her astonishment at Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s &quot;refusal even to suggest to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley that he control the rampaging police and the bloodshed in the streets&quot;.

=== 1972 election ===

Steinem was reluctant to re-join the McGovern campaign, as although she had brought in McGovern&#x27;s single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she &quot;&quot;still&quot; had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern&#x27;s campaign staff&quot;. In April 1972, Steinem remarked that he &quot;still doesn&#x27;t understand the Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;.

McGovern ultimately excised the abortion issue from the party&#x27;s platform, and recent publications show McGovern was deeply conflicted on the issue. Steinem later wrote this description of the events:


However, Germaine Greer flatly contradicted Steinem&#x27;s account, reporting, &quot;Jacqui Ceballos called from the crowd to demand abortion rights on the Democratic platform, but Bella [Abzug] and Gloria stared glassily out into the room, thus killing the abortion rights platform&quot;, and asking &quot;Why had Bella and Gloria not helped Jacqui to nail him on abortion? What reticence, what loserism had afflicted them?&quot; Steinem later recalled that the 1972 Convention was the only time Greer and Steinem ever met.

The cover of &quot;Harper&quot;″s that month read, &quot;Womanlike, they did not want to get tough with their man, and so, womanlike, they got screwed&quot;.

=== 2004 election ===
In the run-up to the 2004 election, Steinem voiced fierce criticism of the Bush administration, asserting, &quot;There has never been an administration that has been more hostile to women&#x27;s equality, to reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right, and has acted on that hostility&quot;, adding, &quot;If he is elected in 2004, abortion will be criminalized in this country&quot;. At a Planned Parenthood event in Boston, Steinem declared Bush &quot;a danger to health and safety&quot;, citing his antagonism to the Clean Water Act, reproductive freedom, sex education, and AIDS relief.

=== 2008 election ===
Steinem was an active participant in the 2008 presidential campaign, and praised both the Democratic front-runners, commenting,

Nevertheless, Steinem endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton, citing her broader experience, and saying that the nation was in such bad shape it might require two terms of Clinton and two of Obama to fix it.

She also made headlines for a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed in which she cited gender and not race as &quot;probably the most restricting force in American life&quot;. She elaborated, &quot;Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women.&quot;

Steinem again drew attention for, according to the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, seeming &quot;to denigrate the importance of John McCain&#x27;s time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam&quot;; Steinem&#x27;s broader argument &quot;was that the media and the political world are too admiring of militarism in all its guises&quot;.

Following McCain&#x27;s selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, Steinem penned an op-ed in which she labeled Palin an &quot;unqualified woman&quot; who &quot;opposes everything most other women want and need&quot;, described her nomination speech as &quot;divisive and deceptive&quot;, called for a more inclusive Republican Party, and concluded that Palin resembled &quot;Phyllis Schlafly, only younger&quot;.

=== 2016 election ===

In an HBO interview with Bill Maher, Steinem, when asked to explain the broad support for Bernie Sanders among young Democratic women, responded, &quot;When you&#x27;re young, you&#x27;re thinking, &#x27;Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.&#x27;&quot; Her comments triggered widespread criticism, and Steinem later issued an apology and said her comments had been &quot;misinterpreted&quot;.

Steinem endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Steinem was an honorary co-chair of and speaker at the Women&#x27;s March on Washington on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.

== CIA ties and leader of Independent Research Service ==
In 1967, Steinem revealed in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she worked full time from 1958 until 1962 at the Independent Research Service, which was largely financed by the CIA. In May 1975, Redstockings, a radical feminist group, published a report that Steinem and others put together on the Vienna Youth Festival and its attendees for the Independent Research Service. Redstockings raised the question of whether Steinem had continuing ties with the CIA, which Steinem denied. Steinem defended her relationship to the CIA, saying: &quot;In my experience The Agency was completely different from its image; it was liberal, nonviolent and honorable.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Steinem had a four-year relationship with the publisher Mortimer Zuckerman.

On September 3, 2000, at age 66, Steinem married David Bale, father of actor Christian Bale. The wedding was performed at the home of her friend Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Steinem technically became stepmother to Bale&#x27;s four adult children; she has no biological children. Steinem and Bale were married for only three years before he died of brain lymphoma on December 30, 2003, at age 62.

Steinem was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986 and trigeminal neuralgia in 1994.

Commenting on aging, Steinem says that as she approached 60 she felt like she entered a new phase in life that was free of the &quot;demands of gender&quot; that she faced from adolescence onward.

Steinem lives alone in New York&#x27;s Upper East Side, where she owns the first three floors of her historic brownstone apartment building. In 2021, on her 87th birthday, Google Arts &amp; Culture launched a virtual tour of her home, where she has lived since 1966.

When taking part in season 5 of &quot;Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&quot;, comedian Tig Notaro discovered she and Steinem are distant cousins.

== Political positions ==

Although most frequently considered a liberal feminist, Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a radical feminist. More importantly, she has repudiated categorization within feminism as &quot;nonconstructive to specific problems&quot;, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness.&quot; Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked several firm positions.

=== Female genital mutilation ===
In 1979, Steinem wrote the article on female genital mutilation that brought it into the American public&#x27;s consciousness; the article &quot;The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation&quot; was published in the March 1979 issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; The article reported on the &quot;75 million women suffering with the results of genital mutilation&quot;. According to Steinem, &quot;The real reasons for genital mutilation can only be understood in the context of the &quot;patriarchy&quot;: men must control women&#x27;s bodies as the means of production, and thus repress the independent power of women&#x27;s sexuality.&quot;

Steinem&#x27;s article contains the basic arguments that would later be developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum.

=== Feminist theory ===

Steinem has frequently voiced her disapproval of the obscurantism and abstractions some claim to be prevalent in feminist academic theorizing. She said, &quot;Nobody cares about feminist academic writing. That&#x27;s careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted[...] But I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulness—and what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability.&quot; Steinem later singled out deconstructionists like Judith Butler for criticism, saying, &quot;I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, &#x27;Beware: Deconstruction Ahead&#x27;. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say &#x27;discourse&#x27;, not &#x27;talk&#x27;. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised—and I think it&#x27;s important that women&#x27;s experiences be given a narrative.&quot;

=== Kinsey Reports ===
In addition to feminism, Steinem has also been a prominent advocate for analyzing the Kinsey Reports.

=== Pornography ===
Steinem has criticized pornography, which she distinguishes from erotica, writing: &quot;Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.&quot; Steinem&#x27;s argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes, &quot;Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.&quot;

On the issue of same-sex pornography, Steinem asserts, &quot;Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male-female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master.&quot; Steinem has also cited &quot;snuff films&quot; as a serious threat to women.

=== Same-sex marriage ===
In an essay published in &quot;Time&quot; magazine on August 31, 1970, &quot;What Would It Be Like If Women Win&quot;, Steinem wrote about same-sex marriage in the context of the &quot;Utopian&quot; future she envisioned, writing:

Although Steinem did not mention or advocate same-sex marriage in any published works or interviews for more than three decades, she again expressed support for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, stating in 2004 that &quot;[the] idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction oppresses women—whose health depends on separating sexuality from reproduction—as well as gay men and lesbians.&quot; Steinem is also a signatory of the 2008 manifesto, &quot;Beyond Same-Sex Marriage: A New Strategic Vision For All Our Families and Relationships&quot;, which advocates extending legal rights and privileges to a wide range of relationships, households, and families.

=== Transgender rights ===
In 1977, Steinem expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex reassignment surgery of tennis player Renée Richards had been in her opinion characterized as either a frightening look at what feminism could cause or as proof that feminism was no longer necessary. Steinem wrote that the issue was at minimum &quot;a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality.&quot; She also wrote that, while she supported the right of individuals to identify as they choose, she believed some transsexuals &quot;surgically mutilate their own bodies&quot; in order to conform to a gender role that is inexorably tied to physical body parts. She claimed that &quot;feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.&quot;

On October 2, 2013, Steinem clarified her remarks on transgender people in an op-ed for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, writing that critics failed to consider that her 1977 essay was &quot;written in the context of global protests against routine surgical assaults, called female genital mutilation by some survivors.&quot; Steinem later in the piece expressed unequivocal support for transgender people, saying that transgender people &quot;including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned.&quot; She also apologized for any pain her words might have caused.

On June 15, 2020, Steinem co-wrote a letter with Mona Sinha to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which they opposed the elimination of civil rights protections for transgender healthcare by the Trump administration. In it, they made note of precolonial American traditions of gender variance and claimed that &quot;the health of any of us affects the health of all of us, and excluding trans people endangers us all.&quot;

==Desired legacy==
In 2024 Steinem said she hoped her legacy would be that her work &quot;might help individual people... to become more the unique, valuable, loved and lovable person that they want to be.&quot;

We sincerely apologize for any offense.&quot; The company then faced further criticism online, this time both from customers who were still unhappy that Steinem had been featured in the first place, and customers who were unhappy that Steinem had been removed.

In Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s 2016 music video for her song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Your Mama&quot;, Steinem can be heard saying part of her &quot;Address to the Women of America&quot; speech, specifically, &quot;This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution.&quot;

<doc id="299079" wikidata="Q926227" url="?curid=299079" title="R101">
<text>R101 was one of a pair of British rigid airships completed in 1929 as part of the Imperial Airship Scheme, a British government programme to develop civil airships capable of service on long-distance routes within the British Empire. It was designed and built by an Air Ministry–appointed team and was effectively in competition with the government-funded but privately designed and built R100. When built, it was the world&#x27;s largest flying craft at in length, and it was not surpassed by another hydrogen-filled rigid airship until the LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was launched seven years later.

After trial flights and subsequent modifications to increase lifting capacity, which included lengthening the ship by to add another gasbag, the R101 crashed in France during its maiden overseas voyage on 5 October 1930, killing 48 of the 54 people on board. Among the passengers killed were Lord Thomson, the Air Minister who had initiated the programme, senior government officials, and almost all the dirigible&#x27;s designers from the Royal Airship Works.

The crash of R101 effectively ended British airship development, and was one of the worst airship accidents of the 1930s. The loss of 48 lives was more than the 36 killed in the much better-known &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster of 1937, though fewer than the 52 killed in the French military &quot;Dixmude&quot; in 1923 and the 73 killed when the USS &quot;Akron&quot; crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New Jersey in 1933.

==Background==

R101 was built as part of a British government initiative to develop airships to provide passenger and mail transport from Britain to the most distant parts of the British Empire, including India, Australia and Canada, since the distances were then too great for heavier-than-air aircraft. The Burney Scheme of 1922 had proposed a civil airship development programme to be carried out by a specially established subsidiary of Vickers with the support of the British government. The scheme drew support from the Air Ministry, which sought more airships and a base in India. The Admiralty added that it would forgo some light cruisers of which it was very short. However, Prime Minister Lloyd George&#x27;s government decided it could not afford to support the Burney Scheme.

When the 1923 general election brought Ramsay MacDonald’s Labour administration to power, the new Air Minister, Lord Thomson, formulated the Imperial Airship Scheme in place of the Burney Scheme. It called for the building of two experimental airships: one, R101, to be designed and constructed under the direction of the Air Ministry, and the other, R100, to be built by a Vickers subsidiary, the Airship Guarantee Company, under a fixed-price contract. They were nicknamed the &quot;Socialist Airship&quot; and the &quot;Capitalist Airship&quot;, respectively.

In addition to the building of the two airships, the Imperial Airship Scheme involved the establishment of the necessary infrastructure for airship operations; for example, the mooring masts used at Cardington, Ismalia, Karachi and Montreal had to be designed and built, and the meteorological forecasting network extended and improved.

Specifications for the airships were drawn up by an Air Ministry committee, whose members included Squadron Leader Reginald Colmore and Lieutenant-Colonel V.C. Richmond, both of whom had extensive experience with airships, most of them non-rigid. They called for airships of not less than five million cubic feet (140,000 m³) capacity and a fixed structural weight not to exceed 90 tons, giving a &quot;disposable lift&quot; of nearly 62 tons. With the necessary allowance of about 20 tons for the service load consisting of a crew of approximately 40, as well as stores and water ballast, this allowed a possible fuel and passenger load of 42 tons. Accommodation for 100 passengers and tankage for 57 hours&#x27; flight was to be provided, and a sustainable cruise speed of and maximum speed of were called for. In wartime, the airships would be expected to carry 200 troops or possibly five parasite fighter aircraft.

Vickers&#x27; design team was led by Barnes Wallis, who had extensive experience of rigid airship design and later became famous for the geodetic framework of the Wellington bomber and for the bouncing bomb. His principal assistant (the &quot;Chief Calculator&quot;), Nevil Shute Norway, later well known as the novelist Nevil Shute, later gave his account of the design and construction of the two airships in his 1954 autobiography, &quot;Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer&quot;. Shute Norway&#x27;s book characterises R100 as a pragmatic and conservative design, and R101 as extravagant and overambitious, but one purpose of having two design teams was to test different approaches, with R101 deliberately intended to extend the limits of existing technology. Shute Norway later admitted that many of his criticisms of the R101 team were unjustified.

An extremely optimistic timetable was drawn up, with construction of the government-built R101 to begin in July 1925 and be complete by the following July, with a trial flight to India planned for January 1927. In the event, the extensive experimentation that was necessary delayed the start of construction of R101 until early 1927. R100 was also delayed, and neither flew until late 1929.

==Design and development==

The entire airship programme was under the direction of the Director of Airship Development, Group Captain Peregrine Fellowes, with Colmore acting as his deputy. Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond was appointed Director of Design: later he was credited as &quot;Assistant Director of Airship Development (Technical)&quot; with Squadron Leader Michael Rope as his assistant. The Director for Flying and Training, responsible for all operational matters for both airships, was Major G.H. Scott, who had developed the design of the mooring masts that were to be built. Work was based at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, Bedfordshire, which had been built by Short Brothers during the First World War and had been employed by the Admiralty to copy and improve on the latest German designs from captured rigid airships. The Works had been nationalised in 1919, but after the loss of the R38 (then in the process of being transferred to the US as ZR2), naval airship development was stopped and it had been placed on a care and maintenance basis.

R101 was to be built only after completion of an extensive research and test programme by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). As part of this programme, the Air Ministry funded the costs of refurbishing and flying R33 in order to gather data about structural loads and the airflow around a large airship. This data was also made available to Vickers; both airships had the same elongated tear-drop shape, unlike previous designs. Hilda Lyon, who was responsible for the aerodynamic development, found that this shape produced the minimum amount of drag. Safety was a primary concern and this would have an important influence on the choice of engines.
An early decision had been made to construct the primary structure largely from stainless steel rather than lightweight alloys such as duralumin. The design of the primary structure was shared between Cardington and the aircraft manufacturer Boulton and Paul, who had extensive experience in the use of steel and had developed innovative techniques for forming steel strip into structural sections. Working to an outline design prepared with the help of data supplied by the NPL, the stress calculations were performed by Cardington. This information was then supplied to J.D. North and his team at Boulton and Paul, who designed the metalwork. The individual girders were fabricated by Boulton and Paul in Norwich, and transported to Cardington where they were bolted together. This scheme for a prefabricated structure entailed demanding manufacturing tolerances and was entirely successful, as the ease with which R101 was eventually extended bears witness. Before any contracts for the metalwork were signed, an entire bay consisting of a pair of the 15-sided transverse ring frames and the connecting longitudinal girders was assembled at Cardington. After the assembly had passed loading tests, the individual girders were then tested to destruction. The structure of the airframe was innovative: the ring-shaped transverse frames of previous airships had been braced by radial wires meeting at a central hub, but no such bracing was used in R101, the frames being stiff enough in themselves. However, this resulted in the structure extending further into the envelope, thereby limiting the size of the gasbags.

The specifications drawn up in 1924 by the Committee for the Safety of Airships had based weight estimates on the then-existing rules for airframe strengths. However, the Air Ministry Inspectorate introduced a new set of rules for airship safety standards in late 1924 and compliance with these as-yet unformulated rules had been explicitly mentioned in the individual specifications for each airship. These new rules called for all lifting loads to be transmitted directly to the transverse frames rather than being taken via the longitudinal girders. The intention behind this ruling was to enable the stressing of the framework to be fully calculated, rather than relying on empirically accumulated data, as was contemporary practice at the Zeppelin design office. Apart from the implications for the airframe weight, one effect of these regulations was to force both teams to contrive a new system of harnessing the gasbags. R101&#x27;s patented &quot;parachute&quot; gasbag harnessing, designed by Michael Rope, proved less than satisfactory, permitting the bags to surge unduly, particularly in rough weather. This caused the gasbags to chafe against the structure, tearing holes in the fabric. Another effect was that both R100 and R101 had a relatively small number of longitudinal girders in order to simplify the stress calculations.

R101 used pre-doped linen panels for much of its covering, rather than lacing undoped fabric into place and then applying dope to shrink it. In order to reduce the area of unsupported fabric in the covering, the design alternated the main longitudinals with non-structural &quot;reefing booms&quot; mounted on kingposts which were adjustable using screw-jacks in order to tension the covering. The pre-doped fabric proved unsatisfactory from the start, with panels splitting because of humidity changes before the airship had even left its shed.

There were other innovative design features. Previously, ballast containers had been made in the form of leather &quot;trousers&quot;, and one or other leg could be opened at the bottom by a cable-release from the control car. In R101, the extreme forward and aft ballast bags were of this type, and were locally operated, but the main ballast was held in tanks connected by pipes so that ballast could be transferred from one to another to alter the airship&#x27;s trim using compressed air. The arrangement for ventilating the interior of the envelope, necessary both to prevent any build-up of escaped hydrogen and also to equalise pressure between the outside and inside, was also innovative. A series of flap-valves were situated at the nose and stern of the airship cover (those at the nose are clearly visible in photographs) to allow air to enter when the airship was descending, while a series of vents was arranged around the circumference amidships to allow air to exit during ascent.

===Engines===

Heavy oil (diesel) engines were specified by the Air Ministry because the airship was intended for use on the India route, where it was thought that high temperatures would make petrol an unacceptable fire hazard because of its low flash point. A petrol explosion had been a major cause of fatalities in the loss of R38 in 1921.

Initial calculations were based on the use of seven Beardmore Typhoon six-cylinder heavy-oil engines which were expected to weigh and deliver each. When the development of this engine proved impractical, the use of the eight-cylinder Beardmore Tornado was proposed instead. This was an engine being developed by Beardmore, combining two four-cylinder engines which had originally been developed for railway use. In March 1925 these were expected to weigh and deliver each. Because of the increased weight of each engine, it was decided to use five, resulting in overall power being reduced from to .

Severe torsional resonance of the crankshaft was encountered above 950 rpm, limiting the engine to a maximum of 935 rpm, giving an output of only with a continuous power rating at 890 rpm of . The engine was also considerably above estimated weight, at , over double the initial estimate. Some of this excess weight was the result of the failure to manufacture a satisfactory lightweight aluminium crankcase.

The original intention had been to fit two of the engines with variable-pitch propellers in order to provide reverse thrust for manoeuvring during docking. The torsional resonance caused the hollow metal blades of the reversing propellers to develop cracks near the hubs, and as a short-term measure, one of the engines was fitted with a fixed-pitch reverse propeller, consequently becoming dead weight under normal flight conditions. For the airship&#x27;s final flight, two of the engines were adapted to be capable of running in reverse by a simple modification of the camshaft.

Each engine car also contained a Ricardo petrol engine for use as a starter motor. Three of these also drove generators to provide electricity when the airship was at rest or flying at low speeds: at normal flight speeds the generators were driven by constant-speed variable-pitch windmills. The other two auxiliary engines drove compressors for the compressed air fuel and ballast transfer system. Before the final flight, one of the petrol engines was replaced by a Beverly heavy oil engine; to lessen the risk of fire, the petrol tanks could be jettisoned.

Diesel fuel was contained in tanks in the transverse frames, the majority of the tanks having a capacity of . A mechanism was provided for dumping fuel directly from the tanks in an emergency. By the use of tankage provided for weight compensation, when travelling with a light passenger load a total fuel load of could be carried.

===Crewing and control===
In normal service, R101 carried a crew of 42. This consisted of two watches of 13 men under the officer of the watch, this duty being divided among the three principal ship&#x27;s officers. In addition there were the chief navigator, the meteorological officer, the chief coxswain, the chief engineer, the chief wireless officer and the chief steward, who were not assigned to watches but were on duty as necessary, and four supernumeraries (three engineers and a radio operator) who were available to provide relief watch keeping if necessary, and an assistant steward, a cook and a galley boy who were on duty as required between 06:30 and 21:30. The minimum crew requirement, as specified in the airship&#x27;s Certificate of Airworthiness, was 15 men.

The control car was occupied by the duty officer of the watch and the steering and altitude coxswains, who respectively controlled the rudder and elevators using wheels similar to a ship&#x27;s wheel. The engines were individually controlled by an engineer in each of the engine cars, orders being given by an individual telegraph to each car. These moved an indicator in the engine car to signal the desired throttle setting and also rang a bell to draw attention to the fact that an order had been transmitted.

===Accommodation===
The passenger accommodation was spread over two decks within the envelope and as first designed included 50 passenger cabins for one, two, or four people, a dining room for 60 people, two promenade decks with windows down the sides of the airship, a spacious lounge of and an asbestos-lined smoking room for 24 people. Most of the passenger space was on the upper deck, with the smoking room, kitchen and washrooms, crew accommodation, as well as the chart room and radio cabin on the lower deck. The control car was immediately under the forward section of the lower deck and was reached by a ladder from the chart room.

Walls were made of doped linen painted in white and gold. Weight-saving measures included wicker furniture and aluminium cutlery. The promenade windows were lightweight &quot;Cellon&quot; instead of the intended glass, and one set was removed as part of later weight-saving measures.

==Operational history==
===Testing===
====1929====
The lengthy process of inflating the R101&#x27;s hydrogen gasbags began on 11 July 1929 and was complete by 21 September. With the airship now airborne and loosely tethered within the shed, it was now possible to carry out lift and trim trials. These were disappointing. A design conference held on 17 June 1929 had estimated a gross lift of 151.8 tons and a total airframe weight, including the power installation, of 105 tons. The actual figures proved to be a gross lift of 148.46 tons and a weight of 113.6 tons. Moreover, the airship was tail-heavy, a result of the tail surfaces being considerably above estimated weight. In this form, a flight to India was out of the question. Airship operations under tropical conditions were made more difficult by the loss of lift in high air temperatures: the loss of lift in Karachi (then part of British India) was estimated to be as much as 11 tons for an airship the size of R101.

On 2 October the press were invited to Cardington to view the finished airship. However, weather conditions made it impossible to take it out of the shed until 12 October, when it was walked out by a ground-handling party of 400. The event attracted a huge number of spectators, with surrounding roads a solid line of cars. The moored airship continued to attract spectators, and it was estimated that more than a million people had made the trip to Cardington to see R101 at the mast by the end of November.

The flying programme was influenced by the Air Ministry&#x27;s need to generate favourable publicity, illustrating the political pressures which weighed upon the programme. Noël Atherstone, the first officer, commented in his diary on 6 November: &quot;All these window-dressing stunts and joy-rides before she has got an Airworthiness Certificate are quite wrong, but there is no-one in the RAW [Royal Airship Works] executive who has got the guts to put their foot down and insist on trials being free of joy-rides&quot;. Atherstone&#x27;s remarks were occasioned by a lunch held on the airship for delegates to a conference on empire legislation, but there were several similar occasions.

R101 made its first flight on 14 October. After a short circuit over Bedford, course was set for London, where it passed over the Palace of Westminster, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the City, returning to Cardington after a flight lasting five hours 40 minutes. During this flight the servos were not used, without any difficulty being experienced in controlling the airship. A second flight lasting nine hours 38 minutes followed on 18 October, with Lord Thomson among the passengers, after which R101 was briefly returned to the shed to enable some modifications to be made to the starting engines. A third flight lasting seven hours 15 minutes was made on 1 November, during which it was flown at full power for the first time, recording a speed of : even at full speed it was not found necessary to use the control servos. During this flight, it circled over Sandringham House, observed by King George V and Queen Mary, flew on to the previous Secretary of State for Air&#x27;s country house near Cromer, then to Norwich over Boulton &amp; Paul&#x27;s works and aerodrome before returning by Newmarket and Cambridge. On 2 November the first night flight was made, slipping the mast at 20:12 before heading south to fly over London and Portsmouth before attempting a speed trial over a circuit over the Solent and the Isle of Wight. These trials were frustrated by pipe breakages in the cooling systems of two of the engines, a problem later solved by replacing the aluminium piping with copper. It returned to Cardington around 09:00, the mooring operation ending in a minor accident, damaging one of the reefing booms at the bow.

On 8 November, a short flight – purely for public relations purposes – was made, carrying 40 passengers, including the Mayor of Bedford and various officials. To accommodate this load, the airship was flown with only a partial fuel and ballast load and was inflated to a pressure height of . In Atherstone&#x27;s words, it &quot;staggered round the vicinity of Bedford for a couple of hours&quot; before returning to the mast.

Two days later, the wind began to rise and gales were forecast. On 11 November, the wind touched , with a maximum gust speed of . Although the ship&#x27;s behaviour at the mast gave cause for a good deal of satisfaction, there was nevertheless some cause for concern. The movement of the ship had caused considerable movement of the gasbags, the surging being described by Coxswain &quot;Sky&quot; Hunt as being around four inches (ten cm) from side to side and &quot;considerably more&quot; longitudinally. This caused the gasbags to foul the framework, and the resulting chafing caused the gasbags to be holed in many places.

A sixth flight was made on 14 November, to test the modifications that had been made to the cooling system and the repairs to the gasbags, carrying a load of 32 passengers, including 10 MPs with a special interest in aviation and a party of Air Ministry officials headed by Sir Sefton Brancker, the Director of Civil Aviation.

On 16 November, it had been planned to carry out a demonstration flight for a party of 100 MPs, a scheme that had been suggested by Lord Thomson in the expectation that few would wish to take advantage of the offer; in the event, it was oversubscribed. The weather on the day was unfavourable, and the flight was rescheduled. The weather then cleared, and on the following day, R101 slipped the mast at 10:33 to carry out an endurance trial, planned to last at least thirty hours. R101 passed over York and Durham before crossing the coast and flying over the North Sea as far north as Edinburgh, where it turned west towards Glasgow. During the night, a series of turning trials were made over the Irish Sea, after which the airship was flown south to fly over Dublin (the home town of R101&#x27;s Captain, Carmichael Irwin) before returning to Cardington via Anglesey and Chester. After some delay in finding Cardington owing to fog, R101 was secured to the mast at 17:14, after a flight lasting 30 hours 41 minutes. The only technical problem encountered during the flight was with the pump for transferring fuel, which broke down several times, although subsequent examination of the engines showed that one was on the point of suffering a failure of a big end bearing.

The flight for the MPs had been rescheduled for 23 November. With the barometric pressure low, R101 lacked sufficient lift to carry 100 passengers, even though all but a bare minimum of fuel was drained off and the ship lightened by removing all unnecessary stores. The flight was cancelled because of the weather, but not before the politicians had arrived at Cardington: they accordingly embarked and had lunch while the ship rode at the mast, only kept in the air by dynamic lift produced by the wind. Following this, R101 remained at the mast until 30 November, when the wind had dropped enough for it to be walked back into the shed.

While the initial flight trials were being carried out, the design team examined the lift problem. Studies identified possible weight savings of 3.16 tons. The weight-saving measures included deleting twelve of the double-berth cabins, removing the reefing booms from the nose to frame 1 and between frames 13 to 15 at the tail, replacing the glass windows of the observation decks with Cellon, removing two water ballast tanks, and removing the servo mechanism for the rudder and elevators. Letting the gasbags out would gain 3.18 tons extra lift, although Michael Rope considered this unwise, since there were thousands of exposed fixings protruding from the girders; chafing of the gasbags would have to be prevented by wrapping these in strips of cloth. To further increase lift, an extra bay of capacity could be installed. This would deliver an extra nine tons disposable lift. After much consultation, all these proposed measures were approved in December. Letting out the gasbags and the weight-saving measures were begun. Delivery by Boulton &amp; Paul of the metalwork for the extra bay was expected to take place in June.

====1930====

R101&#x27;s outer cover was also giving cause for concern. An inspection on 20 January 1930 by Michael Rope and J. W. W. Dyer, head of the Fabric Section at Cardington, revealed serious deterioration of the fabric on the top of the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add reinforcement bands along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope showed that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original specified strength for the cover was a breaking strain of 700 lb per foot run (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m), while the calculated load at a speed of was 143 lb per foot run (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed. An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new cover which would be doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show; for these flights, the cover would be further reinforced.

Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June, when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed, and shortly afterwards a split in the cover appeared on the starboard side of the airship. It was decided to repair this at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day, but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the Hendon Air Show could be made.

R101 made three flights in June, totalling 29 hours 34 minutes duration. On 26 June, a short proving flight was made, the controls – no longer servo-operated – being described as &quot;powerful and fully adequate&quot;. At the end of this flight, the R101 was found to be &quot;flying heavy&quot; and two tons of fuel oil had to be jettisoned in order to lighten the airship for mooring. This was initially attributed to changes in air temperature during the flight. On the following two days, R101 made two flights, the first to take part in the rehearsal for the RAF display at Hendon and the second to take part in the display itself. These flights revealed a problem with lift, considerable jettisoning of ballast being necessary. During this time, Atherstone was replaced by Captain G.F. Meager, who was normally the first officer on R100. Meager was &quot;alarmed&quot; by the heaviness of R101, as after 10 hours of flight, R100 would have been considerably light due to fuel consumption. Meager observed that it was the first time he had &quot;the wind up&quot; in an airship. He had dropped a ton of ballast, and in order to weigh off the R101 for mooring, Flight Lieutenant Irwin was required to dump 10 tons of water and fuel oil. An inspection of the gasbags revealed a large number of holes, a result of the letting-out of the gasbags which allowed them to foul projections on the girders of the framework.

When the gasbag restraints were loosened to allow more gas capacity (R101B) it came to the attention of Dr. Eckener. His concern was conveyed to Willy von Meister, the Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei representative in the United States, who was visiting Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at Lake Constance. Dr. Eckener was concerned that the gas bags would be holed by wearing upon the structure and loss of gas would occur. Von Meister stopped on his way back to the US to visit his mother, and met Lord Thomson to convey Dr. Eckener&#x27;s offer of technical help. Lord Thomson listened cordially, thanked von Meister, and informed him that padding was being installed which British designers felt would suffice.

Concern was also raised over the possibility of loss of gas through the valves, which were of an innovative design by Michael Rope. Airship valves are intended primarily to vent gas automatically if pressure in the cells rises to the point that the bag might rupture; they are also used to adjust lift for handling. It was suspected that valves could open when the airship rolled heavily or when flapping of the outer cover caused localised low pressure, but after an examination of their operation, F. W. McWade, the Air Inspectorate Department inspector at Cardington, concluded that their operation was satisfactory and they were not likely to have been the cause of any significant loss of gas.

As an experimental aircraft, R101 had been operating under a temporary &quot;Permit to Fly&quot;, the responsibility of McWade. On 3 July, bypassing his immediate superior, McWade wrote a letter to the Director of Aeronautical Inspection, Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. S. Outram, expressing his unwillingness to recommend either an extension to the permit or the granting of the full Certificate of Airworthiness which would be necessary before the airship could fly in the airspace of other countries. His concern was that the padding on the framework was inadequate to protect the gasbags from chafing, the harnessing having been let out so that they were &quot;hard up against the longitudinal girders&quot;, and that any surging of the gasbags would tend to loosen the padding, rendering it ineffective. He also expressed doubts about the use of padding, considering that it made inspection of the airframe more difficult and would also tend to trap moisture, making corrosion more likely. Outram, who knew little about airships, reacted to this by consulting Colmore, now Director of Airship Development, from whom he received a reassuring reply. The matter was taken no further.

R101 entered its shed for the extension on 29 June. At the same time, the gasbags were given a complete overhaul, two of the engines were replaced by the adapted engines capable of running in reverse, and most of the cover was replaced. The original cover was left in place between frames 3 and 5 and in two of the bays at the tail. These parts of the cover had been doped after fitting and were therefore thought to be satisfactory, even though an inspection by McWade had found that some areas where reinforcements had been stuck on with a rubber solution were seriously weakened; these areas were further reinforced, using dope as an adhesive.

A schedule was drawn up by the Air Ministry for R101 to undertake the flight to India in early October, to coincide with the Imperial Conference which was to be held in London. The entire programme was intended to improve communication with the Empire, and it was hoped that the flight would generate favourable publicity for the airship programme. The final trial flight of R101 was originally scheduled for 26 September 1930, but high winds delayed the move from the shed until 1 October. That evening, R101 slipped the mast for its only trial flight before setting off for India. This lasted 16 hours 51 minutes and was undertaken under near-ideal weather conditions; because of the failure of the oil cooler in one engine, it was not possible to carry out full-speed trials. The flight was curtailed in order to prepare the airship for the flight to India.

Despite the lack of full endurance and speed trials, and the fact that a proper investigation of the aerodynamic consequences of the extension had not been fully completed by the NPL, a Certificate of Airworthiness was issued on 2 October, the Inspectorate expressing their complete satisfaction with the condition of R101 and the standards to which the remedial work had been carried out. The certificate was handed over to H. C. Irwin, the ship&#x27;s captain, on the day of its flight to India.

==Final flight==

R101 departed from Cardington on the evening of 4 October 1930 for its intended destination of Karachi, via a refuelling stop at Ismaïlia in Egypt, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Carmichael Irwin. Passengers included Lord Thomson, Secretary of State for Air; Air Vice Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker, Director of Civil Aviation; Squadron Leader William Palstra, RAAF Air Liaison Officer to the British Air Ministry; and Director of Airship Development, Reginald Colmore. Representing the designers were Lt. Col. V. C. Richmond and Michael Rope.

The weather forecast on the morning of 4 October was generally favourable, predicting south to south-westerly winds of between 20 and 30 m.p.h. (32 and 48 km/h) at over northern France, with conditions improving over southern France and the Mediterranean. Although the mid-day forecast indicated some deterioration in the situation, this was not considered to be alarming enough to cancel the planned voyage. A course was plotted which would take R101 over London, Paris and Toulouse, crossing the French coast near Narbonne.

Fine rain was beginning to fall when, at dusk, with all the crew and passengers aboard, R101 readied for departure. Under the illuminating spotlights, the jettisoning of water ballast to bring the airship into trim was clearly visible. Squadron Leader Booth, the commander of R100, was watching the departure from the tower&#x27;s observation gallery and estimated that two tons had been discharged from the nose and a further ton from the midships tanks. R101 cast off from the mast at 18:36 GMT to a cheer from the crowd which had gathered to witness the event, gently backed from the tower, and, as another ton of ballast was jettisoned, the engines were opened up to about half power and the airship slowly began to climb away, initially heading northeast to fly over Bedford before making a 180° turn to port to pass north of Cardington.

At about 19:06, the duty engineer in the aft engine car reported an apparent oil pressure problem. At 19:16, he shut the engine down, and after a short discussion with the chief engineer, work began to replace the oil gauge, since there was nothing apparently wrong with the engine. With one engine stopped, airspeed was reduced by around to 

At 19:19, having flown but still only from Cardington, a course was set for London. At 20:01, R101, by now over Potters Bar, made its second report to Cardington, confirming the intention to proceed via London, Paris and Narbonne, but making no mention of the engine problem. By that point, the weather had deteriorated, and it was raining heavily. Flying around above the ground, the airship passed over Alexandra Palace before changing course slightly at the landmark clock tower of the Metropolitan Cattle Market north of Islington, and thence over Shoreditch to cross the Thames in the vicinity of the Isle of Dogs, passing over the Royal Naval College at Greenwich at 20:28. The airship&#x27;s progress, flying with its nose pointing some 30 degrees to the right of its track, was observed by many who braved the rain to watch it pass overhead.

An update of the meteorological situation was received at 20:40. The forecast had deteriorated severely, south-westerly winds of up to with low cloud and rain being predicted for northern France, and similar conditions over central France. That this caused concern on board is demonstrated by the request for more detailed information, which was transmitted at 21:19, by which time R101 was near Hawkhurst, Kent. It is possible that an alternative course was being considered. At 21:35, R101 crossed the English coast near Hastings and at 21:40 transmitted a progress report back to Cardington, mentioning that recovery of rainwater into the ballast tanks was taking place but again not reporting the engine problem. At 22:56 the aft engine was restarted. By now the wind had risen to about with strong gusts, but a further meteorological report received shortly after the airship had crossed the coast had been encouraging about weather conditions south of Paris.

The French coast was crossed at the Point de St Quentin at 23:36 GMT, around east of the intended landfall. A new course was set to bring R101 over Orly, based on an estimated wind direction of 245 degrees and speed of . The intended course would have taken R101 four miles west of Beauvais, but the estimated wind speed and direction were inaccurate, as a result of which the R101&#x27;s track was to the east of its intended course. This error would have become apparent when, at about 01:00, R101 passed over Poix-de-Picardie, a distinctive hilltop town that would have been readily recognisable to the navigation officer, Squadron Leader E. L. Johnston. Accordingly, R101 changed course: the new course would take it directly over the Beauvais Ridge, an area notorious for turbulent wind conditions.
At 02:00 the watch was changed, Second Officer Maurice Steff taking over the command from Irwin. R101 was at this point &quot;flying heavy&quot;, relying on dynamic lift generated by forward airspeed to maintain altitude, estimated by the Board of Inquiry as at least above the ground. At about 02:07, R101 went into a dive from which it slowly recovered, probably losing around . As it did so, Rigger S. Church, who was returning to the crew quarters to come off duty, was sent forward to release the forward emergency ballast bags, which were locally controlled. This first dive was steep enough to cause A. H. Leech, the foreman engineer from Cardington, to be thrown from his seat in the smoking room and to wake Chief Electrician Arthur Disley, who was dozing in the switch room next to the chart cabin. As the airship recovered, Disley was roused by Chief Coxswain G. W. Hunt, who then went to the crew quarters, calling out, &quot;We&#x27;re down, lads&quot; in warning. At the same time, the airship went into a second dive and orders to reduce speed to slow (450 rpm) were received in the engine cars. Before Engineer A. J. Cook, on duty in the left-hand midships engine car, could respond, the airship hit the ground at the edge of a wood outside Allonne, southeast of Beauvais, and immediately caught fire. The reason for the order to reduce speed is a matter for conjecture because this would have caused the airship to lose dynamic lift and adopt a nose-down attitude. The subsequent inquiry estimated the impact speed at around , with the airship between 15° and 25° nose down.

Forty-six of the fifty-four passengers and crew were killed immediately. Church and Rigger W. G. Radcliffe survived the crash but later died in hospital in Beauvais, bringing the total of dead to forty-eight. Of the six eventual survivors, four (including Cook) were engineers in the engine cars outside the hull; Leech and Disley were the only survivors from within the main cabin.

=== Memorials ===
In what was described as &quot;French homage to Britain&#x27;s dead in the great airship R101 disaster&quot;, the dead crew and passengers were transported on artillery caissons through Beauvais past several thousand onlookers, with an escort of Spahi cavalry. 

The bodies were then returned to the UK, and on Friday 10 October a memorial service took place at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral while the bodies lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Nearly 90,000 people queued to pay their respects: at one time the queue was half a mile long, and the hall was kept open until 00:35 to admit them all. The following day, a funeral procession transferred the bodies to Euston station through streets crowded with mourners. The bodies were then taken to Cardington village for burial in a common grave in the cemetery of St Mary&#x27;s Church. A monument was later erected, and the scorched Royal Air Force roundel which R101 had flown on its tail is on display, along with a memorial tablet, in the church&#x27;s nave. On 1 October 1933, the Sunday before the third anniversary of the crash, a memorial to the dead near the crash site was unveiled by the side of Route nationale 1 near Allonne. There is also a memorial marker on the actual crash site.

The Church of the Holy Family and St Michael, a Roman Catholic church in Kesgrave, Suffolk, was built in 1931 in memory of Squadron Leader Michael Rope, who was a Catholic. Suspended from the nave roof is a model of R101.

==Official inquiry==

The Court of Inquiry was led by the Liberal politician Sir John Simon, assisted by Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore-Brabazon and Professor C. E. Inglis. The inquiry, held in public, opened on 28 October and spent 10 days taking evidence from witnesses, including Professor Leonard Bairstow and Dr. Hugo Eckener of the Zeppelin company, before adjourning in order to allow Bairstow and the NPL to perform more detailed calculations based on wind-tunnel tests on a specially made model of R101 in its final form. This evidence was presented over three days ending on 5 December 1930. The final report was presented on 27 March 1931.

The inquiry examined most aspects of the design and construction of R101 in detail, with particular emphasis on the gasbags and the associated harnessing and valves, although very little examination of the problems that had been encountered with the cover was made. All the technical witnesses provided unhesitating endorsement of the airworthiness of the airship prior to its flight to India. An examination was also made of the various operational decisions that had been made before the airship undertook its final voyage.
The possibility of the crash having been the result of a prolonged loss of gas caused by leakage or loss through the valves was discounted since this explanation did not explain the airship&#x27;s behaviour during its last moments: moreover the fact that the officers on duty had changed watch routinely implied that there had been no particular cause for alarm a few minutes before the crash. The recent change of watch was considered to be a possible contributory factor to the accident, since the new crew would not have had time to get the feel of the airship. It was also considered most unlikely that the accident had been solely caused by a sudden downdraught. A sudden and catastrophic failure was seen as the only explanation. The inquiry discounted the possibility of structural failure of the airframe. The only major fracture found in the wreckage was at the rear of the new framework extension but it was considered that this had either occurred on impact or more probably been caused by the intense heat of the subsequent fire. The inquiry came to the conclusion that a tear had probably developed in the forward cover, this in turn causing one or more of the forward gasbags to fail. Evidence presented by Professor Bairstow showed that this would cause the R101 to become too nose-heavy for the elevators to correct. The want of sufficient altitude was considered by the R101 Enquiry and must be considered given that the aircraft was flying in an area of reducing atmospheric pressure. The same evening, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; at Frankfurt was reading 400 feet high. A similar error over France would have put the R101 400 feet lower than her intended height. The altimeter could have been corrected while flying across the channel by timing the flare drop before ignition, but over France there was no way to determine altimeter correction. Sightings by observers reporting very low altitudes across France and the belief by the crew that they were at a safe altitude according to the altimeter could both be true. The question of sufficient altitude was considered by the R101 Enquiry but not the attendant issue of altimeter correction.

The cause of the fire was not established. Several hydrogen airships had crashed in similar circumstances without catching fire. The inquiry thought that it was most probable that a spark from the airship&#x27;s electrics had ignited escaping hydrogen, causing an explosion. Other suggestions put forward included the ignition of the calcium flares carried in the control car on contact with water, electrostatic discharge or a fire in one of the engine cars, which carried petrol for the starter engines. All that is certain is that it caught fire almost at once and burned fiercely. In the extreme heat, the fuel oil from the wreck soaked into the ground and caught fire; it was still burning when the first party of officials arrived by air the next day.

The inquiry considered that it was &quot;impossible to avoid the conclusion that the R101 would not have started for India on the evening of October 4th if it had not been that matters of public policy were considered as making it highly desirable that she should do so&quot;, but considered this to be the result of all concerned being eager to prove the worth of R101, rather than direct interference from above.

==Aftermath==
The crash of R101 ended British interest in dirigibles during the pre-war period. Thos W Ward Ltd of Sheffield salvaged what they could of the wreckage, the work continuing through 1931. Although it was stipulated that none of the wreckage should be kept for souvenirs, Wards made small dishes impressed with the words &quot;Metal from R101&quot;, as they frequently did with the metal from ships or industrial structures on which they had worked.

The Zeppelin Company purchased five tons of duralumin from the wreck. The airship&#x27;s competitor, R100, despite a more successful development programme and a satisfactory, although not entirely trouble-free, transatlantic trial flight to Canada and back, was grounded immediately after the R101 crash. For over a year, the R100 remained in its hangar at Cardington whilst the fate of the Imperial Airship programme was decided. In December 1931, the R100 was broken up and sold for scrap.

At the time, the Imperial Airship Scheme was a controversial project because of the large sums of public money involved and because some doubted the utility of airships. Subsequently, there has been controversy about the R101&#x27;s merits. The extremely poor relationship between the R100 team and both Cardington and the Air Ministry created a climate of resentment and jealousy that may have rankled. Nevil Shute Norway&#x27;s autobiography was serialised by the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot; on its publication in 1954 and was misleadingly promoted as containing sensational revelations, and the accuracy of his account is a cause of contention among airship historians. Barnes Wallis later expressed scathing criticism of the design although they may in part reflect personal animosities. Nevertheless, his listing of Richmond&#x27;s &quot;overweening vanity&quot; as a major cause of the debacle and the fact that he had not designed it as another say little for his objectivity.

On 27 November 2014, 84 years after the disaster, Baroness Smith of Basildon, together with members of the Airship Heritage Trust, unveiled a memorial plaque to the R101 in St Stephens Hall in the Palace of Westminster.

<text>Bruce MacLeish Dern (born June 4, 1936) is an American actor. He has received several accolades, including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor and the Silver Bear for Best Actor. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978) and the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Nebraska&quot; (2013). He is also a BAFTA Award, two-time Genie Award, and three-time Golden Globe Award nominee.

A member of the Actors Studio, he rose to prominence during the New Hollywood era through roles in films such as &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967), &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), &quot;The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; (1972). Other notable films include &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; (1973), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974), &quot;Posse&quot; (1975), &quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976), &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977), &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978), &quot;Tattoo&quot; (1981), &quot;That Championship Season&quot; (1982), &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; (1989), &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (1996), &quot;Monster&quot; (2003), &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; (2005), &quot;Chappaquiddick&quot; (2017), and &quot;Emperor&quot; (2020). He played Frank Harlow in the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot; (2006–2011).

He is the father of actress Laura Dern.

==Early life==
Dern was born in Chicago on June 4, 1936, the son of Jean (née MacLeish; 1908–1972) and John Dern (1903–1958), a utility chief and attorney. He grew up in Kenilworth, Illinois. His paternal grandfather, George Dern, was a Utah governor and Secretary of War (he was serving in the latter position during the time of Bruce&#x27;s birth). Dern&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Vice President of the Carson, Pirie and Scott stores, which were established by his own father, Scottish-born businessman Andrew MacLeish. Dern&#x27;s maternal granduncles were poet Archibald MacLeish and Naval aviator Kenneth MacLeish. His godfather was governor and two-time presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson II. Dern graduated from New Trier High School, where he was a track star and sought to qualify for the Olympic Trials in 1956. Dern then attended the University of Pennsylvania, but dropped out after two years.

==Career==

Dern studied at the Actors Studio, alongside Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. He starred with Lyle Kessler in the Philadelphia premiere of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, and starred with Paul Newman and Geraldine Page in the original Broadway run of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;.

In the 1960s, Dern played the sailor in a few flashbacks in &quot;Marnie&quot; and a murdered lover in &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;. He played a murderous rustler in &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;, a gunfighter in &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot;, and an impoverished farmer in the film adaptation of Horace McCoy&#x27;s novel &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;.

In Mark Rydell&#x27;s western film &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, he played a cattle thief who kills a rancher (John Wayne). Dern had a leading role in the ecological science-fiction film &quot;Silent Running&quot; and co-starred with Jack Nicholson in &quot;The King of Marvin Gardens&quot;. Dern played Tom Buchanan in the film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974). In Kirk Douglas&#x27; Revisionist Western film &quot;Posse&quot;, Dern played a train-robber who uses his wiles to turn the tables on his captor, an ambitious, politically minded marshal. Dern starred in the beauty pageant satire film &quot;Smile&quot;, and in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final film &quot;Family Plot&quot;. He played a detective on the trail of a getaway driver (Ryan O&#x27;Neal) in the neo-noir film &quot;The Driver&quot;. In John Frankenheimer&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, Dern played a vengeful Vietnam War veteran and Goodyear Blimp pilot who launches a massive terrorist attack at the Super Bowl. Dern played another Vietnam veteran and the disturbed husband of a perplexed woman (Jane Fonda) in Hal Ashby&#x27;s war film &quot;Coming Home&quot;, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In Bob Brooks&#x27; erotic thriller film &quot;Tattoo&quot;, Dern played an increasingly-deranged tattoo artist who imprisons a fashion model (Maud Adams). The film was dogged by controversy throughout its post-production and pre-release phase - the film&#x27;s release was delayed by nearly a year - and for his lead performance, Dern was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. However, he bounced back by winning the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival for his performance in Jason Miller&#x27;s &quot;That Championship Season&quot; (1982).

Over the next few decades, Dern played a Vietnam veteran and neighborhood survivalist in Joe Dante&#x27;s suburban satire &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;, a local crime boss in Michael Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Diggstown&quot;, a rival of Wild Bill Hickok in Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, and George Spahn in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. Dern&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Said, But Probably Shouldn&#x27;t Have: An Unrepentant Memoir&quot;, was published in 2007.

In Alexander Payne&#x27;s film &quot;Nebraska&quot;, Dern played a resident believing he has won a million dollars, and undertakes a road trip from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to get the prize. He won the Best Actor Award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

===Directors and craft===
In the course of his long and prolific career, Dern collaborated with film directors, including Walter Hill (&quot;The Driver&quot;, &quot;Wild Bill&quot; and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;), Joe Dante (&quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;, &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; and &quot;The Hole&quot;), and Quentin Tarantino (&quot;Django Unchained&quot;, &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;). In an interview for The A.V. Club, Dern said: &quot;I always say that I feel like I&#x27;ve worked for six geniuses in my career... And the six directors, not in any order, would be Mr. Kazan, Mr. Hitchcock, Douglas Trumbull, Alexander Payne, Quentin Tarantino, and Francis Coppola.&quot; In an interview with Josh Olson and Joe Dante for the podcast series &quot;The Movies That Made Me&quot;, and while discussing his career, Dern cited the films of David Lean (specifically, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;), as among the films that inspired him. When asked if he has ever contemplated retirement, Dern said: &quot;If you think I&#x27;m gonna retire so Jimmy fucking Caan can get another part from me, you&#x27;re dead wrong. Because I&#x27;m gonna go till I&#x27;m 100. My goal is to do stuff with older characters that people never got the chance to do, because they never lived long enough... And because I don&#x27;t have anything else I can do.&quot;

==Personal life==
Dern was married to Marie Dawn Pierce from 1957 to 1959. He married Diane Ladd in 1960. Their first daughter died from head injuries after falling into a swimming pool in 1962. The couple&#x27;s second daughter is actress Laura Dern. After his divorce from Ladd, Dern married Andrea Beckett in 1969, and they have stayed married.

<text>Airwolf is an American action military drama television series. It centers on a high-technology attack helicopter, code-named &quot;Airwolf&quot;, and its crew. They undertake various exotic missions, many involving espionage, with a Cold War theme. It was created by Donald P. Bellisario and was produced over four seasons, running from January 22, 1984, until August 7, 1987.

The main cast for the first three seasons is Jan-Michael Vincent, Ernest Borgnine, Alex Cord, Deborah Pratt (who left after season two when her husband Bellisario left the series), and Jean Bruce Scott (who became a regular in seasons two and three). The program originally aired on CBS and was cancelled after the third season. USA Network picked up the show for a fourth season that was completely recast, with Jan-Michael Vincent having only a minor role in the first episode. The fourth season was filmed in Canada, with the aerial scenes relying heavily on stock footage or repeated footage from the first three seasons.

The distinctive musical score was originally orchestral, shifted to more synthesizer-based arrangements early in the second season, and was composed and conducted mainly by Sylvester Levay. Udi Harpaz conducted the scores for many later second- and third-season episodes.

==Plot==

The fictional &quot;Airwolf&quot; is an advanced prototype supersonic helicopter with stealth capabilities and a formidable arsenal. &quot;Airwolf&quot; was designed by Charles Henry Moffet (David Hemmings)—a genius with a psychopathic taste for torturing and killing women—and built by the Firm, a division of the Central Intelligence Agency (a play on the term &quot;the Company&quot;, a nickname for the CIA). Moffet and his crew steal &quot;Airwolf&quot; during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm&#x27;s bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (codenamed Archangel). Moffet takes &quot;Airwolf&quot; to Libya, for acts of aggression such as sinking an American destroyer, as a service for Khaddafi, in exchange for giving Moffet sanctuary on Libyan soil.

Archangel recruits the reclusive Stringfellow Hawke (Vincent), a former test pilot during the development of &quot;Airwolf&quot;, to recover the gunship. Archangel leaves his assistant Gabrielle Ademaur (Belinda Bauer)—who becomes Hawke&#x27;s love interest—at Hawke&#x27;s cabin to brief him for his mission. One week later, after an undercover operative in Libya is killed in the line of duty, Gabrielle is sent in undercover and Hawke is sent in sooner than originally planned. With the assistance of pilot and father figure Dominic Santini (Borgnine), Hawke finds and recovers &quot;Airwolf&quot;, but Gabrielle is tortured and killed by Moffet. Hawke obliterates Moffet with a hail of missiles from &quot;Airwolf&quot; before returning to the United States. Instead of returning the gunship, Hawke and Santini booby-trap &quot;Airwolf&quot; and hide it in &quot;the Lair&quot;, a large natural cave in the remote &quot;Valley of the Gods&quot; (actually filmed in visually similar Monument Valley). Hawke refuses to return &quot;Airwolf&quot; until the Firm can find and recover his brother, St. John (Christopher Connelly), who has been missing in action since the Vietnam War. To obtain access to &quot;Airwolf&quot;, Archangel offers Hawke protection from other government agencies who might try to recover &quot;Airwolf&quot;; in return, Hawke and Santini must fly missions of national importance for the Firm.

The Firm, during the first three seasons, serve as both ally and enemy for Hawke and Santini; when an opportunity to seize &quot;Airwolf&quot; arises, Firm operatives often take it. The first season of the series is dark, arc-driven, and quite reflective of the contemporary Cold War, with the Firm personnel distinctly dressed in white, implicitly boasting that &quot;wearing white hats&quot; distinguished them as good instead of evil. Hawke remains unconvinced, and Santini is skeptical. Early episodes detail the efforts of the United States government to recover &quot;Airwolf&quot; from Hawke, who is officially charged with having stolen it. Because CBS wanted to make the series more family-oriented, the program was transformed during season two into a more light-hearted show, with Hawke and Santini portrayed as cooperative partners with the Firm. This persisted into the fourth season with the newly introduced &quot;Company&quot; and the new crew of &quot;Airwolf&quot;.

==Production==
The series ran for 55 episodes on CBS in the United States in 1984 through 1986, and an additional 24 episodes, with a new cast and production company, aired on the USA Network in 1987, for a total of 79 episodes. A reedited version (produced in Germany) of the first episode was also released on home video in the UK and several other countries; it received a theatrical release in Indonesia. The show was broadcast in several international markets. Parts of the series were filmed in Monument Valley, Utah.

===&quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; connection===
Creator Donald P. Bellisario first toyed with the idea of the adventures of an ace combat pilot in a third-season episode of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; titled &quot;Two Birds of a Feather&quot; (1983), starring William Lucking, which, in turn, was inspired by several episodes of Bellisario&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; — &quot;Legends Are Forever&quot; and &quot;Honor Thy Brother&quot; (1982) — in which Lucking had played a similar character. The &quot;Magnum&quot; episode was intended as a backdoor pilot, but a series was not commissioned. Bellisario heavily reworked the idea, and the final result was &quot;Airwolf&quot;.

===Seasons 2 and 3===
To improve ratings, the studio wanted to add a regular female character and jettison the dark and moody tales of international espionage. This was accomplished at the start of the second season with the addition of Caitlin O&#x27;Shannessy (Jean Bruce Scott) and new stories that were domestic and more action oriented. These changes proved unsuccessful, however, and while production costs remained high, creator Bellisario left both the studio and the series after Season 2. Bellisario&#x27;s then-wife, Deborah Pratt, also left at that time (she was nearly three months pregnant with their daughter, Troian, as Season 2 drew to a close). Series star Jan-Michael Vincent&#x27;s problems with alcoholism also contributed to the show&#x27;s problems. Bernard Kowalski stepped in as executive producer for the third season, but the ratings remained low and the series was cancelled by CBS.

===Season 4===
The USA Network funded a fourth season in 1987, to be produced in Canada by Atlantis and The Arthur Company (owned by Arthur L. Annecharico) in association with MCA. This was intended to increase the number of episodes to make the show eligible for broadcast syndication. The original cast was written out of the fourth season: Jan-Michael Vincent appears in a first transitional episode; a body double for Ernest Borgnine seen only from the back represented Santini, who was killed off in an explosion; Archangel was said to have suddenly been assigned overseas. &quot;The Firm&quot; was replaced by &quot;the Company&quot;; no mention was made of Caitlin. Stringfellow&#x27;s brother-in-law St. John Hawke, (now played by Barry Van Dyke), was suddenly revealed to be alive, having been working for many years as a deep undercover agent for American intelligence, contradicting characterizations in the previous three seasons. St. John replaced Stringfellow as the central character. Production moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on a reduced budget that was less than one-third of the original CBS budget. The production crew no longer had access to the original &quot;Airwolf&quot; helicopter, and all in-flight shots were recycled from earlier seasons; the original full-size studio mockup was re-dressed and used for all interior shots. Actress Michele Scarabelli, who played Jo Santini, said in a &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine interview that all 24 scripts were in place before the cast arrived, leaving the actors little room to develop their characters.

==&quot;Airwolf&quot; helicopter==

The flight-capable &quot;Airwolf&quot; helicopter was a cosmetically modified Bell 222, serial number 47085, sometimes unofficially called a Bell 222A. During filming of the series, the helicopter was owned by Jetcopters, Inc. of Van Nuys, California. The helicopter was eventually sold after the show ended and became an ambulance helicopter in Germany, where it crashed in a thunderstorm and was destroyed on June 6, 1992, killing all three crew members. Andrew Probert designed the Airwolf uniform insignia patch worn by the flight crew members, a snarling bat-winged wolf&#x27;s head wearing a sheepskin.

==Music==
&quot;Airwolf Themes&quot; is a two-CD soundtrack album for the television series released in February, 1999. The 73-minute soundtrack was created over a five-year period by a fan, Northern Ireland-based graphic designer Mark J. Cairns, in collaboration with original composer Levay, with a foreword by the series&#x27; creator, Bellisario.

After the original CBS series was cancelled in 1986, Cairns headed the International Airwolf Appreciation Association for nearly 10 years (1988–1998). He decided in early 1994 to produce his own high-quality soundtrack for the series using the episodic scores from the three seasons of the series to create the first 22 synthesizer-based tracks on the soundtrack, including various medleys and character themes. Only one thousand copies were made.

The first digital download-only EP release, titled &quot;Airwolf Main Themes&quot; was made available in September 2009. It contains four tracks based on variations of the series&#x27; Main Theme and was a preview of the future Extended Themes release.

A further 42-track, 146-minute, enhanced two-CD, limited-edition soundtrack album release called &quot;Airwolf Extended Themes&quot; (containing both a CD of the series&#x27; main theme variants, and a second CD of the episodic themes) was released on March 26, 2014. Bulgarian-Polish musician, Jan Michal Szulew, was the main arranger and orchestrator on the first CD, and Mark J. Cairns the arranger and overall producer of the second CD on this soundtrack. Two thousand copies were made.

==Books==
During the original series run, two books were published. Both were written by Ron Renauld and are titled &quot;Airwolf&quot; and &quot;Trouble From Within&quot;, respectively. A graphic novel was published in August 2015, titled &quot;Airwolf Airstrikes&quot;, which recasts Archangel as a woman, and Dominic Santini&#x27;s son, who is black.

==Merchandise==
* &quot;Airwolf Themes: 2CD Special Limited Edition&quot; (arrangement closely based on the original TV soundtrack)
* &quot;Airwolf: The Wonderweapon&quot; (German CD soundtrack)
* Airwolf Replica Helmet (fully functioning)
* Models of the &quot;Airwolf&quot; helicopter

A series of tie-in novels was printed by Star, adapted from the scripts of various episodes, and coloring books for children (printed in the UK by World Publishing), and a UK annual, which, though produced in 1985 (to cover 1986), was based around the first season. For several years, the children&#x27;s TV comic magazine &quot;Look-In&quot; ran an &quot;Airwolf&quot; comic strip to tie in with the original UK broadcast of the series.

===Video games===
* &quot;Airwolf&quot; (Commodore 64, Commodore 16), published by Elite. There were unrealized plans to rename the European-produced &quot;Airwolf&quot; C64 game as &quot;Fort Apocalypse 2&quot;.
* &quot;Airwolf&quot; (Amstrad CPC), published by Elite, popular in Europe.
* &quot;Airwolf&quot; (ZX Spectrum), published by Elite, popular in the UK and Europe.

==Home media==
Universal Studios has released the first 3 seasons of &quot;Airwolf&quot; on DVD in regions 1, 2, and 4. Earlier releases consisted of single episodes on VHS (double episodes in the UK and some countries, edited together into &quot;movie&quot; format; later in the UK, a selection of first and second season episodes were released by Playback on both VHS and DVD), including a United Kingdom 18 certificate cut of the pilot episode, presented as a standalone film (reshuffling and reworking many scenes, and removing much of the continuity ties with the following series, as well as incorporating footage from the first-season episode &quot;Mad Over Miami&quot;, and with profanity that was not present in the aired version).

Season 4 was released in Region 1 on February 1, 2011.

On September 6, 2011, Shout! Factory released &quot;Airwolf: The Movie&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. This single-disc set features the two-hour pilot tele-film fully restored and uncensored. It also contains special features including a new interview with Ernest Borgnine.

On March 8, 2016, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series and would release &quot;Airwolf - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time on May 3, 2016. They also re-released the first season on DVD on the same day.

Fabulous Films have released an all-new, High Definition Series 1–3 Blu-ray (Region B) box-set for the UK market during April 2014. The new HD transfers were created by Universal Studios.

Fabulous Films have since released single season Blu-ray (Region B) box sets, plus the equivalent DVD (Region 2) season box sets including, for the first time, a Canadian &quot;Airwolf&quot; II Season 4 set from the newly restored prints.

<text>The Marijuana-Logues is an Off-Broadway comedy show in New York City. Arj Barker, Doug Benson and Tony Camin are the creators and performers. It is a four-man stand-up comedy show, with the majority of the humor centered on the drug marijuana. The show&#x27;s title is a play on the long-running Broadway show &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; The show began its run in March 2004. There is also an original cast recording released in 2004 by Comedy Central, and a book. When the show toured, actor Tommy Chong became part of the tour for two cities. His legal concerns, including that audience members were actually smoking marijuana at some of the shows early in its tour, and pressure from his probation officer ultimately caused him to leave the show.

<text>A ( , ; ), sometimes called a maneater, Mata Hari, or vamp, is a stock character of a mysterious, beautiful, and seductive woman whose charms ensnare her lovers, often leading them into compromising, deadly traps. She is an archetype of literature and art. Her ability to enchant, entice and hypnotize her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as verging on supernatural; hence, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, witch, having power over men. Femmes fatales are typically villainous, or at least morally ambiguous, and always associated with a sense of mystification, and unease.

The term originates from the French phrase &quot;femme fatale&quot;, which means &#x27;deadly woman&#x27; or &#x27;lethal woman&#x27;. A &quot;femme fatale&quot; tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, or sexual allure. In many cases, her attitude towards sexuality is , intriguing, or frivolous. In some cases, she uses lies or coercion rather than charm. She may also make use of some subduing weapon such as sleeping gas, a modern analog of magical powers in older tales. She may also be (or imply that she is) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape.

In early 20th-century American films, a &quot;femme fatale&quot; character was referred to as a &quot;vamp&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Vampire&quot;, Philip Burne-Jones&#x27;s 1897 painting, and Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s later 1897 poem, and the 1909 play and 1915 film &quot;A Fool There Was&quot;.

Female mobsters (including Italian-American Mafia or Russian Mafia) have been portrayed as femmes fatales in films noir. Femmes fatales appear in James Bond films.

==History==
===Ancient archetypes===
The &quot;femme fatale&quot; archetype exists in the culture, folklore and myths of many cultures. Ancient mythical or legendary examples include Inanna, Lilith, Circe, Medea, Clytemnestra, Lesbia, Tamamo no Mae, and Visha Kanyas. Historical examples from classical times include Cleopatra and Messalina, as well as the biblical figures Delilah, Jezebel, and Salome. An example from Chinese literature and traditional history is Daji.

===Early Western culture to the 19th century===
The &quot;femme fatale&quot; was a common figure in the European Middle Ages, often portraying the dangers of unbridled female sexuality. The pre-medieval inherited biblical figure of Eve offers an example, as does the wicked, seductive enchantress typified in Morgan le Fay. The Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; shows her more muted presence during the Age of Enlightenment.

The &quot;femme fatale&quot; flourished in the Romantic period in the works of John Keats, notably &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; and &quot;Lamia&quot;. Along with them, there rose the gothic novel &quot;The Monk&quot; by Matthew Gregory Lewis, featuring Matilda, a very powerful &quot;femme fatale&quot;. This led to her appearing in the work of Edgar Allan Poe, and as the vampire, notably in &quot;Carmilla&quot; and &quot;Brides of Dracula&quot;. &quot;The Monk&quot; was greatly admired by the Marquis de Sade, for whom the &quot;femme fatale&quot; symbolised not evil, but all the best qualities of women; his novel &quot;Juliette&quot; is perhaps the earliest wherein the &quot;femme fatale&quot; triumphs. Pre-Raphaelite painters frequently used the classic personifications of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; as a subject.
In the Western culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; became a more fashionable trope, and she is found in the paintings of the artists Edvard Munch, Gustav Klimt, Franz von Stuck, and Gustave Moreau. The novel &quot;À rebours&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans includes these fevered imaginings about an image of Salome in a Moreau painting:

In 1891, Oscar Wilde, in his play &quot;Salome&quot;: she manipulates her lust-crazed stepfather, King Herod, with her enticing Dance of the Seven Veils (Wilde&#x27;s invention) to agree to her imperious demand: &quot;bring me the head of John the Baptist&quot;. Later, Salome was the subject of an opera by Strauss, and was popularized on stage, screen, and peep show booths in countless incarnations.

She also is seen as a prominent figure in late 19th- and 20th-century opera, appearing in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; (Kundry), Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Samson et Delilah&quot; and Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; (based on the plays &quot;Erdgeist&quot; and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; by Frank Wedekind).

Other considerably famous &quot;femmes fatales&quot; include Isabella of France, Hedda Gabler of Kristiania (now Oslo), Marie Antoinette of Austria, and, most famously, Lucrezia Borgia.

=== 20th-century genres ===
==== Early 20th century ====
Mrs Patrick Campbell, George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;second famed platonic love affair&quot;, (she published some of his letters) and Philip Burne-Jones&#x27;s lover and subject of his 1897 painting, &quot;The Vampire&quot;, inspired Burne-Jones&#x27;s cousin Rudyard Kipling to write his poem &quot;The Vampire&quot;, in the year Dracula was published. The poem, which began: &quot;A fool there was ...&quot;, inspired Porter Emerson Browne to write the play, &quot;A Fool There Was&quot;.

The poem was adapted to become a 1909 Broadway production. This was followed by The 1913 film &quot;The Vampire&quot; by Robert Vignola, containing a &quot;vamp&quot; dance. Protagonist Alice Hollister was publicised as &quot;the original vampire&quot;. The 1915 film, &quot;A Fool There Was&quot;, starring Theda Bara, as &quot;The Vamp&quot; followed. The short poem may have been used in the publicity for the 1915 film. 1910s American slang for &quot;femme fatale&quot; was &quot;vamp&quot;, for &quot;vampire&quot;.

Another icon is Margaretha Geertruida Zelle. While working as an exotic dancer, she took the stage name Mata Hari. She was accused of German espionage during World War I and was put to death by a French firing squad. After her death she became the subject of many sensational films and books.

Femmes fatales appear in detective fiction, especially in its &#x27;hard-boiled&#x27; sub-genre which largely originated with the crime stories of Dashiell Hammett in the 1920s. At the end of that decade, the French-Canadian villainess Marie de Sabrevois gave a contemporary edge to the otherwise historical novels of Kenneth Roberts set during the American Revolution.

Film villainess often appeared foreign, often of Eastern European or Asian ancestry. They were a contrast to the wholesome personas of actresses such as Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford. Notable silent-cinema vamps include Theda Bara, Helen Gardner, Louise Glaum, Valeska Suratt, Musidora, Virginia Pearson, Olga Petrova, Rosemary Theby, Nita Naldi, Pola Negri, Estelle Taylor, Jetta Goudal, and, in early appearances, Myrna Loy.

==== Classic film noir era ====

During the era of classic film-noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; flourished in American cinema. The archetypal &quot;femme fatale&quot; is Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck (who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role) in the 1944 film &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. This character is considered one of the best &quot;femme fatale&quot; roles in film noir history. The character was ranked as the #8 film villain of the first 100 years of American cinema by the American Film Institute in the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains. In a classical film noir trope, she manipulates a man into killing her husband for financial gain.

Other examples of &quot;femme fatale&quot; include Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy, portrayed by Mary Astor, who murders Sam Spade&#x27;s partner in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941); manipulative narcissistic daughter Veda (portrayed by Ann Blyth) in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; who exploits her indulgent mother Mildred (portrayed by Joan Crawford) and fatally destroys her mother&#x27;s remarriage to stepfather Monte Barragon (portrayed by Zachary Scott); Gene Tierney as Ellen Brent Harland in &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), and the cabaret singer portrayed by Rita Hayworth in &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), narcissistic wives who manipulate their husbands; Ava Gardner in &quot;The Killers&quot; and Cora (Lana Turner) in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, based on novels by Ernest Hemingway and James M. Cain respectively, manipulate men into killing their husbands. In the Hitchcock film &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947), Alida Valli&#x27;s character causes the deaths of two men and the near destruction of another. Another frequently cited example is the character Jane played by Lizabeth Scott in &quot;Too Late for Tears&quot; (1949); during her quest to keep some dirty money from its rightful recipient and her husband, she uses poison, lies, sexual teasing and a gun to keep men wrapped around her finger. Jane Greer remains notable as a murderous &quot;femme fatale&quot; using her wiles on Robert Mitchum in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947). In &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950), the &quot;femme fatale&quot; lures a man into a life of crime. In Hitchcock&#x27;s 1940 film and Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, the eponymous &quot;femme fatale&quot; completely dominates the plot, even though she is already dead and we never see an image of her. &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; Natasha Fatale, a curvaceous spy, takes her name from the &quot;femme fatale&quot; stock character. &quot;Blonde Ice&quot; (1948) features a female serial killer who murders several men.

==== 1980s to the present ====

The &quot;femme fatale&quot; has carried on to the present day, in films such as &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) and &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985) – both with Kathleen Turner, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) with Sean Young, &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983) with Catherine Deneuve, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) with Isabella Rossellini, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987) with Glenn Close, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) with Sharon Stone, &quot;Damage&quot; (1992) with Juliette Binoche, &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992) with Kim Basinger, &quot;Dream Lover&quot; (1993) with Madchen Amick, &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; (1994) with Linda Fiorentino, &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995) with Nicole Kidman, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997) with Patricia Arquette, &quot;Devil in the Flesh&quot; (1998) and &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; (1999), both with Rose McGowan, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999) with Sarah Michelle Gellar, &quot;Original Sin&quot; (2001) with Angelina Jolie, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002) with Rebecca Romijn, and &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; (2009) with Megan Fox. In 2013, Tania Raymonde played the title role in &quot;Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret&quot;. In 2014, Eva Green portrayed a &quot;femme fatale&quot; in &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; and Rosamund Pike starred in &quot;Gone Girl&quot;. In &quot;Babylon&quot; (2022), Margot Robbie plays character with &quot;femme fatale&quot; tendencies.

Academy Award-winning actress Marion Cotillard has frequently played femmes fatales, in such films as &quot;A Private Affair&quot; (2002), &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;, &quot;The Black Box&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Nicole Kidman has also played a few femmes fatales in films as &quot;To Die For&quot;, &quot;The Paperboy&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and &quot;The Northman&quot;.

The archetype is also abundantly found in American television. One of the most famous femmes fatales of American television is Sherilyn Fenn&#x27;s Audrey Horne of the David Lynch cult series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In the TV series &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;, actress Tanit Phoenix played Lilith, the host who introduced each episode Rod Serling-style and occasionally appeared within the narrative. In the Netflix TV series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, actress Laura Prepon played Alex Vause, a modern &quot;femme fatale&quot;, who led both men and women to their destruction.

Femmes fatales appear frequently in comic books. Notable examples include Batman&#x27;s long-time nemesis Catwoman, who first appeared in comics in 1940, and various adversaries of The Spirit, such as P&#x27;Gell.

This stock character is also often found in the genres of opera and musical theatre, where she will traditionally have a mezzo, alto or contralto range, opposed to the ingénue&#x27;s soprano, to symbolize the masculinity and lack of feminine purity. An example is Hélène from &quot;Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812&quot;.

==Use in criminal trials==
The term has been used by the media in connection with highly publicised criminal trials, such as the trials of Jodi Arias and Amanda Knox.

<doc id="299108" wikidata="Q1806136" url="?curid=299108" title="Tuor and Idril">
<text>Tuor Eladar and Idril Celebrindal are fictional characters from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. They are the parents of Eärendil the Mariner and grandparents of Elrond Half-elven: through their progeny, they become the ancestors of the Númenóreans and of the King of the Reunited Kingdom Aragorn Elessar. Both characters play a pivotal role in &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, one of Tolkien&#x27;s earliest stories; it formed the basis for a section in his later work, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and was expanded as a standalone publication in 2018.

Tuor and Idril&#x27;s marriage was one of only three between Men and Elves in Tolkien&#x27;s writings. Scholars have compared Tuor to Odysseus in Greek mythology, and to Aeneas in Roman mythology, while Idril&#x27;s story has been likened to those of Cassandra and of Helen of Troy.

== Fictional history ==

Tuor Eladar, also known as Ulmondil (&quot;The Blessed of Ulmo&quot;), is the central character of &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;. He is a great hero of the Third House of Men in the First Age of Middle-earth, the only son of Huor and Rían and the cousin of the ill-fated Túrin Turambar. Huor is killed covering the retreat of Turgon, King of Gondolin, in the Battle of Tears Unnumbered, the &quot;Nírnaeth Arnoediad&quot;. Rían, having received no news of her husband, becomes distraught and wanders into the wild. She is taken care of by the local Grey-elves, and before the end of the year she bears a son and calls him Tuor. But she delivers him to the care of the Elves and departs, dying upon the lonely green grave-mound, the Hill of the Slain, at the site of the Battle of Tears Unnumbered.

Tuor is fostered by the Elves in the caves of Androth in the Mountains of Mithrim, in the Hithlum region of Beleriand, living a hard and wary life. When Tuor is sixteen their leader Annael decides to leave, but during the march his people are scattered. Tuor is captured by the Easterlings, Men who had been sent there by the Dark Lord Morgoth and who had cruelly oppressed the few people left there. After three years of thraldom under Lorgan the Easterling, Tuor escapes and returns to the caves.

For four years he lives as an outlaw, seeing no way of escape from the region of Dor-lómin, which is bordered by mountains. He kills many of the Easterlings that he comes upon during his journeys, and his name is feared. Meanwhile, the godlike Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, hears of Tuor&#x27;s plight and chooses Tuor to bear a message of warning to Turgon, Lord of the Hidden City of Gondolin. By Ulmo&#x27;s power a spring near Tuor&#x27;s cave overflows, and following the stream Tuor crosses Dor-lómin to the mountains of Ered Lómin. Under the guidance of two Elves sent there by Ulmo, Gelmir and Arminas, he passes through the ancient Gate of the Noldor into the land of Nevrast, becoming the first Man to reach the shore of the Great Sea, Belegaer. From there he is led by seven swans, arriving at last at Turgon&#x27;s old dwellings at Vinyamar.

Tuor finds arms and armour in the ruins of Vinyamar, and meets Ulmo himself on the seashore. Ulmo appoints Tuor to be his messenger, and tells him to seek King Turgon in Gondolin. He gives Tuor the Elf Voronwë as his guide. Voronwë leads Tuor along the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin, and they catch a brief glimpse of Tuor&#x27;s cousin Túrin near the Pools of Ivrin, the only time the paths of the two ever cross. Journeying through the harsh winter, they reach the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor tells Turgon of Ulmo&#x27;s warning that Morgoth now knows of Gondolin&#x27;s existence, and is about to destroy it, but Turgon refuses to abandon the city.
Tuor remains in the city and falls in love with Turgon&#x27;s only child, Idril Celebrindal, whose mother Elenwë died crossing the northern ice during the Elves&#x27; return from Valinor. In contrast to the first union of Elves and Men, that between Lúthien and Beren, Tuor and Idril are allowed to marry without difficulty. Their wedding is celebrated with great mirth and joy, as King Turgon had grown fond of Tuor. He makes Tuor the leader of the House of the Swan Wing, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin. Turgon also remembers the last words of Huor, which prophesied that a &quot;star&quot; would arise out of his and Turgon&#x27;s lineage which would redeem the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men) from Morgoth. However, the marriage angers Turgon&#x27;s influential nephew Maeglin, who had desired Idril for himself. Maeglin defies Turgon&#x27;s order to stay within the mountains, and is captured by Orcs during a trip to gather resources. Morgoth promises Maeglin both Gondolin and Idril in return for telling him where the hidden city is. Noticing that Maeglin is behaving suspiciously, Idril decides to construct a secret passage out of Gondolin.

During the ensuing sack of Gondolin, Tuor defends Idril and their only child Eärendil from Orcs and the traitorous Maeglin, who threatens to murder the child by throwing him from the city wall. After killing Maeglin, they lead a remnant of the people of Gondolin to escape through the secret passage. In the mountain heights they meet a Balrog, which Glorfindel, chief of the House of the Golden Flower, fights and defeats. They reach the estuary of the Mouths of Sirion; Tuor and his people live there for a while, also founding a town on the Isle of Balar. 

Longing for the Sea, Tuor builds the ship &quot;Eärramë&quot; (&quot;Sea-wing&quot;). He and Idril sail to the West; the Elves and Men of Beleriand believe that the two of them arrived in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar that prohibited mortals from entering the Undying Lands, and that Tuor alone of Men is allowed to be treated as an Elf. Eärendil inherits the Elfstone Elessar from Idril; it is a magical green gem which bestows healing powers on those who touch it. The Elfstone is passed down to their descendant Aragorn by the end of the Third Age, as narrated in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; when he becomes king, he takes the name Elessar.

== Concept and creation ==

The story of Tuor and Idril is told briefly in the 23rd chapter of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, which recounts the fall of the Noldor city of Gondolin. A very early version, written circa 1916–17, is found in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;. The start of a more complete and developed narrative, which Tolkien began after finishing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the 1950s, is included in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. However, the narrative gets no further than Tuor&#x27;s first sight of Gondolin. 

In the original &quot;Fall of Gondolin&quot; story, Tuor is said to have carried an axe named &quot;Dramborleg&quot;, &quot;Thudder-Sharp&quot;, that &quot;smote both a heavy dint as of a club and cleft as a sword&quot;. Later writings state that the Axe of Tuor is preserved in Númenor as an heirloom of the Kings.

== Analysis ==

=== Tuor ===

Scholars have stated that Tuor demonstrated wisdom by listening to his wife, whose wise counsel is her defining trait, whereas a leader of greater stature like Thingol, the Elvenking of Doriath, was brought low by his recklessness and pride. Jennifer Rogers writes in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; that Christopher Tolkien seamlessly introduces the story in his book &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; by providing short extracts of his father&#x27;s 1926 &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot; and &quot;The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor&quot;, thus setting &quot;Tuor&#x27;s story in the context of the Doom of Mandos and the Oath of Fëanor&quot;, in other words within the legendarium. The Tolkien scholar Linda Greenwood notes that Tuor is the only mortal Man in the legendarium permitted to live as an immortal. Tolkien suggests an explanation in a letter, namely that Eru Ilúvatar, the One God, directly intervenes as a unique exception, just as in Lúthien&#x27;s assumption of a mortal fate.

David Greenman, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, compares Tuor both with the Hobbit heroes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and with classical heroes:

Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth writes in his book &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s Worlds&quot; that the windswept treeless hills of Nevrast, where Tuor reaches the cliffs and becomes the first Man to see the sea in the legendarium, are &quot;perfectly Cornish&quot;. Garth notes that Tuor stands there at sunset with his arms outspread until the sea-Vala Ulmo appears from the water to prophesy the birth of Tuor&#x27;s son Eärendil, who ends up with a Silmaril in the sky as the Evening Star. The German artist Jenny Dolfen has painted the scene in her 2019 &quot;And His Heart Was Filled With Longing&quot; as a Cornish landscape, with Tuor surrounded by seagulls. Garth states that this means that the Evening Star was not in the western sky that Tuor saw, whereas when Tolkien visited the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall in 1914, the planet had risen and set &quot;due west&quot;, an uncommon sight. A few weeks later, Tolkien wrote the first poem of his legendarium, &quot;The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star&quot;.

=== Idril ===

The Tolkien scholar Melanie Rawls identifies Idril as a female character with agency in Tolkien&#x27;s works: she is shown to be capable of taking action once she has achieved understanding. Idril counsels her father, Turgon, who &quot;is very masculine and in need of a feminine counterpart&quot;, in his rule of Gondolin. Rawls states, too, that Idril is a &quot;well-balanced personality&quot;, and that Tuor, who combines masculine (warrior) and feminine (counsellor) qualities, &quot;matches her well&quot;. In &quot;Tor.com&quot;″s series on the people of Middle-earth, Megan N. Fontenot praises the characterisation of Idril&#x27;s wisdom and forbearance as told in the story of the Fall of Gondolin. In Fontenot&#x27;s view, Idril&#x27;s story represents &quot;a significant milestone in Tolkien&#x27;s storytelling career&quot;, as she saw in it many echoes of several other female characters of Middle-earth.

Greenman compares and contrasts Idril&#x27;s part in the story to Cassandra and Helen of Troy, two prominent female figures in accounts of the Trojan War: like the prophetess, Idril had a premonition of impending danger and like Helen, her beauty played a major role in instigating Maeglin&#x27;s betrayal of Gondolin, which ultimately led to its downfall and ruin. Conversely, Greeman notes that Idril&#x27;s advice to enact a contingency plan for a secret escape route out of Gondolin was heeded by her people, and that she had always rejected Maeglin&#x27;s advances and remained faithful to Tuor.

In Tolkien&#x27;s fictional language of Sindarin, the name Idril is a form of the Quenya name &quot;Itarillë&quot;, &quot;Itarildë&quot;, or &quot;Itaril&quot;, meaning &quot;sparkling brilliance&quot;. The epithet &quot;Celebrindal&quot; means &quot;Silverfoot&quot;: according to the early &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot; (the first version of the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; from 1926), she was so named &quot;for the whiteness of her foot; and she walked and danced ever unshod in the white ways and green lawns of Gondolin.&quot; Tolkien describes her thus in this text: &quot;Very fair and tall was she, well nigh of warrior&#x27;s stature, and her hair was a fountain of gold.&quot; Christopher Tolkien comments that this description may be the prototype of that of Galadriel. The account is present in the earliest form of the story &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, in which &quot;the people called her Idril of the Silver Feet in that she went ever barefoot and bareheaded, king&#x27;s daughter as she was, save only at pomps of the Ainur&quot;; then she is called &quot;Talceleb&quot; or &quot;Taltelepta&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

Tolkien suspected that his fellow writer and friend C.S. Lewis had borrowed his ideas; he felt that the characters of Tor and Tinidril in Lewis&#x27; &quot;Perelandra&quot; or &quot;Voyage to Venus&quot;, published by The Bodley Head in 1943, had a &quot;certain echo of Tuor and Idril&quot;, and that Tinidril in particular was a pastiche of both Idril and Tinúviel, an earlier version of his Lúthien character.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, Idril was supposed to be the original owner of the sword Hadhafang, an original invention by the affiliated production company Weta Workshop. It is wielded by Idril&#x27;s descendants Elrond and Arwen in certain scenes of both &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series.

<text>The African Democratic Rally (&quot;Rassemblement Démocratique Africain&quot;) is a political party in Burkina Faso. It was originally known as the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) and was formed in 1957 as the Voltaic section of the African Democratic Rally (RDA).

Soon after Independence from France in 1960, UDV-RDA became the only legal political party in Upper Volta and a civilian dictatorship was set up. In 1966, there was a military coup to overthrow the government, and the UDV-RDA didn&#x27;t exist in the new government. Under the rule of Sangoulé Lamizana UDV-RDA was reconstructed and developed good relations with the government. The relation to Lamizana did however cause internal dissent. The pro-Lamizana faction was led by Prime Minister Joseph Conombo and the anti-Lamizana faction was led by Joseph Ouédrago.

At the time of the presidential and legislative elections 1978 UDV-RDA had one list for legislative but the different factions supported different presidential candidates. The party officially supported Lamizana&#x27;s candidature. The dissidents, grouped as the &#x27;Rejectors Front-RDA&#x27; (&quot;Front du Réfus-RDA&quot;) supported the candidature of Joseph Ouédrago. After the elections this faction split away and joined the Voltaic Progressive Front of Joseph Ki-Zerbo.

After the elections Lamizana joined the party. The party was also joined by the National Union of Independents (UNI) and the African Regroupment Party (PRA), which lost their status as political parties following the elections (the 1977 Constitution limited the number of political parties to three, and PRA and UNI were the parties that came 4th and 5th, thus losing their legal status).

When Lamizana was overthrown in 1980, military rule was reinstituted, and the RDA never returned to power.

Nowadays it is part of the [[Alliance for Democracy and Federation-African Democratic Rally]] (&quot;Alliance pour la Démocratie et la Fédération-Rassemblement Démocratique Africain&quot;), the largest of the many opposition parties in Burkina Faso.

She appeared on many television shows in recurring and guest-starring roles, including &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, sitcoms like &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Cybill&quot;, and many more. She was also a regular on the first eight episodes of the Showtime run of &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, as Connie Lehman.

In 1999, Kaczmarek was cast to play Lois in the sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, which premiered on January 9, 2000. &quot;TV Guide&quot; dubbed her role in the series as a &quot;true breakout; a female Homer Simpson&quot;, and critics hailed her for her comic talents. Later, Kaczmarek would credit the show for bringing out her comedic side, saying, &quot;[Before &quot;Malcolm&quot;] I couldn&#x27;t even get auditions for comedies. I played very unfunny people.&quot;

In September 2008, she appeared on stage in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

On July 22, 2011, it was confirmed that Kaczmarek would make a vocal appearance as Red Jessica in the television series &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot; during its second season early 2012.

Kaczmarek was the narrator in the 2011 Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and PBS production of &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Nazi Resistance: The Mildred Fish-Harnack Story&quot;, a documentary about the life of fellow Milwaukee native Mildred Fish-Harnack who in 1943 was the only American woman to ever be personally sentenced to death by order of Adolf Hitler for her role in the German Nazi Resistance Movement.

In November 2012, she made a guest appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Middle&quot; as Frankie Heck&#x27;s (Patricia Heaton) dental teacher. In 2013, Kaczmarek guest starred on NBC&#x27;s long-running legal drama, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, as Suffolk County D.A. Pamela &quot;Pam&quot; James.

Kaczmarek and former &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; co-star Bryan Cranston reprised their roles as Lois and Hal respectively in an &quot;alternate ending&quot; featurette on the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; DVD/Blu-ray box set that was released on November 26, 2013. In it, Hal wakes up from the nightmare that was the plot of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, in a nod to the final scene from &quot;Newhart&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kaczmarek married fellow Wisconsin native and actor Bradley Whitford on August 15, 1992. They resided in Los Angeles with their three children. Both were active with charity, and were seen attending major award shows together. In June 2009, the couple filed for divorce after almost 17 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized in October 2010. According to a June 2009 magazine interview with More.com conducted prior to announcement of the divorce, she replied &quot;That&#x27;s a big no comment&quot; when asked to sum up her love life. She added that she used to believe that she could &quot;go it alone and as long as I had some fabulous boy on my arm, or man, and my career was sailing, that&#x27;s all I needed&quot; whereas she now had grown to appreciate the support of her girlfriends &quot;to talk about kids, to talk about marriages, to talk about just life&quot;. In 2010, they sold their 1924 villa in San Marino, California.

Kaczmarek underwent a hip replacement in April 2004, due to chronic arthritis. She recovered quickly, and used an X-ray of her new hip for her Emmy campaign the following summer, advertising herself as &quot;the only Emmy nominee with an artificial hip (except for Anthony LaPaglia)&quot;.

<text>An elevated passenger ropeway, or chairlift, is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel wire rope loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers. They are the primary on-hill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as &#x27;ski lifts&#x27;), but are also found at amusement parks and various tourist attractions.

Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency, a passenger ropeway can move up to 4,000 people per hour, and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to or . The two-person double chair, which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry, can move roughly 1,200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to . The four person detachable chairlift (&quot;high-speed quad&quot;) can transport 2,400 people per hour with an average rope speed of . Some bi- and tri-cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds.

==Design and function==
A chairlift consists of numerous components to provide safe efficient transport.

===Terminology===
At American ski areas, chairlifts are referred to with a ski industry vernacular. A one-person lift is a &quot;single&quot;, a two-person lift is a &quot;double&quot;, a three-person lift a &quot;triple&quot;, four-person lifts are &quot;quads&quot;, and a six-person lift is a &quot;six pack&quot;. If the lift is a detachable chairlift, it is typically referred to as a &quot;high-speed&quot; or &quot;express&quot; lift, which results in an &quot;express quad&quot; or &quot;high-speed six pack&quot;.

;rope speed: the speed in meters per second or feet per minute/second at which the rope moves
;[load] interval: the spacing between carriers, measured either by distance or time
;capacity: the number of passengers the lift transports per hour
;efficiency: the ratio of fully loaded carriers during peak operation, usually expressed as a percentage of &quot;capacity&quot;. Because fixed grip lifts move faster than detachables at load and unload, misloads (and missed unloads) are more frequent on fixed grips, and can reduce the efficiency as low as 80%.
;fixed grip: each carrier is fastened to a fixed point on the rope
;detachable grip: each carrier&#x27;s grip opens and closes during regular operation allowing detachment from the rope and travel slowly for load and unload. Detachable grips allow a greater rope speed to be used, usually twice that of a fixed grip chair, while simultaneously having slower loading and unloading sections. &quot;See detachable chairlift&quot;.

The capacity of a lift is constrained by the motive power (), the rope speed, the carrier spacing, the vertical displacement, and the number of carriers on the rope (a function of the rope length). Human passengers can load only so quickly until loading efficiency decreases; usually an interval of at least five seconds is needed.

===Rope===
The rope is the defining characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life.

Various techniques are used for constructing the rope. Dozens of wires are wound into a &quot;strand&quot;. Several strands are wound around a textile core, their twist oriented in the same or opposite direction as the individual wires; this is referred to as &quot;Lang lay&quot; and &quot;regular lay&quot; respectively.

Rope is constructed in a linear fashion, and must be spliced together before carriers are affixed. Splicing involves unwinding long sections of either end of the rope, and then winding each strand from opposing ends around the core. Sections of rope must be removed, as the strands overlap during the splicing process.

===Terminals and towers===
Every lift involves at least two terminals and may also have intermediate supporting towers. A bullwheel in each terminal redirects the rope, while sheaves (pulley assemblies) on the towers support the rope well above the ground. The number of towers is engineered based on the length and strength of the rope, worst case environmental conditions, and the type of terrain traversed. The bullwheel with the prime mover is called the &quot;drive bullwheel&quot;; the other is the &quot;return bullwheel&quot;. Chairlifts are usually electrically powered, often with Diesel or gasoline engine backup, and sometimes a hand crank tertiary backup. Drive terminals can be located either at the top or the bottom of an installation; though the top-drive configuration is more efficient, practicalities of electric service might dictate bottom-drive.

====Braking systems====
The drive terminal is also the location of a lift&#x27;s primary braking system. The service brake is located on the drive shaft beside the main drive, before the gearbox. The emergency brake acts directly on the bullwheel. While not technically a brake, an anti-rollback device (usually a cam) also acts on the bullwheel. This prevents the potentially disastrous situation of runaway reverse operation.

====Tensioning system====
The rope must be tensioned to compensate for sag caused by wind load and passenger weight, variations in rope length due to temperature and to maintain friction between the rope and the drive bullwheel. Tension is provided either by a counterweight system or by hydraulic or pneumatic rams, which adjust the position of the bullwheel carriage to maintain design tension. For most chairlifts, the tension is measured in tons.

===Prime mover and gearbox===

Either Diesel engines or electric motors can function as prime movers. The power can range from under 7.5 kW (10 hp) for the smallest of lifts, to more than 750 kW (1000 hp) for a long, swift, detachable eight-seat up a steep slope. DC electric motors and DC drives are the most common, though AC motors and AC drives are becoming economically competitive for certain smaller chairlift installations. DC drives are less expensive than AC variable-frequency drives and were used almost exclusively until the 21st century when costs of AC variable-frequency drive technology dropped. DC motors produce more starting torque than AC motors, so applications of AC motors on chairlifts is largely limited to smaller chairlift installations, otherwise the AC motor would need to be significantly oversized relative to the equivalent horsepower DC motor.

The driveshaft turns at high RPM, but with lower torque. The gearbox transforms high RPM/low torque rotation into a low RPM/high torque drive at the bullwheel. More power is able to pull heavier loads or sustain a higher rope speed (the power of a force is the rate at which it does work, and is given by the product of the driving force and the cable velocity) .

====Secondary and auxiliary movers====
In most localities, the prime mover is required to have a backup drive; this is usually provided by a Diesel engine that can operate during power outages. The purpose of the backup is to permit clearing the rope to ensure the safety of passengers; it usually is much less powerful and is not used for normal operation. The secondary drive connects with the drive shaft before the gear box, usually with a chain coupling.

Some chairlifts are also equipped with an auxiliary drive, to be used to continue regular operation in the event of a problem with the prime mover. Some lifts even have a hydrostatic coupling so the driveshaft of a snowcat can drive the chairlift.

===Carriers and grips===
Carriers are designed to seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 passengers. Each is connected to the cable with a steel cable grip that is either clamped onto or woven into the cable. Clamping systems use either a bolt system or coiled spring or magnets to provide clamping force. For maintenance or servicing, the carriers may be removed from or relocated along the rope by loosening the grip.

====Restraining bar====
Also called a &quot;retention bar&quot; or &quot;safety bar&quot;, these may help hold passengers in the chair in the same way as a safety bar in an amusement park ride. If equipped, each chair has a retractable bar, sometimes with attached foot rests. In most configurations, a passenger may reach up and behind their head, grab the bar or a handle, and pull the restraint forward and down. Once the bar has swung sufficiently, gravity assists positioning the bar to its down limit. Before disembarking, the bar must be swung up, out of the way.

The physics of a passenger sitting properly in a chairlift do not require use of a restraining bar. If the chairlift stops suddenly (as from use of the system emergency brake), the carrier&#x27;s arm connecting to the grip pivots smoothly forward—driven by the chair&#x27;s inertia—and maintains friction (and seating angle) between the seat and passenger. The restraining bar is useful for children—who do not fit comfortably into adult sized chairs—as well as apprehensive passengers, and for those who are disinclined or unable to sit still. In addition, restraining bars with footrests reduce muscle fatigue from supporting the weight of a snowboard or skis, especially during long lift rides. The restraining bar is also useful in very strong wind and when the chair is coated by ice.

Some ski areas mandate the use of safety bars on dangerous or windy lifts, with forfeiture of the lift ticket as a penalty. Vermont and Massachusetts state law also require the use of safety bars, as well as most Ontario and Quebec in Canada.

Restraining bars (often with foot rests) on chairlifts are more common in Europe and also naturally used by passengers of all ages. Some chairlifts have restraining bars that open and close automatically.

====Canopy====
Some lifts also have individual canopies which can be lowered to protect against inclement weather. The canopy, or bubble, is usually constructed of transparent acrylic glass or fiberglass. In most designs, passenger legs are unprotected; however in rain or strong wind this is considerably more comfortable than no canopy. Among more notable bubble lifts are the Ramcharger 8 at Big Sky Resort, North America&#x27;s first high speed eight pack; and the longest bubble lift in the world is the American Flyer high speed six pack at Copper Mountain.

===Control system===
To maintain safe operation, the chairlift&#x27;s control system monitors sensors and controls system parameters. Expected variances are compensated for; out-of-limit and dangerous conditions cause system shutdown. In the unusual instance of system shutdown, inspection by technicians, repair or evacuation might be needed. Both fixed and detachable lifts have sensors to monitor rope speed and hold it within established limits for each defined system operating speed. Also, the minimum and maximum rope tension, and speed feedback redundancy are monitored.

Many—if not most—installations have numerous safety sensors which detect rare but potentially hazardous situations, such as the rope coming out of an individual sheave.

Detachable chairlift control systems measure carrier grip tension during each detach and attach cycle, verify proper carrier spacing and verify correct movement of the detached carriers through the terminals.

===Safety systems===
Aerial lifts have a variety of mechanisms to ensure safe operation over a lifetime often measured in decades. In June 1990, Winter Park Resort performed planned destructive safety testing on &quot;Eskimo&quot;, a 1963 Riblet Tramway Company two-chair, center-pole fixed grip lift, as it was slated for removal and replacement with a high-speed quad Poma lift. The destructive testing attempted to mimic potential real-life operating scenarios, including tests for braking, rollback, oily rope, tree on line, fire, and tower pull. The data gleaned from this destructive safety testing helped improve the safety and construction of both existing as well as the next generation of chairlifts.

====Braking====
As mentioned above, there are multiple redundant braking systems. When a Normal Stop is activated from the control panel, the lift will be slowed and stopped using regenerative braking through the electric motor and the service brake located on the highspeed shaft between the gearbox and electric motor. When an Emergency Stop is activated all power is cut to the motor and the emergency brake or bull-wheel brake is activated. In the case of a rollback, some lifts utilize a ratchet like system to prevent the bull-wheel from spinning backwards while newer installations utilize sensors which activate one or more bull-wheel brakes. All braking systems are fail-safe in that a loss of power or hydraulic pressure will activate the brake. Older chairlifts, for example 1960s-era Riblet Tramway Company lifts, have a hydraulic release emergency brake with pressure maintained by a hydraulic solenoid. If the emergency brake/stop button is depressed by any control panel, the lift cannot be restarted until the hydraulic brake is hand-pumped to proper operating pressure.

====Brittle bars====

Some installations use &quot;brittle bars&quot; to detect several hazardous situations. Brittle bars alongside the sheaves detect the rope coming out of the track. They may also be placed to detect counterweight or hydraulic ram movement beyond safe parameters (sometimes called a &quot;brittle fork&quot; in this usage) and to detect detached carriers leaving the terminal&#x27;s track. If a brittle bar breaks, it interrupts a circuit which causes the system controller to immediately stop the system.

====Cable catcher====
These are small hooks sometimes installed next to sheaves to catch the rope and prevent it from falling if it should come out of the track. They are designed to allow passage of chair grips while the lift is stopping and for evacuation. It is extremely rare for the rope to leave the sheaves.

In May 2006, a cable escaped the sheaves on the Arthurs Seat, Victoria chairlift in Australia causing four chairs to crash into one another. No one was injured, though 13 passengers were stranded for four hours. The operator blamed mandated changes in the height of some towers to improve clearance over a road.

====Collision====
Passenger loading and unloading is supervised by lift operators. Their primary purpose is to ensure passenger safety by checking that passengers are suitably outfitted for the elements and not wearing or transporting items which could entangle chairs, towers, trees, etc. If a misload or missed unload occurs—or is imminent—they slow or stop the lift to prevent carriers from colliding with or dragging any person. Also, if the exit area becomes congested, they will slow or stop the chair until safe conditions are established.

====Communication====
The lift operators at the terminals of a chairlift communicate with each other to verify that all terminals are safe and ready when restarting the system. Communication is also used to warn of an arriving carrier with a passenger missing a ski, or otherwise unable to efficiently unload, such as patients being transported in a rescue toboggan. These uses are the chief purpose for a visible identification number on each carrier.

====Evacuation====

Aerial ropeways always have several backup systems in the event of failure of the prime mover. An additional electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine—even a hand crank—allows movement of the rope to eventually unload passengers. In the event of a failure which prevents rope movement, ski patrol may conduct emergency evacuation using a simple rope harness looped over the aerial ropeway to lower passengers to the ground one by one.

====Grounding====
A steel line strung alongside a mountain is likely to attract lightning strikes. To protect against that and electrostatic buildup, all components of the system are electrically bonded together and connected to one or many grounding systems connecting the lift system to earth ground. In areas subject to frequent electrical strikes, a protective aerial line is fixed above the aerial ropeway. A red sheave may indicate it is a grounding sheave.

====Load testing====

In most jurisdictions, chairlifts must be load inspected and tested periodically. The typical test consists of loading the uphill chairs with bags of water (secured in boxes) weighing more than the worst case passenger loading scenario. The system&#x27;s ability to start, stop, and forestall reverse operation are carefully evaluated against the system&#x27;s design parameters. Load testing a new lift is shown in a short video.

====Rope testing====
Frequent visual inspection of the rope is required in most jurisdictions, as well as periodic non-destructive testing. Electromagnetic induction testing detects and quantifies hidden adverse conditions within the strands such as a broken wire, pitting caused by corrosion or wear, variations in cross sectional area, and tightening or loosening of wire lay or strand lay.

====Safety gate====

If passengers fail to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or pass through a light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the safety gate, and initiate the lift restart procedure. While possibly annoying to other passengers on the chairlift, it is preferable to strike the safety gate—that is, it should not be avoided—and stop the lift than be an unexpected downhill passenger. Many lifts are limited in their download capacity; others can transport passengers at 100 percent capacity in either direction.

====Moving walkways====
The boarding area of a detachable chairlift can be fitted with a moving walkway which takes the passengers from the entrance gate to the boarding area. This ensures the correct, safe and quick boarding of all passengers. For fixed grip lifts, a walkway can be designed so that it moves at a slightly slower speed than the chairs: passengers stand on the moving walkway while their chair approaches, hence easing the boarding process since the relative speed of the chairlift will be slower.

==History==

Aerial passenger ropeways were known in Asia well before the 17th century for crossing chasms in mountainous regions. Men would traverse a woven fiber line hand over hand. Evolutionary refinement added a harness or basket to also transport cargo.

The first recorded mechanical ropeway was by Venetian Fausto Veranzio who designed a bicable passenger ropeway in 1616. The industry generally considers Dutchman Adam Wybe to have built the first operational system in 1644. The technology, which was further developed by the people living in the Alpine regions of Europe, progressed rapidly and expanded due to the advent of wire rope and electric drive. World War I motivated extensive use of military tramways for warfare between Italy and Austria.

===First chairlifts===
The world&#x27;s first three ski chairlifts were created for the ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho in 1936 and 1937, then owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The first chairlift, since removed, was installed on Proctor Mountain, two miles (3 km) east of the more famous Bald Mountain, the primary ski mountain of Sun Valley resort since 1939. One of the chairlifts still remains on Ruud Mountain, named for Thomas Ruud a famous Norwegian ski racer. The chairlift has been preserved with its ski jump and original single chairs as it was during WWII. The chairlift was developed by James Curran of Union Pacific&#x27;s engineering department in Omaha during the summer of 1936. Prior to working for Union Pacific, Curran worked for Paxton and Vierling Steel, also in Omaha, which engineered banana conveyor systems to load cargo ships in the tropics. (PVS manufactured these chairs in their Omaha, NE facility.) Curran re-engineered the banana hooks with chairs and created a machine with greater capacity than the up-ski toboggan (cable car) and better comfort than the J-bar, the two most common skier transports at the time—apart from mountain climbing. His basic design is still used for chairlifts today. The patent for the original ski lift was issued to Mr. Curran along with Gordon H. Bannerman and Glen H. Trout (Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific RR) in March 1939. The patent was titled &quot;Aerial Ski Tramway,&#x27;. W. Averell Harriman, Sun Valley&#x27;s creator and former governor of New York State, financed the project.

Mont Tremblant, Quebec opens in February 1938 with the first Canadian chairlift, built by Joseph Ryan. The ski lift had 4,200 feet of cable and took 250 skiers per hour.

The first chairlift in Europe was built in 1938 in Czechoslovakia (present-day Czech Republic), from Ráztoka, at , to Pustevny, at , in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range.

===Modern chairlifts===
New chairlifts built since the 1990s are infrequently fixed-grip. Existing fixed-grip lifts are being replaced with detachable chairlifts at most major ski areas. However the relative simplicity of the fixed-grip design results in lower installation, maintenance and, often, operation costs. For these reasons, they are likely to remain at low volume and community hills, and for short distances, such as beginner terrain.

<doc id="299121" wikidata="Q242596" url="?curid=299121" title="Malcolm in the Middle">
<text>Malcolm in the Middle is an American television sitcom created by Linwood Boomer for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series premiered on January 9, 2000, and ended on May 14, 2006, after seven seasons consisting of 151 episodes.

The single-camera series is a comedy that follows a dysfunctional working-class family and stars Frankie Muniz in the lead role as Malcolm, a child prodigy. The ensemble cast includes Jane Kaczmarek and Bryan Cranston as Malcolm&#x27;s parents, Lois and Hal. Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield, and Erik Per Sullivan appear as Malcolm&#x27;s brothers, Francis, Reese, and Dewey, respectively. Typical plots revolve around the family&#x27;s dysfunctional relationships and inability to fit into society, with Malcolm regularly making asides to the camera to comment on their failures. Another brother, Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez), was introduced as the fifth son of Hal and Lois at the end of season four.

&quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; was produced by Satin City and Regency Television in association with Fox Television Studios. The show has been syndicated worldwide, and received widespread critical acclaim and proved a popular draw for Fox. It is placed on several lists of the greatest TV and sitcom series of all time. It has won a Peabody Award, seven Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award and seven Golden Globe nominations. The show was influential as one of the first single-camera comedy series on TV without a live studio audience or laugh track. A four-episode revival is being produced for Disney+.

==Premise==
The series revolves around Malcolm (Frankie Muniz), who&#x27;s revealed in the first episode to be a genius with an IQ of 165, which places him in a class for gifted students (also known as &quot;Krelboynes&quot;), originally taught by Caroline Miller (Catherine Lloyd Burns). He is the third-born child in a comically dysfunctional family of four (later five) boys, 
of Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) and Hal (Bryan Cranston). As of the first season, their delinquent oldest child Francis (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) has been sent away to military school; while his brothers Reese (Justin Berfield) and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan) remain at home with Malcolm and their parents. With Francis away, Malcolm becomes the middle child of the family. In season four, the character Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez) was added to the show as the fifth son of Hal and Lois. The show&#x27;s early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an intellectual and enduring the eccentricities of family life.

Later seasons expanded the show&#x27;s scope by exploring the family&#x27;s interactions with their extended family, friends and colleagues in more depth, including Lois&#x27; tyrannical mother Ida (Cloris Leachman); Lois&#x27; hapless coworker at the Lucky Aide drugstore Craig Feldspar (David Anthony Higgins); Malcolm&#x27;s best friend Stevie Kenarban (Craig Lamar Traylor), who is both a wheelchair user and highly asthmatic; and Stevie&#x27;s dad Abe (Gary Anthony Williams), as well as a series of continuing subplots detailing Francis&#x27; misadventures at the military academy, from which he subsequently disenrolls to work in an Alaskan logging camp, before finally landing a job on a dude ranch run by an eccentric German couple.

The series differed significantly from the standard TV sitcom presentation commonplace at the time. Malcolm routinely broke the fourth wall by both narrating in voice-over and talking directly to the viewer on camera. The distinctive look and sound of the series relied heavily on elaborate post-production, including fast-cut editing, sound effects, musical inserts, the extensive use of locations, and the unusual camera styles, compositions and effects (e.g. overhead, tracking, hand-held and crane shots, and the frequent use of a wide-angle lens for both close-ups and ensemble scenes) that would be generally impractical or impossible to achieve in a standard studio-based video multi-camera sitcom production. The show employed neither a laugh track (which was standard in other TV sitcoms) nor a live studio audience. Emulating the style of hour-long dramas, this half-hour show was shot on film instead of on video.

Another distinctive aspect of the show is that the cold open of nearly every episode is unrelated to the main story. Exceptions include episodes which were the conclusions of &quot;two-parters&quot;; each part two episode opened with a recap of its part one episode.

The family&#x27;s surname is never mentioned directly in the series. Linwood Boomer&#x27;s script for the pilot episode originally included the surname Wilkerson, but it was later removed because he did not want to put &quot;any specific ethnic label on the characters&quot;. The surname appeared in early drafts of promotional material and also on Francis&#x27; Marlin Academy uniform in the pilot. In the last episode of the series, &quot;Graduation&quot;, Francis drops his ID badge from his new office job, which lists his name as &quot;Francis Nolastname&quot;. Also, in that same episode, the principal announces Malcolm as the speaker, mouthing &quot;Nolastname&quot; as his voice is drowned out by microphone feedback. A publicist for Fox said that &quot;officially the family&#x27;s last name should be considered a mystery&quot;.

== Characters ==

* Malcolm (played by Frankie Muniz) is the title character of the series. Malcolm is a genius with an IQ of 165 and a photographic memory. He is placed in a class for gifted students (or &quot;Krelboynes&quot; as they are known at the school). His high intelligence, as well as feelings of not fitting in, and a large ego fueled by a cruel streak of snarkiness cause numerous problems for him over the course of the series. As the title suggests, Malcolm is initially the middle child of the three living at home; chronologically, he is Hal&#x27;s and Lois&#x27; middle son born March 1988. Despite his intelligence, Malcolm is just as immature and destructive as his brothers and is often the ringleader in some of their schemes. Throughout the show, Malcolm often strives for independence away from his controlling mother and often tries to have her see him as an equal. Due to his intelligence, Lois often makes decisions that she feels will benefit his education while keeping a close eye on him. It is revealed in the series finale that she does this so that he will one day become the President of the United States and use his position to help lower-class families like their own. His best friend is Stevie Kenarban. In the series finale, he graduates from high school and starts attending Harvard University by both scholarship and working various jobs, specifically as a janitor.
* Lois (played by Jane Kaczmarek) is the family&#x27;s wildly hot-headed and stubborn mother who is also an intelligent and decisive woman. Most of her bullishness comes from her constant battles throughout the series to keep her badly behaved, highly destructive boys in check, while maintaining a menial job at a Lucky Aide drugstore, as well as her own difficult upbringing with a tyrannical mother and an indifferent father. Though she is hard on her children for their constantly bad behavior, Lois can be just as petty and spiteful as them, e.g., going after a group of girls that humiliated Reese before his senior prom. Despite her constant aggressiveness, she is motherly and will defend her family fiercely, especially against neighbors and others who view them as poor trash; in one episode, she finds that Malcolm and Reese discovered their neighbor having an affair with her Hispanic gardener while they planned to frame her son for theft, but does not punish them for their actions as this counted as revenge against the woman, who despised Lois. Lois is disliked by both Hal&#x27;s wealthy family and her own parents. She has a younger sister named Susan, who blames Lois for stealing Hal from her. Neighbors hate Lois and her sons and celebrate the weekends when they are gone. In the series finale, she discovered that she and Hal are expecting a sixth child.
* Hal (played by Bryan Cranston) is Lois&#x27; husband and father to Francis, Reese, Malcolm, Dewey and Jamie. Hal is a well-meaning, loving, but inept and completely immature father, and completely dependent on Lois, whom he loves absolutely. He comes from a wealthy family that does not accept Lois as his wife and who wish that he had married Susan instead. Because his family is disrespectful towards Lois, he rarely mentions them and avoids his family. Hal loves his boys and will sometimes sneak them out for fun father–son activities behind Lois&#x27; back. Hal is an indecisive character who frequently picks up new hobbies for short periods of time, such as speed walking or painting, and is irresponsible with the money he earns from his office job. His indecisiveness was explored in &quot;Living Will&quot; from a childhood which he had a hard time making decisions for himself and because of this, he always deferred to Lois to make them for him. In the series finale, he discovers that he and Lois are expecting a sixth child. Hal has a high sex drive, as revealed in the episode &quot;Forbidden Girlfriend&quot;, and it is mentioned in the episode &quot;Poker 2&quot; that he has sex 14 times per week. Hal&#x27;s best friend is Abe Kenarban.
* Francis (played by Christopher Kennedy Masterson) is Hal and Lois&#x27; oldest son born October 1984. At the beginning of the series, he is attending military school in Alabama, run by the strict Commandant Spangler (Daniel von Bargen). It is shown that his parents enjoyed a promising middle-class, comfortable lifestyle before he was born and that he was such a difficult, destructive child that their dream soon ended. He has himself legally emancipated at the start of season three, leaves the school, and travels to Alaska. He finds work at a logging camp and later meets and marries Piama (Emy Coligado), a girl of Inuit heritage. When the camp closes, they move to the western United States and take jobs at a Wild West–themed hotel/ranch, run by kindly but eccentric Germans: Otto Mannkusser (played by Kenneth Mars) and his wife, Gretchen (played by Meagen Fay). Francis and his mother have a mutual love–hate war of wills, and his main motivation in life is to thwart or irk her (though, ironically, he marries a woman with the same personality as Lois). Although a juvenile delinquent, he is streetwise. Francis is seen less frequently after season five, becoming a recurring character and making only a small handful of appearances in season six and season seven, which is the show&#x27;s final season. Francis&#x27; steady job disappears in season six due to legal issues until the series&#x27; finale, &quot;Graduation&quot;, reveals that he has been working for a few months in a stable tech company job entering data into computers. He admits to Hal that he likes his job, but also enjoys frustrating Lois by lying to her that he&#x27;s unemployed.
* Reese (played by Justin Berfield) is Hal and Lois&#x27; second son born April 1987. The older brother of Malcolm, Dewey and Jamie, and younger brother of Francis, Reese is the most impulsive and physical of the boys. Lacking common sense, he is frequently outwitted and outspoken by other family members, and is gleefully violent. Despite being dimwitted, Reese is able to devise plans thoroughly (although most of his plans tend to backfire), and is masterful at the rare tasks which can pin his drifting focus, such as driving, or cooking and baking (he&#x27;s revealed to be a culinary prodigy). In the series finale, he finally graduates from high school after intentionally failing many times before, obtains full employment as a high school custodian, and shares an apartment with Craig.
* Dewey (played by Erik Per Sullivan) is Hal and Lois&#x27; fourth son born September 1994. He is the youngest child until the birth of Jamie, and often falls victim to his brothers&#x27; pranks. Starting in season 4, Dewey is shown to be very intelligent and musically gifted as he begins teaching himself to play the piano. He has a very high tolerance for pain due to years of physical and mental abuse from his brothers. Dewey often resorts to Machiavellian schemes to one-up his brothers and parents. Despite his intelligence, he is placed in a remedial class for slower students (or &quot;Buseys&quot;) due to a misunderstanding. Dewey remains in the class and serves as their self-appointed teacher. By the seventh and final season of the show, the Busey class is no longer mentioned. He is the only sibling that eventually breaks the cycle of abusing the younger sibling, which ends up with him acting like a normal, lovable brother towards Jamie. In the series finale, he and Jamie are last seen hiding in the closet together after a prank, continuing their older brothers&#x27; tradition of incurring Lois&#x27; wrath.
* Caroline Miller (played by Catherine Lloyd Burns) Malcolm&#x27;s teacher (seasons 1–2).

==Episodes==

==Production==
===Development===
The pilot&#x27;s script was initially being developed by UPN until Regency Television became involved. It was planned for the 1998–99 television season. However, when UPN&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project waned, Gail Berman managed to rescue the pilot by bringing the project to Fox. The show was then moved to the 1999–2000 cycle where it was picked up by Fox.

===Opening title===
The show&#x27;s opening title features short clips from cult films or television shows, with earlier seasons being edited together with clips from the pilot and early episodes of the show. It was updated in season 4 to include clips from later seasons, set to the song &quot;Boss of Me&quot; by They Might Be Giants.

===Filming===

Much of the filming for &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; was done on location in various parts of the thirty-mile zone around Los Angeles. A privately owned home, located in Studio City, California, was rented for upwards of $3,000 a day to film as the exterior of Malcolm&#x27;s house. Rebuilt in 2011, the property is no longer recognizable due to its modern two-floor design. However, the house directly to the left of it is nearly identical to what it looked like during filming, still making it a frequent stop for fans of the show. Some high school scenes were filmed at Walter Reed Middle School, and the Lucky Aide was represented by a Drug Emporium at 6020 Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood. In &quot;Stock Car Races&quot;, when Hal and the boys are entering a race track, the billboard behind the entrance displays the place as Irwindale Speedway, a real race track in Southern California. The last episode in the first season (&quot;Water Park&quot;) was filmed at a water park called Wild Rivers located in Irvine, California. Though palm trees and desert scenery are seen in shots of the local region and town throughout the show, indicating a location in the Western United States, it is never revealed which state the show is set in (except for Francis&#x27; whereabouts in early seasons, such as his military school in Alabama and his job in Alaska. In Season 6 Episode 6 Hal&#x27;s Christmas gift reveals a license plate showing it to be the &quot;Cherokee state&quot; or Oklahoma, during Lois&#x27; demo derby).

Studio filming for &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; took place on Stage 21 at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, which included the interior of the home and the back yard. The middle school play yard was at the northern point of the CBS studio property at the end of Radford Avenue. It was redressed as the high school courtyard starting in season 4 and was demolished in 2006–2007.

Hallmarks of the series&#x27; filming and structure, many of which heavily influenced later programs, included the following:

* A cold open presenting one or more family members in an absurd situation that has little or nothing to do with the main plot of the episode.
* A split-second whip pan as a transition from one scene to another.
* Frequent pieces to camera delivered by Malcolm.
* An abrupt cut to black at the end of each segment, accompanied by the sound of a slamming door.

During the final two seasons, Christopher Masterson reduced his on-screen time in favor of writing and directing some episodes.

===Music===
The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Boss of Me&quot;, was written and recorded by the alternative rock group They Might Be Giants. The song won the &quot;Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media&quot; award at the 2002 Grammy Awards. The band also performed nearly all of the incidental music for the show in its first two seasons.

Mood-setting music is sprinkled throughout the series, in lieu of audience laughter, in a way that resembles feature film more than other TV sitcoms. Some examples of this highly varied music include ABBA, Basement Jaxx, Sum 41, Kenny Rogers, Lemon Jelly, Lords of Acid, The Getaway People, En Vogue, Electric Light Orchestra, Fatboy Slim, Phil Collins, Claude Debussy, Tears for Fears, Slade, Quiet Riot, Queen, and Citizen King, whose song &quot;Better Days&quot; is played at the end of both the pilot episode and the series finale. The Southern California pop-punk band Lit have many of their songs featured in several episodes. Lit songs that were never released as singles were also used.

A soundtrack, &quot;Music from Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, was released on November 21, 2000.

==Broadcast and syndication==
The show entered barter syndication in the fall of 2004 one month before the sixth season premiered on Fox and was later aired on FX in the fall of 2007 until the fall of 2011.

The show was launched on Nick at Nite on July 5, 2009, at 8:00 pm with an all night marathon. However, the episodes were either skipped over or heavily edited due to content that was too strong for the network&#x27;s standards. When Nick at Nite pulled &quot;Malcolm&quot; it began airing on TeenNick from November 26, 2010, and continued until December 2010. The show returned to TeenNick&#x27;s line-up on July 18, 2011.

On September 26, 2011, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; began airing on IFC.
On March 5, 2018, the series began airing on Fuse.

On April 11, 2019, it was originally revealed that the show would be available on Disney+, Disney&#x27;s direct-to-consumer streaming service, at launch on November 12, 2019. However, the show was not available on launch day for unknown reasons. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney sent a survey out to Disney+ consumers asking if they would like content on the site such as &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and other &quot;mature&quot; shows such as &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Modern Family&quot;. The series is currently available to watch on Hulu.

In the United Kingdom, the series originally aired on Sky1 from September 3, 2000, later also airing on Sky2 before finally leaving all Sky channels in December 2010. It also aired on free-to-air BBC Two from April 6, 2001, to March 7, 2009. From January 3, 2011, it aired on Fiver (now 5*) at 6:00 pm and again at about 7:30 pm, later moving to a weekly slot at 3:15 pm on Saturday afternoons. Repeats continued until January 18, 2014. Comedy Central UK and Ireland picked up the show in November 2015 and aired until 2018. Nickelodeon UK also began showing the series in 2018. 4Music started showing two episodes daily at 6.00pm and 6.30pm, from 6 July 2020. As of December 2021, the series is available on Disney+ in the UK. In Kenya, the show used to air Thursdays at 7:30 pm on NTV from 2003 to 2005.

==Home media==
Only the first season of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; has been released on DVD. In the U.S., season two was set to be released in the fall of 2003, but was cancelled due to high costs of music clearances.

In February 2012, it was announced that Fabulous Films would be releasing the first season of the show in the UK in April, as well as releasing each subsequent season the following month, ending with a complete series set near Christmas 2012. However, in late March 2012, several retailers had removed the release date from their websites; this was later revealed to be because of &quot;technical issues with the Masters&quot; and that the release date had been pushed back to June. Other seasons will now follow on either a monthly or bi-monthly basis.

All the UK DVD releases are intact as originally aired with no cuts, with the original music, with the exception of one season three episode &quot;Company Picnic&quot; which was originally aired as a one-hour special, before being re-edited and split into two parts for syndication. The DVD presents the syndicated version.

All seven seasons as well as the complete series set were released in Australia in September 2013. The complete series set altered the separate seven season sets to fit into four volumes. A collector&#x27;s edition boxset which has the seasons split up instead of volumes was released subsequently in 2014. It features everything from the four-volume set and includes a bonus T-shirt. This set is exclusive to Australia.

In May 2019, Turbine Medien announced the first ever Blu-ray release of the complete series in Germany, that was released in September 2019. The release however, was in Standard Definition, in similar fashion to the PAL DVD releases.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gave the show&#x27;s first season a score of 88 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Ratings===
Despite the critical acclaim, its success was not assured with audiences generally rejecting single-camera, live action comedies at the time. However, the show achieved Fox&#x27;s biggest ratings for a premiere since &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1990 with an audience of more than 23 million for the debut episode and Fox&#x27;s biggest rating for a show aired directly after &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. 26 million watched the second episode.

Fox shuffled the show&#x27;s air time repeatedly to make room for other shows. On January 13, 2006, Fox announced that the show would be moving to 7:00 pm on Sundays effective January 29, 2006. The 151st and final episode of the series aired at 8:30 pm ET/PT (the show&#x27;s original timeslot) on May 14, 2006, and was watched by 7.4 million.

==Awards and nominations==

Jane Kaczmarek and Cloris Leachman were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award every year they appeared on the show, as leading and guest actress, respectively. Leachman won in 2002 and 2006. Frankie Muniz was nominated once for lead actor, and Bryan Cranston three times for supporting actor. The show won a total of seven Emmys during its six-year run and a Peabody Award. Kaczmarek was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, Muniz was nominated twice, and Cranston was nominated once.

==Legacy==
The show was influential as a family sitcom that was not filmed in front of a live studio audience and did not feature a laugh track, in addition to being one of the first comedy series to use a single-camera filming style, which was later used in shows such as &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, and &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

In the 2017 film &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot;, Bryan Cranston appeared as himself, offering one of the protagonists a guest role on an episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;.

The series served as inspiration for episode 6 of the Disney+ Marvel Cinematic Universe television miniseries &quot;WandaVision&quot;, and the intro of &quot;WandaVision&quot; show in show also parodies &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. In episode 8 of the series, a DVD box of the first season can be seen among DVDs of other shows. Later in that same episode, the main characters are watching season seven&#x27;s second episode &quot;Health Insurance&quot;.

There is an alternate ending to &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; released on the complete series DVD box set, where Hal (whose actor Cranston plays Walter White in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;) wakes up from a dream, revealing the entirety of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; to be a bad dream in &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; that Hal had after eating deep-fried Twinkies. This is a parody of the ending to the show &quot;Newhart&quot;.

The series is referenced heavily in the fifth episode of the sixteenth season of the sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; — &quot;Celebrity Booze: The Ultimate Cash Grab&quot; — which features Cranston guest-starring as himself. Throughout the episode, the gang recognizes Cranston for his work on &quot;Malcolm&quot; and mistake his &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; co-star Aaron Paul to be Malcolm himself. The characters Dennis and Frank Reynolds also praise the show, with Frank saying it &quot;changed the game&quot;.

==Adaptation==
Russian channel STS made a shot-for-shot adaptation called &quot;Супер Макс&quot; (&quot;Super Max&quot;) that comprises 1 season so far.

==Revival==
In 2016, Bryan Cranston openly expressed interest in doing a reunion. In 2021, Frankie Muniz, while speaking on Steve-O&#x27;s podcast, revealed that Cranston was writing a script for a movie reunion and that the entire cast was ready to return except for one hold out, though he kept the identity confidential. In December 2023 it was suggested that the hold out was the creator of the show, Linwood Boomer, during Muniz&#x27;s appearance on Mayim Bialik&#x27;s podcast and that he would only give his blessing if two specific previous writers were on board.

In December 2024, it was announced that a four-episode revival was in the works for Disney+ with Muniz, Cranston and Kaczmarek set to reprise their roles. It will follow Malcolm and his daughter as Hal and Lois demand their presence for their 40th wedding anniversary party. Initially, the project had been pitched as a two-hour movie before being consolidated into four 30-minute episodes for the channel. The series will commence filming in April 2025, in accordance with Muniz&#x27;s NASCAR schedule.

<text>Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics was the first appearance of the sport of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. The tournament was played between 7 and 14 August 1936 in Berlin, Germany. 23 nations entered the competition, making basketball the largest tournament of the team sports, but Hungary and Spain withdrew, meaning 21 competed.

The International Olympic Committee and International Basketball Federation, which is the governing body of international basketball, used the 1936 tournament to experiment with outdoor basketball. Lawn and dirt tennis courts were used for the competition, but this caused problems when the weather was adverse, especially during the final of the tournament.

The medals were awarded by James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. The United States won its first gold medal, while Canada and Mexico won silver and bronze, their only medals in basketball, as of 2024.

<text>Accenture plc is a global multinational professional services company originating in the United States and headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, that specializes in information technology (IT) services and management consulting. It was founded in 1989. A Fortune Global 500 company, it reported revenues of $64.9 billion in 2024.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in the early 1950s. The division conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which led to GE&#x27;s installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer, believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the United States.

=== Split from Arthur Andersen ===
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, tensions grew between the two units. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC, pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting. This dispute came to a head in 1998, when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In 2000, as a result of arbitration, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid $1.2 billion to Arthur Andersen and changed its name to Accenture.

On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted the name, &quot;Accenture&quot;. The word &quot;Accenture&quot; was derived from &quot;Accent on the future&quot;. The name &quot;Accenture&quot; was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company&#x27;s Oslo, Norway office. Petersen hoped that the name would not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates, because the word itself was meaningless.

=== Incorporation and public listing ===
Accenture was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001. On 19 July 2001, Accenture&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Because of the split from Andersen, Accenture avoided prosecution on June 16, 2002, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prosecuted Arthur Andersen for obstructing justice and accounting fraud.

=== Reincorporation in Ireland ===
On 26 May 2009, Accenture announced that its board of directors unanimously approved changing the company&#x27;s place of incorporation from Bermuda to Ireland.

== Services and operations ==
Accenture&#x27;s business is organized into five segments:

# Strategy and Consulting
# Technology
# Operations
# Accenture Song (formerly Interactive)
# Industry X

The company provides services to clients in various industries, including communications, media and technology, financial services, health and public service, consumer products, and resources.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Leadership ===
William D. Green became the CEO in September 2004. Green was replaced by Pierre Nanterme in January 2011. In January 2019, Nanterme stepped down from his position, citing health reasons. Chief Financial Officer David Rowland was named as the interim CEO. Julie Sweet was appointed CEO in September 2019.

=== Employees ===
As of 2024, Accenture reported having approximately 774,000 employees.

=== Finances ===
The financial results were as follows:

== Controversies ==

=== Incorporation in a tax haven ===
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven. The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics such as former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs, reported Accenture&#x27;s decision to incorporate in Bermuda was a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company. The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that &quot;prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity.&quot;

=== UK NHS technology project ===
Accenture engaged in an IT overhaul project for the British National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns. The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project five years later for the same reasons.

=== Tax avoidance ===
In 2012, it was revealed Accenture was paying only 3.5% in tax in Ireland as opposed to the average rate of 24% it would pay if instead based in the UK.

=== US immigration ===
In June 2018, Accenture was asked to recruit 7,500 U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. Under the $297 million contract, Accenture had been charging the US Government nearly $40,000 per hire, which was more than the annual salary of the average officer. According to a report published by the DHS Office of Inspector General in December 2018, Accenture had been paid $13.6M through the first ten months of the contract. They had hired two agents against a contract goal of 7,500 hires over 5 years. The report was issued as a &#x27;management alert&#x27;, indicating an issue requiring immediate attention, stating that &quot;Accenture has already taken longer to deploy and delivered less capability than promised&quot;. The contract was terminated in 2019.

=== Working conditions ===

In February 2019, contractors from Accenture&#x27;s Austin, Texas, location who performed content moderation tasks for Facebook wrote an open letter to Facebook describing poor working conditions and a &quot;Big Brother environment&quot; that included restricted work breaks and strict non-disclosure agreements. A counselor in the Austin office stated that the content moderators could develop post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the work, which included evaluating videos and images containing graphic violence, hate speech, animal abuse, and child abuse. Accenture issued a statement saying the company offers opportunities for moderators to advance, increase their wages, and provide input &quot;to help shape their experience.&quot;

In February 2025, Vice News spoke to a former Accenture employee under condition of anonymity. His project on the WhatsApp team for Meta required him to sift through images and deciding whether or not they depicted child sexual abuse, which he coped with &quot;through a lot of substance abuse&quot;. The former employee claimed to have witnessed multiple missed opportunities to protect children, and alleged that one colleague had previously been arrested for possessing child abuse materials. In a statement, Accenture said they are &quot;committed to helping companies keep their platforms safe through services such as content, advertising and compliance reviews&quot;.

=== Tax practices ===
In February 2019, Accenture paid $200 million to Swiss authorities over tax claims related to transfer pricing arrangements.

=== Data breach ===
In August 2021, Accenture confirmed a data breach due to a ransomware attack, which reportedly led to the theft of six terabytes of data.

=== Employment practices ===
In March 2023, Accenture announced plans to eliminate 19,000 jobs of the 738,000 employees over 18 months, citing reduced revenue forecasts.

In February 2025, Accenture made significant changes to its diversity and inclusion policies, including discontinuing global employee representation goals and specific demographic-focused career development programs. The company also paused participation in external diversity benchmarking surveys and reevaluated their external partnerships. According to media analysis, this was to comply with President Trump&#x27;s Executive Order to avoid losing billions of dollars of work with US Federal Agencies.

<doc id="299137" wikidata="Q2353682" url="?curid=299137" title="Current liability">
<text>Current liabilities in accounting refer to the liabilities of a business that are expected to be settled in cash within one fiscal year or the firm&#x27;s operating cycle, whichever is longer. These liabilities are typically settled using current assets or by incurring new current liabilities.

Key examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, which are generally due within 30 to 60 days, though in some cases payments may be delayed. Current liabilities also include the portion of long-term loans or other debt obligations that are due within the current fiscal year. The proper classification of liabilities is essential for providing accurate financial information to investors and stakeholders.

The classification of liabilities also plays a role in determining financial ratios, such as the current ratio—calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. A higher current ratio indicates that the business has sufficient current assets to cover its obligations over the coming year, suggesting stronger liquidity. The difference between current assets and current liabilities is referred to as trade working capital.

Beginning on January 1, 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board amended IAS 1 with regards to the classification of certain liabilities as current or noncurrent in the presentation in financial statements. Previously, the IAS 1 required that, for a liability to be classified as current, it must not have an &quot;unconditional right&quot; to be deferred for at least 12 months after the reporting date. The board removed this requirement, instead, the right to postpone the settlement must have substance and should exist at the reporting date.

<doc id="299138" wikidata="Q380647" url="?curid=299138" title="Giles of Rome">
<text>Giles of Rome (; ; – 22 December 1316) was a medieval philosopher and Scholastic theologian and a friar of the Order of St Augustine, who was also appointed to the positions of prior general of his order and as Archbishop of Bourges. He is famed as being a logician, who produced a commentary on the &quot;Organon&quot; by Aristotle, and as the author of two important works: &quot;De ecclesiastica potestate&quot;, a major text of early-14th-century papalism, and &quot;De regimine principum&quot;, a guide book for Christian temporal leadership. Giles was styled &quot;Doctor Fundatissimus&quot; (&quot;Best-Grounded Teacher&quot;) by Pope Benedict XIV.

Writers in 14th- and 15th-century-England such as John Trevisa and Thomas Hoccleve translated or adapted him into English.

==Early life==
Very little is known about his early life, although the Augustinian friar Jordan of Quedlinburg claimed in his &quot;Liber Vitasfratrum&quot; that Giles belonged to the noble Colonna family of Rome. But Jordan was not a contemporary of Giles, and many scholars remain sceptical of his account of Giles&#x27; early life. Having entered the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine in Rome, he was sent by his Order to the University of Paris for his philosophical and theological studies, and there became a disciple of the Dominican Thomas Aquinas, and was later appointed to teach at the university, being the first of his Order to do so. It has been estimated that Giles was taught by Thomas Aquinas between 1269 and 1272, and in the years that followed, he produced many of his commentaries on the works of Aristotle, who had been experiencing an intellectual revival during the thirteenth century, and he also produced his commentary on Peter Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Sentences&quot;. Giles remained in Paris studying and teaching theology until Bishop Étienne Tempier condemned the application of Aristotelianism within the Christian discourse, including those who had produced commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s work. Giles, whose work had been condemned, disappeared from the Parisian academic scene.

There is no information remaining concerning Giles between the period of 1277 and 1281, when he returned to Italy. However, in 1281, at the Thirty-sixth Council of Paris, in which several differences between the bishops and mendicant orders were dealt with, he sided with the bishops against the mendicants. In reference to this, a contemporary philosopher, Godfrey of Fontaines mentioned Giles as the most renowned theologian of the whole city (&quot;qui modo melior de tota villa in omnibus reputatur&quot;), suggesting that he might have been in Paris during this period before going back to Rome.

Philip III of France entrusted to Giles the education of his son and heir, who later, in 1285, ascended the throne as Philip IV. When the new king entered Paris after his consecration at Reims, Giles gave the welcoming address in the name of the university, insisting on justice as the most important virtue for a king to practice. In 1285 Giles&#x27; work was again called into question, but by 1287 he was allowed to continue teaching. Eight years later in 1295, Giles was appointed as the Archbishop of Bourges, which he wrote about in his work &quot;De renunciatione&quot;.

==Controversy==
Giles was involved in the condemnation of 1277 promulgated by Étienne Tempier. Several of his opinions had been found reprehensible by Archbishop Tempier, and in 1285 Pope Honorius IV asked him for a public retraction. This, however, was far from lessening his reputation, for in 1287 a decree of the general chapter of the Augustinians held in Florence, after remarking that Giles&#x27;s doctrine &quot;shines throughout the whole world&quot; (&quot;venerabilis magistri nostri Ægidii doctrina mundum universum illustrat&quot;), commanded all members of the order to accept and defend all his opinions, written or to be written.

After filling several important positions in his order he was elected superior-general/prior-general, in 1292. Three years later Pope Boniface VIII appointed him Archbishop of Bourges, France, although Jean de Savigny had already been designated for this see by Pope Celestine V. The French nobility protested on the grounds that Giles was an Italian, but his appointment was maintained and approved by the king.

He was present at the Council of Vienne (1311–1312) in which the Order of Knights Templars was suppressed. He died in Avignon.

==Works==
His writings cover the fields of philosophy and theology. There is no complete edition of his works, but several treatises have been published separately.

In Holy Scripture and theology he wrote commentaries on the &quot;Hexaemeron&quot;, the &quot;Canticle of Canticles&quot;, and the &quot;Epistle to the Romans&quot;; several &quot;Opuscula&quot; and &quot;Quodlibeta,&quot; various treatises, and especially commentaries on Peter the Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Four Books of Sentences.&quot;

In philosophy, besides commentaries on almost all the works of Aristotle, he wrote several special treatises. But his main work is the treatise &quot;De regimine principum,&quot; written for, and dedicated to, his pupil, Philip IV. It passed through many editions (the first, Augsburg, 1473) and was translated into several languages. The Roman edition of 1607 contains the life of Egidio. The work is divided into three books: the first treats the individual conduct of the king, the nature of his true happiness, the choice and acquisition of virtues, and the ruling of passions; the second deals with family life and the relations with wife, children, and servants; the third considers the State, its origin, and the proper mode of governing in times of peace and war.

Almost immediately, &quot;De regimine&quot; was translated into Old French by Henri de Gauchy. It was also translated into seven other European vernaculars, including Italian, and Middle English (by John Trevisa), and also Hebrew. It was the most copied &quot;mirror for princes&quot; alongside the &quot;Secreta secretorum&quot;.

His pedagogical writings have been published in German by Michael Kaufmann (Freiburg, 1904).

His attitude in the difficulties between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV was long believed to have been favourable to the king. But it has been proved that he is the author of the treatise &quot;De potestate ecclesiastica,&quot; in which the rights of the pope are vindicated. The similarity between this treatise and the bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot; seems to support the view taken by some writers that he was the author of the bull.

He had already taken an active part in ending the discussions and controversies concerning the validity of Boniface&#x27;s election to the papacy. In his treatise &quot;De renunciatione Papæ sive Apologia pro Bonifacio VIII&quot; he shows the legitimacy of Celestine&#x27;s resignation and consequently of Boniface&#x27;s election. In philosophy and theology, he generally follows the opinions of his master, St. Thomas, whose works he quotes as &quot;scripta communia.&quot;

The &quot;Defensorium seu Correctorium corruptorii librorum Sancti Thomæ Aquinatis&quot; against the Franciscan William de la Mare of Oxford is by some attributed to him, but this remains uncertain. Nevertheless, on many points, he holds independent views and abandons the Thomistic doctrine to follow the opinions of St. Augustine and of the Franciscan School. He even errs in asserting that, before the Fall, grace had not been given to Adam, an opinion which he wrongly attributes to St. Augustine.

Giles wrote a commentary on Guido Cavalcanti&#x27;s philosophical love &quot;canzone&quot; &quot;Donna me prega&quot; (see Enrico Fenzi, &quot;La canzone d&#x27;amore di Guido Cavalcanti e i suoi antichi commenti&quot;, Melangolo, 1999).

==Aegidian school==
After the decree of the general chapter of 1287, mentioned above, his opinions were generally accepted in the Augustinian Order. He thus became the founder of the Ægidian School. Among the most prominent representatives of this school must be mentioned Giacomo Capoccio of Viterbo (d. 1307) and Augustinus Triumphus (d. 1328), both of them his contemporaries, and also students and professors in the University of Paris: Prosper of Reggio Emilia, Albert of Padua, Gerard of Siena, Henry of Friemar, Thomas of Strasbourg – all in the first half of the fourteenth century.

For some time after this other opinions prevailed in the Augustinian Order. But as late as the seventeenth century should be mentioned Raffaello Bonerba (d. 1681) who wrote &quot;Disputationes totius philosophiæ … in quibus omnes philosophicæ inter D. Thomam et Scotum controversiæ principaliter cum doctrina nostri Ægidii Columnæ illustrantur&quot; (Palermo, 1645, 1671); and Agostino Arpe (d. 1704) who wrote &quot;Summa totius theologiæ Ægidii Columnæ&quot; (Bologna, 1701, and Genoa, 1704).

Federico Nicolò Gavardi (d. 1715), the most important interpreter of Colonna, composed &quot;Theologia exantiquata iuxta orthodoxam S. P. Augustini doctrinam ab Ægidio Columna doctore fundatissimo expositam …&quot; (6 vols. fol., Naples and Rome, 1683–1696); this work was abridged by Anselm Hörmannseder in his &quot;Hecatombe theologica&quot; (Presburg, 1737). Benignus Sychrovský (d. 1737) wrote also &quot;Philosophia vindicata ab erroribus philosophorum gentilium iuxta doctrinam S. Augustini et B. Ægidii Columnæ&quot; (Nuremberg, 1701).

<doc id="299145" wikidata="Q318506" url="?curid=299145" title="Deepak Chopra">
<text>Deepak Chopra (; ; born October 22, 1946) is an Indian-American author, new age guru, and alternative medicine advocate. A prominent figure in the New Age movement, his books and videos have made him one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in alternative medicine. In the 1990s, Chopra, a physician by education, became a popular proponent of a &quot;holistic approach&quot; to well-being that includes yoga, meditation, and nutrition, among other new-age therapies.
Chopra studied medicine in India before emigrating in 1970 to the United States, where he completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in endocrinology. As a licensed physician, in 1980, he became chief of staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH). In 1985, he met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and became involved in the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement. Shortly thereafter, Chopra resigned from his position at NEMH to establish the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center. In 1993, Chopra gained a following after he was interviewed about his books on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. He then left the TM movement to become the executive director of Sharp HealthCare&#x27;s Center for Mind-Body Medicine. In 1996, he cofounded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing.

Chopra claims that a person may attain &quot;perfect health&quot;, a condition &quot;that is free from disease, that never feels pain&quot;, and &quot;that cannot age or die&quot;. Seeing the human body as undergirded by a &quot;quantum mechanical body&quot; composed not of matter but energy and information, he believes that &quot;human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself&quot;, as determined by one&#x27;s state of mind. He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease.

The ideas Chopra promotes have regularly been criticized by medical and scientific professionals as pseudoscience. The criticism has been described as ranging &quot;from the dismissive to...damning&quot;. Philosopher Robert Carroll writes that Chopra, to justify his teachings, attempts to integrate Ayurveda with quantum mechanics. Chopra says that what he calls &quot;quantum healing&quot; cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics. This has led physicists to object to his use of the term &quot;quantum&quot; in reference to medical conditions and the human body. His discussions of quantum healing have been characterized as technobabble – &quot;incoherent babbling strewn with scientific terms&quot; by those proficient in physics. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has said that Chopra uses &quot;quantum jargon as plausible-sounding hocus pocus&quot;. Chopra&#x27;s treatments generally elicit nothing but a placebo response, and they have drawn criticism that the unwarranted claims made for them may raise &quot;false hope&quot; and lure sick people away from legitimate medical treatments.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Chopra was born in New Delhi, British India to Krishan Lal Chopra (1919–2001) and Pushpa Chopra. His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the British Indian Army. His father was a prominent cardiologist, head of the department of medicine and cardiology at New Delhi&#x27;s Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospital for over 25 years, and was also a lieutenant in the British army, serving as an army doctor at the front at Burma and acting as a medical adviser to Lord Mountbatten, viceroy of India. , Chopra&#x27;s younger brother, Sanjiv Chopra, was a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and on staff at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Chopra completed his primary education at St. Columba&#x27;s School in New Delhi and graduated from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi in 1969. He spent his first months as a doctor working in rural India, including, he writes, six months in a village where the lights went out whenever it rained. It was during his early career that he was drawn to study endocrinology, particularly neuroendocrinology, to find a biological basis for the influence of thoughts and emotions.

He married in India in 1970 before emigrating, with his wife, to the United States that same year. The Indian government had banned its doctors from sitting for the exam needed to practice in the United States. Consequently, Chopra had to travel to Sri Lanka to take it. After passing, he arrived in the United States to take up a clinical internship at Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey, where doctors from overseas were being recruited to replace those serving in Vietnam.

Between 1971 and 1977, he completed residencies in internal medicine at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts, the VA Medical Center, St Elizabeth&#x27;s Medical Center, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He earned his license to practice medicine in the state of Massachusetts in 1973, becoming board certified in internal medicine, specializing in endocrinology.

===East Coast years===
Chopra taught at the medical schools of Tufts University, Boston University, and Harvard University, and became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH) (later known as the Boston Regional Medical Center) in Stoneham, Massachusetts before establishing a private practice in Boston in endocrinology.
While visiting New Delhi in 1981, he met the Ayurvedic physician Brihaspati Dev Triguna, head of the Indian Council for Ayurvedic Medicine, whose advice prompted him to begin investigating Ayurvedic practices. Chopra was &quot;drinking black coffee by the hour and smoking at least a pack of cigarettes a day&quot;. He took up Transcendental Meditation to help him stop, and , he continued to meditate for two hours every morning and half an hour in the evening.

Chopra&#x27;s involvement with TM led to a meeting in 1985 with the leader of the TM movement, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who asked him to establish an Ayurvedic health center. He left his position at the NEMH. Chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs: &quot;[W]hen all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit.&quot;

He became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the founders of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, and medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The center charged between $2,850 and $3,950 per week for Ayurvedic cleansing rituals such as massages, enemas, and oil baths, and TM lessons cost an additional $1,000. Celebrity patients included Elizabeth Taylor. Chopra also became one of the TM movement&#x27;s spokespeople. In 1989, the Maharishi awarded him the title &quot;Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth&quot; (Dhanvantari was the Hindu physician to the gods). That year Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine&quot; was published, followed by &quot;Perfect Health: The Complete Mind/Body Guide&quot; (1990).

===West Coast years===
In June 1993, he moved to California as executive director of Sharp HealthCare&#x27;s Institute for Human Potential and Mind/Body Medicine, and head of their Center for Mind/Body Medicine, a clinic in an exclusive resort in Del Mar, California, that charged $4,000 per week and included Michael Jackson&#x27;s family among its clients. Chopra and Jackson first met in 1988 and remained friends for 20 years. When Jackson died in 2009 after being administered prescription drugs, Chopra said he hoped it would be a call to action against the &quot;cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities&quot;.

Chopra left the Transcendental Meditation movement around the time he moved to California in January 1993. Mahesh Yogi claimed that Chopra had competed for the Maharishi&#x27;s position as guru, although Chopra rejected this. According to Robert Todd Carroll, Chopra left the TM organization when it &quot;became too stressful&quot; and was a &quot;hindrance to his success&quot;. Cynthia Ann Humes writes that the Maharishi was concerned, and not only with regard to Chopra, that rival systems were being taught at lower prices. Chopra, for his part, was worried that his close association with the TM movement might prevent Ayurvedic medicine from being accepted as legitimate, particularly after the problems with the &quot;JAMA&quot; article. He also stated that he had become uncomfortable with what seemed like a &quot;cultish atmosphere around Maharishi&quot;.

In 1995, Chopra was not licensed to practice medicine in California where he had a clinic. However, he did not see patients at this clinic &quot;as a doctor&quot; during this time. In 2004, he received his California medical license, and was affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California. Chopra is the owner and supervisor of the Mind-Body Medical Group within the Chopra Center, which in addition to standard medical treatment offers personalized advice about nutrition, sleep-wake cycles, and stress management based on mainstream medicine and Ayurveda. He is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.

===Alternative medicine business===
Chopra&#x27;s book &quot;Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old&quot; was published in 1993. The book and his friendship with Michael Jackson gained him an interview on July 12 that year on &quot;Oprah&quot;. Paul Offit writes that within 24 hours Chopra had sold 137,000 copies of his book and 400,000 by the end of the week. Four days after the interview, the Maharishi National Council of the Age of Enlightenment wrote to TM centers in the United States, instructing them not to promote Chopra, and his name and books were removed from the movement&#x27;s literature and health centers. Neuroscientist Tony Nader became the movement&#x27;s new &quot;Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth&quot;.

Sharp HealthCare changed ownership in 1996 and Chopra left to set up the Chopra Center for Wellbeing with neurologist David Simon, now located at Omni La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in Carlsbad, California. In his 2013 book, &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot;, Paul Offit writes that Chopra&#x27;s business grosses approximately $20 million annually, and is built on the sale of various alternative medicine products such as herbal supplements, massage oils, books, videos and courses. A year&#x27;s worth of products for &quot;anti-ageing&quot; can cost up to $10,000, Offit wrote. Chopra himself is estimated to be worth over $80 million . , according to Srinivas Aravamudan, he was able to charge $25,000 to $30,000 per lecture five or six times a month. Medical anthropologist Hans Baer said Chopra was an example of a successful entrepreneur, but that he focused too much on serving the upper-class through an alternative to medical hegemony, rather than a truly holistic approach to health.

===Teaching and other roles===
Chopra serves as an adjunct professor in the marketing division at Columbia Business School. He serves as adjunct professor of executive programs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He participates annually as a lecturer at the &quot;Update in Internal Medicine&quot; event sponsored by Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. In 2016, Chopra was promoted from voluntary assistant clinical professor to voluntary full clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego in their Department of Family Medicine and Public Health. Robert Carroll writes of Chopra charging $25,000 per lecture, &quot;giving spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism&quot;.

Chopra founded the American Association for Ayurvedic Medicine (AAAM) and Maharishi AyurVeda Products International, though he later distanced himself from these organizations. Since 2004, he has been a board member of Men&#x27;s Wearhouse, a men&#x27;s clothing distributor. In 2005, Chopra was appointed as a senior scientist at The Gallup Organization. In 2006, he launched Virgin Comics with his son Gotham Chopra and entrepreneur Richard Branson. 

In 2009, Chopra founded the , a tax-exempt 501(c) organization that raises funds to promote and research alternative health. The Foundation sponsors annual &quot;Sages and Scientists&quot; conferences. He sits on the board of advisors of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association, an organization based in the United States. In July 2023, Chopra and the Foundation co-hosted an event entitled &quot;We the Future&quot; alongside Kenneth Cole. It explored the future of AI, and supported guiding AI from the outset to create positive disruption and to on a worldwide basis establish peace as the cornerstone of innovation. It featured as speakers real estate investor Craig Hatkoff on AI&#x27;s application to innovation, disability rights activist Eddie Ndopu on AI and accessibility, astronaut Sian Proctor on AI and space, record producer Jerry Wonda  on AI and music, and model and actress Gabriella Wright on AI and well-being.

In 2012, Chopra joined the board of advisors for tech startup State.com, creating a browsable network of structured opinions. In 2014, Chopra founded ISHAR (Integrative Studies Historical Archive and Repository). In 2015, Chopra partnered with businessman Paul Tudor Jones II to found JUST Capital, a non-profit firm which ranks companies in terms of just business practices in an effort to promote economic justice.

===Personal life===
Chopra and his wife have, , two adult children (Gotham Chopra and Mallika Chopra) and three grandchildren. , Chopra lives in a &quot;health-centric&quot; condominium in Manhattan. He is a member of the inaugural class of the Great Immigrants Award named by Carnegie Corporation of New York (July 2006)

==Ideas and reception==
Chopra believes that a person may attain &quot;perfect health&quot;, a condition &quot;that is free from disease, that never feels pain&quot;, and &quot;that cannot age or die&quot;. Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a &quot;quantum mechanical body&quot; comprised not of matter but energy and information, he believes that &quot;human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself&quot;, as determined by one&#x27;s state of mind. He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease.

===Consciousness===
Chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics, including the study of consciousness and Vedanta philosophy. He is a philosophical idealist, arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature that mind, or &quot;dynamically active consciousness&quot;, is a fundamental feature of the universe.

In this view, consciousness is both subject and object. It is consciousness, he writes, that creates reality; we are not &quot;physical machines that have somehow learned to think...[but] thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine&quot;. He argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers; the universe experiences itself through our brains: &quot;We are the eyes of the universe looking at itself&quot;. He has been quoted as saying: &quot;Charles Darwin was wrong. Consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that.&quot; He opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine, arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs, desires, memory and creativity. In his book &quot;Quantum Healing&quot;, Chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe, and therefore it must create consciousness. Claims of quantum consciousness are, however, disputed by scientists arguing that quantum effects have no effect in systems on the macro-level systems (i.e., the brain).

===Approach to health care ===

Chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body, with mental states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and memories) directly influencing physiology through neurotransmitters such as dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin. He has stated, &quot;Your mind, your body and your consciousness which is your spirit and your social interactions, your personal relationships, your environment, how you deal with the environment, and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process ... By influencing one, you influence everything.&quot;

Chopra and physicians at the Chopra Center practice integrative medicine, combining the medical model of conventional Western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, and Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda, illness is caused by an imbalance in the patient&#x27;s &quot;doshas&quot;, or humors, and is treated with diet, exercise, and meditative practices based on the medical evidence there is, however, nothing in Ayurvedic medicine is known to be effective at treating disease, and some preparations may be actively harmful, although meditation may be useful in promoting general well-being.

In discussing health care, Chopra has used the term &quot;quantum healing&quot;, which he defined in &quot;Quantum Healing&quot; (1989) as the &quot;ability of one mode of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body)&quot;. This attempted to wed the Maharishi&#x27;s version of Ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics, an example of what cultural historian Kenneth Zysk called &quot;New Age Ayurveda&quot;. The book introduces Chopra&#x27;s view that a person&#x27;s thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes.

Chopra coined the term &quot;quantum healing&quot; to invoke the idea of a process whereby a person&#x27;s health &quot;imbalance&quot; is corrected by quantum mechanical means. Chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and well-being. He has attempted to integrate Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics to justify his teachings. According to Robert Carroll, he &quot;charges $25,000 per lecture performance, where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism&quot;.

Chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in a quantum state, corresponding to a jump to &quot;a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer&quot;. Physics professor Robert L. Park has written that physicists &quot;wince&quot; at the &quot;New Age quackery&quot; in Chopra&#x27;s cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction, since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure.

Chopra&#x27;s claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a &quot;systematic misinterpretation&quot; of modern physics. Chopra&#x27;s connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid. The main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical, omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible.

Physicists have objected to Chopra&#x27;s use of terms from quantum physics. For example, he was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics in 1998 for &quot;his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness&quot;. When Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer in 2010 on the question &quot;Does God Have a Future?&quot;, Harris argued that Chopra&#x27;s use of &quot;spooky physics&quot; merges two language games in a &quot;completely unprincipled way&quot;. Interviewed in 2007 by Richard Dawkins, Chopra said that he used the term &quot;quantum&quot; as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics.

Chopra wrote in 2000 that his AIDS patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on Ayurveda, including taking herbs, meditation, and yoga. He acknowledges that AIDS is caused by the HIV virus but says that &quot;&#x27;hearing&#x27; the virus in its vicinity, the DNA mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound&quot;. Ayurveda uses vibrations that are said to correct this supposed sound distortion. Medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman writes that Chopra&#x27;s treatment has &quot;to put it mildly...no supporting empirical data&quot;.

In 2001, ABC News aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer. In it, Chopra said, &quot;There is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance.&quot; Chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room, whose vital signs were recorded in charts that were said to show a correspondence between Chopra&#x27;s periods of concentration and the subject&#x27;s periods of relaxation. After the show, a poll of its viewers found that 90% of them believed in distance healing. Health and science journalist Christopher Wanjek has criticized the experiment, saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so, freezing the frame of the video shows the correspondences are not so close as claimed. Wanjek characterized the broadcast as &quot;an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news&quot; that has &quot;a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound&quot;.

===Alternative medicine===

Chopra has been described as &quot;America&#x27;s most prominent spokesman for Ayurveda&quot;. His treatments benefit from the placebo response. Chopra states, &quot;The placebo effect is real medicine, because it triggers the body&#x27;s healing system.&quot; Physician and former U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall has criticized Chopra for his promotion of Ayurveda, stating, &quot;It can be dangerous,&quot; referring to studies showing that 64% of Ayurvedic remedies sold in India are contaminated with significant amounts of heavy metals like mercury, arsenic, and cadmium and a 2015 study of users in the United States who found elevated blood lead levels in 40% of those tested.

Chopra has metaphorically described the AIDS virus as emitting &quot;a sound that lures the DNA to its destruction&quot;. The condition can be treated, according to Chopra, with &quot;Ayurveda&#x27;s primordial sound&quot;. Taking issue with this view, medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that, &quot;to put it mildly, Dr. Chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for AIDS that has no supporting empirical data&quot;.

He is placed by David Gorski among the &quot;quacks&quot;, &quot;cranks&quot;, and &quot;purveyors of woo&quot; and described as &quot;arrogantly obstinate&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Deepak Chopra is &quot;the controversial New Age guru and booster of alternative medicine&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated that he is &quot;the poet-prophet of alternative medicine&quot;. He has become one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in the holistic-health movement. &quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Chopra on its list of the 20th century&#x27;s heroes and icons. Cosmo Landesman wrote in 2005 that Chopra was &quot;hardly a man now, more a lucrative new age brand the David Beckham of personal/spiritual growth&quot;. For Timothy Caulfield, Chopra is an example of someone using scientific language to promote treatments that are not grounded in science: &quot;[Chopra] legitimizes these ideas that have no scientific basis at all, and makes them sound scientific. He really is a fountain of meaningless jargon.&quot; A 2008 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article by Ptolemy Tompkins commented that Chopra was a &quot;magnet for criticism&quot; for most of his career, and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals. Opinions ranged from the &quot;dismissive&quot; to the &quot;outright damning&quot;. Chopra&#x27;s claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can, some have argued, lure sick people away from medical treatment. Tompkins, however, considered Chopra a &quot;beloved&quot; individual whose basic messages centered on &quot;love, health and happiness&quot; had made him rich because of their popular appeal. English professor George O&#x27;Har argues that Chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives, and places what he calls Chopra&#x27;s &quot;sophistries&quot; alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey. Paul Kurtz writes that Chopra&#x27;s &quot;regnant spirituality&quot; is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science, while Wendy Kaminer equates Chopra&#x27;s views with irrational belief systems such as New Thought, Christian Science, and Scientology.

===Aging===
Chopra believes that &quot;ageing is simply learned behaviour&quot; that can be slowed or prevented. Chopra has said that he expects &quot;to live way beyond 100&quot;. He states that &quot;by consciously using our awareness, we can influence the way we age biologically...You can tell your body not to age.&quot; Conversely, Chopra also says that aging can be accelerated, for example by a person engaging in &quot;cynical mistrust&quot;. Robert Todd Carroll has characterized Chopra&#x27;s promotion of lengthened life as a selling of &quot;hope&quot; that seems to be &quot;a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish&quot;.

===Spirituality and religion===
Chopra has likened the universe to a &quot;reality sandwich&quot; which has three layers: the &quot;material&quot; world, a &quot;quantum&quot; zone of matter and energy, and a &quot;virtual&quot; zone outside of time and space, which is the domain of God, and from which God can direct the other layers. Chopra has written that human beings&#x27; brains are &quot;hardwired to know God&quot; and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience. Chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti, a 20th-century speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects.

In 2012, reviewing &quot;War of the Worldviews&quot;a book co-authored by Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow – physics professor Mark Alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, &quot;[covering] all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God&quot;. Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that &quot;the counterpoint to Chopra&#x27;s speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses&quot;, but rather Occam&#x27;s razor.

In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the creation–evolution controversy and Intelligent design, which were criticized by science writer Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society. In 2010, Shermer said that Chopra is &quot;the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience&quot;.

===Position on skepticism===
Paul Kurtz, an American skeptic and secular humanist, has written that the popularity of Chopra&#x27;s views is associated with increasing anti-scientific attitudes in society, and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new, alternative forms of validation for ideas. Kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to open-minded but proper scrutiny, and that skepticism &quot;has its work cut out for it&quot;.

In 2013, Chopra published an article on what he saw as &quot;skepticism&quot; at work in Wikipedia, arguing that a &quot;stubborn band of militant skeptics&quot; were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as Rupert Sheldrake, an author, lecturer, and researcher in parapsychology. The result, Chopra argued, was that the encyclopedia&#x27;s readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to &quot;expand science beyond its conventional boundaries&quot;. The biologist Jerry Coyne responded, saying that it was instead Chopra who was losing out as his views were being &quot;exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding psychobabble&quot;.

More broadly, Chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole, writing in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that &quot;No skeptic, to my knowledge, ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others.&quot; Astronomer Phil Plait said this statement trembled &quot;on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie&quot;, listing Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Stephen Jay Gould, and Edward Jenner among the &quot;thousands of scientists [who] are skeptics&quot;, who he said were counterexamples to Chopra&#x27;s statement.

===Misuse of scientific terminology===

Reviewing Susan Jacoby&#x27;s book &quot;The Age of American Unreason&quot;, Wendy Kaminer sees Chopra&#x27;s popular reception in the US as symptomatic of many Americans&#x27; historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) &quot;to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science&quot;. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;nonsensical references to quantum physics&quot; are placed in a lineage of American religious pseudoscience, extending back through Scientology to Christian Science. Physics professor Chad Orzel has written that &quot;to a physicist, Chopra&#x27;s babble about &#x27;energy fields&#x27; and &#x27;congealing quantum soup&#x27; presents as utter gibberish&quot;, but that Chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince non-scientists that he understands physics. English professor George O&#x27;Har writes that Chopra is an exemplification of the fact that human beings need &quot;magic&quot; in their lives, and places &quot;the sophistries of Chopra&quot; alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey, the special effects and logic of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and the magic of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement, decoherence and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In 1998, Chopra was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics for &quot;his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness&quot;. When interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the Channel 4 (UK) documentary &quot;The Enemies of Reason&quot;, Chopra said that he used the term &quot;quantum physics&quot; as &quot;a metaphor&quot; and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics. In March 2010, Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer at the California Institute of Technology on the question &quot;Does God Have a Future?&quot; Shermer and Harris criticized Chopra&#x27;s use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts. A 2015 paper examining &quot;the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit&quot; used Chopra&#x27;s Twitter feed as the canonical example, and compared this with fake Chopra quotes generated by a spoof website.

===Yoga===
In April 2010, Aseem Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, criticized Chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in Hinduism but in an older Indian spiritual tradition. Chopra later said that yoga was rooted in &quot;consciousness alone&quot; expounded by Vedic rishis long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He said that Shukla had a &quot;fundamentalist agenda&quot;. Shukla responded by saying Chopra was an exponent of the art of &quot;How to Deconstruct, Repackage and Sell Hindu Philosophy Without Calling it Hindu!&quot;, and he said Chopra&#x27;s mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate.

==Legal actions==
In May 1991, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) published an article by Chopra and two others on Ayurvedic medicine and TM. &quot;JAMA&quot; subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author, Hari M. Sharma, had undisclosed financial interests, followed by an article by &quot;JAMA&quot; associate editor Andrew A. Skolnick which was highly critical of Chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject. Several experts on meditation and traditional Indian medicine criticized &quot;JAMA&quot; for accepting the &quot;shoddy science&quot; of the original article. Chopra and two TM groups sued Skolnick and &quot;JAMA&quot; for defamation, asking for $194 million in damages, but the case was dismissed in March 1993.

After Chopra published his book, &quot;Ageless Body, Timeless Mind&quot; (1993), he was sued for copyright infringement by Robert Sapolsky for having used, without proper attribution, &quot;five passages of text and one table&quot; displaying information on the endocrinology of stress. An out-of-court settlement resulted in Chopra correctly attributing material that was researched by Sapolsky.

==Select bibliography==
According to publishers HarperCollins, Chopra has written more than 80 books which have been translated into more than 43 languages, including numerous &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers in both fiction and nonfiction categories. His book &quot;The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success&quot; was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 72 weeks.

<text>An intangible asset is an asset that lacks physical substance. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names, reputation, R&amp;D, know-how, organizational capital as well as any form of digital asset such as software and data. This is in contrast to physical assets (machinery, buildings, etc.) and financial assets (government securities, etc.).

Intangible assets are usually very difficult to value.They suffer from typical market failures of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Today, a large part of the corporate economy (in terms of net present value) consists of intangible assets, reflecting the growth of information technology (IT) and organizational capital. Specifically, each dollar of IT has been found to be associated with and increase in firm market valuation of over $10, compared with an increase of just over $1 per dollar of investment in other tangible assets. Furthermore, firms that both make organizational capital investments and have a large computer capital stock have disproportionately higher market valuations.

==Definition in accounting==

Intangible assets may be one possible contributor to the disparity between &quot;company value as per their accounting records&quot;, as well as &quot;company value as per their market capitalization&quot;. Considering this argument, it is important to understand what an intangible asset truly is in the eyes of an accountant. A number of attempts have been made to define intangible assets:
* The Australian Accounting Standards Board included examples of intangible items in its definition of &quot;assets&quot; in Statement of Accounting Concepts number 4 (SAC 4), issued in 1995. The statement did not provide a formal definition of an intangible asset, but did explain that tangibility was not an essential characteristic of an asset.
* The International Accounting Standards Board standard 38 (IAS 38) defines an intangible asset as: &quot;an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance&quot;. This definition is in addition to the standard definition of an asset which requires a &quot;past event&quot; that has given rise to a resource that the entity &quot;controls&quot; and from which &quot;future economic benefits&quot; are expected to flow. Thus, the extra requirement for an intangible asset under IAS 38 is &quot;identifiability&quot;. This criterion requires that an intangible asset is separable from the entity or that it arises from a contractual or legal right.
* The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 350 (ASC 350) defines an intangible asset as an asset, other than a financial asset, that lacks physical substance.

The lack of physical substance would therefore seem to be a defining characteristic of an intangible asset. Both the IASB and FASB definitions specifically preclude monetary assets in their definition of an intangible asset. This is necessary in order to avoid the classification of items such as accounts receivable, derivatives and cash in the bank as an intangible asset. IAS 38 contains examples of intangible assets, including: computer software, copyright and patents.

== Financial accounting ==

=== General standards ===

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) offers some guidance (IAS 38) as to how intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements. In general, legal intangibles that are developed internally are not recognized and legal intangibles that are purchased from third parties are recognized. Wordings are similar to IAS 9.

Under US GAAP, intangible assets are classified into: Purchased vs. internally created intangibles, and Limited-life vs. indefinite-life intangibles. 

=== Expense allocation ===

Intangible assets are typically expensed according to their respective life expectancy. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or an indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life, whichever is shorter. Examples of intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are copyrights and patents. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reassessed each year for impairment. If an impairment has occurred, then a loss must be recognized. An impairment loss is determined by subtracting the asset&#x27;s fair value from the asset&#x27;s book/carrying value. Trademarks and goodwill are examples of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill has to be tested for impairment rather than amortized. If impaired, goodwill is reduced and loss is recognized in the Income statement.

=== Research and development ===
Research and development (known also as R&amp;D) is considered to be an intangible asset (about 16 percent of all intangible assets in the US), even though most countries treat R&amp;D as current expenses for both legal and tax purposes. Most countries report some intangibles in their National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). The contribution of intangible assets in long-term GDP growth has been recognized by economists. Also of note, acquired &quot;In-Process Research and Development&quot; (IPR&amp;D) is considered an asset under US GAAP.

IAS 38 requires any project that results in the generation of a resource to the entity be classified into two phases: a research phase, and a development phase.

The classification of research and development expenditure can be highly subjective, and it is important to note that organizations may have ulterior motives in their classification of research and development expenditures.

=== Taxation ===

For personal income tax purposes, some costs with respect to intangible assets must be capitalized rather than treated as deductible expenses. Treasury regulations in the USA generally require capitalization of costs associated with acquiring, creating, or enhancing intangible assets. For example, an amount paid to obtain a trademark must be capitalized. Certain amounts paid to facilitate these transactions are also capitalized. Some types of intangible assets are categorized based on whether the asset is acquired from another party or created by the taxpayer. The regulations contain many provisions intended to make it easier to determine when capitalization is required.

Given the growing importance of intangible assets as a source of economic growth and tax revenue, and because their non-physical nature makes it easier for taxpayers to engage in tax strategies such as income-shifting or transfer pricing, tax authorities and international organizations have been designing ways to link intangible assets to the place where they were created, hence defining nexus. Intangibles for corporations are amortized over a 15-year period, equivalent to 180 months.

Definition of &quot;intangibles&quot; differs from standard accounting, in some US state governments. These governments may refer to stocks and bonds as &quot;intangibles&quot;.

==Value of intangible assets==

The most valuable firms, spanning high-tech, pharmaceutical, automotive and financial services industries, derive their competitiveness and market value from intangible rather than physical, that is to say, &quot;tangible&quot; capital. Among companies in the S&amp;P 500, intangibles including intellectual property account for 90% of the total market value. 

Intangible assets, though not always visible, play a crucial role in shaping the success of companies and countries in today&#x27;s competitive environment. Investing in these assets helps businesses attract skilled talent, build customer loyalty, achieve market success, foster innovation and growth. These assets also contribute to improved economic opportunities, higher-paying jobs, enhanced product quality. According to WIPO&#x27;s World IP Report (2017), intellectual property (IP) and other intangibles contribute on average twice as much value as tangible capital to products manufactured and traded along value chains. 

Recent estimates from Brand Finance used in the Global Innovation Index (GII) suggest that the global value of intangibles has been growing rapidly over the last 25 years to reach around USD 62 trillion in 2023. 

In 2023, intangible investment accounted for over 16 percent of GDP in highly intangible-intensive economies like Sweden, the United States of America (US) and France. A trend showing intangible investment growing faster than tangible investment at country level. India was the country that experienced the fastest growth in intangible investment from 2011 to 2020.

Software and data and brands are the two fastest growing types of intangible assets, both growing three times faster than R&amp;D between 2011–2021.

Valuing intangible assets is nevertheless a challenge. There is no single methodology to value them. Depending on the type of asset at hand, context and data availability, often a combination of different approaches is used. In most cases, the value of intangibles can be estimated considering the future economic benefits associated with the asset, like projected cash flows. However, for many intangibles in practice this can be difficult. The cost to repurchase or recreate an asset or comparison with transactions involving similar assets are also common methods to determine value. 

Intangible asset finance, also known as IP finance, is the branch of finance that uses intangible assets such as intellectual property (legal intangible) and reputation (competitive intangible) to gain access to credit. Intangible assets can for example be used in equity finance. For example, many Swiss companies use equity finance to support their growth, particularly Venture capital. The information gathered through interviews indicates that a supportive IP portfolio, particularly when reinforced by robust patents, plays a crucial role as a contributing factor. Without these rights, investors are reluctant to engage with startups. In China, pledge-backed lending is the earliest type of IP financing developed and the fastest growing one. In 2022, the registered amount of patent and trademark pledged lending in China reached CNY 486.9 billion, up 57.1 percent year-on-year. Twenty-eight thousand projects from 26,000 chinese businesses received loans, both increasing about 65.5 percent year-on-year.

<doc id="299148" wikidata="Q221367" url="?curid=299148" title="Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York">
<text>Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York (17 August 1473) was the second son of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville. Richard and his older brother, who briefly reigned as King Edward V of England, mysteriously disappeared shortly after their uncle Richard III became king in 1483.

== Early life ==
Richard was born at the Dominican Friary in Shrewsbury on 17 August 1473, the sixth child and second son of reigning King of England Edward IV and his wife Elizabeth Woodville.

Prince Richard was created Duke of York on 28 May 1474 and was knighted on 18 April 1475. From this time on, it became a tradition for the second son of the English sovereign to be Duke of York. He was made a Knight of the Garter in May 1475.

=== Marriage to Anne de Mowbray ===
In January 1476, John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Nottingham and Warenne, died leaving his infant daughter Anne as his sole heir. Anne was quickly marked out as a bride for Richard. In anticipation of the marriage, Richard was created Earl of Nottingham on 12 June 1476, and was also given the titles of Duke of Norfolk and earl Warenne on 7 February 1477.

A papal dispensation for the marriage was obtained on 12 May 1477 because the children were too young to contract a valid marriage. Additionally they were &quot;related in the third and fourth degrees of kindred&quot;. According to Medieval canon law, the minimum age for marriage was 14 for boys and 12 for girls, but it was not unknown for aristocratic children to be married much younger for political reasons. On 15 January 1478, in St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster, 4-year-old Richard married the 6-year-old Anne.

Anne de Mowbray died in Greenwich on 19 November 1481. Her estates should have passed to William, Viscount Berkeley and to John, Lord Howard, the co-heirs of the last duke&#x27;s great-aunts. However Edward IV was not willing to relinquish the wealthy Mowbray estates, and so in January 1483, Parliament passed an act that gave the Mowbray estates to Richard for his lifetime (and at his death to his heirs if he had any). The rights of the two co-heirs at law were extinguished; Viscount Berkeley had financial difficulties and King Edward IV paid off and forgave those debts. Berkeley then renounced his claims to the Mowbray estate before parliament in 1483. Nothing was done for Lord Howard.

==Heir presumptive==
Richard&#x27;s father, King Edward IV, died on 9 April 1483. Thus Richard&#x27;s elder brother Edward, Prince of Wales, became King of England and was acclaimed as such, and Richard his heir presumptive. Fearing for her family&#x27;s safety, the Queen Dowager arrived with her family to Westminster Abbey seeking sanctuary in April 1483. Her eldest son was taken by his regent, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to the Tower of London, allegedly to prepare for his coronation.

On 19 May 1483, Edward V was lodged in the Tower. In June 1483, the Duke of Gloucester requested that Richard join his brother in the Tower and Queen Elizabeth was forced to hand over the young boy. Richard entered the Tower on 16 June.

A priest, now generally believed to have been Robert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, testified that Edward IV had agreed to marry Lady Eleanor Talbot in 1461. Lady Eleanor was still alive when Edward married Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 and the Regency Council under the late King&#x27;s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, concluded that this was a case of bigamy. This invalidated the second marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and the legitimacy of all children of their union. &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; declared both Edward and Richard as illegitimate and removed from the line of succession on 25 June 1483. The Duke of Gloucester, as the only surviving brother of Edward IV, became King Richard III.

==Possible fate==

The Duke of York was sent to the Tower of London, then a royal residence, by King Richard III in mid-1483, where he was held with his brother. They were sometimes seen in the garden of the Tower, but the princes disappeared from sight after the summer of 1483, and their ultimate fates remain unknown. In 1486, Richard&#x27;s eldest sister Elizabeth married Henry VII, thereby uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster.

=== Murder ===
By autumn 1483 it was widely-believed that the princes had been murdered. Tudor History was quick to blame their uncle Richard. Richard III has remained a key suspect, though other culprits including Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and Henry VII have been suggested. Thomas More wrote that the princes were smothered to death with their pillows, and his account forms the basis of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, in which Tyrrell suborns Forrest and Dighton to murder the princes on Richard&#x27;s orders. Historian D. E. Rhodes stated that the boys were both murdered, probably in August. Alison Weir states that archaeological evidence indicates that the boys died in September. Subsequent re-evaluations of Richard III have questioned his guilt, beginning with William Cornwallis early in the 17th century.

=== Illness ===

In the period before the boys&#x27; disappearance, Edward was regularly being visited by a doctor; historian David Baldwin extrapolates that contemporaries may have believed Edward had died either of an illness or as the result of attempts to cure him. He notes however that there is no indication Richard was also receiving medical treatment.

=== Discovery of remains ===
In 1674, bones reportedly belonging to two children were discovered by workmen rebuilding a stairway in the Tower. Four years later, on the orders of the reigning king Charles II, these were subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey, in an urn bearing the names of Edward and Richard. The bones were re-examined in 1933 in light of medical advances. It was discovered the skeletons were incomplete and had been interred with animal bones. It was determined that the incomplete skeletons were of two slender children: the first aged 12 to 13, and the second aged 9 to 11. According to Lawrence E. Tanner and W. Wright (the physicians who carried out the examination), &quot;the evidence that the bones in the urn are those of the Princes is as conclusive as could be desired&quot;. Further examinations from 1955 to 1987 have mostly substantiated Tanner and Wright&#x27;s claims, though the age of the bones has remained impossible to determine. Paul Murray Kendall, author of the revisionist biography &quot;Richard III&quot;, notes that historian Wilton M. Krogman of the University of Pennsylvania stated that &quot;the skeletons inurned in Westminster Abbey cannot be flatly and incontrovertibly identified as those of the sons of Edward IV&quot;.

In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Adjoining this was another vault, which was found to contain the coffins of two children. This tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV&#x27;s children: George, Duke of Bedford, who had died at the age of two; and Mary of York who had died at the age of 14. Both had predeceased the King. However, the remains of these two children were later found elsewhere in the chapel, leaving the occupants of the children&#x27;s coffins within the tomb unknown.

===Perkin Warbeck===

In 1491, in Cork, Perkin Warbeck, a young man of Flemish origin was proclaimed by a variety of Yorkist supporters led by the Irish city&#x27;s former Mayor John Atwater to be Richard. He claimed to have escaped from the Tower and spent the intervening years on the run. Over the next six years, Warbeck travelled across Europe, receiving recognition from a number of monarchs including Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and James IV of Scotland as &quot;Richard IV&quot; of England. This support included Margaret of York, the aunt of the real Richard. Following his capture after a failed invasion of England in 1497, Warbeck was held in the Tower of London. He confessed to being an impostor, and was later executed following an attempt to escape.
==Arms==
As son of the king, Richard was granted use of the arms of the kingdom, differentiated by a &quot;label argent, on the first point a canton gules&quot;.

<text>Melanie Anne Safka Schekeryk (February 3, 1947 – January 23, 2024), professionally known as Melanie or Melanie Safka, was an American singer-songwriter.

Melanie is widely known for the 1971–72 global hit &quot;Brand New Key&quot;, her 1970 version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, her composition &quot;What Have They Done to My Song Ma&quot;, and her 1970 international breakthrough hit &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot;, which was inspired by her experience of performing at the 1969 Woodstock music festival.

==Early life==
Melanie was born and raised in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York City. Her father, Frederick M. Safka (1924–2009), was of Russian–Ukrainian ancestry, and her mother, jazz singer Pauline &quot;Polly&quot; Altomare (1926–2003), was of Italian heritage. Melanie made her first public singing appearance at age four on the radio show &quot;Live Like A Millionaire&quot;, performing the song &quot;Gimme a Little Kiss&quot;. She moved with her family to Long Branch, New Jersey, and attended Long Branch High School. Disturbed that she was rejected by her schoolmates as a &quot;beatnik&quot;, she ran away to California. After her return to New Jersey, she transferred to Red Bank High School in Red Bank, New Jersey. She graduated in 1966, although she was prevented from attending her graduation ceremony because of an overdue library book. She was inducted into the school&#x27;s hall of fame in 2014.

==Career==

In the 1960s, Melanie started performing at The Inkwell, a coffee house in the West End section of Long Branch. After high school, her parents insisted that she attend college, so she studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. She began singing in the folk clubs of Greenwich Village, such as The Bitter End, and signed her first recording contract with Columbia Records. Melanie released two singles on the label in the U.S. She subsequently signed with Buddah Records and found her first chart success in Europe in 1969 with &quot;Bobo&#x27;s Party&quot;, which reached No. 1 in France. Her popularity in Europe resulted in performances on European television programs such as &quot;Beat-Club&quot; in West Germany. Her debut album received positive reviews from &quot;Billboard&quot;, which described her voice as &quot;wise beyond her years&quot; and said her &quot;non-conformist approach to the selections on this LP make her a new talent to be reckoned with&quot;.

Later in 1969, Melanie had a hit in the Netherlands with &quot;Beautiful People&quot;. She was one of only three solo female artists who performed at the Woodstock festival in 1969, and her first hit song, &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot;, was inspired by the Woodstock audience lighting candles during her set as well as being influenced by her following of Indian spiritual master Meher Baba. The record became a hit in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States in 1970. The B-side of the single featured Melanie&#x27;s spoken-word track, &quot;Candles in the Rain&quot;. Her first top 10 hit in America was &quot;Lay Down&quot;, which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart and achieved worldwide success. Her later hits included &quot;Peace Will Come (According To Plan)&quot; and a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;.
In 1970, Melanie was the only artist to ignore a court injunction banning the Powder Ridge Rock Festival, which was scheduled to be held on July 31, August 1 and 2, 1970. She played for the crowd on a homemade stage powered by Mister Softee trucks. Not long after this performance, she played at the Strawberry Fields Festival held from August 7 to 9, 1970, at Mosport Park in Ontario, Canada. She also performed at the Isle of Wight Festival, held between August 26 and 30, 1970, at Afton Down. At the festival, she was introduced by Keith Moon and received four standing ovations. She appeared again at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2010. In June 1971, she was the artist who sang to herald in the summer solstice at Glastonbury Fayre (later the Glastonbury Festival) in England. She performed again at Glastonbury in 2011, the 40th anniversary of the original festival.

Melanie left Buddah Records when they insisted that she produce albums on demand. In 1971, she formed her own label, Neighborhood Records, with Peter Schekeryk, who was also her producer and husband. She had her biggest American hit on the Neighborhood label, the novelty-sounding late 1971 No. 1 hit &quot;Brand New Key&quot; (often referred to as &quot;The Roller Skate Song&quot;). &quot;Brand New Key&quot; sold over three million copies worldwide and was featured in the 1997 movie &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.

When first released, &quot;Brand New Key&quot; was banned by some radio stations because some inferred sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie acknowledged the possibility of reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating: I wrote [&#x27;Brand New Key&#x27;] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories as to what the lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio ... My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in their life afterward ... People will take it any way they want to take it.

In a 2013 interview with music journalist Ray Shasho, Melanie elaborated on the origin of &quot;Brand New Key&quot;:
Of course I can see it symbolically with the key, but I just thought of roller skating. I was fasting with a twenty seven day fast on water. I broke the fast and went back to my life living in New Jersey and we were going to a flea market around six in the morning. On the way back ... and I had just broken the fast, from the flea market, we passed a McDonald&#x27;s and the aroma hit me, and I had been a vegetarian before the fast. So we pulled into the McDonald&#x27;s and I got the whole works ... the burger, the shake and the fries ... and no sooner after I finished that last bite of my burger ... that song was in my head. The aroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and the vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire. And me saying to my dad ... &quot;You&#x27;re holding, you&#x27;re holding, you&#x27;re holding, right?&quot; Then I&#x27;d look back and he wasn&#x27;t holding and I&#x27;d fall. So that whole thing came back to me and came out in this song. So it was not a deliberate or intentional sexual innuendo.

The follow-up single to &quot;Brand New Key&quot; was &quot;Ring the Living Bell&quot;. To compete with this release, Melanie&#x27;s former record company released &quot;The Nickel Song&quot;, which she had recorded while still signed to Buddah Records. Both songs were simultaneous top 40 hits while &quot;Brand New Key&quot; was still on the charts, setting a record for the first female performer to have three top 40 hits at the same time.

Melanie won &quot;Billboard&quot;″s No. 1 Top Female Vocalist award for 1972 and was awarded two gold albums, and a gold single for &quot;Brand New Key&quot;. Three of her compositions were hits for the New Seekers. She is also known for her musical adaptations of children&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Alexander Beetle&quot; and &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;. When she became an official UNICEF ambassador in 1972, she agreed to forgo a world tour in favor of raising money for the organization. She also took time to raise her daughter.

Melanie had another top 40 hit single in 1973 with &quot;Bitter Bad&quot;, a song that marked a slight departure from the hippie sentiments of her earlier hits, with lyrics such as &quot;If you do me wrong I&#x27;ll put your first and last name in my rock n&#x27; roll song&quot;. Melanie&#x27;s other chart hits during this period were the self-penned &quot;Together Alone&quot; and a cover of &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, which reached No 37 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1974.

===Later career===
In 1976, Melanie released one album on Atlantic Records, &quot;Photograph&quot;, which was produced by Ahmet Ertegun. The album was praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the year&#x27;s best, although it was largely ignored by the public. It was re-issued on compact disc in 2005 with an additional disc of unreleased material.

Also in 1976, Melanie appeared at the tribute concert for Phil Ochs, who had died by suicide on April 9 that year. Held on May 28 at New York City&#x27;s Felt Forum, Melanie performed an emotional version of Ochs&#x27;s songs &quot;Chords of Fame&quot; and &quot;Miranda&quot;. She had appeared with Ochs on stage in 1974 at his &quot;Evening with Salvador Allende&quot; concert (also held at the Felt Forum), along with Dave Van Ronk, Arlo Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and others.

In 1983, Melanie wrote the music and lyrics for a theatrical musical, &quot;Ace of Diamonds&quot;, with a book by Ed Kelleher and Seymour Vall based on a series of letters written by Annie Oakley. Though never fully produced, several staged readings were performed at the Lincoln Center, with Melanie as the narrator and pop singer and actress Annie Golden as Oakley.

Melanie won an Emmy Award for writing the lyrics to the theme song for the television series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. With one exception, her albums were produced by her husband, Peter Schekeryk, who died suddenly in 2010. Her three children — Leilah, Jeordie, and Beau-Jarred — are also musicians. Beau-Jarred is a guitarist and accompanied his mother on tour.

One of Melanie&#x27;s later albums, &quot;Paled By Dimmer Light&quot; (2004), was co-produced by Peter and Beau-Jarred Schekeryk and includes the songs &quot;To Be The One&quot;, &quot;Extraordinary&quot;, &quot;Make It Work&quot;, and &quot;I Tried To Die Young&quot;. 

In 2007, Melanie was invited by Jarvis Cocker to perform at the Meltdown festival at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Her sold-out performance was critically acclaimed, with &quot;The Independent&quot; saying, &quot;It was hard to disagree that Melanie has earned her place alongside Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Laura Nyro, Joni Mitchell, Nico, and Marianne Faithfull in the pantheon of iconic female singers. Meltdown was all the better for her presence.&quot; The concert was filmed for a DVD, &quot;Melanie: For One Night Only&quot;, which was released in October 2007. She recorded &quot;Psychotherapy&quot;, sung to the tune of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, which parodied aspects of Freudian psychoanalysis. The song has been played on &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;. In July 2012, Melanie headlined along with Arlo Guthrie and Judy Collins at the 15th annual Woody Guthrie Folk Festival, which is held to celebrate Woody Guthrie&#x27;s life and music.

In October 2012, Melanie collaborated with John Haldoupis, artistic and managing director of Blackfriars Theatre in Rochester, New York, to create an original musical about her love story with her late husband. &quot;Melanie and the Record Man&quot; made its premiere on October 19, with performances scheduled until October 28. The musical, conceived and designed by Haldoupis, featured Melanie&#x27;s music and told the story of meeting Peter, falling in love, and working together to produce her music. Melanie performed during the musical and was also the narrator. In June 2014, she toured Australia for the first time since 1977.

In April 2015, Melanie was inducted into Red Bank Regional&#x27;s &quot;Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame&quot;. She received the Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award at the Artists Music Guild&#x27;s 2015 AMG Heritage Awards on November 14, 2015, in Monroe, North Carolina. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2019, she performed on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;.

At the time of her death in 2024, Melanie was working on a covers album titled &quot;Second Hand Smoke&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Melanie married record producer Peter Schekeryk in 1968. They had three children; daughter Leilah born in 1973, daughter Jeordie in 1975, and son Beau-Jarred in 1980. Leilah and Jeordie, when aged seven and six, released a cover of &quot;There&#x27;s No One Quite Like Grandma&quot; that charted in Canada, reaching No. 27. Peter Schekeryk died in 2010. Melanie was a vegetarian in the early 1970s; she also practiced fasting.

Melanie identified herself politically as a libertarian, stating, &quot;I am not a Democrat, a Socialist, or a Republican.&quot; She said that she had experienced acceptance from a &quot;universal force of motherhood&quot; after receiving a hug from Mata Amritanandamayi, a.k.a. &quot;Amma&quot; (&quot;Mother&quot;) or the &quot;hugging saint&quot; from India, as she is also known, which had inspired her to write &quot;Motherhood of Love&quot;.

Melanie resided in the Nashville metropolitan area. She died on January 23, 2024, at the age of 76. Her three children shared their mother&#x27;s death in a Facebook post and her reps mentioned &quot;an illness&quot;, but no cause was given.

<text>The Churches of Chiloé in Chile&#x27;s Chiloé Archipelago are a unique architectural phenomenon in the Americas and one of the most prominent styles of Chilotan architecture. Unlike classical Spanish colonial architecture, the churches of Chiloé are made entirely in native timber with extensive use of wood shingles. The churches were built from materials to resist the Chiloé Archipelago&#x27;s humid and rainy oceanic climate.

Built in the 18th and 19th centuries when Chiloé Archipelago was still a part of the Spanish Crown possessions, the churches represent the fusion of Spanish Jesuit culture and local native population&#x27;s skill and traditions; an excellent example of mestizo culture.

The Churches of Chiloé were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2000. The University of Chile, Fundación Cultural Iglesias de Chiloé and other institutions have led efforts to preserve these historic structures and to publicize them for their unique qualities.

==Location==
The sixteen churches registered as part of the World Heritage Site are concentrated in the central eastern zone of the archipelago.

<text>Chiloé Island (, , ) also known as Greater Island of Chiloé (&quot;Isla Grande de Chiloé&quot;), is the largest island of the Chiloé Archipelago off the west coast of Chile, in the Pacific Ocean. The island is located in southern Chile, in the Los Lagos Region.

Of roughly rectangular shape, the southwestern half of the island is a wilderness of contiguous forests and swamps. Mountains in the island form a belt running from the northwestern to the southeastern corner of the island. Cordillera del Piuchén make up the northern mountains and the more subdued Cordillera de Pirulil gathers the southern mountains. The landscape of the northeastern sectors of Chiloé Island is dominated by rolling hills with a mosaic of pastures, forests and cultivated fields. While the western shores are rocky and relatively straight, the eastern and northern shores contain many inlets, bays and peninsulas, and it is here where all towns and cities lie.

Geographically, the bulk of the island is a continuation of the Chilean Coast Range, with the sea of Chiloé being a submerged portion of the Chilean Central Valley. The climate is cool temperate oceanic with Mediterranean precipitation pattern.

==Geography==

With an area of , Chiloé Island is the second largest island in Chile (after the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego), the largest island completely within Chile, and the fourth largest in South America. It is separated from the Chilean mainland by the Chacao Strait (&quot;Canal Chacao&quot;) to the north, and by the Gulf of Ancud (&quot;Golfo de Ancud&quot;) and the Gulf of Corcovado (&quot;Golfo Corcovado&quot;) to the east; the Pacific Ocean lies to the west, and the Chonos Archipelago lies to the south, across the Boca del Guafo. The island is from north to south, and averages wide. The capital is Castro, on the east side of the island; the second largest town is Ancud, at the island&#x27;s northwest corner, and there are several smaller port towns on the east side of the island, such as Quellón, Dalcahue and Chonchi.

Chiloé Island and the Chonos Archipelago are a southern extension of the Chilean coastal range at Chilean Patagonia, which runs north and south, parallel to the Pacific coast and the Andes Mountains. The Chilean Central Valley lies between the coastal mountains and the Andes, of which the Gulfs of Ancud and Corcovado form the southern extension. Mountains run north and south along the spine of the island. The east coast is deeply indented, with several natural harbors and numerous smaller islands.

==Climate==

Chiloé runs from 41º47&#x27;S to 43º26&#x27;S, and has a humid, cool temperate climate. The western side of the island is rainy and wild, home to the Valdivian temperate rain forests, one of the world&#x27;s few temperate rain forests. Chiloé National Park (&quot;Parque Nacional de Chiloé&quot;) is located on the island&#x27;s western shore and Tantauco Park (&quot;Parque Tantauco&quot;), a private natural reserve created and owned by Chilean business magnate and former President of Chile Sebastián Piñera, is located on the island&#x27;s southern shore. Both include parts of the coastal range. The eastern shore, in the rain shadow of the interior mountains, is warmer and drier.

== Alfaguara project ==

The northwestern of Chiloé Island in Chiloé National Park has a great diversity of marine fauna, including blue whale, sei whale, Chilean dolphins and Peale&#x27;s dolphins; sea lions, marine otters, and Magellanic penguin and Humboldt penguins.
Nevertheless, this relatively undisturbed area faces different threats, like urban development, habitat degradation, land and marine pollution.

The Alfaguara project (blue whale project), conducted by the Cetacean Conservation Center, is based at Puñihuil on the northwest coast.
The project combines long-term research, educational and capacity building programs for marine conservation combined with the sustainable development of the local communities. The Islotes de Puñihuil Natural Monument is a group of three islets to the west and north of Puñihuil. The monument is the only known shared breeding site for Humboldt and Magellanic penguins. 
It is also a breeding area for other species, such as the red-legged cormorant and kelp gull.

==History==

Chiloé has been described by Renato Cárdenas, historian at the Chilean National Library, as &quot;a distinct enclave, linked more to the sea than the continent, a fragile society with a strong sense of solidarity and a deep territorial attachment.&quot;
Chiloé&#x27;s history began with the arrival of its first human inhabitants more than 7,000 years ago. Spread along the coast of Chiloé are a number of middens - ancient dumps for domestic waste, containing mollusc shells, stone tools and bonfire remains. All of these remains indicate the presence of nomadic groups dedicated to the collection of marine creatures (clams, mussels and &quot;Choromytilus chorus&quot;, among others) and to hunting and fishing.

When the Spanish conquistadores arrived on Chiloé Island in the 16th century, the island was inhabited by the Chono, Huilliche and Cunco peoples. The original peoples navigated the treacherous waters of the Chiloé Archipelago in boats called &quot;dalcas&quot; with skill that impressed the Spaniards.

The first Spaniard to sight the coast of Chiloé was the explorer in 1540, as he was travelling to Peru. However, in an expedition ordered by Pedro de Valdivia, captain Francisco de Ulloa reached the Chacao Channel in 1553 and explored the islands forming the archipelago, and is thus considered the first European &quot;discoverer&quot; of Chiloé. In 1558, Spanish soldier García Hurtado de Mendoza began an expedition which would culminate in the Chiloé archipelago being claimed for the Spanish crown.

The city of Castro was founded in 1567.
The island was originally called New Galicia by the Spanish discoverers, but this name did not stick and the name Chiloé, meaning &quot;place of seagulls&quot; in the Huilliche language, was given to the island.

Jesuit missionaries to Chiloé Island, charged with the evangelization of the local population arrived on Chiloé at the turn of the 17th century and built a number of chapels throughout the archipelago. By 1767 there were already 79 and today more than 150 wooden churches built in traditional style can be found on the islands, many of these declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, the Franciscans assumed responsibility for the religious mission to Chiloé from 1771.

Chiloé only became part of the Chilean republic in 1826, eight years after independence and following the two failed campaigns for independence in 1820 and 1824. From 1843, a large number of Chilotes (as inhabitants of the island are called) migrated to Patagonia in search of work, mainly in Punta Arenas, but as living and working conditions in Chiloé improved in the following century this migration began gradually to decrease.

In the 19th century, Chiloé was a center for foreign whalers, particularly French whalers. From the middle of the 19th century and until the beginning of the 20th century, Chiloé was the main producer of railroad ties for the whole continent. From this point on, new towns dedicated to this industry were formed, including Quellón, Dalcahue, Chonchi and Quemchi were established. From 1895, lands were given to European settlers and also to large manufacturing industries.

With the rise of farming, inland areas of Chiloé Island began to be occupied; previously only the coastline had been inhabited. With the construction of the railroad between Ancud and Castro in 1912, the occupation of inland zones was completed. This railroad is no longer in service.

On December 10, 2021, a wildfire spread across Chiloe, including the city of Castro, burning houses, churches and schools, and causing many residents to evacuate.

==Access==
In late 2012, LAN Airlines became the first airline to offer flights to Chiloé Island, inaugurating a regular service between Puerto Montt and the airport of Mocopulli, Dalcahue. Previously the only means of access to Chiloé island was via a ferry service across the Chacao Channel. In 2013, a small airstrip was opened at the south tip of the island, allowing local flight access to the remote village of Inío. 

A project to build a bridge from Chiloé Island to the mainland of Chile was initially proposed in 1972 and was eventually launched under the government of Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006) who launched the project as part of works to celebrate the Bicentennial of Chile. In 2006, however, the Chacao Channel bridge project was cancelled by the Ministry of Public Works after concerns about its total cost, which was estimated to be higher than the initial budget for the project. In May 2012, President Sebastián Piñera again revived the project, announcing an international bidding process would be opened to present the best solution for the construction of the bridge, with a US$740 million investment limit.

<doc id="299168" wikidata="Q2900682" url="?curid=299168" title="Reasonable person">
<text>In law, a reasonable person, reasonable man, sometimes referred to situationally, is a hypothetical person whose character and care conduct, under any &quot;common set of facts,&quot; is decided through reasoning of good practice or policy. It is a legal fiction crafted by the courts and communicated through case law and jury instructions. In some practices, for circumstances arising from an &quot;uncommon set of facts,&quot; this person represents a composite of a relevant community&#x27;s judgement as to how a typical member of that community should behave in situations that might pose a threat of harm (through action or inaction) to the public.

The reasonable person is used as a tool to standardize, teach law students, or explain the law to a jury. The reasonable person belongs to a family of hypothetical figures in law including: the &quot;right-thinking member of society&quot;, the &quot;officious bystander&quot;, the &quot;reasonable parent&quot;, the &quot;reasonable landlord&quot;, the &quot;fair-minded and informed observer&quot;, the &quot;person having ordinary skill in the art&quot; in patent law. Ancient predecessors of the reasonable person include the &quot;bonus pater familias&quot; (the good family father) of ancient Rome, the &quot;bonus vir&quot; (the good man) and &quot;spoudaios&quot; (the earnest person) in ancient Greece as well as the &quot;geru maa&quot; (the silent person) in ancient Egypt. 

While there is a loose consensus on its meaning in black letter law, there is no accepted technical definition, and the &quot;reasonable person&quot; is an emergent concept of common law. The reasonable person is not an average person or a typical person, leading to difficulties in applying the concept in some criminal cases, especially in regard to the partial defence of provocation. Most recently, Valentin Jeutner has argued that it matters less whether the reasonable person is reasonable, officious or diligent but rather that the most important characteristic of the reasonable person is that they are another person. As with legal fiction in general, it is somewhat susceptible to &quot;ad hoc&quot; manipulation or transformation. Strictly according to the fiction, it is misconceived for a party to seek evidence from actual people to establish how someone would have acted or what he would have foreseen. However, changes in the standard may be &quot;learned&quot; by high courts over time if there is a compelling consensus of public opinion.

The standard also holds that each person owes a duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances. While the specific circumstances of each case will require varying kinds of conduct and degrees of care, the reasonable person standard undergoes no variation itself. The standard does not exist independently of other circumstances within a case that could affect an individual&#x27;s judgement. In cases resulting in judgment notwithstanding verdict, a vetted jury&#x27;s composite judgment can be deemed beyond that of the reasonable person, and thus overruled.

The &quot;reasonable person&quot; construct can be found applied in many areas of the law. The standard performs a crucial role in determining negligence in both criminal law—that is, criminal negligence—and tort law. The standard is also used in contract law, to determine contractual intent, or (when there is a duty of care) whether there has been a breach of the standard of care. The intent of a party can be determined by examining the understanding of a reasonable person, after consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties. During the Nuremberg Trials, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe introduced the standard of the reasonable person to international law. Nowadays known as the standard of the &#x27;reasonable military commander&#x27;, international courts use it to assess the conduct of military officers in times of war.

==History==
The &quot;reasonable man&quot; appeared in Richard Hooker&#x27;s defence of conservatism in religion, the &quot;Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot; (1594-7), where he preferred Papists to Turks and accepted the opinions of religious experts when there was no reason to dissent.

In 1835, Adolphe Quetelet detailed the characteristics of &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen&quot; (French, &quot;average man&quot;). His work is translated into English several ways. As a result, some authors pick &quot;average man&quot;, &quot;common man&quot;, &quot;reasonable man&quot;, or stick to the original &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen&quot;. Quetelet was a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist. He documented the physical characteristics of man on a statistical basis and discussed man&#x27;s motivations when acting in society.

Two years later, the &quot;reasonable person&quot; made his first appearance in the English case of &quot;Vaughan v. Menlove&quot; (1837). In &quot;Menlove&quot;, the defendant had stacked hay on his rental property in a manner prone to spontaneous ignition. After he had been repeatedly warned over the course of five weeks, the hay ignited and burned the defendant&#x27;s barns and stable and then spread to the landlord&#x27;s two cottages on the adjacent property. Menlove&#x27;s attorney admitted his client&#x27;s &quot;misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence,&quot; arguing that negligence should only be found if the jury decided Menlove had not acted with &quot;&quot;bona fide&quot; [and] to the best of his [own] judgment.&quot;

The &quot;Menlove&quot; court disagreed, reasoning that such a standard would be too subjective, instead preferring to set an objective standard for adjudicating cases:
English courts upheld the standard again nearly 20 years later in &quot;Blyth v. Company Proprietors of the Birmingham Water Works.&quot; In the case, Sir Edward Hall Alderson held:
==Rationale==
American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. explained the theory behind the reasonable person standard as stemming from the impossibility of &quot;measuring a man&#x27;s powers and limitations.&quot; Individual, personal quirks inadvertently injuring the persons or property of others are no less damaging than intentional acts. For society to function, &quot;a certain average of conduct, a sacrifice of individual peculiarities going beyond a certain point, is necessary to the general welfare.&quot; Thus, a reasonable application of the law is sought, compatible with planning, working, or getting along with others. As such, &quot;his neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper peril, to come up to their standard, and the courts which they establish decline to take his personal equation into account.&quot; He heralded the reasonable person as a legal fiction whose care conduct under any common set of facts, is chosen—or &quot;learned&quot; permitting there is a compelling consensus of public opinion—by the courts.

The reasonable person standard, contrary to popular conception, is intentionally distinct from that of the &quot;average person,&quot; who is not necessarily guaranteed to always be reasonable. The reasonable person will weigh all of the following factors before acting:
* the foreseeable risk of harm his actions create versus the utility of his actions;
* the extent of the risk so created;
* the likelihood such risk will actually cause harm to others;
* any alternatives of lesser risk, and the costs of those alternatives.
Taking such actions requires the reasonable person to be appropriately informed, capable, aware of the law, and fair-minded. Such a person might do something extraordinary in certain circumstances, but whatever that person does or thinks, it is always reasonable.

The reasonable person has been called an &quot;excellent but odious character.&quot;
English legal scholar Percy Henry Winfield summarized much of the literature by observing that:

==Hand Rule==

Under United States common law, a well known—though nonbinding—test for determining how a reasonable person might weigh the criteria listed above was set down in &quot;United States v. Carroll Towing Co.&quot; in 1947 by the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Learned Hand. The case concerned a barge that had broken her mooring with the dock. Writing for the court, Hand said:
While the test offered by Hand does not encompass all the criteria available above, juries in a negligence case might well still be instructed to take the other factors into consideration in determining whether the defendant was negligent.

The Sedona Conference issued its &quot;Commentary on a Reasonable Security Test&quot; to advance the Hand Rule for a cybersecurity context. The commentary adds three important articulations to the Hand Rule; a person is reasonable if no alternative safeguard would have provided an added benefit that was greater than the added burden, the utility of the risk should be considered as a factor in the calculation (as either a cost or a benefit, depending on the situation), and both qualitative and quantitative factors may be used in the test.

==Personal circumstances==
The legal fiction of the reasonable person is an ideal, as nobody is perfect. Everyone has limitations , so the standard requires only that people act similarly to how &quot;a reasonable person under the circumstances&quot; would, as if their limitations were themselves circumstances. As such, courts require that the reasonable person be viewed as having the same limitations as the defendant.

For example, a disabled defendant is held to a standard that represents how a reasonable person with that same disability would act. This is no excuse for poor judgment, or trying to act beyond one&#x27;s abilities. Were it so, there would be as many standards as there were defendants; and courts would spend innumerable hours, and the parties much more money, on determining that particular defendant&#x27;s . 

By using the reasonable person standard, courts instead use an objective tool and avoid such subjective evaluations. when attempting to determine liability. 

===Children===
One broad allowance made to the reasonable person standard is for children. The standard here requires that a child act in a similar manner to how a &quot;reasonable person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances&quot; would act. In many common law systems, children under the age of 6 or 7 are typically exempt from any liability, whether civil or criminal, as they are deemed to be unable to understand the risk involved in their actions. This is called the defense of infancy: in Latin, &quot;doli incapax.&quot;
In some jurisdictions, one of the exceptions to these allowances concern children engaged in what is primarily considered to be high-risk adult activity, such as operating a motor vehicle, and in some jurisdictions, children can also be &quot;tried as an adult&quot; for serious crimes, such as murder, which causes the court to disregard the defendant&#x27;s age.

===Mentally ill===
The reasonable person standard makes no allowance for the mentally ill. Such a refusal goes back to the standard set in &quot;Menlove&quot;, where Menlove&#x27;s attorney argued for the subjective standard. In the 170 years since, the law has kept to the legal judgment of having only the single, objective standard. Such judicial adherence sends a message that the mentally ill would do better to refrain from taking risk-creating actions, unless they exercise a heightened degree of self-restraint and precaution, if they intend to avoid liability.

Generally, the courts have reasoned that by not accepting mental illness as a bar to recovery, a potentially liable third party, such as a caregiver, will be more likely to protect the public. The courts have also stated the reason that members of the public are unable to identify a mentally ill person, as they can a child or someone with a physical disability.

===Professionals===
When a person attempts a skilful act, the &quot;reasonable person under the circumstances&quot; test is elevated to a standard of whether the person acted how a &quot;reasonable professional under the circumstances&quot; would have, whether or not that person is actually a professional, has training, or has experience. Other factors also become relevant, such as the degree to which a professional is educated (i.e., whether a specialist within the specific field, or just a general practitioner of the trade), and customary practices and general procedures of similar professionals. However, such other relevant factors are never dispositive.

Some professions may maintain a custom or practice long after a better method has become available. The new practices, though less risky, may be entirely ignored. In such cases, the practitioner may very well have acted unreasonably despite following custom or general practices.

====Medical professionals====
In healthcare, plaintiffs must prove via expert testimony the standard of medical care owed and a departure from that standard. The only exception to the requirement of expert testimony is where the departure from accepted medical practices was so egregious that a layperson can readily recognize the departure.

However, controversial medical practices can be deemed reasonable when followed by a respected and reputable minority of the medical field, or where the medical profession cannot agree over which practices are best.

====Armed professionals====
The &quot;reasonable officer&quot; standard is a method often applied to law enforcement and other armed professions to help determine if a use of force was excessive. The test is whether an appropriately trained professional, knowing what the officer knew at the time and following guidelines (such as a force continuum), would have used the same level of force or higher. If the level of force is justified, the quantity of force is usually presumed to have been necessary unless there are other factors. For example, if a trained police officer was justified in fatally shooting a suspect, the number of shots is presumed to have been necessary barring other factors, such as a reckless disregard of others&#x27; safety or that additional force was used when the suspect was no longer a threat.

===Inexperience===
When anyone undertakes a skilful task that creates a risk to others, that person is held to the minimum standard of how a reasonable person experienced in that task would act, regardless of their actual level of experience.

==External circumstances==
Factors beyond the defendant&#x27;s control are always relevant. Additionally, so is the context within which each action is made. Many things affect how a person acts: individual perceptions, knowledge, the weather, etc. The standard of care required depends on the circumstances, but is always that which is reasonable.

While community customs may be relied upon to indicate what kind of action is expected in the circumstances, these are not themselves conclusive of what a reasonable person would do.

It is precisely for this wide-ranging variety of possible facts that the reasonable person standard is so broad (and often confusing and difficult to apply). However, a few general areas of relevant circumstances rise above the others.

===Emergency doctrine===
Allowing for circumstances under which a person must act urgently is important to prevent hindsight bias by the trier of fact. A reasonable person may not always act as they would when more relaxed. It is fair that actions be judged in light of any exigent conditions that could have affected how the defendant acted.

===Available resources===
People must make do with what they have or can get. Such circumstances are relevant to any determination of whether the defendant acted reasonably. Where resources are scarce, some actions may be reasonable that would not be were there plenty.

===Negligence &quot;per se&quot;===

Because a reasonable person is objectively presumed to know the law, noncompliance with a local safety statute may also constitute negligence. The related doctrine of negligence &quot;per se&quot; addresses the circumstances under which the law of negligence can become an implied cause of action for breaching a statutory standard of care. Conversely, minimal compliance with a safety statute does not always absolve a defendant if the trier of fact determines that a reasonable person would have taken actions beyond and in excess of what the statute requires. The trier of fact can deem the defendant&#x27;s duty of care met by finding that the statute&#x27;s standard itself is reasonable and the defendant acted in accordance with what it statute contemplated.

==Reasonable bystander==

For common law contracts, disputes over contract formation are subjected to what is known as the &quot;objective test of assent&quot; in order to determine whether a contract exists. This standard is also known as the officious bystander, &quot;reasonable bystander&quot;, &quot;reasonable third party&quot;, or &quot;reasonable person in the position of the party&quot;. This is in contrast to the subjective test employed in most civil law jurisdictions. The test stems from attempts to balance the competing interests of the judicial policies of assent and of reliability. The former holds that no person ought to be contractually obligated if they did not consent to such an agreement; the latter holds that if no person can rely on actions or words demonstrating consent, then the whole system of commercial exchange will ultimately collapse.

Prior to the 19th century, courts used a test of subjective evaluation; that is, the trier of fact determined each party&#x27;s understanding. If both parties were of the same mind and understanding on matters, then assent was manifested and the contract was valid. Between the 19th and 20th centuries, the courts shifted toward the objectivist test, reasoning that subjective testimony was often unreliable and self-serving.

From those opposite principles, modern law has found its way to a rough middle ground, though it still shows a strong bias toward the objective test. Promises and agreements are reached through manifestations of consent, and parties are liable for actions that deliberately manifest such consent; however, evidence of either party&#x27;s state of mind can be used to determine the context of the manifestation if the evidence is reliable and compatible with the manifestation in question, though such evidence is typically given very little weight.

Another circumstance where the reasonable bystander test is used occurs when one party has inadvertently misstated the terms of the contract, and the other party sues to enforce those terms: if it would have been clear to a reasonable bystander that a mistake had been made, then the contract is voidable by the party who made the error; otherwise, the contract is binding.

==Reasonable person standard for victims==

===Reasonable woman===
==== Sexual harassment ====
A variant of the reasonable person can be found in sexual harassment law as the &quot;reasonable woman&quot; standard. The variation recognizes a difference between men and women regarding the effect of unwanted interaction with a sexual tone. As women have historically been more vulnerable to rape and sex-related violence than have men, some courts believe that the proper perspective for evaluating a claim of sexual harassment is that of the reasonable woman. Notably, Justice Antonin Scalia held that women did not have constitutional protection from discrimination under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause, where by extension of logic, held the &quot;reasonable woman&quot; standard to be of moot value. However, such has not been the majority opinion of the court.

====Satire====
Though the use of the reasonable woman standard has gained traction in some areas of the law, the standard has not escaped the crosshairs of humorists. In 1924, legal humorist A. P. Herbert considered the concept of the reasonable man at length in the fictional case of &quot;Fardell v. Potts.&quot; In Herbert&#x27;s fictional account, the judge addressed the lack of a reasonable woman standard in the common law, and ultimately concluded that &quot;a reasonable woman does not exist.&quot;

===&quot;L&#x27;homme moyen sensuel&quot;===
The concept of &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen sensuel&quot; does not speak of a reasonable person&#x27;s ability, actions, or understandings. Rather it refers to the response of a reasonable person when presented with some form of information either by image or sound, or upon reading a book or magazine. A well-known application of the concept is Judge John M. Woolsey&#x27;s lifting of the ban on the book &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce. That ruling contemplated the effect the book would have upon a reasonable person of reasonable sensibility. Similarly, when the publisher of &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot; was charged in California with publishing an obscene book, the concept of &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen sensuel&quot; influenced the court&#x27;s finding of innocence. It was nearly two decades after Woolsey that the US Supreme Court set down the standard by which materials, when viewed by &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen sensuel&quot;, were judged either obscene or not. Generally, it has been &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen sensuel&quot; that has dictated what is and is not obscene or pornographic in books, movies, pictures, and now the Internet for at least the past 100 years.

===Qualifications===

<text>Médard Chouart des Groseilliers (born 1618) was a French explorer and fur trader in Canada. He is often paired with his brother-in-law Pierre-Esprit Radisson, who was about 20 years younger. The pair worked together in fur trading and exploration. Their decision to enter British service led to the foundation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1670. This company established trading posts and extensive relations with the First Nations in western Canada. It was highly influential in making the region amenable to British colonization. Radisson, with Groseiliers, also mapped many of the Great Lakes and trading routes used by settlers.

==Early life==
Médard Chouart was born in Charly-sur-Marne, Champagne province, France, to Médard Chouart, his father and Marie Poirier. He also had a cousin named Médard Chouart. He later called himself Sieur des Groseilliers after a farm his parents managed in Bassevelle. He was reported to have immigrated to New France in 1641 at age 23, but according to historian Grace Lee Nute, this has never been proven. He became a &quot;donné&quot; or lay helper at the Jesuit missions in the Huron region near present-day Simcoe County, Ontario. Here he learned the skills of a coureur des bois. In 1646, Groseilliers fought with the Huron against the Iroquois.

On 3 September 1647 Groseilliers married the widowed Helène Martin, the daughter of Abraham Martin, whose land surrounding Quebec City later became famous as the Plains of Abraham. Their first child died in 1648. Their second child, also named Médard, was born in 1651, the same year Helène died. After the Iroquois destroyed the Huron missions and forced the people to move further west in the late 1640s, Groseilliers worked to re-establish trade, especially in the Lake Superior region.

In 1653, Groseilliers travelled to Acadia to meet with Claude de la Tour and returned to New France in July and established himself at Trois-Rivières. There he married his second wife, Marguérite Hayet, (sometimes spelled Hayot) the widowed step-sister of Pierre-Esprit Radisson and from whom he inherited his lands in Trois-Rivières. Two sons from her first marriage became troublesome. In 1654, Groseilliers petitioned the governor of New France to find the boys another guardian, which was accepted. His first child by Marguérite, Jean Baptiste, was baptized on 5 July 1654. His second child by Marguérite, also named Marguérite, was baptized on 15 April 1659 and his third child, Marie-Antoinette, was baptized on 8 June 1661.

==As a fur trader==
===French service===

In August 1654, Groseilliers was sent west along with an unknown partner, to journey west to the new Huron lands. The voyage took two years to complete and upon returning in August 1656, they carried in their canoes reports of contact with several First Nations, among them the Sioux, Pottawattomi, Winnebago and Fox peoples and furs worth &quot;14 to 15 thousand livres&quot;. Leaving in August 1659, Groseilliers and Radisson traveled west to the far end of Lake Superior and wintered at Lac Courte Oreilles in what is now known as Wisconsin. According to Radisson&#x27;s account of the voyage, they helped repel an Iroquois attack along the Ottawa River and that the idea for trading furs from Hudson Bay came to them at this time. They returned in the summer of 1660 and upon return to New France, they were fined most of their profits by the colonial government because they had left New France without a license.

This journey demonstrated that the French could find riches in the interior of the continent and this led more Frenchmen to go west, with seven heading to Lake Superior within the year. From Cree traders, the French men came to understand that the main source of furs lay northwest of the lake. In 1661, Groseilliers traveled to France to appeal the fine without success and returned to New France the same year. Groseilliers and Radisson proposed creating a trading company for the furs to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of finance under King Louis XIV. Colbert thought it a waste of resources and refused to support the project. In Spring 1662, Groseilliers and Radisson intended to journey to the west via the Hudson Bay region. In order to get to Hudson Bay from Isle Percée, Groseilliers intended to charter a vessel. However, the plans fell through and Groseilliers and Radisson instead searched further south in New England in hope of finding a suitable vessel.

=== Formation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ===
Groseilliers and Radisson traveled to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They organized another expedition into Hudson Bay in 1663, but it was turned back by the ice. At Boston in 1665 they met Sir George Cartwright, who told them to travel to England to gain support. Captured by Dutch privateers on the voyage, the French men were put ashore in Spain. Reaching England, they were presented to King Charles II and became associated with Prince Rupert. Eventually Prince Rupert chartered two vessels for Radisson and Groseilliers.

In 1668 two ships left England for Hudson Bay: under the command of Zachariah Gillam with Groseilliers as his second and &quot;Eaglet&quot; with William Stannard as captain and Radisson as his second. &quot;Eaglet&quot; was caught in a storm, was damaged and forced to return to England. &quot;Nonsuch&quot; made it to Hudson Bay and continued south, into James Bay. &quot;Nonsuch&quot; reached the mouth of the Rupert River which was named after their benefactor. They landed near what is now the town of Waskaganish, Quebec, where they built a fort and wintered there. The expedition returned to England in 1669 with a rich cargo of furs.

The haul of furs impressed King Charles and led Prince Rupert and his fellow investors to create the &quot;Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudsons Bay&quot;, also known as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, on 2 May 1670. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was given monopoly over the area of land that would become known as Rupert&#x27;s Land. From 1670 to 1675, Groseilliers and Radisson were employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, voyaging into Hudson Bay to establish trading posts, forts and exploring the area. Their activities were watched with interest by the French whose economy suffered from the arrival of English fur traders.

===Return to French service===

In 1674, a French Jesuit priest, Charles Albanel, was sent north into Hudson Bay. Captured by representatives of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Albanel was sent to England as a prisoner. In England he convinced Groseilliers and Radisson to return to French service. Groseilliers traveled to France and spent the year before returning to New France in 1676.

On 20 May 1682 the French created their own fur-trading company, called &quot;La Compagnie de la Baie d’Hudson&quot; or &quot;Compagnie du Nord&quot;, given charter by the French government. The company was created to compete with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Groseilliers joined the company and with Radisson, sailed north to the Hayes and Nelson Rivers to create a French trading post. Similar expeditions from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and a group from Boston under the leadership of Benjamin Gillam arrived at the same time. The three groups fought with the experienced leadership of Radisson and Groseilliers coming out victorious. They took the majority of the Bostonians and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company personnel captive, including the new governor of Hudson Bay, John Bridgar and seized furs from their former employer.

Upon their return to New France, the two Frenchmen found that their actions had angered the British and alarmed French officials. In order to cover the British losses the &quot;Compagnie du Nord&quot; was forced to pay taxes on their furs. Radisson and Groseilliers sailed to France in 1683 for adjudication on the tax matter. The French government found in favour of the British, whose leader the Duke of York was France&#x27;s best chance to re-convert the English back to Catholicism. While in France, Groseilliers refused an offer to rejoin the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and returned to his farm at Trois-Rivières. His final fate is unknown.

<doc id="299175" wikidata="Q5927098" url="?curid=299175" title="Papelucho">
<text>Papelucho is the main character in a series of children&#x27;s books created by Chilean writer Marcela Paz. Twelve books were published between 1947 and 1974. The series became a classic among books for children in Chile.

The books are written in the form of diaries by the title character, a middle-class, eight-year-old Chilean boy in Santiago. Papelucho is able to find interest and humour in everyday life, and does this by means of an exuberant fantasy, a strong sense of observation and ridicule, and highly developed originality and creativity. In this respect it shows similarity with other widely read works of the European children&#x27;s literature, which also depict the adventures of children&#x27;s everyday life, such as Goscinny and Sempé&#x27;s Le petit Nicolas series, Richmal Crompton&#x27;s Just William series, and Elena Fortún&#x27;s Celia books.

The first book of the series, &quot;Papelucho&quot;, was published in 1947, after it won an award in a contest arranged by a young Chilean publishing house, Rapa Nui. The illustrations were by Yolanda Huneeus, a sister of the author. The book very quickly became a bestseller in Chile and one edition followed another. Eleven books followed; the last one appeared in 1974: &quot;Am I Dys-Lazy?&quot;

The sales of the series, in all editions starting from 1947, summed in 2007 up to more than five million copies sold. It is listed as &quot;recommended reading&quot; at Chilean schools and is currently (2011) edited by Random House in Santiago, Chile.

== Awards ==
Chile&#x27;s main award in letters, the Premio Nacional de Literatura, was given to Marcela Paz in 1982, a few years before her death in 1985. In 1968, &quot;Papelucho the Missionary&quot; was a candidate for the Hans Christian Andersen Award from the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) in Amrisville, Switzerland.

There are adaptations for the theater and as comics (2011).

==Translations==
A French edition of the first book in the series came out in 1951 in the collection &quot;Rouge et Bleu&quot; (GP publishers, translated and adapted by G. Tyl-Cambier). The text was adapted and published with coloured illustrations as a large format book, which was very successful, 25,000 copies being rapidly sold and a second edition appearing two years later. In 1980 a new French edition appeared and survived several changes in the editing house: Bordas being succeeded by Pocket, then Havas Poche, until the end of the nineties.

The Japanese publishing house Kodansha published in 1972 a Japanese translation with drawings by Marcela Claro Huneeus, the author&#x27;s daughter. A Greek edition was published by Kedros, Athens, 1984. And recently Anicia in Rome has published an Italian translation of four of the books.

There is also a bilingual Spanish-English edition, which was available in Chile at the end of 2006. The English translation was made by Linda Craddock, Ailsa Shaw and Jean Paul Beuchat. This translation doesn&#x27;t include the last three books, unpublished at the time.

==Movie==

Cine Animadores and Canal 13 Films released in 2007 the film &quot;Papelucho and the Martian&quot;, loosely based on the book of the same name.

==Comic book==
&quot;Papelucho&quot; was also adapted into a comics series, drawn by Walter Carzon.

==Bibliography==

<text>Rhode Island College (RIC) is a public college in Rhode Island, United States, with much of the land in Providence, and other parts in North Providence. The college was established in 1854 as the Rhode Island State Normal School, making it the second-oldest institution of higher education in Rhode Island after Brown University. Located on a campus, the college has a student body of 9,000: 7,518 undergraduates and 1,482 graduate students. RIC is a member of the NCAA and has 17 Division III teams.

== History ==

Rhode Island College was first established as the Rhode Island State Normal School by the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1854. Its creation can be attributed to the labors of Henry Barnard, the first state agent for education in Rhode Island who had established the Rhode Island Teachers Institute at Smithville Seminary in 1845, and his successor, Elisha Potter. The Rhode Island State Normal School was one of the nation&#x27;s first normal schools (teacher preparatory schools), which grew out of the humanitarian groundswell of the mid-19th century spurred by educational missionaries like Horace Mann. The school attracted hard working young people who came chiefly from ordinary backgrounds.

Not yet thoroughly convinced of the school&#x27;s value, the General Assembly curtailed its financial support in 1857 and the school was moved to Bristol where it lingered until 1865 before closing. However, in 1869, the newly appointed state commissioner of education, Thomas W. Bicknell, began a vigorous personal campaign to revive the school. His efforts were rewarded in 1871 when the General Assembly unanimously voted a $10,000 appropriation for the school&#x27;s re-opening in Providence.

Renamed the Rhode Island Normal School, the institution settled into a period of steady growth punctuated by periodic moves to larger quarters. The general favor won by the school, after its first difficult years had passed, was confirmed in 1898 when it moved into a large building specially constructed for it on Providence&#x27;s Capitol Hill near the State House.

In 1920, the Rhode Island Normal School was renamed Rhode Island College of Education by order of the General Assembly. The college now offered a four-year program which upon a student&#x27;s completion would grant a Bachelor of Education degree. At this time the observation school, which dated back to the 1890s, was renamed the Henry Barnard School. The college&#x27;s graduate program also originated in the early 1920s and the first master&#x27;s degrees were conferred in 1924.

For the next three decades the college remained a teachers&#x27; college with a student body of four to six hundred men and women. Early in the 1950s that calm was shattered by intense debate that arose over the college&#x27;s role in the state system of higher education and for a time serious doubt was cast on its continued existence. There were plans to merge the institution with Rhode Island&#x27;s other four-year college, the University of Rhode Island. After careful consideration, the Board of Trustees of State Colleges decided to keep the college independent and strengthen it overall.

In 1958, the college was moved to its current campus in the Mount Pleasant section of Providence. In 1959, the Rhode Island Commission to Study Higher Education recommended the development of the institution into a general college which was approved by the General Assembly. Reflecting the broadening of purpose, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to its current name Rhode Island College in 1959.

The East Campus includes the former grounds of the Rhode Island State Home and School for Dependent and Neglected Children, the first post-Civil War orphanage in the country. In recent years, many efforts have been undertaken by Rhode Island College and its benefactors to preserve the Yellow Cottage (or Cottage C), one of the original structures from the State Home.

===Principals and presidents===
The president is the chief executive officer; prior to 1920, the chief academic officer of the college was known as the &quot;principal&quot;. Jack R. Warner is the eleventh president, and 19th chief officer of Rhode Island College, starting his position in 2022. On January 6, 2022, previous president Frank Sánchez announced that he would not seek a third term as president of the college; his term ended on June 30, 2022 and was replaced by Jack R. Warner.

==Academics==
Academic programs at Rhode Island College are divided into five colleges: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Feinstein School of Education and Human Development, the School of Business, the School of Nursing, and the School of Social Work. These schools offer more than 90 undergraduate and 30 graduate programs for students. Rhode Island College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. Among the five colleges, individual departments have received additional accreditation from the following associations: Council on Social Work Education, National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Association of Schools of Music, National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked the college 618th.

==Student life==

Enrollment is predominantly from Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Of the students, 67% are female.

The school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Anchor&quot;, has been running since 1928 as an independent, student-run publication. Its radio station is 90.7 WXIN Rhode Island College Radio.

Student activities and clubs on campus are governed and funded by Student Community Government, Inc., a semi-autonomous organization financed by the college&#x27;s student activity fee, consisting of an executive board, parliament, and several committees. Student Parliament consists of 34 student positions and a number of by-lawed positions. Those positions include seats taken by administrators, faculty, staff and alumni. All student representatives of Student Parliament represent a constituency whose concerns they are supposed to represent throughout the academic year.

The James P. Adams Library is the main library. Students, faculty, staff, and the community have access to a wide variety of knowledge resources including electronic reference resources, e-books, databases, audiovisual materials, and special collections. The library is also the academic, social, and intellectual center of the campus, hosting a variety of lectures, exhibits and performances to the benefit of the campus community.

RIC has six residence halls which house 1,194 undergraduate students. Penfield Hall, a new $30 million, energy efficient, LEED-certified residence hall opened in 2007. The building expanded the institution&#x27;s existing housing capacity by 44%.

The Unity Center is non-denominational with many religions, ethnic groups, and academic concentrations represented.

===Greek life===
Rhode Island College has recently seen an increase in Greek life on campus. The Greek Council consists of two fraternities and three NPC sororities, as well as numerous multicultural organizations. Fraternities at Rhode Island College include Alpha Sigma Phi and Kappa Sigma. Sororities at Rhode Island College are Alpha Sigma Tau, Delta Phi Epsilon, Theta Phi Alpha, and Zeta Phi Beta.

===Athletics===
Rhode Island College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Anchormen are a member of the Little East Conference.

===Arts===
The Rhode Island College Department of Music, Theatre, and Dance was established in 1972.

Theatre students in the program have been top competitors at the Region I Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, either winning first, second or honorable distinction. Professional choreographers and celebrated filmmakers are often guests of the program.

In September 2020, The Recording Academy placed the Rhode Island College Concert Chorus on the Official Ballot for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards for their virtual performance of &quot;When I Think of You.&quot; The chorus earned their Grammy Award Considerations in two categories: Best Pop Duo or Group Performance and Best Music Video. This was the first Grammy Award Consideration for a music performance group at Rhode Island College in the school&#x27;s history. On October 2, 2020, Rhode Island College President Dr. Frank Sánchez hosted an event at Sapinsley Hall for music producers Al Gomes (class of 1986) and Connie Watrous, along with Chorus Conductor and Professor of Music Teresa Coffman, to announce the Grammy Awards news live to the entire Rhode Island College community including administration, staff, students, and alumni.

<text>Creo Parametric, formerly known, together with Creo Elements/Pro, as Pro/Engineer (commonly referred to as Pro E) and Wildfire, is a solid modeling or computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and associative 3D modeling application, to run on Microsoft Windows.

&quot;Creo Parametric&quot; should not be confused with &quot;Creo Elements/Direct Modeling&quot;, formerly CoCreate ME10 (2D) and or ME30 (3D) CAD Products. The ex-CoCreate CAD Products are now owned by PTC and renamed &quot;Creo Elements/Direct Drafting&quot; and &quot;Creo Elements/Direct Modeling&quot;.

&quot;Creo Parametric&quot; is an application of a suite of 10 that provide collaborative solid modeling, assembly modelling, 2D orthographic views, finite element analysis, parametric modelling, sub-divisional and non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surface modeling, technical drawing (drafting), and numerical control (NC) and tooling functionality for mechanical designers.

Creo Parametric competes directly with CATIA, SolidWorks, NX/Solid Edge, Inventor/Fusion 360, IRONCAD, and Onshape. It was created by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) and was the first of its kind to market.

The software uses a specific file naming scheme, not allowing certain characters like ä, ö, é, ő, ł, Đ, ... (including spaces).

==Overview==

Creo Parametric (formerly Pro/Engineer), PTC&#x27;s parametric, integrated 3D CAD/CAM/CAE software, is used by manufacturers for mechanical engineering, design, and manufacturing.

Pro/Engineer was the industry&#x27;s first rule-based constraint (sometimes called &quot;parametric&quot; or &quot;variational&quot;) 3D CAD modeling system. The parametric modeling approach uses parameters, dimensions, features, and relationships to capture intended model behavior. This design approach can be family-based or platform-driven, where the strategy is to use engineering constraints and relationships to quickly optimize the design, or where the resulting geometry may be complex or based upon equations. Creo Parametric provides a complete set of design, analysis and manufacturing abilities on one, integral, scalable platform. These required abilities include solid modeling, surfacing, rendering, data Interoperability, routed systems design, simulation, tolerance analysis, numerical control (NC) and tooling design.

Creo Parametric can be used to create a complete 3D digital model of manufactured goods. The models consist of 2D and 3D solid model data which can also be used downstream in finite element analysis, rapid prototyping, tooling design, and CNC manufacturing. All data are associative and interchangeable between the CAD, CAE, and CAM modules without data conversion. A product and its entire bill of materials (BOM) can be modeled accurately with fully associative engineering drawings, and revision control information. The associativity functionality in Creo Parametric enables users to make changes in the design at any time during the product development process and automatically update the end products. This ability enables concurrent engineering – design, analysis and manufacturing engineers working in parallel – and streamlines product development processes.

==Summary of abilities==

Creo Parametric is a software application within the CAID/CAD/CAM/CAE category.

Creo Parametric is a parametric, feature-based modeling architecture incorporated into a single database philosophy with rule-based design abilities. It provides in-depth control of complex geometry. The abilities of the product can be split into the three main headings of Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing. This data is then documented in a standard 2D production drawing or the 3D drawing standard ASME Y14.41-2003.

=== Product design ===

Creo Parametric offers a range of tools to enable the generation of a complete digital representation of the product being designed. In addition to the general geometry tools there is also the ability to generate geometry of other integrated design disciplines such as industrial and standard pipe work and complete wiring definitions. Tools are also available to support collaborative development.

A number of concept design tools that provide up-front Industrial Design concepts can then be used in the downstream process of engineering the product. These range from conceptual Industrial design sketches, reverse engineering with point cloud data and comprehensive free-form surface.

=== Analysis ===

Creo Parametric has numerous analysis tools available and covers thermal, static, dynamic and fatigue finite element analysis along with other tools all designed to help with the development of the product. These tools include human factors, manufacturing tolerance, mould flow and design optimization. The design optimization can be used at a geometry level to obtain the optimum design dimensions and in conjunction with the finite element analysis.

=== Surface modeling ===
Creo Parametric has good surface modeling abilities, using commands like Boundary blend and Sweep. Advanced options like Style (Interactive Surface Design Extension - ISDX) and Freestyle provide more abilities to create complex models easily.

=== Manufacturing ===

By using the fundamental abilities of the software with regards to the single data source principle, it provides a rich set of tools in the manufacturing environment in the form of tooling design and simulated CNC machining and output.

Tooling options cover specialty tools for molding, die-casting and progressive tooling design.

==Release history==
The UNIX version was discontinued after 4.0, except x86-64 Unix on Solaris. It was renamed Creo 1.0 after Pro/Engineer Wildfire 5.0 (rebranded PTC Creo Elements/Pro), occurred on October 28, 2010, which coincided with PTC&#x27;s announcement of Creo, a new design software application suite.

For the first 10 years, PTC generally released 2 versions per year, with some exceptions. The initial release (Rev 1) was in 1988.

<text>In physics, chemistry, and materials science, percolation () refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. It is described by Darcy&#x27;s law. Broader applications have since been developed that cover connectivity of many systems modeled as lattices or graphs, analogous to connectivity of lattice components in the filtration problem that modulates capacity for percolation.

==Background==
During the last decades, percolation theory, the mathematical study of percolation, has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics, materials science, complex networks, epidemiology, and other fields. For example, in geology, percolation refers to filtration of water through soil and permeable rocks. The water flows to recharge the groundwater in the water table and aquifers. In places where infiltration basins or septic drain fields are planned to dispose of substantial amounts of water, a percolation test is needed beforehand to determine whether the intended structure is likely to succeed or fail.
In two dimensional square lattice percolation is defined as follows. A site is &quot;occupied&quot; with
probability p or &quot;empty&quot; (in which case its edges are removed) with probability 1 – p; the
corresponding problem is called site percolation, see Fig. 2.

Percolation typically exhibits universality. Statistical physics concepts such as scaling theory, renormalization, phase transition, critical phenomena and fractals are used to characterize percolation properties.
Combinatorics is commonly employed to study percolation thresholds.

Due to the complexity involved in obtaining exact results from analytical models of percolation, computer simulations are typically used. The current fastest algorithm for percolation was published in 2000 by Mark Newman and Robert Ziff.

==Examples==
* Coffee percolation (see Fig. 1), where the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma.
* Movement of weathered material down on a slope under the earth&#x27;s surface.
* Cracking of trees with the presence of two conditions, sunlight and pressure.
* Collapse and robustness of biological virus shells to random subunit removal (experimentally-verified fragmentation of viruses).
* Transport in porous media.
* Spread of diseases.
* Surface roughening.
* Dental percolation, increase rate of decay under crowns because of a conducive environment for strep mutants and lactobacillus
* Potential sites for septic systems are tested by the &quot;perc test&quot;. Example/theory: A hole (usually 6–10 inches in diameter) is dug in the ground surface (usually 12–24&quot; deep). Water is filled in to the hole, and the time is measured for a drop of one inch in the water surface. If the water surface quickly drops, as usually seen in poorly-graded sands, then it is a potentially good place for a septic &quot;leach field&quot;. If the hydraulic conductivity of the site is low (usually in clayey and loamy soils), then the site is undesirable.

<text>Ali Kelmendi (3 November 1900 – 11 February 1939) was a Kosovar Albanian communist, an organizer of the communist movement in Albania and was posthumously a Hero of Albania under the communist government.

==Life and career==
Ali Kelmendi was born on 3 November 1900 in a poor peasant family in the town of İpek in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (in present-day Kosovo), son of Sulejman Kelmendi. In 1920 he fled to Albania after all communist activities were banned in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There he joined the left-wing political movement &quot;Bashkimi&quot; (English:&quot;Unity&quot;) of Avni Rustemi, Llazar Fundo, and Fuat Asllani.

In June 1924, he participated in the resurgence led by Fan Noli in Albania as a fighter. After the fall of Noli&#x27;s regime (December 1924) he emigrated to Brindisi, Italy, thereafter to Austria. Kelmendi joined the anti-Zogist group KONARE (, ) founded by Noli.

On 8 October 1925 Kelmendi went then to the Soviet Union together with other 13 Albanians based on a study-related invitation from COMINTERN. He passed one year in the Dzerzhinsky Academy in Leningrad (today&#x27;s &quot;Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich&quot;), and after that he moved to Odessa to work as customs official. There he joined the Albanian communist group affiliated to the Balkan Confederation of Communist Parties belonging to the Communist International.

In 1930, the Communist International sent Kelmendi to Albania as an organizer of the communist movement. He also made some organizational work in Kosovo. However, his work bore no considerable fruit since Marxism hadn&#x27;t found any favorable soil in Albania and the clandestine work was very difficult because of the activity of the security police. Kelmendi was arrested several times and in 1936 he was exiled. He went shortly back to Russia in March 1932, and after the exile from Albania to Greece and then Moscow. He later server as an intermediary between COMINTERN and Albanian communist groups. Kelmendi participated in the Spanish Civil War, fighting with the Garibaldi International Brigade.

In 1939, he edited a propagandist newspaper in France together with other Albanian communists. He died in Paris, France, on 11 February 1939 after complications from a stomach surgery, while suffering from tuberculosis.

<text>Paul Peuerl (also &quot;Bäurl, Beuerlin, Bäwerl, Agricola, Peyerl&quot;; 13 June 1570 (baptised), in Stuttgart – after 1625) was a German organist, organ builder, renovator and repairer, and composer of instrumental music.

From November 1601 he was organist in Horn and from late 1609 in Steyr. He built organs in Steyr, Horn, Enns, and Wilhering. Peuerl wrote the earliest published trio sonatas outside of Italy. His work on the suite form was for his time significant and influential. In 1625 he fled Steyr for religious reasons; his fate afterwards is unknown.

Musicologists began to research his work in 1865. A complete edition was published in 1929.

<doc id="299202" wikidata="Q182791" url="?curid=299202" title="Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (; 11 May 1827 – 12 October 1875) was a French sculptor and painter during the Second Empire under Napoleon III.

== Life ==
Born in Valenciennes, Nord, son of a mason, his early studies were under François Rude. Carpeaux entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1844 and won the Prix de Rome in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of Michelangelo, Donatello and Verrocchio. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of baroque art. Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition.

Carpeaux debuted at the Salon in 1853 exhibiting &quot;La Soumission d&#x27;Abd-el-Kader al&#x27;Empereur&quot;, a bas-relief in plaster that did not attract much attention. Carpeaux was an admirer of Napoléon III and followed him from city to city during Napoléon&#x27;s official trip through the north of France. After initially not making any contact with the emperor, he finally succeeded in arranging a face-to-face encounter at Amiens where he managed to convince Napoléon to commission a marble statue that was to be carried out by a practitioner, Charles Romain Capellaro.

Carpeaux soon grew tired of academicism and became a wanderer on the streets of Rome. He spent free time admiring the frescoes of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. Carpeaux said, &quot;When an artist feels pale and cold, he runs to Michelangelo in order to warm himself, as with the rays of the sun&quot;.

While a student in Rome, Carpeaux submitted a plaster version of &quot;Pêcheur napolitain à la coquille&quot;, the &quot;Neapolitan Fisherboy&quot;, to the French Academy. He carved the marble version several years later, showing it in the Salon exhibition of 1863. It was purchased for Napoleon III&#x27;s empress, Eugénie. The statue of the young smiling boy was very popular, and Carpeaux created a number of reproductions and variations in marble and bronze. There is a copy, for instance, in the Samuel H. Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Some years later, he carved the &quot;Girl with a Shell&quot;, a similar study.

In 1861, he made a bust of Princess Mathilde, and this later brought him several commissions from Napoleon III. Then in 1866, he established his own atelier in order to reproduce and make work on a grander scale.
In 1866, he was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour.

He employed his brother as the sales manager and made a calculated effort to produce work that would appeal to a larger audience.
On 12 October 1875, he died at George Barbu Știrbei&#x27;s &quot;château&quot; in Bécon-les-Bruyères, outside Courbevoie.

Among his students were Jules Dalou, Jean-Louis Forain and the American sculptor Olin Levi Warner.

== Work ==
* &quot;Ugolin et ses fils&quot; (&quot;Ugolino and His Sons&quot;) (1861; Metropolitan Museum of Art) with versions in other museums including the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris.
* &quot;The Dance&quot;, commissioned for the Opera Garnier in 1869, featuring several nude figures in a wild and boisterous dance, criticized as an offense to common decency
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Neapolitan Fisherboy&quot;) (Musée du Louvre, Paris)
* &quot;Young girl with a shell&quot;, Valenciennes

* &quot;Fontaine de l&#x27;Observatoire&quot;, also known as the &quot;Carpeaux Fountain&quot;, south of the Jardin du Luxembourg. Partly complete at his death, Carpeaux finished the terrestrial globe with the cardinal points represented by the four figures of Asia (East), Europe (North), America (West) and Africa (South).
* &quot;L&#x27;Amour à la folie&quot;, part of a group &quot;La Danse&quot; for the facade of the Opera Garnier (1869)

<doc id="299207" wikidata="Q625463" url="?curid=299207" title="Roi Et province">
<text>Roi Et (, ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in central northeastern Thailand also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Kalasin, Mukdahan, Yasothon, Sisaket, Surin, and Maha Sarakham.

==Toponymy==
The name of the province literally means &#x27;one hundred and one&#x27; (; ). Correctly, the number should be &quot;eleven&quot; (; ), as the province was named after its eleven ancient gates built for its eleven vassal states. In ancient times, the number &quot;eleven&quot; was written &quot;๑๐๑&quot; (101) and the provincial name was written accordingly. Later, people took &quot;๑๐๑&quot; to mean &#x27;one hundred and one&#x27; and have since then called it &quot;Roi Et&quot;.

==Geography==
Most of the province is covered by plains about 130–160 meters above sea level, drained by the Chi River. In the north are the hills of the Phu Phan mountain range. The Yang River is the major watercourse. In the south is the Mun River, which also forms the boundary with Surin. At the mouth of the Chi River, where it enters the Mun River, a floodplain provides a good rice farming area. The total forest area is or 4.4 percent of provincial area.

==History==
The area was already settled at the time of the Khmer empire, as several ruins show. However, the main history of the province began when Lao people from Champasak settled near Suwannaphum during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In the late-18th century, King Taksin moved the city to its present site, then called &quot;Saket Nakhon&quot;.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the shrine of the city pillar, which is in the artificial lake &quot;Bueng Phalan Chai&quot;. The spirit of the shrine, Mahesak, is revered by local people.

The provincial tree is &quot;Lagerstroemia macrocarpa&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is the spiny eel &quot;Macrognathus siamensis&quot;. It is an ingredient in making a &quot;namya&quot; (curry sauce) for eating with &quot;khanom chin&quot; (rice vermicelli), a local delicacy.

==Transportation==
===Road===
Route 214 leads north to Kalasin and south to Kaset Wiset, Surin, and Prasat. Route 2044 leads east to Phon Thong. Route 23 leads west to Maha Sarakham and Ban Phai, and east to Yasothon and Ubon Ratchathani. Route 215 leads south to Suwannaphum and the border with Surin province.

===Air===
Roi Et is served by Roi Et Airport to the north of the town.Thai AirAsia operates daily flights to Don Mueang Airport 470 kilometers away.

== Health ==
Roi Et&#x27;s main hospital is Roi Et Hospital, a regional hospital operated by the Ministry of Public Health.
==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===

The province is divided into 20 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 193 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 2,311 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Roi Et Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 73 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Roi Et has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 72 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 129 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>Earl of Castlehaven was a title in the Peerage of Ireland, created on 6 September 1616. It was held in conjunction with the Barony of Audley (created 1312 in the Peerage of England), the Barony of Audley of Orier (created with the earldom in the Peerage of Ireland), and the Barony of Audley of Hely (created for the third Earl in 1633, in the Peerage of England).

Upon the attainder and execution of the second earl for sodomy, under the Buggery Act 1533 in 1631, he forfeited his English peerage, but not his Irish titles; this was because his English barony of Audley had been created for &quot;heirs general&quot;, but his Irish earldom and barony was an entailed honour protected by statute &quot;De Donis&quot;. His son, the third earl, was created &quot;Baron Audley of Hely&quot; on 3 June 1633 by letters patent, with the precedence of his grandfather, in an attempt to restore to him the original &quot;Barony of Audley&quot;. However, this was deemed insufficient to do so; a bill was passed in Parliament in 1678 which allowed him to inherit the original Barony despite the attainder. Within months he was barred from the House of Lords as a Roman Catholic under the Second Test Act.

With the death of the eighth earl, the Earldom of Castlehaven and the Baronies of Audley of Hely and Audley of Orier became extinct. The Barony of Audley created by writ of 1312 devolved upon his nephew, George Thicknesse, 19th Baron Audley.

<text>Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven (1593 – 14 May 1631; also spelled &quot;Mervin, Touchet&quot;), was an English nobleman who was convicted of rape and sodomy and subsequently executed.

A son of George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven and 11th Baron Audley, by his wife, Lucy Mervyn, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Audley during his father&#x27;s lifetime, so is sometimes referred to as Mervyn Audley.

He was knighted by James I in 1608, before he studied law at the Middle Temple. He served as Member of the Parliament of England for Dorset in the Addled Parliament of 1614 and was a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire. He succeeded his father on 20 February 1616 or 1617 as Earl of Castlehaven and Baron Audley. He left six children upon his death.

Sometime before 1608 (records of the marriage are lacking), Lord Audley married Elizabeth Barnham, a sister-in-law of the philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon, and with her, he had six children. By all accounts the marriage was a loving and successful one, ending with her death in 1622. His second marriage, on 22 July 1624, at Harefield, Middlesex, was to the former Lady Anne Stanley (1580–1647), elder daughter and co-heiress of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (by his wife, Alice Spencer), and widow of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos. They had a daughter, Anne Touchet, who died young. Lady Anne was significantly older than Castlehaven, and the marriage was not a success, but in 1628 Lord Castlehaven&#x27;s son was married to her thirteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth; a marriage of step-children.

==Trial on charges of rape and sodomy==
In 1630, Castlehaven was publicly accused of allowing another man to rape his wife and committing sodomy with two of his servants. Castlehaven&#x27;s son, James, claimed that it was the extent of Castlehaven&#x27;s &quot;uxoriousness&quot; toward his male favourites which led to his initial lodging of a complaint.

At a trial by his peers, it was stated that one such favourite, Henry Skipwith, had arrived at Fonthill Gifford in 1621 and that within a few years he was so close to Castlehaven that he sat at the family&#x27;s table and was to be addressed as &quot;Mister Skipwith&quot; by the servants. Several years later, Giles Broadway arrived at the house and received similar treatment. It was not long before Castlehaven was providing Skipwith with an annual pension, and he was accused of attempting to have Skipwith inseminate both Anne and her daughter Elizabeth, to produce an heir from Skipwith instead of his son.

Charges were brought against Castlehaven on the complaint of his eldest son and heir, who feared disinheritance, and were heard by the Privy Council under the direction of Thomas Coventry, Lord High Steward. Lady Castlehaven gave evidence of a household which she said was infested with debauchery, and the Attorney-General acting for the prosecution explained to the court that Castlehaven had become ill because &quot;he believed not God&quot;, an impiety which made Castlehaven unsafe. However, he insisted he was not guilty and that his wife and son had conspired together in an attempt to commit judicial murder. All witnesses against Castlehaven would gain materially by his death (as the defendant put it: &quot;It is my estate, my Lords, that does accuse me this day, and nothing else&quot;) and &quot;News writers throughout England and as far away as Massachusetts Bay speculated about the outcome.&quot;

Castlehaven maintained his innocence, and the trial aroused considerable public debate. After some deliberation, the Privy Council returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the charge of rape. The sodomy charge was also upheld, but by a slim margin as not all jurors agreed that actual penetration had taken place. The case remains of interest to some as an early trial concerning male homosexuality, but ultimately its greatest influence proved to be as a precedent in spousal rights, as it became the leading case establishing an injured wife&#x27;s right to testify against her husband.

Castlehaven was convicted for his sexual crimes: namely the &quot;unnatural crime&quot; of sodomy, committed with his page Laurence (or Florence) FitzPatrick; and assisting Giles Browning (alias Broadway) in the rape of his wife Anne, Countess of Castlehaven, in which Lord Castlehaven was found to have participated by restraining her. Attainder was decreed. Under the terms of the attainder, Castlehaven forfeited his English barony of Audley, created for &quot;heirs general&quot;, but retained his Irish earldom and barony since it was an entailed honour protected by the statute &quot;De Donis&quot;.

==Confession of Faith and Execution==

In the days leading up to Castlehaven&#x27;s execution, Thomas Winniffe the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s and a Doctor Wickham visited Castlehaven daily, both to comfort him and settle him in his religion. Winniffe drafted a Confession of Faith and Castlehaven signed it.

On Saturday 14 May 1631, Castlehaven, accompanied by Winniffe and others, left the Tower of London and ascended the scaffold at Tower Hill which had been constructed for his execution. Concerned about rumours suggesting his lack of faith had prompted his downfall, he said the following to the assembled crowd:

&quot;Now forasmuch as there hath been speech and rumour of my unsettledness in my religion, I have for explanation, thereof, not only made Confession of my Faith to two worthy doctors; but for better satisfaction to the world in that point, express the same in writing under my hand signed; which as it is here set down, I desire may be publicly read.&quot;

That signed Confession of Faith was then read aloud on the scaffold by a young gentleman:

In the name of God Amen

I Mervyn Earle of Castlehaven, being in my full strength and memorie (thanks bee given unto my maker) having been branded and openlie accused for change, alteration and doubtfulness of my faith and religion, if thoughtfull like a Christian man to give satisfacction upon what grounds I stand for my belieifes and to express it under my hand for the satisfaccion of all charitable people &amp; Christian men. 

First I doe believe in the blessed and glorious Trinity three persones and one eternall and everliving God, God the Father, God my Redeemer, &amp; God my Sanctifier. I doe rely wholie upon the merit death and passion of oue blessed Saviour Christ Jesus and upon his mediation for the remission of my Sinnes. 

I doe believe and use wth most humble reverence Our Lordes praire, the Creed of the Apostles, and the ten Comandemts as they are sett downe &amp; allowed by the Church of England. 

I doe believe the Canonicall Scriptures, and that they are written by the inspiration of the holie Spiritt. 

I doe believe the booke of Comon praier allowed in the Church of England to bee an excellent forme for the Service of God and soe use the same, and for the rest of my beliefe I doe referr it to the true Orthodox faith of oue Church of England and from the Articles received att this present In the Church of England and confirmed by Authoritie of Parliament I doe not differ in any point, renouncing all the superstitions and Erroures taught or believed in the Church of Rome or anie other Church, in wch faith I will confirme (God willing) to my lives end, in testimonie whereof I have hereunto subscribed my hand.

Castelhaven

After that, Castlehaven acknowledged the King’s mercy; said a short private prayer; laid his head on the block and was beheaded with a single stroke.

==Aftermath==
Castlehaven&#x27;s Irish titles passed to his son James.

Elizabeth was estranged from her husband and left to fend for herself in England, often in the company of Lady Elizabeth Petre, herself estranged from her husband William Petre, 4th Baron Petre. James was married to Elizabeth Graves within months of his first wife&#x27;s death.

Laurence FitzPatrick and Giles Browning were each put on trial for their roles in the offences. FitzPatrick testified that Lady Castlehaven &quot;was the wickedest woman in the world, and had more to answer for than any woman that lived&quot;. Both men were convicted and subsequently executed.

The historian Cynthia B. Herrup, writes that Anne &quot;always insisted upon her innocence, and in theory, her husband’s condemnation should have vindicated her&quot; but that &quot;her life after 1631 was a very partial exoneration&quot; and &quot;The most popular verse circulating after the trial portrayed Castlehaven as a cuckold rather than the Countess as a victim.&quot; In &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;, Cokayne adds that the death of Castlehaven was certainly brought about by his wife&#x27;s manipulations and that her undoubted adultery with one Ampthill and with Henry Skipwith renders her motives suspicious.

==Children==
Mervyn Touchet&#x27;s first marriage (before 1608) was with Elizabeth Barnham (1592 – c. 1622–4), daughter of London alderman Benedict Barnham and his wife, Dorothea Smith, and they had six surviving children:

* James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven (1612–1684), who married Elizabeth Brydges (1614 or 1615 – 1679), daughter of his stepmother, but left no surviving children

<text>Afan Lido Football Club () is a football team based in Port Talbot, Wales, playing in the .

==History==
Afan Lido F.C. were founded in 1967 shortly after the opening of the Afan Lido Sports Centre in Aberavon. A football team was set up to give the centre&#x27;s users a proper organisation. Ken Williams was the prime mover behind the club.

Lido gained admission to the Port Talbot and District League for the 1967–68 season. In 1971–72 the club was accepted into the Welsh Football League, and two years later was promoted into the First Division (afterwards the Second Division), and another two years later they were promoted again into the Premier Division (afterwards the First Division). After a barren spell they were relegated but were promoted in 1984–85; by this time the League had been reorganised and a higher National Division had been formed, to which Afan Lido were promoted in 1989–90 after finishing 3rd (they had actually won the Premier Division the two previous seasons, but not been promoted because of the ground criteria set by the League).

Afan Lido became founder members of the League of Wales in 1992, and won the League Cup in 1992–93 and 1993–94. The next year the porous defence was addressed, and the team finished in second place in the League, winning a UEFA Cup place, but they were defeated by RAF Yelgava of Latvia on the away-goals rule. This was a taste of things to come, and Afan Lido were relegated from the League of Wales before winning their place back after an absence of two years.

Lido&#x27;s young team that emerged during the spell out of the League of Wales grew together and the club enjoyed several encouraging seasons after settling again in the top flight. Lido&#x27;s policy of choosing players from within the club&#x27;s huge junior structure (which has 25 teams for all age groups, from under 5s upwards) paid off, when they finished 5th place in 2001–02. If the club had scored a single point more, in fact, Lido would have taken the town into European football for a second time.

Leaner years followed that near miss, and in 2005 the club left the Welsh Premier in controversial circumstances, after being deducted points for fielding an ineligible player in a league game. The points deducted sunk the Lido into the relegation zone below NEWI Cefn Druids, which sealed their fate.

In 2011 Lido secured a return to the Welsh Premier and their first season in the top flight saw the club survive the drop. The club also won the Welsh Premier League Cup, defeating Newtown on penalties at Aberystwyth.

Off-field issues surfaced the following season, however, and Lido had to assemble an all-new squad under the guidance of Paul Reid. The club finished bottom of the Welsh Premier, but survived relegation due to the demise of Llanelli and the inability of Haverfordwest County to finish in a promotion spot in Welsh League Division One.

On 4 July 2013 Afan Lido appointed former club captain and fans favourite Paul Evans to the hotseat as they look to cement their position within the top division.

For the 2016–17 season, the club found themselves in the same division as town rivals Port Talbot.

<doc id="299225" wikidata="Q6144435" url="?curid=299225" title="James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven">
<text>James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven ( - 11 October 1684) was the son of Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven and his first wife, Elizabeth Barnham (1592 - ). Castlehaven played a prominent role in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms that took place in the middle of the 17th century, and was particularly active in the conflicts in Ireland at this time.

== Titles ==
He succeeded to the Irish earldom of Castlehaven and Baron Audley of Orier on 14 May 1631, when his father was attainted and beheaded. Most of his estates in England were taken over by others.

He was created Baron Audley of Hely with remainder &quot;to his heirs forever&quot; on 3 June 1633, with the place and precedency of George, his grandfather, formerly Baron Audley, in an effort to nullify his father&#x27;s attainder. However, this was considered insufficient, legally, until a bill was passed by Parliament in 1678 allowing him to inherit the original Barony of Audley.

== War in Ireland ==
Castlehaven was involved in the defence of Ireland during the Confederate Wars of the 1640s and in the subsequent Cromwellian invasion. During the outbreak of the Irish uprising in 1641–42, Castlehaven volunteered to help suppress the Irish rebels, but because he was a Catholic he was not trusted to take command. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested and detained at Dublin Castle. Fearing that he would meet the same fate as the Earl of Strafford, Tuchet manage to escape 27 September, with the help of a friend and fled south into the Wicklow Mountains. His intention was &#x27;to gain a passage by Wexford into France, and from thence into England;’ but coming to Kilkenny, the headquarters of the confederate Catholics, he was persuaded to accept a command in the army, and was appointed general of horse under Sir Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara. It was believed among the northern Irish that his escape was a contrivance on the part of the Earl of Ormonde &#x27;to work an understanding&#x27; between him and his kindred in rebellion, Castlehaven being related to him through the marriage of his sister with Edmund Roe Butler.

Even though he considered himself English, he was appointed a member of the 25-strong Supreme council of the Confederation of Kilkenny. In 1644 the Irish Confederate Supreme Council decided to vote for Castlehaven as the commander of a 6,000-strong expedition force in a push against the Ulster-Scottish army under Robert Monro. The campaign under Castlehaven proved indecisive, the large army being mostly used to defend the stronghold of Charlemont. Historians generally consider the expedition to have been a wasted opportunity: as a result of this, Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill considered Castlehaven to be incompetent and Thomas Preston also developed a dislike of him. (Castlehaven somewhat unconvincingly later blamed O&#x27;Neill for the failure of the expedition). However, Castlehaven was not entirely lacking in military ability. Apart from Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, he proved to be the only Irish Confederate commander capable of winning conventional set-piece battles. In 1643 he surprised and routed hundreds of Inchiquin&#x27;s men in county Cork at the battle of Cloughleagh. In 1650 he won a second small (though inconsequential) victory over an English Parliamentarian force during the battle of Tecroghan with some aid from Ulick Burke. The great weakness of Castlehaven was that he was largely an amateur, lacking the patience to conduct sieges and somewhat touchy- it is said that some referred to him as &quot;Tiarna Beag&quot; or &#x27;Little Lord.&#x27; The anonymous author of the Aphorismical Discovery, a contemporary account of events during the Confederate wars in Ireland, contemptuously referred to Castlehaven as the &#x27;pigmeyan Goliath of Clanricarde.&#x27;

== Later years ==
In 1647 he, like many other Catholic nobles, moved to France and was present at Prince Rupert&#x27;s siege of Landrécy, the capital of Hainault. He went back to Ireland, after seeing the Prince of Wales in Paris, to hold several commands in Leinster, Munster, and Clare but was unable to counter the actions of Cromwell and his son-in-law, Ireton. He was able to return to the continent in April 1652
 to further his military career serving Prince de Condé in the Fronde, Charles II, and the Spanish Crown. He participated in the battles of Rocroy, Cambrai, Seneffe, Maestricht, Charleroi and Mons

Castlehaven wrote his memoirs in 1681 in response to the hysteria of the Popish Plot. Like all Catholic peers, he had been barred from the House of Lords (where he sat as Baron Audley) by the Test Act 1678, much to the regret of the Protestant peers, who held him in high regard. He took his leave on 30 November 1678, with a speech expressing his duty to the Crown, and his concern for the peace and welfare of the Kingdom. His fellow peers, knowing him to be in financial difficulty, wrote to Charles II recommending Castlehaven to his bounty.

== Marriage and issue ==
He married twice, first Elizabeth Brydges (died March 1678/9) in Kilkenny, daughter of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos and of his wife Lady Anne Stanley (1580–1647), who married the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven after Lord Chandos&#x27; death. (Anne Stanley was thus both the 3rd Earl&#x27;s stepmother, and his mother-in-law.). Elisabeth was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He married secondly, about 19 June 1679, Elizabeth Graves (died 1720).

He died without issue on 11 October 1684, at Kilcash Castle, County Tipperary, Ireland and was succeeded in the earldom by his youngest brother Mervyn. Mervyn&#x27;s older brother George was passed over by virtue of being a Benedictine monk.

<text>The Battle of Kleidion (; or Clidium, after the medieval name of the village of Klyuch, ; also known as the Battle of Belasitsa) took place on 29 July 1014, between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire. It was the culmination of the nearly half-century struggle between the Byzantine Emperor Basil II and the Bulgarian emperor Samuel in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The result was a decisive Byzantine victory.

The battle took place in the valley between the mountains of Belasitsa and Ograzhden, near the modern Bulgarian village of Klyuch. The decisive encounter occurred on 29 July with an attack in the rear by a force under the Byzantine general Nikephoros Xiphias, who had infiltrated the Bulgarian positions. The ensuing battle was a major defeat for the Bulgarians. Thousands of Bulgarian soldiers were captured and blinded by order of Basil II, who would subsequently be known as the &quot;Bulgar-Slayer&quot;. Samuel survived the battle, but died two months later from a heart attack, reportedly brought on by the sight of his blind soldiers.

Although the engagement did not end the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances, and it has been considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium.

==Background==

The origins of the conflict date back to the 7th century, when the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh established a state along the Danube in one of the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire. As a result, the Bulgarian state fought a series of wars with Byzantium in order to secure its continued existence.

In 968, Bulgaria was invaded from the north by the Kievan prince Sviatoslav. By that time, the Bulgarian Empire, which had once threatened the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon, had lost much of its power. During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also at war with the Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in the Bulgarian emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule. The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.

When the Byzantine emperor Basil II ascended the throne in 976, he made the destruction of independent Bulgaria his first ambition. Opposing him were the western Bulgarians, now led by Samuel of Bulgaria. Basil II&#x27;s first campaign was disastrous, the Emperor barely escaping with his life when the Bulgarians annihilated the Byzantine army in the Gates of Trajan Pass in 986.
Over the next fifteen years, while Basil was preoccupied with revolts against his rule and the Fatimid threat in the east, Samuel retook most of the previously conquered Bulgarian lands and carried the war into enemy territory in a series of campaigns. However, his invasion of southern Greece, that reached as far as Corinth, resulted in a major defeat in the Battle of Spercheios in 996. The next phase of the war began in 1000, when Basil, having secured his own position, launched a series of offensives against Bulgaria. He secured Moesia, and in 1003, his forces took Vidin. The next year, Basil inflicted a heavy defeat on Samuel in the Battle of Skopie. By 1005, Basil had regained control of Thessaly and parts of southern Macedonia. Over these and the next few years, a regular pattern emerged: the Byzantines would campaign in Bulgaria, laying siege to forts and pillaging the countryside, while the numerically inferior Bulgarians, unable to offer direct opposition, launched diversionary raids in Macedonia and Greece. Despite some successes, these did not achieve any permanent results, nor did they force Basil to abandon his campaigns in Bulgaria. A counter-attack in 1009 failed at the Battle of Kreta, and although the Byzantines themselves did not achieve any decisive success, their methodical war of attrition deprived the Bulgarians of their strongholds and gradually weakened their forces. In the words of Byzantine historian John Skylitzes: &quot;The Emperor Basil II continued to invade Bulgaria each year and destroy and devastate everything on his way. Samuel could not stop him in the open field or engage the Emperor in a decisive battle, and suffered many defeats and began to lose his strength.&quot; The culmination of the war came in 1014, when Samuel, at the head of his army, resolved to stop the Byzantine army before it could enter the Bulgarian heartland.

==Prelude==
Samuel knew that the Byzantine army would have to invade the country through a series of mountain passes, and so took precautions to bar them. The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers, especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would need to pass through to reach the heart of Bulgaria. Samuel heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle. The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack and it had been used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years. The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe. In addition, the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base — it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west. The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units.

Samuel&#x27;s decision to face Basil II and the bulk of his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country, but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility, which had been fatally weakened by Basil&#x27;s campaigns. In 1005 for example, the governor of the important Adriatic port of Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II. To face this threat, Samuel gathered a large army to face the Byzantines, some claiming it numbered as many as 45,000 soldiers. Basil II also prepared carefully, assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders, including the governor of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), Nicephorus Xiphias, who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuel in 1001.

==Battle==
The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini, Drama and Serres and reached the Rupel pass on the Struma river. From there the army entered the Strumitsa valley and reached the vicinity of the village of Klyuch, where the river bent and approached Belasitsa and Ozgrazhden. There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers. The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.

In response, Samuel sent a large army under one of the most able Bulgarian nobles, Nestoritsa, to strike southwards and draw the attention of Basil away from the siege at Klyuch. Nestoritsa&#x27;s Bulgarians reached Thessalonika, but Byzantine troops under Theophylact Botaneiates, the &quot;strategos&quot; (governor-general) of the city and his son Mihail managed to defeat them outside the city walls in a bloody battle. Theophylactus captured many soldiers and a large quantity of military equipment and marched north to join Basil at Klyuch.

Basil&#x27;s first attempt to overwhelm the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable to pass through the valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and threaten the Bulgarians from behind, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians&#x27; rear. On 29 July, Xiphias attacked the Bulgarian defenders, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarians abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.

In the confusion of the rout, thousands of Bulgarian troops were killed and the remainder desperately attempted to flee westwards. Samuel and his son Gabriel Radomir immediately headed to the east from their headquarters in the Strumitsa fortress to aid their army, but in desperate fighting near the village of Mokrievo (present-day North Macedonia) they were overwhelmed by the quickly advancing enemy. Many Bulgarian soldiers were killed at Mokrievo and many more were captured. Emperor Samuel himself barely escaped, only breaking free through the bravery of his son, who mounted his father on his own horse and took him to safety in Prilep. From Prilep, Samuel returned to Prespa while Gabriel Radomir headed towards Strumitsa to continue the struggle.

==Further developments==
After his victory, Basil II advanced towards Strumitsa, which was key to holding the whole Vardar valley. On their way to the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the &quot;cubicularius&quot; Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.

===Prisoners===
Skylitzes records that Basil completely routed the Bulgarian army and took 15,000 prisoners (14,000 according to Kekaumenos). Modern historians, however, such as Vasil Zlatarski, claim that these numbers are exaggerated. The 14th century Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle numbers the prisoners at 8,000. Basil divided the prisoners into groups of 100 men, blinded 99 men in each group and left one man in each with one eye so that he could lead the others home; this was done in retaliation for the death of Botaneiates, who was Basil&#x27;s favourite general and advisor, and also to crush the Bulgarian morale. Another possible reason was that, from the Byzantine perspective, the Bulgarians were rebels against their authority, and blinding was the usual punishment meted out to rebels. For this action, Basil gained the nickname &quot;Boulgaroktonos&quot; (, ), &quot;the Bulgar-slayer&quot;. Samuel died of a heart attack on October 6, 1014, reportedly due to seeing his soldiers blinded.

==Aftermath==

The death of Botaneiates and the four more years of war that followed indicate that the Byzantine success was not complete. Some modern historians doubt that the Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos. Other historians emphasize that the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria. His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II, and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018. In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav was killed in a battle at Dyrrhachium, and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185.

Other theses in the historiography stress the significance of the battle. As a result of the battle of Belasitsa, the Bulgarian army suffered heavy casualties that could not be restored. The ability of the central government to control the peripheral and interior provinces of the Empire was reduced and the actions of the local and provincial governors became more decisive for the outcome of the war with Byzantium. Many of them voluntarily surrendered to Basil II.

The battle also affected the Serbs and the Croats, who were forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Byzantine Emperor after 1018. The borders of the Byzantine Empire were restored to the Danube for the first time since the 7th century, allowing Byzantium to control the entire Balkan peninsula from the Danube to the Peloponnese and from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea.

<text>Sir Richard Grenville (15 June 1542 – 10 September 1591), also spelt Greynvile, Greeneville, and Greenfield, was an English privateer and explorer. Grenville was lord of the manors of Stowe, Cornwall and Bideford, Devon. He subsequently participated in the plantations of Ireland specifically the Munster plantations, the English colonisation of the Americas and the repulse of the Spanish Armada.

Grenville also served as Member of Parliament for Cornwall, High Sheriff for County Cork and Sheriff of Cornwall. In 1591, Grenville died at the battle of Flores fighting against an overwhelmingly larger Spanish fleet near the Azores. He and his crew on board the galleon fought against the 53-strong Spanish fleet to allow the other English ships to escape. Grenville was the grandfather of Sir Bevil Grenville, a prominent military officer during the English Civil War.

==Origins==
Richard Grenville was the eldest son and heir of Sir Roger Grenville (d. 1545), who was captain of when she sank in Portsmouth Harbour in 1545, by his wife Thomasine Cole, daughter of Thomas Cole of Slade. Thomasine remarried to Thomas Arundell. The ancient Grenville family were lords of the manors of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall. He was a cousin of Sir Walter Raleigh and the privateer and explorer Sir Humphrey Gilbert.

Grenville&#x27;s birthplace is believed to have been at Bideford. His father (who had pre-deceased his own father Sir Richard Grenville (c. 1495–1550), the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cornwall in 1529) died when he was an infant, aged 3, and his mother remarried to Thomas Arundell of Clifton Arundell House, where Grenville spent much of his childhood. At age 17, Grenville began law studies at the Inner Temple.

==Early career==
On 19 November 1562, aged 20, he was in an affray in the Strand in London in the company of his cousin, Nicholas Specott, gentleman, with Lewis Lloyd and Edward Horseman, their attendants. Upon encountering Sir Edmound Unton, Fulke Greville, Robert Bannister, gentleman, and Thomas Allen, yeoman, (with their servants), Grenville ran Robert Bannister through with his sword, then left him to die. Grenville and company were outlawed for three months and then pardoned for public duelling and manslaughter.

At age 21, he inherited his grandfather&#x27;s estates at Stowe in Cornwall, and at Bideford and Buckland Abbey in Devon. About 1565, he married Mary St Leger, daughter of Sir John St Leger.

He was appointed High Sheriff of Cork in 1568.

==Military career==

===Hungarian campaign===

In pursuit of his military career, with his West Country cousins, Godolphins, Carews, Killigrews, Champernownes, Basets, etc., Grenville fought against the Turks in Hungary for the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian in 1566. After petitioning Elizabeth I in 1565 to leave England for service abroad to a foreign prince, Grenville and his West Country cousins paid for and recruited a troop of West Countrymen to accompany them.

=== Colonisation in Ireland ===
In 1569, he arrived in Ireland with Sir Warham St Leger (c. 1525–1597) to arrange for settlement of lands in the Barony of Kerricurrihy. These had been mortgaged to St Leger by Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. At about this time Grenville also seized lands for colonisation at Tracton, to the west of Cork harbour.

Sir Peter Carew had asserted his claim to lands in south Leinster. St Leger settled nearby, and Humphrey Gilbert pushed westward from Idrone along the Blackwater River. The plantations in the south of Ireland led to bitter disputes with local Irish nobility. They escalated into the first of the Desmond rebellions, led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald.

As Sheriff of Cork, Grenville witnessed the rebellion in which Fitzmaurice, along with the Earl of Clancar, James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald (the Seneschal of Imokilly); Edmund Fitzgibbon (the White Knight); and others, attacked Tracton. They overcame the English defence with pickaxes and killed nearly the entire garrison. The three surviving English soldiers were hanged the next day by the Irish. Fitzmaurice threatened the imminent arrival of Spanish forces. Having plundered the citizenry of Cork, he boasted that he could also take the artillery of the city of Youghal.

In June 1569, soon after Grenville&#x27;s sailing for England, Fitzmaurice camped outside the walls of Waterford and demanded that Grenville&#x27;s wife and Lady St Leger be given over to him, along with all the English and all prisoners; the citizens refused. Fitzmaurice&#x27;s troops massacred local English farmers in response. As Cork ran low on provisions, the people of Youghal expected an attack at any minute. The rebellion continued, but Grenville remained in England.

==Return to England==
Grenville sided with the Earl of Arundel and the Duke of Norfolk in 1569 against the Queen&#x27;s secretary. He was elected MP for Cornwall in 1571 and appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1576. &quot;Undeviatingly Protestant&quot;, he arrested the Catholic priest Cuthbert Mayne at the home of the Tregians in 1577. Mayne was martyred as a result.

===Buckland Greynvile Abbey===
In 1575–76, Sir Richard was back home at Bideford expanding his holdings, businesses and properties after his expedition plans were scuppered. He finished remodeling the rest of the interior of Buckland Greynvile Abbey into a suitable home for his growing family. He decorated it with navigational themes in the plaster on the ceilings, the Greynvile coat of arms on the mantle pieces, as well as a knight in repose against a tree.

===Development of Bideford===
Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in north Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. A charter had been granted to his ancestor Richard Grenville in 1272, creating the town&#x27;s first council. Three centuries later, Grenville would seek a new charter for the town, hoping to develop it into a port that would trade with his estates in Munster. The charter was officially granted of 16 December 1572. Grenville would also revitalise the market and restore the town&#x27;s fair.

In 1575, he created the port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the town council he established. He was again elected as MP for Cornwall in 1584 (sitting until 1586).

==Development of Irish estate==
Following a period of supporting Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s venture in North America (see below) he returned to Munster to arrange the estate granted him under the plantation of the province. Following the suppression of the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1583, he had purchased some in Kinalmeaky and brought settlers over. His renewed efforts beginning in 1588 yielded little success, and Grenville returned to England late in 1590.

==Privateering plan and sailing around the world==

In 1574, Grenville submitted a proposal to the Privy Council to take a single ship to attack Spanish treasure ships and establish English colonies in South America and from there to sail across the &quot;South Sea&quot; (i.e. Pacific Ocean) in hope of finding a short cut to the Spice Islands and &quot;terra australis incognita&quot;.
The patent was initially granted, but was rescinded a year later on the grounds that England was still using diplomacy with Spain and had been at great pains to rebuild her relations with Philip II after the tensions of 1568–1571. It was these plans that were usurped and were eventually executed by Francis Drake when he circumnavigated the globe in 1577. This caused some bad blood and is the reason why Grenville refused to ever serve with Francis Drake in any capacity.

That same year Grenville received thanks of the Privy Council and the Earl of Bedford, then Lieutenant of Cornwall, in Ireland for raising troops against Sir Thomas Stukely, styling himself the Duke of Ireland.

==New World and Roanoke Colony==

In 1585, Grenville was admiral of the seven-strong fleet that brought English settlers to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of modern-day North Carolina in North America. Grenville and his fleet arrived at the village of Aquascogoc, inhabited by the Pamlico but, before leaving, Grenville furiously reacted to the disappearance of a silver drinking cup from the colony. Grenville and his men proceeded to sack and burn Aquascogoc.

Grenville was heavily criticised by Ralph Lane, general of the expedition, who referred to Grenville&#x27;s &quot;intolerable pride and insatiable ambition&quot;. Lane&#x27;s remark was prompted by a bitter legal feud he then had with Grenville. On his return, Grenville captured a Spanish ship, &quot;Santa Maria de Vincente&quot;, which he later brought to Bideford to be converted into &quot;Galleon Dudley&quot;. The cannon from that Spanish ship are thought to be those erroneously labelled &quot;Armada cannons&quot; in Bideford&#x27;s Victoria Park.

In 1586 Grenville returned to Roanoke to find that the surviving colonists had departed with Drake. Grenville left 15 of his own men to defend Raleigh&#x27;s New World territory. During his return voyage to England, Grenville raided various towns in the Azores Islands. At about this time, a description was given of his behaviour while dining with Spanish captains:

Grenville brought with him a Native American from Roanoke Island to Bideford after returning from the 1586 resupply trip. He named the Native American tribesman Raleigh after his cousin Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh converted to Christianity and had his baptism at Saint Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church in Bideford on 27 March 1588, but died from influenza while residing in Grenville&#x27;s house on 2 April 1589. His interment was at the same church five days later along with Grenville&#x27;s daughter, Rebecca.

==Spanish Armada==
In 1587, Grenville was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the West Country by the Privy Council, to organize the defences of Devon and Cornwall in preparation for the expected attack by the Spanish Armada the following year. Also was commissioned with overseeing the repair of the Fortifications of the Cinque Ports and Boscastle Harbour.

In 1588, he was made a member of the council that was created to devise means of defence against the Spanish armada. Grenville equipped seven ships at Bideford with supplies and more colonists for Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;Planters&quot; Colony settled at Roanoke the previous year. However, a stay of shipping due to the impending arrival of the Spanish Armada meant that the fleet did not sail. Grenville led five of these ships to Plymouth to join the English defences and returned to Bideford where he provisioned the remaining two ships for Roanoke, a voyage that later turned back after being raided by the French. Later that year, Grenville was commissioned to keep watch at sea on the western approaches to the Bristol Channel in case of the return of the Spanish Armada.

==Command of &quot;Revenge&quot; and death==
Grenville was appointed Vice-Admiral of the Fleet under Thomas Howard. He was charged with maintaining a squadron at the Azores to await the return to Spain of the South American treasure fleets. He took command of , a galleon of new design that was faster and more maneuverable than older naval ships.

At Flores Island the English fleet was surprised by a much larger squadron sent by King Philip II of Spain. Howard retreated to safety, but Grenville faced the 53 enemy ships alone, leading his single ship in what amounted to a suicide mission, stating that he &quot;utterly refused to turn from the enimie...he would rather chose to die than to dishonour himselfe&quot;. His crew was reduced by nearly 100 men due to sickness on shore, but he chose nonetheless to confront the far superior Spanish force. For twelve hours he and his crew fought off the Spanish, causing heavy damage to fifteen galleons. According to Raleigh&#x27;s account, Grenville and his soldiers fought for hour after hour, &quot;...until all the powder of The &quot;Revenge&quot;, to the last barrell, was now spent, all her pikes broken, fortie of her best men slain, and the most part of the rest hurt&quot;. The ship itself was &quot;marvellous unsaverie, filled with bloud and bodies of deade and wounded men like a slaughter house&quot;.

The fight was later romanticized by the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson in his work &quot;:&quot; &quot;Out-gunned, out-fought, and out-numbered fifty-three to one&quot;, Grenville was said to have wished to blow up his ship rather than give up the fight, as Tennyson wrote: &quot;Sink me the ship, Master Gunner! – sink her! split her in twain! ... Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!&quot; Grenville&#x27;s crew however refused to obey these suicidal orders and his officers surrendered what was left of their vessel to the Spanish, on a promise of fair treatment.

Grenville died of his wounds several days later, screaming that his men were &quot;traitors and dogs&quot;, but the Spanish were not to enjoy their success, nor would Grenville&#x27;s men survive their deliverance. The Spanish fleet was caught by a cyclone soon after and during a week-long storm &quot;Revenge&quot; and fifteen Spanish warships and merchant vessels were lost. &quot;Revenge&quot; sank with her mixed prize-crew of seventy Spaniards and English prisoners near the island of Terceira, at the approximate position .

==Marriage and children==

In 1565 Grenville married Mary St Leger (c. 1543–1623), daughter of Sir John St Ledger of Annery, Monkleigh, near Bideford, and heir to her brother. She outlived her husband and died aged about 80 on 9 November 1623 and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bideford. The family initially lived at Buckland Abbey before moving to a newly built house at Bideford. They had four sons, including Bernard Grenville.
Capt. George Vancouver was related to him on his mother&#x27;s side. Her name was Bridget Berners.
