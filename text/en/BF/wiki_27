<text>Mel Fisher (August 21, 1922 – December 19, 1998) was an American treasure hunter best known for finding the 1622 wreck of the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; in Florida waters.

==Personal life==

Fisher was an Indiana-born former chicken farmer who eventually moved to California. He opened the first diving shop in the state, called &quot;See Da Sea&quot;. He attended Purdue University. In 1953, he married Dolores (Deo) Horton who became his business partner. She was one of the first women to learn how to dive and set a women&#x27;s record by staying underwater for 50 hours. Mel and Deo had five children. On July 20, 1975, Fisher&#x27;s oldest son Dirk, his wife Angel, and diver Rick Gage died after their boat sank due to bilge pump failure. Fisher spent decades treasure hunting in the Florida Keys.

==The Slave Ship &quot;Henrietta Marie&quot;==
In 1972, Fisher&#x27;s company found the wreck of the slave ship &quot;Henrietta Marie&quot; during the search for the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; and other ships of the 1622 Spanish treasure fleet that had wrecked along the Florida Keys in a hurricane. Two anchors and a cannon were found on the first visit. The wreck was visited again in 1973. Some artifacts were collected from the wreck, including bilboes, iron shackles that were used to restrain slaves. When they realized that the wreck was likely a slave ship, not a treasure ship, the company reburied the artifacts and pieces of the ship&#x27;s hull that they had exposed and left the site. In 1983 through 1985 Henry Taylor, sub-contracting with Mel Fisher&#x27;s company, excavated the wreck (known as the &quot;English wreck&quot;) with the assistance of archaeologist David Moore. The wreck was identified when a bronze ship&#x27;s bell carrying the inscription &quot;The Henrietta Marie 1699&quot; was found at the wreck site. Survey and excavation of the wreck site has continued at intervals.

In 1993, the National Association of Black Scuba Divers (NABS) placed a memorial plaque on the seabed near the wreckage site, which reads “Henrietta Marie: In recognition of the Courage, Pain and Suffering of Enslaved African People. Speak her name and gently touch the souls of our ancestors.&quot;

In November 2024, the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum opened a new exhibit about the transatlantic slave trade and its connections with the Florida Keys, centered on artifacts from the &quot;Henrietta Marie&quot; along with materials sourced elsewhere.
==The Atocha==
Fisher found the Spanish galleon &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.melfisher.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; named after a parish in Madrid for protection. He discovered silver bars from the wreck in 1973, and in 1975, Dirk found five bronze cannons whose markings would prove to be that of the &quot;Atocha&quot;. Only days later, Dirk, Angel, and Rick Gage, were killed. The estimated $450 million cache recovered, known as &quot;The Atocha Motherlode,&quot; included 40 tons of gold and silver; there were some 114,000 of the Spanish silver coins known as &quot;pieces of eight&quot;, gold coins, Colombian emeralds, gold and silver artifacts, and 1000 silver ingots.

Large as it was, this was only roughly half of the treasure that went down with the &quot;Atocha&quot;. The stern castle of the ship holding more gold and Muzo emeralds has not been found Also still missing are 300 silver bars and 8 bronze cannons, among other things.

The site of the wreckage of the &quot;Atocha&quot;, called &quot;The Bank of Spain&quot; (a sandy area 22 feet deep and within 200 yards of the anchor location), is still being worked on and treasures are slowly being recovered. The emeralds from the &quot;Atocha&quot; are some of the finest emeralds in the world. They come from the Muzo Mine in Colombia. The emeralds of Muzo are renowned for their color, fire and geometry.

The State of Florida claimed title to the wreck and forced Fisher&#x27;s company, Treasure Salvors, Inc., into a contract giving 25% of the found treasure to the state. Fisher&#x27;s company fought the state, claiming the find should be the company&#x27;s exclusively. After eight years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favour of Treasure Salvors and it was awarded rights to all found treasure from the vessel on 1 July 1982.

==Other finds==
Fisher and Treasure Salvors found remains of several other shipwrecks in Florida waters, including the &quot;Atocha&#x27;s&quot; sister galleon the &quot;Santa Margarita&quot;, lost in the same year, and the remains of a slave ship known as the &quot;Henrietta Marie&quot;, lost in 1700. Mel Fisher&#x27;s company, Mel Fisher&#x27;s Treasures, sold the rights to the 1715 Treasure Fleet shipwreck to Queens Jewels, LLC.

==Counterfeit sales==
In 1998, Fisher&#x27;s retail sales subsidiary Crystals of Delaware pled no contest to charges of fraud in a plea agreement with the Monroe County state&#x27;s attorney for the sale of counterfeit coins bearing a 1733 fleet insignia. Mr. Fisher had purchased the coins from Walter J. Kruse, a longtime associate with a criminal record for previous sale of counterfeit coins, but sold them with a signed certificate stating that he himself had found them. Fisher&#x27;s company agreed to pay in excess of $67,000 to identified claimants, and to maintain a $50,000 fund for any additional customers who stepped forward during a three year probation period.

==Legacy==
Fisher hired Duncan Matthewson as chief archaeologist during the &quot;Atocha&quot; period, and Treasure Salvors, Inc.&#x27;s employees became experts in recovery and conservation of underwater artifacts. Fisher agreed to sell Treasure Salvors in 1986 and it remained active as of 2009. Fisher&#x27;s business continued as Mel Fisher&#x27;s Treasures. Fisher blended private and public interests when it came to underwater cultural resources. Concern in the U.S., and Florida specifically, for protection of submerged archaeological sites contributed to the 2001 adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.

<doc id="296660" wikidata="Q23093" url="?curid=296660" title="Madrid Atocha railway station">
<text>Madrid Atocha (), also named Madrid Puerta de Atocha–Almudena Grandes, is the oldest major railway station in Madrid. It is the largest station serving commuter trains (&quot;Cercanías&quot;), regional trains from the south and southeast, intercity trains from Navarre, Cádiz and Huelva (Andalusia) and La Rioja, and the AVE high speed trains from Girona, Tarragona and Barcelona (Catalonia), Huesca and Zaragoza (Aragon), Sevilla, Córdoba, Málaga and Granada (Andalusia), Valencia, Castellón and Alicante (Levante Region). These train services are run by Spain&#x27;s national rail company, Renfe. As of 2019, the station has daily service to Marseille, France.

==Overview==
The station is in the Atocha neighborhood of the district of Arganzuela. The original façade faces Plaza del Emperador Carlos V, a site at which a variety of streets converge, including the Calle de Atocha, Paseo del Prado, Paseo de la Infanta Isabel, Avenida de la Ciudad de Barcelona, Calle de Méndez Álvaro, Paseo de las Delicias, Paseo de Santa María de la Cabeza, and Ronda de Atocha.

Atocha station is a railway complex, formed by the Madrid Atocha Cercanías and Madrid Puerta de Atocha stations of Spain&#x27;s national railways and a station of the Madrid underground called Atocha-RENFE. RENFE is the state-owned company which operates freight and passenger trains since 1941.

==History==

At this site, Madrid&#x27;s first railway station was inaugurated on 9 February 1851 under the name &quot;Estación de Mediodía&quot; (Atocha-Mediodía is now the name of an area of the Arganzuela district, and means &quot;south&quot; in old Spanish).

After the building was largely destroyed by fire, it was rebuilt by the MZA railway company and reopened in 1892. The architect for the replacement, in a wrought iron renewal style was Alberto de Palacio Elissagne, who collaborated with Gustave Eiffel. Engineer Henry Saint James also took part in the project. The name Atocha has become attached to the station because of the nearby basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Atocha. The train platforms were partly covered by a roof in the form of inverted hull with a height of approximately 27 meters and length of 157 meters. The steel and glass roof spreads between two brick flanking buildings.

This complex of railway tracks expanded through the years. In 1985, a project of complete remodeling began, based on designs by Rafael Moneo. In 1992, the original building was taken out of service as a terminal, and converted into a concourse with shops, cafés, and a nightclub. Like the Orsay Museum in Paris, the concourse has been given a new function, that being in the case of Atocha a stunning covered tropical garden.

A modern terminal was also designed by Moneo, and built in adjacent land to serve both the new High Speed trains, regional and local commuter lines. The main lines end in the new terminal; regional and commuter train platforms are located underground, at the ingress to a rail tunnel extending northward under the Paseo de la Castellana. The station is served by two Madrid Metro stations, Estación del Arte (located near the Museo Reina Sofía) and the Atocha Renfe metro station. The latter was added when the new terminal building was constructed and is directly linked to the railway station, providing access to Line 1. A connection to Line 11 will be constructed in the first half of the 2020s, with work scheduled to begin in November 2022 for completion by the end of 2026.

On 19 December 2021, the regional government of the Community of Madrid announced that Atocha Renfe station would be renamed &quot;Atocha&quot;, owing to the liberalization of Spain&#x27;s railway industry and the entry of new rail companies into the Spanish market. The station was originally set to be renamed &quot;Atocha-Constitución del 78&quot; (Atocha-Constitution of &#x27;78), announced by Vice President Ignacio Aguado on 16 February 2021, and proposed by Citizens (Cs), his political party, but was halted after Cs lost all its seats in the Assembly of Madrid in the aftermath of the 2021 Madrilenian regional election. The name change, which entailed replacing signage, updating maps and modifying station announcements, took effect on 1 February 2022. The following month on 3 March 2022 the Spanish central government announced a second name change to rename Puerta de Atocha after writer Almudena Grandes, who died four months earlier, with the name change taking effect on 19 November 2022.

The Spanish central government approved a €500 million expansion of Puerta de Atocha station on 13 June 2023 which would entail the construction of a new four-track underground station with two through platforms for high-speed services, allowing high-speed trains to serve both Atocha and Chamartín, the renovation of the existing station building and the construction of a new southern vestibule along the Calle de Méndez Álvaro.

==2004 Madrid train bombings==

On 11 March 2004, packed arriving commuter trains were bombed in a series of coordinated attacks, killing 193 people and wounding 1,800. The official investigation by the Spanish Judiciary determined the attacks were directed by a Islamist terrorist cell.

==Memorials to the 2004 attacks==

On 10 June 2004, a somber and minimalist Atocha station memorial was dedicated to the victims of the attacks. The monument includes a virtual shrine. Visitors to the attacked stations can leave a hand silhouette and a message through special-purpose consoles. A second monument to this event, known as 11-M in Spain, is the (Forest of Remembrance) in the near Atocha. This monument is made up of 192 olive and cypress trees, one for each person who died on that day, with a tree also planted in remembrance of the police officer, who died on 3 April 2004. He died as a result of a suicide bomb during the attempt to capture a number of the perpetrators, four of whom were killed by the bomb. Initially inaugurated as the (Forest of the Departed) the site was renamed on the first anniversary of the devastating attack. The forest is surrounded by a stream, with water as a symbol of life.

<doc id="296666" wikidata="Q2584477" url="?curid=296666" title="Construction of the real numbers">
<text>In mathematics, there are several equivalent ways of defining the real numbers. One of them is that they form a complete ordered field that does not contain any smaller complete ordered field. Such a definition does not prove that such a complete ordered field exists, and the existence proof consists of constructing a mathematical structure that satisfies the definition.

The article presents several such constructions. They are equivalent in the sense that, given the result of any two such constructions, there is a unique isomorphism of ordered field between them. This results from the above definition and is independent of particular constructions. These isomorphisms allow identifying the results of the constructions, and, in practice, to forget which construction has been chosen.

==Axiomatic definitions==
An axiomatic definition of the real numbers consists of defining them as the elements of a complete ordered field. This means the following: The real numbers form a set, commonly denoted formula_1, containing two distinguished elements denoted 0 and 1, and on which are defined two binary operations and one binary relation; the operations are called &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;multiplication&quot; of real numbers and denoted respectively with and ; the binary relation is &quot;inequality&quot;, denoted formula_2 Moreover, the following properties called axioms must be satisfied.

The existence of such a structure is a theorem, which is proved by constructing such a structure. A consequence of the axioms is that this structure is unique up to an isomorphism, and thus, the real numbers can be used and manipulated, without referring to the method of construction.

=== Axioms ===
# formula_1 is a field under addition and multiplication. In other words,
#* For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) + &quot;z&quot; and &quot;x&quot; × (&quot;y&quot; × &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; × &quot;y&quot;) × &quot;z&quot;. (associativity of addition and multiplication)
#* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot; + &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; × &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot; × &quot;x&quot;. (commutativity of addition and multiplication)
#* For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; × (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; × &quot;y&quot;) + (&quot;x&quot; × &quot;z&quot;). (distributivity of multiplication over addition)
#* For all &quot;x&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; + 0 = &quot;x&quot;. (existence of additive identity)
#* 0 is not equal to 1, and for all &quot;x&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; × 1 = &quot;x&quot;. (existence of multiplicative identity)
#* For every &quot;x&quot; in formula_1, there exists an element −&quot;x&quot; in formula_1, such that &quot;x&quot; + (−&quot;x&quot;) = 0. (existence of additive inverses)
#* For every &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0 in formula_1, there exists an element &quot;x&quot;−1 in formula_1, such that &quot;x&quot; × &quot;x&quot;−1 = 1. (existence of multiplicative inverses)
# formula_1 is totally ordered for formula_14. In other words,
#* For all &quot;x&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. (reflexivity)
#* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_1, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. (antisymmetry)
#* For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in formula_1, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;. (transitivity)
#* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_1, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. (totality)
# Addition and multiplication are compatible with the order. In other words,
#* For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in formula_1, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; + &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;. (preservation of order under addition)
#* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_1, if 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; and 0 ≤ &quot;y&quot;, then 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; × &quot;y&quot; (preservation of order under multiplication)
# The order ≤ is &quot;complete&quot; in the following sense: every non-empty subset of formula_1 that is bounded above has a least upper bound. In other words,
#* If &quot;A&quot; is a non-empty subset of formula_1, and if &quot;A&quot; has an upper bound in formula_23 then &quot;A&quot; has a least upper bound &quot;u&quot;, such that for every upper bound &quot;v&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;u&quot; ≤ &quot;v&quot;.

==== On the least upper bound property ====
Axiom 4, which requires the order to be Dedekind-complete, implies the Archimedean property.

The axiom is crucial in the characterization of the reals. For example, the totally ordered field of the rational numbers Q satisfies the first three axioms, but not the fourth. In other words, models of the rational numbers are also models of the first three axioms.

Note that the axiom is nonfirstorderizable, as it expresses a statement about collections of reals and not just individual such numbers. As such, the reals are not given by a first-order logic theory.

==== On models ====

A &quot;model of real numbers&quot; is a mathematical structure that satisfies the above axioms.
Several models are given below. Any two models are isomorphic; so, the real numbers are unique up to isomorphisms.

Saying that any two models are isomorphic means that for any two models formula_24 and formula_25 there is a bijection formula_26 that preserves both the field operations and the order. Explicitly,
* is both injective and surjective.
* and .
* and , for all and in formula_27
* if and only if , for all and in formula_27

===Tarski&#x27;s axiomatization of the reals===

An alternative synthetic axiomatization of the real numbers and their arithmetic was given by Alfred Tarski, consisting of only the 8 axioms shown below and a mere four primitive notions: a set called &quot;the real numbers&quot;, denoted formula_1, a binary relation over formula_1 called &quot;order&quot;, denoted by the infix operator &lt;, a binary operation over formula_1 called &quot;addition&quot;, denoted by the infix operator +, and the constant 1.

&quot;Axioms of order&quot; (primitives: formula_1, &lt;):

Axiom 1. If &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, then not &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;. That is, &quot;&lt;&quot; is an asymmetric relation.

Axiom 2. If &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot;, there exists a &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot;. In other words, &quot;&lt;&quot; is dense in formula_1.

Axiom 3. &quot;&lt;&quot; is Dedekind-complete. More formally, for all &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; ⊆ formula_1, if for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, then there exists a &quot;z&quot; such that for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;, if &quot;z&quot; ≠ &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; ≠ &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;.

To clarify the above statement somewhat, let &quot;X&quot; ⊆ formula_1 and &quot;Y&quot; ⊆ formula_1. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:

:&quot;X precedes Y&quot; if and only if for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and every &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;.

:The real number &quot;z separates&quot; &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; if and only if for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; with &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;z&quot; and every &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; with &quot;y&quot; ≠ &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;.

Axiom 3 can then be stated as:

:&quot;If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets.&quot;

&quot;Axioms of addition&quot; (primitives: formula_1, &lt;, +):

Axiom 4. &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) + &quot;y&quot;.

Axiom 5. For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, there exists a &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; + &quot;z&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.

Axiom 6. If &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; + &quot;w&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; or &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;w&quot;.

&quot;Axioms for one&quot; (primitives: formula_1, &lt;, +, 1):

Axiom 7. 1 ∈ formula_1.

Axiom 8. 1 &lt; 1 + 1.

These axioms imply that formula_1 is a linearly ordered abelian group under addition with distinguished element 1. formula_1 is also Dedekind-complete and divisible.

==Explicit constructions of models==
We shall not prove that any models of the axioms are isomorphic. Such a proof can be found in any number of modern analysis or set theory textbooks. We will sketch the basic definitions and properties of a number of constructions, however, because each of these is important for both mathematical and historical reasons. The first three, due to Georg Cantor/Charles Méray, Richard Dedekind/Joseph Bertrand and Karl Weierstrass all occurred within a few years of each other. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

===Construction from Cauchy sequences===
A standard procedure to force all Cauchy sequences in a metric space to converge is adding new points to the metric space in a process called completion.

formula_1 is defined as the completion of the set formula_43 of the rational numbers with respect to the metric Normally, metrics are defined with real numbers as values, but this does not make the construction/definition circular, since all numbers that are implied (even implicitly) are rational numbers.

Let &quot;R&quot; be the set of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. That is, sequences
of rational numbers such that for every rational , there exists an integer such that for all natural numbers , one has . Here the vertical bars denote the absolute value.

Cauchy sequences and can be added and multiplied as follows:
: .

Two Cauchy sequences and are called &quot;equivalent&quot; if and only if the difference between them tends to zero; that is, for every rational number , there exists an integer such that for all natural numbers , one has .

This defines an equivalence relation that is compatible with the operations defined above, and the set R of all equivalence classes can be shown to satisfy all axioms of the real numbers. formula_43 can be considered as a subset of formula_45 by identifying a rational number with the equivalence class of the Cauchy sequence .

Comparison between real numbers is obtained by defining the following comparison between Cauchy sequences: if and only if 
 is equivalent to or there exists an integer such that for all 

By construction, every real number is represented by a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. This representation is far from unique; every rational sequence that converges to is a Cauchy sequence representing . This reflects the observation that one can often use different sequences to approximate the same real number.

The only real number axiom that does not follow easily from the definitions is the completeness of , i.e. the least upper bound property. It can be proved as follows: Let be a non-empty subset of formula_46 and be an upper bound for . Substituting a larger value if necessary, we may assume is rational. Since is non-empty, we can choose a rational number such that for some in . Now define sequences of rationals and as follows:

Set and . For each consider the number
If is an upper bound for , set and .
Otherwise set
 and .

This defines two Cauchy sequences of rationals, and so the real numbers and . It is easy to prove, by induction on that is an upper bound for for all 
and is never an upper bound for for any 

Thus is an upper bound for . To see that it is a least upper bound, notice that the limit of is , and so . Now suppose is a smaller upper bound for . Since is monotonic increasing it is easy to see that for some . But is not an upper bound for and so neither is . Hence is a least upper bound for and is complete.

The usual decimal notation can be translated to Cauchy sequences in a natural way. For example, the notation means that is the equivalence class of the Cauchy sequence . The equation states that the sequences and are equivalent, i.e., their difference converges to .

An advantage of constructing formula_45 as the completion of formula_43 is that this construction can be used for every other metric space.

===Construction by Dedekind cuts===
A Dedekind cut in an ordered field is a partition of it, (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), such that &quot;A&quot; is nonempty and closed downwards, &quot;B&quot; is nonempty and closed upwards, and &quot;A&quot; contains no greatest element. Real numbers can be constructed as Dedekind cuts of rational numbers.

For convenience we may take the lower set formula_49 as the representative of any given Dedekind cut formula_50, since formula_51 completely determines formula_52. By doing this we may think intuitively of a real number as being represented by the set of all smaller rational numbers. In more detail, a real number formula_53 is any subset of the set formula_54 of rational numbers that fulfills the following conditions:
# formula_53 is not empty
# formula_56
# formula_53 is closed downwards. In other words, for all formula_58 such that formula_59, if formula_60 then formula_61
# formula_53 contains no greatest element. In other words, there is no formula_61 such that for all formula_60, formula_65

* We form the set formula_66 of real numbers as the set of all Dedekind cuts formula_51 of formula_68, and define a total ordering on the real numbers as follows: formula_69
* We embed the rational numbers into the reals by identifying the rational number formula_70 with the set of all smaller rational numbers formula_71. Since the rational numbers are dense, such a set can have no greatest element and thus fulfills the conditions for being a real number laid out above.
* Addition. formula_72
* Subtraction. formula_73 where formula_74 denotes the relative complement of formula_52 in formula_54, formula_77
* Negation is a special case of subtraction: formula_78
* Defining multiplication is less straightforward.
** if formula_79 then formula_80
** if either formula_49 or formula_82 is negative, we use the identities formula_83 to convert formula_49 and/or formula_82 to positive numbers and then apply the definition above.
* We define division in a similar manner:
** if formula_86 then formula_87
** if either formula_49 or formula_82 is negative, we use the identities formula_90 to convert formula_91 to a non-negative number and/or formula_92 to a positive number and then apply the definition above.
* Supremum. If a nonempty set formula_93 of real numbers has any upper bound in formula_94, then it has a least upper bound in formula_94 that is equal to formula_96.

As an example of a Dedekind cut representing an irrational number, we may take the positive square root of 2. This can be defined by the set formula_97. It can be seen from the definitions above that formula_51 is a real number, and that formula_99. However, neither claim is immediate. Showing that formula_49 is real requires showing that formula_51 has no greatest element, i.e. that for any positive rational formula_102 with formula_103, there is a rational formula_104 with formula_105 and formula_106 The choice formula_107 works. Then formula_108 but to show equality requires showing that if formula_109 is any rational number with formula_110, then there is positive formula_102 in formula_51 with formula_113.

An advantage of this construction is that each real number corresponds to a unique cut. Furthermore, by relaxing the first two requirements of the definition of a cut, the extended real number system may be obtained by associating formula_114 with the empty set and formula_115 with all of formula_54.

===Construction using hyperreal numbers===
As in the hyperreal numbers, one constructs the formula_117 from the rational numbers by means of an ultrafilter. Here a hyperrational is by definition a ratio of two hyperintegers. Consider the ring formula_52 of all limited (i.e. finite) elements in formula_117. Then formula_52 has a unique maximal ideal formula_121, the infinitesimal hyperrational numbers. The quotient ring formula_122 gives the field formula_1 of real numbers. This construction uses a non-principal ultrafilter over the set of natural numbers, the existence of which is guaranteed by the axiom of choice.

It turns out that the maximal ideal respects the order on formula_117. Hence the resulting field is an ordered field. Completeness can be proved in a similar way to the construction from the Cauchy sequences.

===Construction from surreal numbers===
Every ordered field can be embedded in the surreal numbers. The real numbers form a maximal subfield that is Archimedean (meaning that no real number is infinitely large or infinitely small). This embedding is not unique, though it can be chosen in a canonical way.

=== Construction from integers (Eudoxus reals)===
A relatively less known construction allows to define real numbers using only the additive group of integers formula_125 with different versions. , who attributes this construction to unpublished work by Stephen Schanuel, refers to this construction as the &quot;Eudoxus reals&quot;, naming them after ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus. As noted by and , Eudoxus&#x27;s treatment of quantity using the behavior of proportions became the basis for this construction. This construction has been formally verified to give a Dedekind-complete ordered field by the IsarMathLib project. 

Let an almost homomorphism be a map formula_126 such that the set formula_127 is finite. (Note that formula_128 is an almost homomorphism for every formula_129.) Almost homomorphisms form an abelian group under pointwise addition. We say that two almost homomorphisms formula_130 are almost equal if the set formula_131 is finite. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of almost homomorphisms. Real numbers are defined as the equivalence classes of this relation. Alternatively, the almost homomorphisms taking only finitely many values form a subgroup, and the underlying additive group of the real number is the quotient group. To add real numbers defined this way we add the almost homomorphisms that represent them. Multiplication of real numbers corresponds to functional composition of almost homomorphisms. If formula_132 denotes the real number represented by an almost homomorphism formula_133 we say that formula_134 if formula_133 is bounded or formula_133 takes an infinite number of positive values on formula_137. This defines the linear order relation on the set of real numbers constructed this way.

=== Other constructions ===
 write: &quot;Few mathematical structures have undergone as many revisions or have been presented in as many guises as the real numbers. Every generation reexamines the reals in the light of its values and mathematical objectives.&quot;

A number of other constructions have been given, by:

<doc id="296669" wikidata="Q4634096" url="?curid=296669" title="311 (telephone number)">
<text>311 is a special telephone number supported in many communities in Canada and the United States. The number provides access to non-emergency municipal services. The number format follows the N11 code for a group of short, special-purpose local numbers as designated in the North American Numbering Plan.

The telephone number 3-1-1 creates a central hub for local subscribers to access a variety of city services. It is intended, in part, to divert routine inquiries and non-urgent community concerns from the 9-1-1 number which is reserved for emergency service. A promotional website for 3-1-1 in Akron described the distinction as follows: &quot;Burning building? Call 911. Burning question? Call 311.&quot;

Many cities also accept comments through online interfaces. An &quot;Open 311&quot; application programming interface is also available for these services.

==History==
The first use of 3-1-1 for informational services was in Baltimore, Maryland, where the service commenced on 2 October 1996. 3-1-1 is intended to connect callers to a call center that can be the same as the 9-1-1 call center, but with 3-1-1 calls assigned a secondary priority, answered only when no 9-1-1 calls are waiting. This system is intended to extend the system such that true emergency callers are answered quickly with highest priority.

The largest 3-1-1 operation in North America operates in New York City, which was implemented in March 2003.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) reserved the use of 3-1-1 for non-emergency municipal services throughout Canada on 5 November 2004. The first Canadian 3-1-1 service opened in Calgary, Alberta on 18 May 2005.

Historically, the 311 code was used by some telephone companies for testing purposes. In Alberta, 311 was the automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) until 1 April 2005 when this was changed to 958–6111 to make way for the 3-1-1 service.

Since 2020, National 311 Day has been an event held on March 11 (3/11) to spread awareness about 3-1-1 systems.

==Operation==
3-1-1 service is generally implemented at the local level; in some cities, it is also used for various municipal calls.

Examples of calls intended for 3-1-1 include:
*abandoned vehicles in roadway
*code and housing violations 
*dead animal removal
*debris in roadway
*graffiti removal 
*illegal burning
*non-working streetlamps, parking meters, traffic lights
*noise complaints
*parking law enforcement
*parks and recreation concerns
*potholes, sinkholes and utility holes in streets
*public safety concerns 
*rat or rodent infestation
*reporting stolen vehicles

=== Open 311 ===
On March 3, 2010, the Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States, Vivek Kundra, announced the creation of a uniform &quot;Open 311&quot; application programming interface for these services. In 2009 at TechCrunch 50, CitySourced first launched &quot;Mobile 311&quot; to allow citizens to submit issues directly from a smartphone to their local government. The online 311 service SeeClickFix, which partners with news organizations to promote reported issues, is available across the United States but does not connect to municipalities with their permission or knowledge except in a few select cases.

Open 311 is used internationally, for example by FixMyStreet in the United Kingdom.

=== Cell-phone access ===
311 services works with some cellular phone providers, and about one-third of all 311 calls in the USA originate from cell phones rather than landlines, while cell-phone carriers gradually add the service to their networks.

===Latin America===
Places such as Panama, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica have implemented nationwide 311 centers.

In the Republic of Panama, the Centro de Atencion Ciudadana (3-1-1) is legally responsible for the centralized reception of citizen complaints, requests, suggestions and consultations to government agencies or municipalities. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year, receiving over a million citizen contacts on an annual basis through its toll-free line, self-service portal, mobile application and social media accounts.

==Equivalents in other countries==
===Finland===
On a yearly basis, the dispatchers in Finland&#x27;s 112 service receive some 800,000 non-urgent calls. In order to curb this problem, which ties up precious resources, a committee proposes that Finland launch a new telephone number—116 115—for such calls. Calls to this number would also be free of charge.

===Germany===
In Germany, 115 is a single access number to communal, regional and federal administrations.

===Sweden===
Sweden has introduced a system with which less-urgent callers can call 114 14 to get connected to the local police station. Depending on current load and situation, however, the call could potentially be connected to any station in Sweden. Calls to this number are charged according to the same rates as any other national calls.

===United Kingdom===
In all parts of the United Kingdom, the non-emergency number for contacting the police is 101.

==Usage==
The cost of city services in Baltimore has been dramatically reduced by the combination of the 3-1-1 service and CitiStat.

While Baltimore was the first city to use 311 as a police non-emergency number, in January 1999, Chicago initiated the first comprehensive 3-1-1 system, by providing information and tracking city services from intake to resolution, in addition to taking non-emergency police calls. When the new service was launched, information regarding all city services, service requests, assistance in reaching various city departments and public offices, and a variety of information ranging from information about the city&#x27;s Blue Bag recycling program to special events schedules could be obtained by calling 3-1-1. This also supplanted the need to remember or find the number (312) 744–5000, which, until then, acted as a switching station for reaching various city departments and employees, as well as Chicago Police non-emergency (dialing this number today directs you to a 3-1-1 center operator from any area code). Since its launch, Chicago 3-1-1 has won numerous national awards, including the Innovations in American Government Award from the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2003. In addition to providing seamless delivery of city services to residents, the call center serves as a backup to the city&#x27;s 911 call center.

In Orange County, Florida, in 2004, while the 3-1-1 system was still being piloted, three hurricanes struck Central Florida. The unusual occurrence damaged homes and businesses throughout the Orlando area. The pilot program used a seven-digit number (initially 836–3111) and it was this number that received the demands for post-hurricane services. This experience tested and proved the value of the program and Orange County immediately activated the 3-1-1 number for governmental customer service.

In New York City, 3-1-1 is used by city officials as one of several sources of measurement and information about the performance of city services. Important dates in the history of New York&#x27;s 3-1-1 service include December 20, 2005, when it received its record high of 240,000 calls, due to the first day of the 2005 New York City transit strike, and June 20, 2007, when it received its 50 millionth call.

In San Francisco, 3-1-1 is the number for the City and County of San Francisco. As in New York City, it provides information about city services, such as transit information. San Francisco 3-1-1 was implemented in 2007 shortly after the launch of the T Third Street Muni light rail line. However, it has come under substantial criticism of late because the 3-1-1 system charges the financially strapped Muni system $1.96 for every Muni-related phone call. Some have criticized Mayor Gavin Newsom for stealing Muni funds into the 3-1-1 system.

In the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 3-1-1 is also used to find lost pets, get answers to questions about taxes, complain about needed roadway maintenance, get information about flood conditions, make non-emergency police reports, and other government services.

The City of Philadelphia implemented its 3-1-1 service in 2008. The Philly311 Contact Center provides information to citizens and places service requests for departments across the city. These requests include but are not limited to: missed rubbish collection, graffiti removal, License &amp; Inspection inquiries, and pothole repairs. Philly311 receives over one million calls each year despite not being in service on a 24/7 basis, as is the case in other cities.

<text>Melquíades Rafael Ruiz Martínez (born October 23, 1946) is a Cuban-American lobbyist and former politician who served as a United States senator from Florida from 2005 to 2009 and as general chairman of the Republican Party from November 2006 until October 19, 2007. Previously, Martínez served as the 12th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George W. Bush. Martínez is a Cuban-American and Roman Catholic. He announced he was resigning as general chairman of the Republican National Committee on October 19, 2007.

Martínez resigned his United States Cabinet post on August 12, 2004, to run for the open U.S. Senate seat in Florida being vacated by retiring Democratic Senator Bob Graham. Martínez secured the Republican nomination and narrowly defeated the Democratic nominee, Betty Castor. His election made him the first Cuban-American to serve in the U.S. Senate. On December 2, 2008, Martínez announced he would not be running for re-election to the Senate in 2010.

On August 7, 2009, &quot;CNN&quot; and the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; reported that Martínez would be resigning from his Senate seat. Later that month, Governor Charlie Crist announced that he would appoint George LeMieux as the successor to Martínez for the remaining year and a half of the Senate term.

Two weeks after Martínez resigned his Senate seat, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that he would become a lobbyist and partner at international firm DLA Piper. He left DLA Piper in August 2010 to become chairman of Chase Bank Florida and its operations in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Martinez is currently chairman of the Southeast and Latin America for JPMorgan, Chase &amp; Co. Martínez also serves as a co-chair of the Housing Commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

==Early life==
Martínez was born in Sagua La Grande, Cuba, the son of Gladys V. (Ruíz) and Melquíades C. Martínez. He came to the United States in 1962 as part of a Roman Catholic humanitarian effort called Operation Peter Pan, which brought into the U.S. more than 14,000 children. Catholic charitable groups provided Martinez a temporary home at two youth facilities. At the time Martínez was alone and spoke virtually no English. He graduated from Bishop Moore High School in 1964. He subsequently lived with two foster families, and in 1966 was reunited with his family in Orlando.

Martínez received an associate degree from Orlando Junior College in 1967, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international affairs from Florida State University, and his Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University College of Law in 1973. He began his legal career working at the Orlando personal injury law firm Wooten Kimbrough, where he became a partner and worked for more than a decade. During his 25 years of law practice in Orlando, he was involved in various civic organizations. He served as vice-president of the board of Catholic Charities of the Orlando Diocese.

==Early political career==
In 1994, Martínez ran for Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He teamed up with future Family Research Council President Ken Connor, the gubernatorial candidate. The Connor/Martínez ticket was defeated in the Republican primary, finishing fifth with 83,945 votes, or 9.31% of the vote.

On November 3, 1998, Martínez was elected Orange County Chairman (during Martínez&#x27;s tenure the position was relabeled mayor). While in office, Martínez implemented what became known as the &quot;Martínez doctrine&quot; which prohibits development from taking place unless adequate public infrastructure, specifically school capacity, is able to support such development. The doctrine was challenged in court, but its legality was upheld when the Florida Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to a lower court&#x27;s ruling. Martínez served as mayor through the end of 2000.

Before becoming Secretary of HUD, Martínez served on the Governor&#x27;s Growth Management Study Commission. He previously served as president of the Orlando Utilities Commission, on the board of directors of a community bank, and as chairman of the Orlando Housing Authority.

Serving as co-chairman of then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential election campaign in Florida, Martínez was a leading fundraiser. He was one of the 25 electors from Florida, who voted for Bush in the 2000 election. While serving as HUD Secretary, Martínez sat as an ex officio member of the President&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans.

Mel Martínez and his wife Kitty have three children and five grandchildren. He is the brother of Rafael E. Martínez. Mel Martínez resides in Orlando.

==U.S. Senate election, 2004==
In November 2004, Martínez was the Republican nominee in the U.S. Senate election to replace retiring Democrat Bob Graham. Much of Martínez&#x27;s support came from Washington: he was endorsed early by many prominent Republican groups, and publicly supported by key national Republican figures such as Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. His Cuban background and his popularity in the battleground Orlando, Florida, region both contributed to his appeal to the statewide GOP in Florida. But Internet magazine Salon reported that Martínez wanted to run for governor in 2006, though the GOP convinced him to run for the Senate two years earlier instead.

===Primary===
Martínez&#x27;s nomination by the Republican Party was far from certain. He was seriously challenged by former Congressman Bill McCollum. McCollum criticized Martínez&#x27;s background as a plaintiff&#x27;s attorney, and many Republicans initially feared that Martínez&#x27;s nomination would destroy the GOP&#x27;s ability to criticize Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards&#x27; background. Martínez was also said to be soft on tort reform, a major Republican issue in the 2004 race.
After a McCollum surge in the final weeks leading up to the primary, Martínez fought back in the last week of the race, putting out mass mailings and television ads that called McCollum &quot;the new darling of homosexual extremists,&quot; pointing out that McCollum had sponsored hate crimes legislation while a member of the House of Representatives. Martínez pulled some of the more offensive ads from the air after a personal appeal from Governor Jeb Bush, but never disavowed them. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; took the extraordinary step of revoking its endorsement of Martínez in the Republican primary and endorsing McCollum.

In the Republican primary on August 31, Martínez won a decisive victory over McCollum (45 to 31 percent). Shortly afterward, he spoke alongside President Bush at the 2004 Republican National Convention on September 2.

During part of his tenure in the Senate, Martínez sat at the Candy desk.

===General election===
Martínez defeated his Democratic opponent, Betty Castor, in a very close election that was preceded by numerous negative television ads from both campaigns. Martínez&#x27;s margin of victory was small enough that a winner was not declared until Castor conceded the day after the election.

Twelve of Martinez&#x27;s 25 stops on taxpayer-funded domestic trips as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 2003 were to Florida cities, at the same time that he was also campaigning for Senate in Florida.

President Bush won in Florida by 52%-47%, but Martínez only won 49.5%-48.4%, with a margin of about 70,000 votes. Martínez did much worse than Bush in the Tampa area, such as in Hillsborough, and Pinellas counties, and in smaller counties such as Liberty and Lafayette. The only counties that Martínez won that Bush did not were Orange and Miami-Dade.

===Campaign reporting violation===
In August 2006, the Martínez campaign acknowledged that the 2004 campaign had been under review by the Federal Election Commission for more than a year. Following the 2004 election, Martínez originally reported that his $12-million campaign had about $115,000 in debt, according to FEC documents. But a revision showed his campaign instead owed $685,000 in election expenses. The campaign spent about $300,000 in accounting and attorney&#x27;s fees related to the 2004 campaign. On October 28, 2008, Republican Sen. Mel Martínez agreed to pay $99,000 in fines for his campaign&#x27;s failure to comply with federal election laws, including its acceptance of excess contributions, records show. An FEC audit found Martínez&#x27;s campaign accepted a total of $313,235 in contributions that exceeded limits from 186 donors. The fine was agreed to by the FEC on Sep 10 and was posted a month later in its database.

The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in August 2006 that alleged Martínez illegally accepted more than $60,000 from the Bacardi beverage company in the campaign. CREW alleged Bacardi violated the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and FEC regulations by soliciting contributions from a list of the corporation&#x27;s vendors for these campaigns, and by using corporate funds to pay for food and beverages at campaign events held in the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters on May 11, 2004. An amended complaint by CREW in October 2006 alleged similar behavior by Bacardi for Democratic Senator Bill Nelson&#x27;s 2006 re-election campaign. In April 2007, the FEC notified CREW it had reviewed the allegations against Bacardi, the Martínez campaign and the Nelson campaign, found no reason to believe any of the alleged violations occurred, and closed the matter.

==Staffing controversies==

On April 6, 2005, Martínez accepted the resignation of his legal counsel, Brian Darling, who was responsible for writing and circulating the Schiavo memo related to the Terry Schiavo case.
Martínez immediately denied all knowledge of Darling&#x27;s involvement in the situation, noting that he himself had inadvertently passed a copy of the memo to Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, believing that it was nothing more than an outline of the Republican proposal. Martínez asserted that the memo &quot;was intended to be a working draft,&quot; stating that Darling &quot;doesn&#x27;t really know how I got it.&quot;

The Schiavo memo is the third incident in which Martínez accepted broad responsibility while laying blame upon a staffer for the underlying deed. During the Republican primary, a staffer was blamed for a passage in a campaign flyer painting his opponent Bill McCollum as a servant of the &quot;radical homosexual lobby.&quot; Shortly thereafter another staffer was blamed for labeling federal agents involved in the Elián González affair as &quot;armed thugs.&quot;

In spite of Martínez&#x27;s vocal objections to homosexual issues such as gay marriage, he employed two gay men in his 2004 Senate campaign.

==Republican National Committee==

In November 2006, Martínez was named general chairman of the Republican Party for the 2007–2008 election cycle (Mike Duncan handled the day-to-day operations). Some felt the choice was made in part due to the dip in support for Republicans among Latino voters in the 2006 midterm elections. Some conservatives objected to Martínez&#x27;s selection, citing his positions on immigration and their general lack of enthusiasm for his performance as senator. Martínez stepped down from this position on October 19, 2007.

==Published works==

In August 2008, Martínez released an autobiography titled &quot;A Sense of Belonging; From Castro&#x27;s Cuba to the U.S. Senate, One Man&#x27;s Pursuit of the American Dream&quot;. The book was written by Martínez with Ed Breslin (Crown Publishing, August 2008) .

The book &quot;Immigrant Prince&quot; is a biography about Martínez written by Richard E. Foglesong, the George and Harriet Cornell Professor of Politics at Rollins College (University Press of Florida, April 2011) .

==Lobbying Spanish government officials on behalf of United States==

Three months into Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential term, the administration tapped Senator Mel Martínez to deliver a private message to Spanish government officials in order to thwart a probe into former Bush administration officials for rendition and torture of Guantanamo detainees which the U.S. was failing to investigate. According to Carol Rosenberg, &quot;The cause for alarm at the U.S. Embassy was what a U.S. diplomat called a &#x27;well documented&#x27; 12-inch-tall dossier compiled by a Spanish human rights group. In the name of five Guantánamo captives with ties to Spain, it accused the Bush legal insiders of laying the foundation for abuse of detainees in the months following the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The six accused are: former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales; David Addington, former chief of staff and legal adviser to the Vice President; William Haynes, former DOD General Counsel; Douglas Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; Jay Bybee, former head of the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel; and John Yoo, a former member of Bybee&#x27;s staff.

On April 15, 2009, Martínez met with Acting Foreign Minister Angel Losada on a visit to the Spanish foreign ministry, where he warned that an investigation would have consequences, and &quot;that prosecutions would not be understood or accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship.&quot; Lossada told Martínez that he understood the complications but &quot;the independence of the judiciary and the process must be respected&quot;, and &quot;that the executive branch of government could not close any judicial investigation and urged that this case does not affect the overall relationship, adding that our interests were much broader, and that the universal jurisdiction case should not be viewed as a reflection of the Spanish Government&#x27;s position.&quot;

Following the outreach, the Spanish Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido&#x27;s press chief told the media that the Prosecutor&#x27;s office will deliver the AG&#x27;s recommendation to the National Court, where it will be up to investigating judge Baltasar Garzon to decide whether to pursue the case or not. Baltasar Garzon has been an outspoken critic of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and has publicly stated that former President George W. Bush should be tried for war crimes.

In April 2010, on the advice of the Spanish Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido, who believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court ever thinks about becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge Garzon should drop his investigation. As CNN reported, Mr. Conde-Pumpido told reporters that Judge Garzon&#x27;s plan threatened to turn the court &quot;into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action.&quot;

==Positions==
* Abortion: Rated 100% by National Right to Life Committee, which indicates an anti-abortion stance. Morally opposed to abortion even in case of rape or incest, he supports education to reduce abortions, and supports the promotion of alternatives such as adoption. His position on the legality of abortion is unclear, but he has indicated that he would not vote for prosecuting involved parties even in the event of a reversal of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. In a debate moderated by Tim Russert, Martínez stated:

&quot;The bottom line is I don&#x27;t plan on prosecuting anyone. When I go to the United States Senate, I&#x27;m going to be confirming judges who will go to the courts, and the courts will deal with the issue. This is not up for a vote by the United States Senate.&quot; He added, &quot;We&#x27;re far from prosecuting people in this country over that issue&quot;

* Economy: Supports free trade generally; supports tax cuts; advocates lowering regulation of employers and reducing liability insurance burdens.
* Education: Supports No Child Left Behind Act; advocates more standardized testing; supports school voucher programs; supports English-only education.
* Immigration: In his 2004 campaign, Martínez said &quot;Our immigration policy should first and foremost ensure the security of our great Nation and those individuals posing a terrorist threat should be prevented from entering our country. I strongly oppose amnesty for illegal aliens; our immigration laws should not reward lawlessness&quot; and &quot;I oppose amnesty for illegal aliens. I support a plan that matches workers with needy employers without providing a path to citizenship. Immigration to this country must always be done through legal means&quot; In a 2006 after election platform reversal, he helped craft the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 that would be referred to by much of his own party as &quot;amnesty&quot;. (See On June 28, 2007, he would later vote for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 – which he helped form with other Senate leaders – that would allow many illegal immigrants to become citizens. The bill was defeated through being denied cloture on the Senate floor.
* Environment: Supports funding state conservation preservation funding without raising taxes; supports opening up maximum amount of Forest Services federal land for hunting and shooting sports; supports &quot;voluntary incentives&quot; legislation to make it easier for private landowners to set aside land for hunting, shooting, and conservation purposes.
* Foreign policy
** Cuba: Critical of Cuba&#x27;s human rights record; supports tightening travel and strengthening the economic and trade blockade against Cuba; supports U.S. government funding of persons in Cuba who are opposed to current Cuban government; opposes foreign aid to countries that oppose U.S. policies; Advocates closure of Guantanamo Bay detainment camp Senator Martínez is also a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus
** Iraq: Supports the Bush Doctrine, but has asserted that the U.S. erred in hastily dismantling the Iraqi Army.
** Israel: Supports Israeli self-determination; supports close ties between U.S. and Israel
* Health care: Supports private Medicare and Social Security accounts for new workers; advocates more thorough investigations of Medicare fraud; supports reimportation of drugs from Canada.
* Homeland security: Opposes base closures in Florida; advocates maintaining &quot;the strongest military in the world.&quot; Even to the point of spending additional funds to keep Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates in service even after they have lost their air defense missile capabilities.
* Religion: Supports free exercise of religion; opposes &quot;removing all public displays of religious devotion&quot; from society.
* Same-sex marriage and gay rights: Supported an amendment to the United States Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In June 2006, he was quoted on the matter regarding not amending the Constitution, thus leaving each State to come up with its own laws, &quot;It isn&#x27;t good enough to say, &#x27;Leave it up to the states.&#x27; ... If we leave it up to the states, we will see the erosion of marriage that we&#x27;ve seen by activist courts, which we otherwise will not see if we protect the institution of marriage at the federal level&quot;. He opposed legislation that would prevent employers from firing gays and has declined to endorse anti hate crimes legislation. In 2006, Kansas U.S. Senator Sam Brownback blocked a confirmation vote on a George W. Bush federal appeals court nominee from Michigan, judge Janet T. Neff, objecting to her joining the bench solely for her having attended a same-sex commitment ceremony in Massachusetts in 2002 which involved a next door neighbor who was a close childhood friend of Neff&#x27;s daughters. In July 2007, he finally lifted his block that had prevented the vote, and Brownback was joined in opposition by just three other conservatives, including Senator Martinez.
* Senior Citizens: Lead sponsor of legislation to create a nationwide Silver Alert program to help locate missing seniors.
* U.S. Supreme Court nominations: Has voted in favor of all three nominees who were nominated during his Senate tenure: John Roberts (2005), Samuel Alito (2006), and Sonia Sotomayor (2009).
* Welfare: Supports Republican-style welfare reforms encouraging personal responsibility; supports programs for job training and retraining.
* Public housing: Supports providing housing for peoples of a needy situation: physically, mentally, as well as financially. When secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Senator Martínez played a large part in the construction of housing and continued to do so as a junior senator.

On January 25, 2008, Martínez endorsed Sen. John McCain in the Florida Republican primary of the 2008 presidential election, citing McCain&#x27;s understanding of national security and economic and foreign policy. McCain subsequently won the primary.

<text>The first USS &quot;Hatteras&quot; was a 1,126-ton iron-hulled steamer purchased by the Union Navy at the beginning of the American Civil War. She was outfitted as a gunboat and assigned to the Union blockade of the ports and waterways of the Confederate States of America. During an engagement with the disguised Confederate commerce raider, CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, she was taken by surprise and was sunk off the coast of Galveston, Texas. The wreck site is one of the few listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its location away from destructive surf and because of the ship&#x27;s side-wheel design, which marks the transition between wooden sailing ships and steam-powered ships.

&quot;Hatteras&quot; (formerly &quot;St. Mary&quot;) was purchased by the U. S. Navy from Harlan and Hollingsworth of Wilmington, Delaware on 25 September 1861. She was fitted out at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and commissioned in October 1861, Commander George F. Emmons in command.

==Civil War service==

&quot;Hatteras&quot; sailed for Key West, Florida on 5 November 1861, arriving there on 13 November to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron to choke off the South&#x27;s economic lifeline as part of president Lincoln&#x27;s Anaconda Plan. After blockade duty off Apalachicola, Florida, she was reassigned to Cedar Key, Florida, reaching there on 7 January 1862. Nine days later, &quot;Hatteras&quot; made a highly successful raid on the Cedar Keys harbor, burning seven small would-be blockade runners loaded with turpentine and cotton at the Florida Railroad wharf (an important Southern railroad terminus), several flat-cars, and various buildings.

To cap this day&#x27;s work, &quot;Hatteras&quot; also captured 14 of the 22-man garrison stationed there, including their commanding officer. Such unceasing attack from the sea on any point along her long coastline and inland waterways cost the South dearly in losses, economic disruption, and dispersion of defense strength.

After this exploit, &quot;Hatteras&quot; was transferred to the Gulf Blockading Squadron and arrived off Berwick, Louisiana on 26 January. The next day, she engaged CSS &quot;Mobile&quot;, but failed to do any serious damage when the light-draft ship withdrew to the safety of shallow water.

Nevertheless, the Gulf of Mexico proved to be a profitable hunting ground for &quot;Hatteras&quot;, as in less than a year, she captured seven blockade runners with assorted cargos of cotton, sugar, and other goods the South was desperately striving to export for gold or much needed trade goods. These captures netted &quot;Hatteras&quot;, among other things, some 534 bales of valuable cotton. Commander Emmons stationed four of his own men on board one prize ship, the sloop &quot;Poody&quot;, and rechristened her &quot;Hatteras Jr&quot;., turning the erstwhile blockade runner into a unit of the Union&#x27;s Gulf Blockading Squadron.

Other Confederate ships taken by &quot;Hatteras&quot; as prizes included: steamer &quot;Indian No. 2&quot;, &quot;schooner&quot; &quot;Magnolia&quot;, steamer &quot;Governor A. Mouton&quot;, schooner &quot;Sarah&quot;, sloop &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, and brig &quot;Josephine&quot;. The majority of these ships were captured off Vermilion Bay, Louisiana, as they ran toward either Havana, Cuba, or the Sabine River area of Texas.

However, her illustrious career was cut short in early 1863, not long after she was ordered to join the blockading squadron under Rear Admiral David Farragut, who was attempting to retake the key Texas port of Galveston. Under a new skipper, Commander Homer C. Blake, who had relieved Captain Emmons in November 1862, &quot;Hatteras&quot; joined Farragut&#x27;s squadron off Galveston on 6 January 1863.

===Encounter with the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;===

As the blockading fleet lay to off the coast near Galveston on the afternoon of 11 January 1863, a set of sails was sighted just over the horizon and &quot;Hatteras&quot; was ordered to give chase. She took off in pursuit of the unknown ship at about 15:00 (3:00 PM), and for the next four hours followed her as she ventured closer and closer to shore. Finally, as dusk was falling, &quot;Hatteras&quot; came within hailing distance of the square-rigged ship. Commander Blake demanded her identity. The Confederates identified themselves as the British gunvessel &quot;HMS Spitfire.&quot; Still suspicious, Blake ordered one of &quot;Hatteras&quot;″ boats to inspect this &quot;Britisher.&quot;
Scarcely had the longboat pulled away from &quot;Hatteras&quot; than a new reply to Blake&#x27;s question rang through the night. &quot;We are the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;.&quot; With this, the famed Confederate raider commanded by Raphael Semmes struck the Union Jack the raider had been flying, raising the Confederate Stars and Bars, and began raking &quot;Hatteras&quot; with her heavy cannon. Through the gloom, for about 20 minutes, the two ships exchanged heavy fire at distances ranging from . The flashes of the guns and their rumbling were heard in the Union squadron some away, and the cruiser was dispatched to investigate and render aid if needed.

But &quot;Hatteras&quot; had already been badly holed in two places and was on fire and beginning to sink. Captain Blake ordered the magazines flooded to prevent explosion and reluctantly fired a single bow gun, indicating surrender and a need for assistance. &quot;Alabama&quot;, promptly sent over her boats to help remove &quot;Hatteras&quot;&#x27; crew and wounded, and the last boatload of men had barely pulled away when the Union blockader sank, some 45 minutes after the beginning of the action.

Of &quot;Hatteras&quot;″ crew of 126, two had been killed and five wounded. Six escaped back to the squadron in the boat originally sent out to board and investigate &quot;HMS &quot;Petrel&quot;&quot;, and the remainder, including Captain Blake, were taken to Port Royal, Jamaica, and from there paroled back to the United States; &quot;Alabama&quot; suffered only two wounded.

When &quot;Brooklyn&quot; reached the site of the battle early the following morning, she found the hulk of &quot;Hatteras&quot; upright in the water about south of Galveston Light. Only &quot;Hatteras&quot;″ masts reached out of water, and from the topmast the U.S. Navy commissioning pennant was still waving in the breeze. Even after surrendering, she had not struck her colors.

==Present day==
The hull of &quot;Hatteras&quot; rests in approximately of water off of Galveston, Texas and is buried under about of sand. Her steam engine and two iron paddle wheels remain on the ocean bottom. The wreck is monitored to ensure that it is not damaged by oil and gas development in the area.

The wreck of &quot;Hatteras&quot; is the property of the United States Navy, though the Texas Historical Commission, Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston and the federal Minerals Management Service (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) cooperate in preserving the important historical site.

At one time, local treasure hunters filed suit claiming the right to salvage the ship, but the courts found in favor of the United States government, in one of the few times courts have ruled in favor of historic preservation of a shipwreck site versus commercial interests.

The Alabama Hills are named in honor of the CSS Alabama.

<text>Jonathan Trumbull Jr. (March 26, 1740 – August 7, 1809) was an American politician and military officer who served as the governor of Connecticut, speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and lieutenant governor of Connecticut. He is often confused with his younger brother, John Trumbull, a famous artist during the revolutionary war and early years of the United States.

==Early life==
Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, the second son of Jonathan Trumbull Sr. (the eventual governor of Connecticut) and his wife Faith Robinson, daughter of Rev. John Robinson. Trumbull graduated from Harvard College in 1759, and gave the valedictory address when he received his master&#x27;s degree in 1762. His brother John Trumbull was a noted painter of the Revolution.

Trumbull served in the Continental Army as paymaster general of the Northern Department from July 28, 1775, to July 29, 1778. In February 1781, he was given the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was included in the general orders of June 8, 1781: &quot;Jonathan Trumbull. Esqr., Junior, is appointed Secretary to the Commander in Chief and to be respected accordingly.&quot; He served for the duration of the war as aide-de-camp to General George Washington until December 28, 1783. After the war, he became an original member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati.

===United States Congress===
Elected to the First, Second, and Third Congresses, Trumbull served in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1795. He was the Speaker of the House in the Second Congress, both preceded and succeeded by Frederick A. C. Muhlenberg. He did not seek re-election for a fourth term and instead ran for the United States Senate.

When Trumbull was elected to the United States Senate, he served from March 4, 1795, to June 10, 1796.

<doc id="296708" wikidata="Q312612" url="?curid=296708" title="Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino">
<text>Lorenzo di Piero de&#x27; Medici (; 12 September 1492 – 4 May 1519) was the ruler of Florence from 1516 until his death in 1519. He was also Duke of Urbino during the same period. His daughter Catherine de&#x27; Medici became Queen Consort of France, while his illegitimate son, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, became the first Duke of Florence.

==Early life==
Lorenzo was born in Florence on 12 September 1492, a son of Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and Alfonsina Orsini. His paternal grandparents were Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini. His maternal grandparents were Roberto Orsini, Count of Tagliacozzo and his wife, Catherine of San Severino.

==Career==
Lorenzo II became lord of Florence in August 1513, after his uncle, Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, handed over control of its government. Ambitious by nature, Lorenzo II, despite being appointed Captain of the Florentine militia, lacked patience with Florence&#x27;s republican system of government and thus, in 1516, convinced his uncle, Pope Leo X to make him Duke of Urbino at the age of 24. So began a conflict with the city&#x27;s previous duke, Francesco Maria I della Rovere. During the protracted War of Urbino, Delle Rovere recaptured the city, only to have Medici — commanding a 10,000-man Papal army — in turn, retake the city. During battle, Lorenzo was wounded, which prompted him to retire to Tuscany. In September 1517, he regained Urbino via treaty; however, it remained under the Medici family&#x27;s rule for only two years. In 1521 the duchy reverted to the Della Rovere family.

On 13 June 1518, Lorenzo married Madeleine de la Tour, daughter of the Count of Auvergne. The marriage produced a daughter, Catherine, in 1519. Catherine de&#x27; Medici went on to become Queen of France, via a marriage to the future King Henry II of France, arranged by the second Medici Pope, Pope Clement VII.

Only 21 days after Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s birth, Lorenzo II died, &quot;worn out by disease and excess.&quot; Thus his daughter Catherine was raised primarily by the Medici Popes, Leo X and Clement VII, and their surrogates.

Lorenzo II&#x27;s tomb is in the Medici Chapel of Florence&#x27;s Church of San Lorenzo. There is disagreement over which of the two tombs is Lorenzo II&#x27;s. The received view is that Lorenzo&#x27;s tomb that is adorned by Michelangelo&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Pensieroso&quot;, which offers an idealized portrait of Lorenzo II, and that its companion piece, also sculpted by Michelangelo, represents Lorenzo II&#x27;s uncle Giuliano di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. But historian Richard Trexler has argued that Lorenzo II, having been Captain of the Florentine militia, must be the figure holding the baton, symbol of military authority conferred by the Republic. Trexler also notes that the &quot;Pensieroso&quot; is holding a mappa, the symbol of military authority in ancient Rome, which would be an appropriate symbol for Giuliano di Lorenzo, who was appointed Captain of Roman forces. In sharing the same name with his illustrious ancestor, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Duke&#x27;s tomb is often mistaken for that of his grandfather.

Famously, Niccolò Machiavelli dedicated his political treatise &quot;The Prince&quot; to Lorenzo to advise him of tactics to use to maintain his authority.

<text>Harssens is a former town located in Groningen, Netherlands.

It was already established in the 14th century with a coat of arms of a blue &#x27;griffioen&#x27; (winged, lanky, standing lion figure). In 1604 when Warmolus Hilbrandus addressed Kaiser Rudolf II of the Holy Roman Empire the Kaiser made Hildbrandus lord of the estate and recognized the coat of arms. By 1742 the Hilbrandus manor and the church in Harssens were dismantled. The rights to the coat of arms remained and when Adorp was established as a township in 1809 the winged lion of Harssens had a place of honour in the town crest.

Harssens is no longer a town but there are plans to rebuild the estate or Harssensborg as a tourist attraction.

<text>This is a list of ships of the Confederate States Navy (CSN), used by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865. Included are some types of civilian vessels, such as blockade runners, steamboats, and privateers which contributed to the war efforts by the CSN. Also included are special types of floating batteries and harbor defense craft.

==CSN Warships==
The Secretary of the CS Navy, Stephen Mallory, was very aggressive on a limited budget in a land-focused war, and developed a two-pronged warship strategy of building ironclad warships for coastal and national defense, and commerce raiding cruisers, supplemented with exploratory use of special weapons such as torpedo boats and torpedoes.

===Batteries===
Based upon the successful employment of ironclad warships, particularly batteries, at the Battle of Kinburn, Britain and France decided to focus on armor plated warships, starting with coastal battery designs. Initial ocean going ironclad cruisers, such as the French and the British were only just emerging in 1859 and 1860, and were beyond the budget and timeline necessary for rapid force deployment that the CS Navy needed for immediate coastal defenses in 1861.

Therefore, the Confederate Congress voted $2 million in May 1861 to buy ironclads from overseas, and in July and August started work on construction and converting wooden ships locally. On 12 October 1861, the became the first ironclad to enter battle when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi. In February 1862, the even larger joined the Confederate Navy, having been built at Norfolk. The Confederacy built a number of ships designed as versions of the &quot;Virginia&quot;, of which several saw action. In the failed attack on Charleston on April 7, 1863, two small ironclads, and participated in the successful defense of the harbor. For the later attack at Mobile Bay, the Union faced the .

===Cruisers===
CS Navy cruisers were ocean-going ships designed primarily for the Confederate Navy&#x27;s strategy of &quot;guerre de course&quot;. Confederate States Navy cruisers were typically lightly armed, with a couple of large guns or a pivot gun, and often very fast. The Navy planned to add ironclad cruisers to their fleet, successfully procuring one, but too late to be of benefit for the war.

<text>Daniel Kahikina Akaka (; September 11, 1924 – April 6, 2018) was an American educator and politician who served as a United States Senator from Hawaii from 1990 to 2013. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Honolulu, he served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. He attended the University of Hawaii, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Originally a high school teacher, Akaka went on to serve as a principal for six years. In 1969, the Department of Education hired him as a chief program planner. In the 1970s, he served in various governmental positions.

Akaka was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1976 to represent Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district; he served for 13 years. In 1990, he was appointed to the U.S. Senate to succeed the deceased Spark Matsunaga, subsequently winning the special election to complete Matsunaga&#x27;s term. He would later be reelected to three full terms. In March 2011, he announced he would not run for reelection in 2012.

After fellow U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye died on December 17, 2012, Akaka became the state&#x27;s senior senator for 2 weeks until he left office on January 3, 2013. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat Mazie Hirono.

==Early life, family, and education==

Daniel Kahikina Akaka was born in Honolulu, the son of Annie (née Kahoa) and Kahikina Akaka. His paternal grandfather was born in Shantou, Guangdong, China, and his other grandparents were of Native Hawaiian descent. His brother was Rev. Abraham Akaka.

Akaka described Hawaiian as his &quot;native tongue&quot;.

Akaka graduated from Kamehameha Schools in 1942. During World War II he served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, including service on Saipan and Tinian. He served from 1945 to 1947. He worked as a welder and a mechanic and in 1948 was a first mate on the schooner &quot;Morning Star&quot;.

Akaka married Mary Mildred &quot;Millie&quot; Chong on May 22, 1948. The Akakas had five children.

Entering college (funded by the G.I. Bill), Akaka earned a Bachelor of Education in 1952 from the University of Hawaii. He later received a Master of Education from the same school in 1966.

==Early career==
Akaka worked as a high school teacher in Honolulu from 1953 until 1960, when he was hired as a vice principal. In 1963, he became head principal.

In 1969, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare hired Akaka as a chief program planner. Akaka continued working in government, holding positions as director of the Hawaii Office of Economic Opportunity, human resources assistant for Governor George Ariyoshi, and director of the Progressive Neighborhoods Program.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Akaka was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1976 to represent , comprising all of the state outside the city of Honolulu. He was reelected seven times, all by wide margins; apart from 1986, when he obtained 76%, he never received less than 80 percent of the vote. 

==U.S. Senate (1990-2013)==
===Elections===

Akaka was appointed by Governor John Waihee to the U.S. Senate in April 1990 to serve temporarily after the death of Senator Spark Matsunaga. In November of the same year, he was elected to complete the remaining four years of Matsunaga&#x27;s unexpired term, defeating U.S. Representative Pat Saiki with 53% of the vote. He was reelected in 1994 for a full six-year term with over 70% of the vote. He was reelected almost as easily in 2000.

For the 2006 election, he overcame a strong primary challenge from U.S. Representative Ed Case, then won a third full term with 61 percent of the vote, defeating Cynthia Thielen.

===Tenure===
During his Senate tenure, Akaka served as the Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the United States Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

In 1996, Akaka sponsored legislation that led to nearly two-dozen Medals of Honor being belatedly awarded to Asian-American soldiers in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion. He also passed legislation compensating Philippine Scouts who were refused veterans benefits.

From 2000 until his retirement from the Senate in 2013, Akaka sponsored legislation, known as the Akaka Bill, to afford sovereignty to Native Hawaiians. In 2005, Akaka acknowledged in an interview with NPR that the Akaka Bill could eventually result in outright independence.

The Akaka Bill has been supported as a means of restoring Hawaiian self-determination lost with the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It would include giving up the ability to sue for sovereignty in federal courts in exchange for recognition by the federal government (but would not block sovereignty claims made under international law.) The bill has been criticized as discriminating on the basis on ethnic origin in that only Native Hawaiians would be permitted to participate in the governing entity that the bill would establish.

In October 2002, Akaka voted against authorizing the use of military force against Iraq.

In April 2006, Akaka was ranked by &quot;Time&quot; as one of America&#x27;s Five Worst Senators. The article criticized him for mainly authoring minor legislation, calling him &quot;master of the minor resolution and the bill that dies in committee&quot;.

In February 2009, a bill was authored in the Philippine House of Representatives by Rep. Antonio Diaz seeking to confer honorary Filipino citizenship on Akaka, Senators Daniel Inouye and Ted Stevens and Representative Bob Filner, for their role in securing the passage of benefits for Filipino World War II veterans.

On March 2, 2011, Akaka announced he would not be running for re-election in the 2012 U.S. Senate elections. The 88-year-old Akaka attended his final session in the Senate on December 12, 2012. He closed his speech with a traditional Hawaiian farewell, &quot;a hui hou&quot; (until we meet again).

<doc id="296724" wikidata="Q419976" url="?curid=296724" title="Lamar Alexander">
<text>Andrew Lamar Alexander Jr. (born July 3, 1940) is an American politician and attorney who served as a United States senator from Tennessee from 2003 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he also was the 45th governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987 and the 5th United States secretary of education from 1991 to 1993, where he helped with the implementation of Education 2000.

Born in Maryville, Tennessee, Alexander graduated from Vanderbilt University and the New York University School of Law. After establishing a legal career in Nashville, Tennessee, Alexander ran for Governor of Tennessee in 1974, but was defeated by Democrat Ray Blanton. Alexander ran for governor again in 1978, and this time defeated his Democratic opponent, Jake Butcher. He won re-election in 1982 and served as chairman of the National Governors Association from 1985 to 1986.

Alexander served as the president of the University of Tennessee from 1988 until 1991, when he accepted an appointment as Secretary of Education under President George H. W. Bush. Alexander sought the presidential nomination in the 1996 Republican primaries, but withdrew before the Super Tuesday primaries. He sought the nomination again in the 2000 Republican primaries, but dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa Straw Poll.

In 2002, Alexander was elected to succeed retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson. Alexander defeated Congressman Ed Bryant in the Republican primary and Democratic Congressman Bob Clement in the general election. He served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 2007 to 2012 and as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee from 2015 to 2021. He introduced the Every Student Succeeds Act, which supplanted the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015. On December 17, 2018, Alexander announced that he would not run for a fourth term in the Senate in 2020.

==Early life and education==

Alexander was born and raised in Maryville, Tennessee, the son of Genevra Floreine (&quot;née&quot; Rankin), a preschool teacher, and Andrew Lamar Alexander, a high school principal. His family is of Scotch-Irish descent. He attended Maryville High School, where he was class president, and was elected Governor of Tennessee Boys State.

In 1962, Alexander graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin American studies. He was a member of Sigma Chi. Alexander was the editor of &quot;The Vanderbilt Hustler&quot;, the primary student newspaper on campus, and he advocated for the open admission of African Americans. At Vanderbilt, he was a member of the track and field team. In 1965, he obtained his Juris Doctor from the New York University School of Law.

==Career==

===Early political career===

After graduating from law school, Alexander clerked for United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Judge John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1965 to 1966.

In 1967, Alexander worked as a Legislative Assistant for Senator Howard Baker. While a staffer, he was briefly roommates with future U.S. Senator Trent Lott, and met his future wife at a staffer softball game. In 1969, he worked for Bryce Harlow, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s executive assistant. In 1970, he moved back to Tennessee, serving as campaign manager for Memphis dentist Winfield Dunn&#x27;s successful gubernatorial bid. Dunn was the first Republican in 50 years to win the governorship. After this campaign, Alexander co-founded and worked as a partner in the Nashville law firm of Dearborn and Ewing. Meanwhile, Alexander rented a garage apartment to Thomas W. Beasley, a student at the Vanderbilt Law School who later co-founded Corrections Corporation of America.

The Tennessee State Constitution at the time prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, so with Dunn unable to run, Alexander sought the party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1974. He defeated his two chief opponents, Commissioner of Mental Health Nat T. Winston, Jr., and Southwestern Company president Dortch Oldham, 120,773 votes to 90,980 and 35,683, respectively. He faced the Democratic nominee, Ray Blanton, a former congressman and unsuccessful 1972 Senate candidate, in the general election. Blanton attacked Alexander for his service under Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace several months earlier as a result of the Watergate scandal, and defeated Alexander on election day, 576,833 votes to 455,467.

After the 1974 campaign, Alexander returned to the practice of law. In 1974, &quot;TIME Magazine&quot; named Alexander one of the &quot;200 Faces of the Future&quot;. In 1977, Alexander once again worked in Baker&#x27;s Washington office following Baker&#x27;s election as Senate Minority Leader.

===Governor of Tennessee===

Although the Tennessee State Constitution had been amended in early 1978 to allow a governor to succeed himself, Blanton chose not to seek re-election, due to a number of scandals. Alexander once again ran for governor, and made a name for himself by walking from Mountain City in the far northeast of the state to Memphis in the far southwest, a distance of , wearing a red and black flannel shirt that would become something of a trademark for him. 

Investigative news reports, disclosed late during the 1978 Tennessee gubernatorial campaign, revealed that Alexander once transferred the non-profit charter of a Christian church to his Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain that he served as a director in order to sell liquor-by-the-drink in the once &quot;dry town&quot; of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. During the campaign, Alexander, then a Nashville attorney, vowed to place his $62,676 interest in the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain into an untouchable trust.

After winning the Republican nomination with nearly 86% of the vote, he defeated Knoxville banker Jake Butcher in the November 1978 election, 665,847 votes to 523,013.

In early 1979, a furor ensued over pardons made by Governor Blanton, whose administration was already under investigation in a cash-for-clemency scandal. Since the state constitution is somewhat vague on when a governor must be sworn in, several political leaders from both parties, including Lieutenant Governor John S. Wilder and State House Speaker Ned McWherter, arranged for Alexander to be sworn in on January 17, 1979, three days earlier than the traditional inauguration day, to prevent Blanton from signing more pardons. Wilder later called the move &quot;impeachment Tennessee-style.&quot;

In February 1979, shortly after his inauguration, Alexander created an Office of Ombudsman, which was charged with cutting government red tape. He also gave state employees a 7% raise, and replaced state prisoners working at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion with a paid staff. One of Alexander&#x27;s biggest accomplishments as governor was the relationship he cultivated with the Japanese corporate community, which resulted in the construction of a $660 million Nissan assembly plant in Smyrna in 1980, the largest single investment in the state&#x27;s history up to the time. Alexander was also instrumental in the location of General Motors&#x27; Saturn Manufacturing Facility in Spring Hill, which began operations in 1990.

In 1982 Alexander took advantage of the 1978 constitutional amendment allowing governors to serve a second consecutive four-year term. He ran again and defeated Knoxville mayor Randy Tyree, 737,963 votes to 500,937. During his second term, he served as chairman of the National Governors Association from 1985 to 1986, and was chair of the President&#x27;s Commission on American Outdoors, 1985 to 1986. He also oversaw the &quot;Tennessee Homecoming&quot; in 1986, in which local communities launched numerous projects that focused on state and local heritage.

In 1983, Alexander implemented his &quot;Better Schools&quot; program, which standardized basic skills for all students, and increased math, science and computer education. A portion of this plan, known as &quot;Master Teachers,&quot; or &quot;Career Ladder,&quot; called for income supplements for the state&#x27;s top teachers. Due to staunch opposition from the Tennessee Education Association, which derided the plan&#x27;s method of teacher evaluations, the bill initially died in the state legislature. Later that year, Alexander convinced House Speaker Ned McWherter to support an amended version of the bill, which passed.

In 1986, Alexander proposed the &quot;Better Roads Program&quot; to fund a backlog of needed highway projects. The project increased the state&#x27;s gasoline tax by three cents, and funded fifteen priority projects and six interstate-type projects including Interstate 840, the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and the eastern extension of the Pellissippi Parkway near Knoxville, now signed as Interstate 140. A similar initiative based on the Better Roads Program, the &quot;IMPROVE Act&quot;, was signed by Governor Bill Haslam in 2017.

After opting out of the 1984 US Senate contest for the open seat of retiring Majority Leader Howard Baker, Alexander was constitutionally ineligible for a third term and stepped down from the governorship on January 17, 1987. He was succeeded by Ned McWherter.

===President of the University of Tennessee===
Alexander along with his family moved to Australia for a short time in the late 1980s. While there he wrote a book titled &quot;Six Months Off&quot;. Upon returning to Tennessee, he served as president of the University of Tennessee from 1988 to 1991.

===United States Secretary of Education===

Alexander served as the United States Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993. As Education Secretary, he sparked controversy after he approved Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) to accredit schools despite an advisory panel that repeatedly recommended against it in 1991 and 1987.

In 1993, Steve Levicoff published a book-length critical discussion of TRACS and Alexander&#x27;s decision in &quot;When The TRACS Stop Short&quot;.

Former Department of Education employee and writer Lisa Schiffren has stated that, &quot;His fortune is founded on sweetheart deals not available to the general public, and a series of cozy sinecures provided by local businessmen. Such deals are not illegal...&quot; Schiffren further notes that, in 1987, Alexander helped found Corporate Child Care Management, Inc. (now known as Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.), a company thatvia a mergeris now the nation&#x27;s largest provider of worksite day care. While businessman Jack C. Massey spent $2 million on this enterprise, Alexander co-founded the company with only $5,000 of stock which increased in value to $800,000, a 15,900 percent return within four years. Also in 1987, he wrote a never-cashed investment check for $10,000 to Christopher Whittle for shares in Whittle Communications that increased in value to $330,000. In 1991, Alexander&#x27;s house, which he had recently purchased for $570,000, was sold to Whittle for $977,500. Alexander&#x27;s wife obtained an $133,000 profit from her $8,900 investment in a company created to privatize prisons. Alexander frequently shifted assets to his wife&#x27;s name, yet such transfers are not legal under federal ethics and security laws. In his 2005 U.S. Senate financial disclosure report, he listed personal ownership of BFAM (Bright Horizons Family Solutions) stock valued (at that time) between $1 million and $5 million. He taught about the American character as a faculty member at Harvard Kennedy School.

===United States presidential bids===

Alexander made two unsuccessful runs for President of the United States, in 1996 and 2000. In 1996, he finished third in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and dropped out before the Super Tuesday primaries. After dropping out of the race, Alexander took on an advisory role in the Dole/Kemp campaign. In 2000, during his second candidacy, he traveled around the US in a Ford Explorer, eschewing a campaign bus or plane. That journey lasted less than six months, from the announcement of Alexander&#x27;s candidacy on March 9, 1999, to his withdrawal on August 16, 1999, after a poor showing in the Ames Straw Poll. He ended both of his presidential campaigns in Nashville, Tennessee.

===U.S. Senate===

====Elections====
=====2002=====
Despite vowing not to return to elective office, Alexander was nevertheless persuaded by the White House to run for the open seat of retiring Senator Fred Thompson in 2002. Seen as a moderate Republican by Tennessee standards, his candidacy was vigorously opposed by conservatives, who instead supported US Representative, and a House manager during the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Ed Bryant.

Alexander was better-funded and armed with more prominent endorsements, however, and edged Bryant in the primary, 295,052 votes to 233,678. Democrats had high hopes of retaking the seat that they lost in 1994 with their candidate, US Representative Bob Clement, a member of a prominent political family. However, Clement&#x27;s campaign never really caught on, and Alexander defeated him in the general election with 54 percent of the vote. With his election to the US Senate, he became the first Tennessean to be popularly elected both governor and senator. At the age of 62, Alexander also became the oldest elected freshman US senator from Tennessee since Democrat Lawrence D. Tyson in 1924.

=====2008=====
In April 2007, Alexander announced he would run for re-election to the Senate in 2008.

Alexander was favored throughout the entire campaign, due to his long history in Tennessee politics and a disorganized Democratic opposition. His rivals were former state Democratic Party Chairman Bob Tuke, who won a heated primary, and Libertarian candidate Daniel T. Lewis.

Alexander won reelection, taking 65 percent of the vote to Tuke&#x27;s 32 percent. Alexander also carried all but one of Tennessee&#x27;s 95 counties; he lost only in Haywood County in western Tennessee, which was secured by Tuke. He won the normally Democratic strongholds of Davidson and Shelby counties—home to Nashville and Memphis, respectively. Alexander also benefited from riding the coattails of John McCain, who won the state with a solid majority.

=====2014=====
In December 2012, Alexander announced he would be seeking re-election to a third Senate term in 2014. Alexander&#x27;s campaign had a war chest of $3.1 million in cash going into his 2014 re-election bid.

In an August 2013 letter to Alexander signed by over 20 Tennessee Tea Party groups, the groups called on Alexander to retire from the Senate in 2014, or face a primary challenge. The letter stated: &quot;During your tenure in the Senate we have no doubt that you voted in a way which you felt was appropriate. Unfortunately, our great nation can no longer afford compromise and bipartisanship, two traits for which you have become famous. America faces serious challenges and needs policymakers who will defend conservative values, not work with those who are actively undermining those values.&quot;

Although Alexander was initially thought to be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, he worked to avoid this and ultimately did not face a high-profile challenger. He declared his intention to run early, quickly won the endorsement of Governor Bill Haslam, every living former Tennessee Republican Party chair person, and the state&#x27;s entire Republican congressional delegation, except for then scandal-hit Scott DesJarlais. He also raised a large amount of money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators Bob Bennett and Richard Lugar by trying to stay in touch with his constituents, especially in East Tennessee. Moreover, out-of-state conservative organizations such as the Senate Conservatives Fund made little effort to defeat Alexander.

Alexander won the Republican primary, defeating State Representative and Tea Party challenger Joe Carr. However, Alexander recorded the lowest winning percentage (49.7%) and lowest margin of victory (9.2 points) ever in a primary for a Republican U.S. senator from Tennessee. Carr won a larger percentage of the vote (40.5%) than the previous 11 challengers to sitting Republican U.S. senators in Tennessee history combined (40.3%). Alexander won the general election with 62% of the vote.

====Tenure====
In 2006, a newly discovered species of springtail found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park was named &quot;Cosberella lamaralexanderi&quot; in Alexander&#x27;s honor, because of his support of scientific research funding in the park and because the springtails&#x27; patterning is reminiscent of the plaid shirts Alexander typically wears while campaigning.

On October 6, 2018, Alexander was one of 50 senators (49 Republicans, 1 Democrat) who voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

=====Republican leadership=====
In late 2006, Alexander announced that he had secured the requisite number of votes to become the Republican Party&#x27;s Minority Whip in the Senate during the 110th Congress. Even though he was seen as the preferred choice of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Bush administration, he lost the election to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott by one vote (25–24).

Alexander would get a second shot at entering his party&#x27;s leadership a year later when Lott announced his intent to resign from the Senate by the end of 2007. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, then Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, ran for Whip and was elected without opposition. With the Conference Chair vacant, Alexander announced that he would seek the position. He would go on to defeat Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina by a margin of 31–16.

Alexander stepped down as Conference Chairman in January 2012, citing his desire to foster consensus. He said, &quot;I want to do more to make the Senate a more effective institution so that it can deal better with serious issues.&quot; He added, &quot;For these same reasons, I do not plan to seek a leadership position in the next Congress&quot;, ending speculation that he would run for the position of Republican Whip after Jon Kyl retired in 2013.

On December 17, 2018, Alexander announced that he would not seek another term in 2020. In an interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, he stated that he had made the decision as early as August 2018.

For his tenure as the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the 116th Congress, Alexander earned an &quot;F&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

=====2013 presidential inauguration role=====
As co-chairman of the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, Alexander was one of the speakers at the Second inauguration of Barack Obama on January 21, 2013, alongside the committee&#x27;s chair, Senator Charles Schumer.

The following is an incomplete list of legislation that Alexander introduced in the Senate.
* PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress) – a bill that would reauthorize research programs on preterm births that are run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It would also authorize grants and demonstration programs to be run by the Health Resources and Services Administration that will try to decrease preterm births. It passed the Senate on September 25, 2013.
* Exchange Information Disclosure Act – a bill that would require the government to report on the number of visitors and enrollees on the federal government&#x27;s healthcare exchanges, as well as what level of insurance coverage people buy on the exchanges. The bill would apply only to the federally run healthcare exchanges, which cover 36 states, not the state-run exchanges, according to &quot;Ripon Advance&quot;. On January 16, 2014, the U.S. House passed the bill. Its companion bill Exchange Information Disclosure Act (H.R. 3362; 113th Congress) was introduced in the House by Rep. Lee Terry (R, NE-2).

==Political positions==
===Iraq===
Before the Iraq War began, Alexander supported sending troops to Iraq and expressed his agreement with President Bush that Iraq must be dealt with immediately. A year after the war began, Alexander stated that the Iraq War had provided &quot;lessons&quot; to the nation, but went on to say that American troops should not be withdrawn, saying &quot;It would be even worse if we left before the job was done.&quot; In 2007, Alexander touted implementing the Iraq Study Group recommendations, noting that he believes Bush will be viewed as a Truman-esque figure if he implements the Group&#x27;s recommendations.

===Health care reform===
On July 15, 2009, Alexander voted against President Obama&#x27;s health care reform bill in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Alexander stated that he opposed the bill because, he said, it would result in higher state taxes, an increased federal debt, government-run health care, and Medicare cuts; he instead supported a different approach to reform. Alexander voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Alexander was part of the group of 13 senators who drafted the Senate version of the failed American Health Care Act of 2017 behind closed doors.

===Bipartisanship===

According to the 2009 annual vote studies by Congressional Quarterly, Alexander was one of the most bipartisan Republican members of the Senate. According to National Journal&#x27;s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 32nd most conservative member in the Senate.

Alexander broke ranks with conservative Senate Republicans when he announced his support for the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor.

Alexander, along with Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Representatives Tom Petri (R-Wisconsin) and David Price (D-North Carolina), requested that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences form The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, which was convened in 2010.

===Gun laws===
In April 2013, Alexander was one of 46 senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all gun buyers. Alexander voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the bill.

===National security===
Alexander critiqued President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from 7 Muslim-majority countries that were claimed to have increased terrorism risk until better screening methods were devised. He stated that the executive order was &quot;inconsistent with our American character.&quot;

===Saudi Arabia===
In March 2018, Alexander voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

===Energy and environment===
Alexander has voiced support for nuclear power on multiple occasions, and is a critic of wind power, believing wind turbines to be eyesores and dangerous to threatened bird populations. After the release of former Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s global warming film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; in 2006, Alexander criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film as a suggestion for mitigating climate change. He stated &quot;Maybe it needs a sequel: &#x27;An Inconvenient Truth 2: Nuclear Power.&#x27;&quot; Alexander also stated that &quot;Because (Gore) was a former vice president and presidential nominee, he brings a lot of visibility to (the issue). On the other hand it may be seen as political by some, and they may be less eager to be a part of it.&quot;

Alexander opposed the proposed Green New Deal, saying that it is not the proper solution to climate change and calling it &quot;an assault on cars, cows, and combustion,&quot; and in response proposed what he calls the &quot;New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy&quot; (named after the World War II-era Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb). The proposed plan contains ten major points of developing advanced nuclear power, more efficient natural gas, carbon capture, more efficient batteries, more efficient buildings, more electric vehicles, cheaper solar power, fusion power, advanced computing, and doubled funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science. Alexander proposed a similar plan by the same name in 2008.

===Trade===
In November 2018, Alexander was one of twelve Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) be submitted to Congress by the end of the month to allow a vote on it before the end of the year, as they were concerned &quot;passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult&quot; if having to be approved through the incoming 116th United States Congress.

===Judiciary===
In March 2016, around seven months before the next presidential election, Alexander declared his opposition to the Senate considering President Obama&#x27;s nominee to the Supreme Court. Alexander said: &quot;I believe it is reasonable to give the American people a voice by allowing the next president to fill this lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.&quot; In September 2020, with less than two months to the next presidential election, Alexander supported an immediate vote on President Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Alexander declared that &quot;even during a presidential election year&quot;, &quot;no one should be surprised that a Republican Senate majority would vote on a Republican president’s Supreme Court nomination&quot;.

===Impeachment of Donald Trump===

In the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Alexander was seen as a key swing voter in the bid to allow witness testimony in the trial. Near midnight on January 30, he said that he would vote against witnesses in the trial.

On January 31, Alexander voted against considering any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents. Alexander additionally voted for tabling four amendments: an amendment to subpoena John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, OMB employee Michael Duffey, and White House aide Robert Blair over the Ukraine scandal, an amendment to subpoena Bolton regarding the Ukraine scandal, an amendment to have Bolton give oral deposition and to testify before the Senate, and an amendment to have the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, to decide motions from any senator or party to subpoena relevant witnesses and documents that have relevance to the Impeachment articles. Alexander voted for a Senate resolution to the trial that passed, which concluded the witness testimony portion of the trial and moved to closing statements.

==Personal life==

In 1969, Alexander married Leslee &quot;Honey&quot; Buhler, who grew up in Victoria, Texas, and graduated from Smith College in Massachusetts. They had met during a softball game for Senate staff members. Together they have four children: Drew, Leslee, Kathryn, and Will. Drew passed away in 2021. After a six-month trip to Australia with his family in the late 1980s, Alexander wrote about their adventure in a book entitled &quot;Six Months Off&quot;.

Alexander is a classical and country pianist. He began taking piano lessons at age three, and won several competitions as a child. In April 2007, he played piano on singer Patti Page&#x27;s re-recording of her 1950 hit &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;. He appeared on the record at the invitation of record executive Mike Curb. Alexander and Page performed the song live at an April 4 fundraiser for his senatorial re-election campaign in Nashville&#x27;s Schermerhorn Symphony Center. While clerking for Judge Wisdom, he also played trombone, tuba and washboard at a Bourbon Street nightclub.

Alexander is a member of Sons of the Revolution. He is a member and elder of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Nashville, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA).

Alexander is an Eagle Scout, and used his Scouting experience in the Senate, sponsoring a 2010 resolution recognizing February 8, as &quot;Boy Scouts of America Day.&quot;

<doc id="296726" wikidata="Q5530992" url="?curid=296726" title="Gender neutrality">
<text>Gender neutrality (adjective form: gender-neutral), also known as gender-neutralism or the gender neutrality movement, is the idea that policies, language, and other social institutions (social structures or gender roles) should avoid distinguishing roles according to people&#x27;s sex or gender. This is in order to avoid discrimination arising from the impression that there are social roles for which one gender is more suited than another. The disparity in gender equality throughout history has had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including marketing, toys, education and parenting techniques. In order to increase gender neutrality in recent years, there has been a societal emphasis on utilizing inclusive language and advocating for equality.

==In policy==
Proponents of gender neutrality may support public policies designed to eliminate gender distinctions. Gender neutrality in the law has changed the nature of custody disputes, making it more likely that men will be awarded custody of their children in the event of a divorce.

The legal definition of gender has been a controversial topic to transgender people; in some countries, in order to be legally defined as a new gender, people must first undergo sex reassignment surgery resulting in sterilization.

California joined Oregon in its effort to recognize gender neutrality. On 15 October 2017, California governor Jerry Brown signed new legislation into law that allows persons the option to select gender-neutral on state identification cards. On 9 October 2021, governor Gavin Newsom signed California Assembly Bill 1084 requiring many department stores in California to maintain a gender neutral children&#x27;s section.

==Gender blindness==

Gender blindness is the practice of not distinguishing people by gender.

Someone who is gender blind does not necessarily side with ideas of movements found within gender-related biases, though these accounts are debatable.

For example, gender blindness can take place while hiring new candidates for a job position. The employer more so focuses on the resume and cover letter rather than focusing on their gender. This reduces gender-bias, meaning there is a preference of one gender to be favored over the other in certain topics and roles.

==Gender-neutral language==

Gender-neutral language, gender-inclusive language, inclusive language or gender neutrality is a form of linguistic prescriptivism that aims to eliminate (or neutralize) reference to gender in terms that describe people. This can involve discouragement of the use of gender-specific job titles, such as &quot;policeman/policewoman&quot;, &quot;fireman&quot;, &quot;stewardess&quot;, &quot;chairman&quot;, and, arguably, in favor of corresponding gender-neutral terms such as &quot;police officer&quot;, &quot;firefighter&quot;, &quot;flight attendant&quot; and &quot;chairperson&quot; (or &quot;chair&quot;). Other gender-specific terms, such as &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;actress&quot;, may be replaced by the originally male term (&quot;actor&quot; used for either gender).

The practice of gender-neutral language is highly encouraged among law students and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, research has shown that, as of 2010, only one judge on the Supreme Court consistently uses gender-neutral language.

The pronouns &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; may be replaced with &quot;they&quot; when the gender of the person referred to is unknown. In addition, those who do not identify as either female or male may use a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to themselves or have others refer to them.

A traditional view encouraged the pronoun &quot;he&quot; to be considered neutral up until the 60s-70s, when feminist objections occurred, so people began to use &quot;he or she&quot; pronouns. Today, using &quot;he or she&quot; can be considered making assumptions about someone&#x27;s gender. The pronoun &quot;they&quot; wouldn&#x27;t necessarily refer to a male or female.

In 2012 a gender-neutral pronoun was proposed in Sweden, and in 2014 it was announced that this word would be included in the following edition of the Swedish Academy Glossary. Swedish thus became the first language to have a gender-neutral pronoun added by an authoritative institution. can be used to describe anyone regardless of their sex or gender identification. Gender-neutral pronouns that have been proposed in the United States have not had widespread use outside of LGBTQ communities.

LGBTQ activists have suggested that the pronouns &quot;he/she and his/her linguistically enforce a normative two sex system&quot; where one must fall into the gender binary of either male or female. There is a growing variety of several different gender-neutral pronouns. These may include &quot;sie&quot;, &quot;hir&quot;, &quot;hirs&quot;, and &quot;hirself&quot;, and also include &quot;z&quot; or &quot;p&quot;. LGBTQ activists argue that only changing pronouns to be gender-neutral for people who are &quot;sex/gender&quot; ambiguous creates someone &quot;other&quot; than the norm. A proposed solution to this issue is to move towards the use of inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns for everyone, even when the sex of a person is known, in an effort to remove the alleged subconscious effects of language in reinforcing gender and gender stereotypes.

&quot;Gender-neutral language&quot; should not be confused with &quot;genderless language&quot;, which refers to a language that does not have grammatical gender.

==Relationship to feminism and masculism==
Gender neutrality emphasizes the equal treatment of men and women and people of any other gender legally with no discrimination whatsoever. This goal is, in principle, shared with both feminists and masculists. However, in gender neutralism, the emphasis is on transcending the perspective of gender altogether rather than focusing on the rights of specific genders.

==Relationship to transhumanism==

Gender neutrality or &quot;gender transcendence&quot; is part of the transhumanist concept of postgenderism, which is defined as the movement to erode the cultural, biological, psychological, and social role of gender within society.

Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of gender roles, social stratification, and cogno-physical disparities and differences are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for reproductive purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term &quot;and&quot; impregnate someone, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society.

From a transhumanist perspective, a shift in gender neutrality is seen as a direct result of the movement of postgenderism. Along with gender fluidity and postgenderism, gender neutrality would be a contributor if a movement of transhumanism were to occur. Given that an individual&#x27;s phenotype serves as the primary basis for gender classification, transhumanism would erode the binary division of gender, allowing for gender neutrality within future societies.

==Impact==

===In marketing===
Marketing is often focused on targeting specific demographics and creating products focused on specific genders. Public views on gender-specific marketing have gained media attention in recent years. For example, a protest against a Bic pen &quot;Bic for her&quot; that was targeted towards women by the posting of thousands of fake reviews of the pen mocking its female-specific advertising.

==== Children&#x27;s toys ====

In the marketing of children&#x27;s toys, gender-specific marketing has been very prevalent. According to a study conducted in 2012, &quot;children learn about the toys seen as appropriate for their gender not only from adults and children but also through the media, which serves as an important source of socialization and gender socialization.&quot; Color palettes and types of toys are gendered characteristics of the toys marketed to either boys or girls. The results of the study mentioned above, showed that &quot;toys that were pastel colored were much more likely to be marketed as toys for &#x27;only girls&#x27;, while bold colored toys were much more likely to be marketed as toys for &#x27;boys only&#x27;&quot; and also found that blue was a more gender-neutral color. Action toys, like cars, weapons, and building toys are marketed toward boys, while toys that have to do with beauty and domestic work are marketed towards girls. 
According to Lauren Spinner, &quot;Portrayals of boys tend to emphasize masculine gender roles and stereotypically masculine play and toys, whereas portrayals of girls tend to emphasize feminine gender roles and stereotypically feminine play and toys&quot;.
An additional study done in 2014 focuses on labeling of toys, &quot;for girls&quot; and &quot;for boys&quot;, paired with explicit colors, pink and blue, and gender stereotypes in children. In one study, novel items were presented to children, painted different colors and labeled differently. A nutcracker was presented to the children as blue and labeled &quot;for boys&quot; in once instance, but to other children it was pink and labeled &quot;for girls&quot;. The results of the studies found labeling profoundly affected the children&#x27;s liking towards toys, and the other study showed that girls are more affected than boys in terms of labeling.

The &quot;color pink did seem to give girls permission to explore masculine toys. This indicates that pink may signify that it is allowable for girls to show interest in counter-stereotypic toys and activities&quot;. This gender specific marketing/labeling exposes children to gender roles and that color can be an indicator of gender. Children &quot;show less involvement with toys stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, and they reject such toys more than ones stereotypically associated with their own sex or neutral ones&quot;. Toys are a medium for children to form gender stereotypes. Some toys, like stuffed animals, have proven to be gender-neutral and are usually marketed to both boys and girls.

Parents also play a large role in building their children&#x27;s gender socialization, as they are the ones buying the toys for their children. The popularity of making toy advertising gender neutral has been increasing through media such as ads showing boys playing with baby dolls (a toy that has commonly been marketed only towards girls in the past). At a young age for both boys and girls start to identify themselves by their gender role and are limited to what they can or can&#x27;t do. Not just that, but the environment around young boys and girls also influences their behavior.

In 2019, Mattel, a company with a long brand history within gender typing (e.g. Barbie), introduced its Creatable World doll line, a new toy that is the &quot;world&#x27;s first gender neutral doll&quot;.

==== Fashion ====
In the marketing of fashion lines, some designers are beginning to design gender-neutral clothing, that is not labeled as either &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;women&#x27;s&quot;. In today&#x27;s society gender neutrality is becoming more widely accepted. &quot;Both males and females are now &#x27;allowed&#x27; to wear certain clothing items once thought inappropriate for their sex&quot;. Women have more freedom because them wearing more masculine clothing, like suits, is generally accepted, but men wearing feminine clothing, like dresses, is less approved. This aspect of gender neutral clothing says &quot;that the world according to (ruling-class) men [is] the only viable one&quot; because most gender neutral clothing looks like typical male clothing.

===In education===
At Nicolaigarden and Egalia, two preschools in Sweden, have replaced the terms &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;boy&quot; with the gender neutral pronoun &quot;hen&quot;, granting students the ability to challenge or cross gender boundaries. In a study done in 2016 that measured teachers&#x27; facilitation of gender-typed and gender-neutral activities during free play, it was concluded that teachers facilitated masculine activities at higher rates than feminine. It is suggested by the study that, &quot;Informing teachers about this trend may prompt teachers to reflect on their own teaching practices and serve as a catalyst for the promotion of teaching practices that create classroom environments in which boys and girls receive support for engagement with a variety of classroom activities.&quot; Other suggestions and pursuits to broaden the mentality behind gender neutrality in schools include

* allowing for gender-neutral prom and homecoming attendance and courts to accommodate same-sex-coupled and transgender participants
* designating gender-neutral bathrooms and on-campus housing
* establishing gender-neutral and co-ed fraternal student organizations
* not separating toys in gender-specific areas
* not having gender-specific sports in physical education lessons

==== Dress code ====
The abolishment of certain dress codes has been conserved among institutions depending on the limitations imposed on students and their comfort in such attire. For transgender students, strict dress codes may complicate their path towards confirming their gender identity, a cost which can affect these individuals well throughout their life. Ways in which compliance with attire in institutions can cause reverberations in other areas of life are factors such as lowered academic performance, higher dropout rates, and increased disciplinary action. , 150 primary schools in the United Kingdom have introduced gender neutral uniforms and students feel more in control of their identity as a result of this policy change.

==== College ====
In 2005, University of California, Riverside became the first public university campus in the US to offer a gender-neutral housing option. A February 2014 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article noted that nearly 150 US schools now have gender-neutral housing programs. Other institutions such as University of Southern California and Princeton, acknowledge some of the dangers that come as a result to housing options as a member of the LGBTQ community and have also developed separate housing to accommodate such students.

In 2016, La Salle University students voted to have a gender-neutral housing option in their dormitories, which would make La Salle the first Catholic university in the United States to offer gender-neutral living. This student-led vote caused controversy in Catholic circles across the United States, since it is traditional for Catholic school residence halls to be completely separated by gender. La Salle University has since incorporated accommodating housing options for students and has urged other Catholic universities to make changes in housing policies as well.

A growing number of American colleges are adopting chosen name and identity policies. As of June 2022, at least 788 American colleges allow students to use a chosen first name, and at least 242 colleges allow students to designate their personal pronouns.

=== In parenting ===

Jennifer Hockenbery Dragseth describes gender as &quot;the classification of male or female that includes social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics. The theory of gender neutrality claims that biological sex does not inevitably determine social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics.&quot; Parental control strategies can be defined as any strategy that a parent uses to alter, change, or influence their child&#x27;s behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Meta-analysis reveals from Endendijk, &quot;the basis of gender-neutral parenting also known as GNP, does not project a gender onto a child. It allows parents and children to break away from gender binary.&quot;

Gender-neutral parenting is allowing children to be exposed to a variety of gender types so children can explore their gender without restriction from society or the gender they were born with. Autonomy-supportive strategies provide the child with an appropriate amount of control, a desired amount of choice, acknowledge the child&#x27;s perspectives and provide the child with meaningful rationales when the choice is constrained. Even if a child does not display gender-bending behaviors, gender neutral parenting allows them to explore and not be constrained in the gender they were born with. This can be through letting them play with non-stereotypical toys for their gender, allowing them to pick their own clothing, allowing them to act more &quot;feminine&quot; or &quot;masculine&quot;, and allowing children to question their gender. In the sociology book &quot;Sex Differences In Social Behavior: A Social Role Interpretation&quot;, Alice Eagly theorizes that sex differences have been proposed, based on biological factors, early childhood socialization, and other perspectives. This allows children to express themselves without feeling pressure from being extremely masculine or feminine.

==== Attitudes and judgement towards gender-roles and toys ====
Parent attitudes towards the child can influence child behaviors such as in toy selection. For example, parent, offer children toys and other objects that are gender-specific, such as trucks for boys and dolls for girls. A study done in Austria, where 324 parents participated showed that by parents&#x27; judgments about the desirability of different types of toys for their children and how the parents&#x27; judgment based on gender-typing of toys, gender role attitudes shows that parents rated same-gender-typed and gender-neutral toys as more desirable for their children than cross-gender-typed toys. This indicates that most traditional parents limit their child interests and behaviors than egalitarian parents.

In terms of education, parents&#x27; attitudes towards their child gender reflects on their expectation for the child. Because parents are still unwilling to send their daughters to the schools, there is a low participation rate of female education compared to male. Parents tend to treat their sons and daughters differently, preferring their sons over their daughters due to the gender roles society has placed, considering children as helping hands for their parents. For example, sons should provide economic support while daughters are expected to conform to the house. Although sons are still preferred, the attitudes towards neutrality have steadily increased in the past two decades. Feminist economics such as Julie A. Nelson argues that for a nonsexist society, the differences are revalued positively while others such as Patricia Elliot believes gender‐specific categories need to be eliminated to enable a positive society.

Although gender-neutral parenting allows their children to be able to decide how they experience their gender, non-gender neutral parents believe the children are programmed in from birth to play with gender directed toys, and parents had no influence towards their children selecting a gender-stereotyped toy.

Children at a young age start to develop a sense of how everyone starts to dress depending the gender of each individual. For instance, when a girl dresses in a way that contradicts societal norms, she might suffer bullying. According to Kent, Canterbury, states that among children between 3 and 7 years old, &quot;younger girls were more motivated to dress in gender-typed ways than older girls were, and understanding of gender stability (i.e. knowledge that gender remains stable over time) predicted appearance rigidity in both boys and girls&quot;.

=== In children&#x27;s literature ===
Gender neutrality in children&#x27;s literature refers to the idea that publishers, writers and illustrators should avoid marketing towards children through the basis of their sex or gender, and should instead focus on expanding content rather than reinforcing social and gender roles. Gender roles and stereotypes permeate our culture and are established through a variety of means such as visual culture or daily interactions with family and peers. Gender neutrality in children&#x27;s marketing is a growing movement among parents, children and publishers. Although there are many homes to gender stereotypes, the books that children are encountering have both psychological and social uses during a time when children are constantly constructing ideas from information around them and assimilating new knowledge with previous knowledge. Organizations such as Let Toys Be Toys, Let Books Be Books and Pinkstinks have been gaining publicity for their work in favour of gender neutrality within children&#x27;s literature and toys.

==== Representations of gender within picture books ====

Studies at Provider-Parent Partnerships have shown that children begin forming their sense of gender identity at 2–3 years old and begin &#x27;Gender typing&#x27; at ages 3–4. In a study surrounding &quot;Gender Perception in Adults&quot;, Dr. Kyle Pruett reported: &quot;A defining moment came in gender difference research when a group of male babies were dressed in pink, and then handed to adults who were told they were girls. The adults responded with language and handling styles shown to be classically female-stereotypic: &#x27;adorable, cuddly, sweet, cute,&#x27; etc. Female babies in blue were called &#x27;slugger, tough, strong, stubborn,&#x27; etc. This is how we simply wind up reinforcing gender-stereotypic behaviors, rather than fostering individual growth and development.&quot;

The concept of a child developing their sense of self in formative years has been a topic of discussion among cultural theorists as well as in children&#x27;s literature criticism. In &quot;The Pleasures of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, Shulamith Shahar states, &quot;Child raising practices and educational methods as well as parent-child relation are determined not solely by biological laws but are also culturally constructed&quot;.

Theorists such as Jacques Lacan and Judith Butler have contributed to this notion of the formation of an individual&#x27;s subjectivity and sense of self. Lacan&#x27;s concept of the mirror stage has contributed to modern understanding of subjectivity and has since been applied to Children&#x27;s Literature Criticism and child development. The Mirror Stage refers to the process in which an infant recognizes itself in the mirror for the first time and, &quot;the transformation that takes place in the subject when he assumes an image&quot;. As Hamida Bosmajian has stated in &quot;Understanding Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;The literary text, then, is an image of the unconscious structured like a language.&quot; Bosmajian proceeds to write, &quot;When the [Mirror Stage] is given utterance in the reader-interpreter&#x27;s language, [the meaning] is deferred.&quot;

Judith Butler&#x27;s notion of gender performativity also forms correlations to gender-specific children&#x27;s literature through analyzing the ways characters perform their gender and has been taken up in Children&#x27;s literature criticism. Butler has defined gender performativity stating: &quot;the production actually happens through a certain kind of repetition and recitation&quot;. Butler also relays that, &quot;Performativity is the discursive mode by which ontological effects are installed.&quot; Although Butler&#x27;s subject is the adult subject the concept of repetition transcends to themes of childhood as well. Both Butler and Lacan consider repetition as being an underlying factor in forming one&#x27;s identity which can then be applied to children&#x27;s literature through the act of children rereading books multiple times.

==== Studies in representation in children&#x27;s literature ====
Gender imbalances have continued to appear in children&#x27;s literature through the lack of diverse representations. In the 2011 issue of &quot;Gender &amp; Society&quot;, the study &quot;Gender in Twentieth-Century Children&#x27;s Books&quot; discovered large disparities. Through looking at almost 6,000 children&#x27;s books published between 1900 and 2000, the study, led by Janice McCabe, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, found that males are central characters in 57% of children&#x27;s books published each year, with just 31% having female central characters. Male animals are central characters in 23% of books per year, the study found, while female animals star in only 7.5%. In putting forth these narrow representations of characters, it becomes difficult for a child to identify themselves within gender binaries and roles. In an earlier study in 1971, out of fifty-eight books, twenty-five had a picture of a woman somewhere in them, yet only four did not having a woman (or animal representing a woman) wearing an apron. Many parents read their own childhood favourites to their children, through an endearing plot, or through beautiful illustrations. Although the adult may recognize that the stereotypes may be outdated, the children may lack that criticality in reading these stories. Furthering this portrayal of gender in children&#x27;s books the ways in which each gender is portrayed is very different. Female characters are much more likely to take on passive and supportive roles whereas male characters fulfill a self-sufficient, strong and active role. This discriminatory portrayal takes place in many children&#x27;s books and runs the risk of leading children toward a misrepresented and misguided realization of their true potential in their expanding world.

Not only are these inequalities present within the books, but gender disparities also exist among those creating children&#x27;s books. In the 2013 count, male authors and illustrators drastically outnumbered those who were female (64:21).

==== In children&#x27;s literature in the media ====
In March 2014, the British organization, Let Toys Be Toys, expanded to include a children&#x27;s book specific category, Let Books Be Books. This expansion specifically addressed gender specific titles on books such as &quot;The Beautiful Girl&#x27;s Colouring Book&quot; and &quot;The Brilliant Boys Colouring Book&quot; and the limitations in which these titles impose upon children. As Katy Guest stated in an article for the &quot;Independent&quot; in March 2014, after Let Books Be Books launched, &quot;What we are doing by pigeon-holing children is badly letting them down. And books, above all things, should be available to any child who is interested in them.&quot; As the organization Let Toys Be Toys states, &quot;Just like labeling toys &#x27;for girls&#x27; or &#x27;for boys&#x27; these books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys.&quot;

The organization quickly gained momentum and almost immediately acquired over 3000 signatures for their petition causing publishers Parragon and Usborne to lend their support and stop publishing gender specific children&#x27;s books. In November 2014, publishers of Peter and Jane Books, Ladybird Books agreed to make titles gender neutral stating: &quot;At Ladybird, we certainly don&#x27;t want to be seen to be limiting children in any way.&quot;

==== Controversy ====
Publishers such as Igloo Books and Buster Books continue to publish gender-specific children&#x27;s books. In an interview in March 2014 Buster Editor Michael O&#x27;Mara stated: &quot;The proof is in the pudding. Our two best children books ever are &quot;The Boys&#x27; Book&quot; and &quot;The Girls&#x27; Book&quot;. The boys&#x27; one included things like how to make a bow and arrow and how to play certain sports and you&#x27;d get things about style and how to look cool in the girls&#x27; book. 2,000 people signed this petition [in the first day], but we sold 500,000 copies of &quot;The Girls&#x27; Book&quot;. These statistics tell me I&#x27;m going in the right direction.&quot;

In a letter in response to this interview &quot;Let Books Be Books&quot; expressed the following concerns to Michael O&#x27;Mara: &quot;We have been contacted by many parents, teachers and supporters who have serious concerns about several of the titles currently on your website and being marketed in shops across the UK. They believe, as we do, that labeling books by gender narrows children&#x27;s choices and imaginations by telling them what they &#x27;should&#x27; be reading, instead of letting them choose books that interest them.&quot;

==Activism==
In 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign was created as a collaborative grassroots organization intended to educate college students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive dorm room and bathroom options.

Twin siblings Emma Moore and Abi Moore founded a campaign, Pinkstinks, in London in May 2008 to raise awareness of the damage caused by gender stereotyping of children. Pinkstinks claims that the marketing of gender-specific products to young children encourages girls to limit their ambitions later in life.

In a 2014 campaign, the United States–based grassroots group Play Unlimited announced the month-long observance of No Gender December.

In 2016, Canada came out with the &quot;No Big Deal&quot; campaign which is a &quot;positive affirming response to the recent conflict around transgender peoples&#x27; pronouns.&quot; This campaign encourages people to ask what pronouns people identify as, instead of just assuming based on people&#x27;s looks. It also tries to make different pronouns easier for people to understand and grasp.

==Gender-neutral lawsuits==
=== &quot;Jones v. Bon Appetit Management Company et al&quot; ===
In February 2014, former catering worker Valeria Jones sued employer Bon Appetit Management Co. in Oregon for US$518,000 after co-workers repeatedly referred to Jones as female. Jones did not identify as either male or female and when applying to work at Bon Appetit, purposely never filled out the male or female identification question. They repeatedly informed co-workers that they did not want to be identified using male or female gender pronouns and asked managers to address the employees as a group and educate the others about gender identity. Jones&#x27;s suit states that the complaint to human resources was never resolved and the managers did not follow through per their requests, prompting their resignation.

=== &quot;Zzyym v. Tillerson&quot; ===
In September 2014, Dana Zzyym, an American U.S. Naval veteran, tried to apply for a passport. Instead of labeling their gender as male or female on the application form, they &quot;wrote &#x27;intersex&#x27; below the &#x27;sex&#x27; category&quot; and &quot;requested &#x27;X&#x27; as an acceptable marker.&quot; They presented a birth certificate which labels Zzyym as neither male nor female. Zzyym was born with ambiguous genitalia and identifies as intersex. The State Department declined Zzyym&#x27;s application. Zzyym sued the State Department, &quot;saying the federal government violated the Constitution&#x27;s guarantees of due process rights and discriminated against Zzyym based on gender.&quot; In November 2016, the court issued the ruling in favor of Zzyym. But , the case has been reopened due to the State Department&#x27;s continued refusal of a gender marker that is neither male nor female on its passport applications.

=== Elisa Rae Shupe ===
On 27 April 2016, Elisa Rae Shupe filed a petition in Multnomah County, Oregon, to no longer be designated male or female. Shupe, a retired United States Army sergeant, was born with male anatomy and lived for a time as a transgender woman. She later began to self-identify as non-binary. The Oregon state statutes had been changed in 2013 to no longer require proof of medical transition before a change in legal gender status. The statutes did not specify whether the new status had to be a binary one. Two of Shupe&#x27;s doctors wrote letters for her stating that she was neither male nor female. On 10 June, Judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted Shupe&#x27;s petition. The ruling was a significant advance toward government recognition of non-binary individuals. In 2019, Shupe issued a statement explaining that she now disagreed with the concept of gender identity and was returning to living as a man. However, in 2022 she published a declaration that she was a trans woman, cutting ties with gender-critical feminists and conversion therapists. Shupe also changed her name to Elisa Rae Shupe.

==Criticism==

Much as with similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity, not recognising and taking account of participants&#x27; sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women&#x27;s inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.

Solely using &quot;he&quot; and &quot;his&quot; as gender-neutral language can lead to a lack of representation or acknowledgment of certain identities. When pronouns such as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;his&quot; are used to refer to gender-neutral persons, there is a subconscious &quot;sex bias&quot; towards males over females, despite the subject being gender neutral. In sports, a 1993 study concluded that more gender references are made to women&#x27;s versus men&#x27;s sports, distinguishing female sports as &quot;other&quot;. However, the same study pointed out that having a gender-neutral sports environment could lead to a near complete lack of acknowledgement of women&#x27;s sports/teams.

The legal test of the &quot;reasonable person&quot; has been criticized for being genderblind in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. In the American case of &quot;Ellison v. Brady&quot;, 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that &quot;a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women&quot;. In &quot;The Hidden Gender of Law&quot;, Regina Graycar and Jenny Morgan argued that gender-neutral rape statutes can imply that men and women are perpetrators and victims of sexual violence at similar rates, which is not accurate.

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women&#x27;s Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym. Single-sex services can have a benefit in providing greater comfort and engaging participants who would otherwise not get involved. The ridding of all sex-separated restrooms could forfeit the feelings of having a safe bathroom space for some people by replacing them with restrooms for all genders/identities.

Gender-neutral laws have had unintended consequences. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 entitles certain employees a 12-week unpaid leave from work without a risk of job loss and applies to all genders. The employees must qualify for this leave by having been employed for over 12 months and be applying for leave due to a &quot;serious health condition&quot;, pregnancy, or adoption. Despite FMLA&#x27;s gender-neutral language, there are concerns about the law reinforcing gender disparity involving childcare between males and females; since FMLA remains gender neutral, it does not recognize the burden of females during pregnancy that males do not experience. Women with children in the workplace are not given as much attention or resources as is needed for their female-specific, personal/at-home issues, reinforcing the gender disparity despite the law&#x27;s need to be gender neutral.

<doc id="296728" wikidata="Q319803" url="?curid=296728" title="Ronald Dworkin">
<text>Ronald Myles Dworkin (; December 11, 1931 – February 14, 2013) was an American legal philosopher, jurist, and scholar of United States constitutional law. At the time of his death, he was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University and Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London. Dworkin had taught previously at Yale Law School and the University of Oxford, where he was the Professor of Jurisprudence, successor to philosopher H. L. A. Hart.

An influential contributor to both philosophy of law and political philosophy, Dworkin received the 2007 Holberg International Memorial Prize in the Humanities for &quot;his pioneering scholarly work&quot; of &quot;worldwide impact&quot;. According to a survey in &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot;, Dworkin was the second most-cited American legal scholar of the twentieth century. After his death, Harvard legal scholar Cass Sunstein said Dworkin was &quot;one of the most important legal philosophers of the last 100 years. He may well head the list.&quot;

His theory of law as integrity as presented in his book &quot;Law&#x27;s Empire&quot;, in which judges interpret the law in terms of consistent moral principles, especially justice and fairness, is among the most influential contemporary theories about the nature of law. Dworkin advocated a &quot;moral reading&quot; of the United States Constitution, and an interpretivist approach to law and morality. He was a frequent commentator on contemporary political and legal issues, particularly those concerning the Supreme Court of the United States, often in the pages of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Ronald Dworkin was born in 1931 in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Madeline (Talamo) and David Dworkin. His family is Jewish. He graduated from Harvard University in 1953 with an A.B., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, where he majored in philosophy and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year. He then attended Magdalen College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, where was a student of Sir Rupert Cross and J. H. C. Morris. Upon completion of his final exams at Oxford, the examiners were so impressed with his script that the Professor of Jurisprudence (then H. L. A. Hart) was summoned to read it. He was awarded a B.A. with a Congratulatory first. Dworkin then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1957 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

==Career==
After law school, Dworkin was a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1957 to 1958. Hand would later call Dworkin &quot;the law clerk to beat all law clerks&quot;, and Dworkin would recall Judge Hand as an enormously influential mentor.
While clerking for Hand, Dworkin was offered a clerkship with Justice Felix Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court. Dworkin declined the offer, a decision he later called &quot;a very serious mistake.&quot; He instead joined Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a New York City law firm, as an associate. 

In 1962, Dworkin left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and became a professor of law at Yale Law School, becoming the holder of the Wesley N. Hohfeld Chair of Jurisprudence. In 1969, he was appointed to the Chair of Jurisprudence at Oxford, a position in which he succeeded H. L. A. Hart (who remembered Dworkin&#x27;s Oxford examination and promoted his candidacy) and was elected Fellow of University College, Oxford. After retiring from Oxford, Dworkin became the Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London, where he later became the Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence. He was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law at New York University School of Law and professor of philosophy at New York University (NYU), where he taught from the late 1970s. He co-taught a colloquium in legal, political, and social philosophy with Thomas Nagel. Dworkin had regularly contributed, for several decades, to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. He delivered the Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture at Harvard, the Storrs Lectures at Yale, the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Stanford, and the Scribner Lectures at Princeton. In June 2011, he joined the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.

==Jurisprudence and philosophy==
===Law as rule and principle===
Dworkin&#x27;s criticism of H. L. A. Hart&#x27;s legal positivism has been summarized by the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;:
Dworkin, as positivism&#x27;s most significant critic, rejects the positivist theory on every conceivable level. Dworkin denies that there can be any general theory of the existence and content of law; he denies that local theories of particular legal systems can identify law without recourse to its moral merits, and he rejects the whole institutional focus of positivism. A theory of law is for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be decided and it begins, not with an account of the political organization of a legal system, but with an abstract ideal regulating the conditions under which governments may use coercive force over their subjects.
Dworkin&#x27;s opinion of Hart&#x27;s legal positivism was expressed in its fullest form in the book &quot;Law&#x27;s Empire&quot;. Dworkin&#x27;s theory is &quot;interpretive&quot;: the law is whatever follows from a constructive interpretation of the institutional history of the legal system.

Dworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one&#x27;s principles are skewed enough. To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases, etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. All interpretation must follow, Dworkin argues, from the notion of &quot;law as integrity&quot; to make sense.

Out of the idea that law is &quot;interpretive&quot; in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people&#x27;s legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. Dworkin opposes the notion that judges have discretion in such difficult cases.

Dworkin&#x27;s model of legal principles is also connected with Hart&#x27;s notion of the Rule of Recognition. Dworkin rejects Hart&#x27;s conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would entail that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute.

Dworkin moves away from positivism&#x27;s separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is.

Despite their intellectual disagreements, Hart and Dworkin &quot;remained on good terms.&quot;

===The right answer thesis===
In Dworkin&#x27;s own words, his &quot;right answer thesis&quot; may be interpreted through the following hypothetical:
Suppose the legislature has passed a statute stipulating that &quot;sacrilegious contracts shall henceforth be invalid.&quot; The community is divided as to whether a contract signed on Sunday is, for that reason alone, sacrilegious. It is known that very few of the legislators had that question in mind when they voted, and that they are now equally divided on the question of whether it should be so interpreted. Tom and Tim have signed a contract on Sunday, and Tom now sues Tim to enforce the terms of the contract, whose validity Tim contests. Shall we say that the judge must look for the right answer to the question of whether Tom&#x27;s contract is valid, even though the community is deeply divided about what the right answer is? Or is it more realistic to say that there simply is no right answer to the question?

One of Dworkin&#x27;s most interesting and controversial theses states that the law as properly interpreted will give an answer. This is not to say that everyone will have the same answer (a consensus of what is &quot;right&quot;), or if it did, the answer would not be justified exactly in the same way for every person; rather it means that there will be a necessary answer for each individual if he applies himself correctly to the legal question. For the correct method is that encapsulated by the metaphor of Judge Hercules, an ideal judge, immensely wise and with full knowledge of legal sources. Hercules (the name comes from a classical mythological hero) would also have plenty of time to decide. Acting on the premise that the law is a seamless web, Hercules is required to construct the theory that best fits and justifies the law as a whole (law as integrity) in order to decide any particular case. Hercules is the perfect judge, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he always reaches the right answer.

Dworkin does not deny that competent lawyers often disagree on what is the solution to a given case. On the contrary, he claims that they are disagreeing about &quot;the&quot; right answer to the case, the answer Hercules would give.

Dworkin&#x27;s critics argue not only that &quot;law proper&quot; (that is, the legal sources in a positivist sense) is full of gaps and inconsistencies, but also that other legal standards (including principles) may be insufficient to solve a hard case. Some of them are incommensurable. In any of these situations, even Hercules would be in a dilemma and none of the possible answers would be the &quot;right&quot; one.

===Discussion of the right answer thesis===

Dworkin&#x27;s metaphor of judge Hercules bears some resemblance to Rawls&#x27; veil of ignorance and Habermas&#x27; ideal speech situation, in that they all suggest idealized methods of arriving at somehow valid normative propositions. The key difference with respect to the former is that Rawls&#x27; veil of ignorance translates almost seamlessly from the purely ideal to the practical. In relation to politics in a democratic society, for example, it is a way of saying that those in power should treat the political opposition consistently with how they would like to be treated when in opposition, because their present position offers no guarantee as to what their position will be in the political landscape of the future (i.e. they will inevitably form the opposition at some point). Dworkin&#x27;s Judge Hercules, on the other hand, is a purely idealized construct, that is, &quot;if&quot; such a figure existed, he would arrive at a right answer in every moral dilemma. For a critique along these lines see Lorenzo Zucca&#x27;s &quot;Constitutional Dilemmas&quot;.

Dworkin&#x27;s right answer thesis turns on the success of his attack on the skeptical argument that right answers in legal-moral dilemmas cannot be determined. Dworkin&#x27;s anti-skeptical argument is essentially that the properties of the skeptic&#x27;s claim are analogous to those of substantive moral claims, that is, in asserting that the truth or falsity of &quot;legal-moral&quot; dilemmas cannot be determined, the skeptic makes not a metaphysical claim about the way things are, but a &quot;moral&quot; claim to the effect that it is, in the face of epistemic uncertainty, unjust to determine legal-moral issues to the detriment of any given individual.

===Moral reading of the Constitution===
In her book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine Baume identified Ronald Dworkin as a leading defender of the &quot;compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy.&quot; Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of &quot;compatibility&quot; was identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron. Dworkin has been a long-time advocate of the principle of the moral reading of the Constitution whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.

===Theory of equality===
Dworkin has also made important contributions to what is sometimes called the &quot;equality of what&quot; debate. In a pair of articles and his book &quot;Sovereign Virtue&quot;, he advocates a theory he calls &quot;equality of resources&quot;. This theory combines two key ideas. Broadly speaking, the first is that human beings are responsible for the life choices they make. The second is that natural endowments of intelligence and talent are morally arbitrary and ought not to affect the distribution of resources in society. Like the rest of Dworkin&#x27;s work, his theory of equality is underpinned by the core principle that every person is entitled to equal concern and respect in the design of the structure of society. Dworkin&#x27;s theory of equality is said to be one variety of so-called luck egalitarianism, but he rejects this statement.

===Positive and negative liberty===
In the essay &quot;Do Values Conflict? A Hedgehog&#x27;s Approach,&quot; Dworkin contends that the values of liberty and equality do not necessarily conflict. He criticizes Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s conception of liberty as &quot;flat&quot; and proposes a new, &quot;dynamic&quot; conception of liberty, suggesting that one cannot say that one&#x27;s liberty is infringed when one is prevented from committing murder. Thus, liberty cannot be said to have been infringed when no wrong has been done. Put in this way, liberty is only liberty to do whatever we wish so long as we do not infringe upon the rights of others.

==Personal life and death==
While working for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin met his future wife, Betsy Ross, with whom he would have twins Anthony and Jennifer. Betsy was the daughter of a successful New York businessman. They were married from 1958 until Betsy died of cancer in 2000. Dworkin later married Irene Brendel, the former wife of pianist Alfred Brendel.

Dworkin died of leukemia in London on February 14, 2013, at the age of 81, survived by his second wife, two children, and two grandchildren.

==Awards==
In 2005, Dworkin was jointly awarded the American Law Institute&#x27;s Henry J. Friendly Medal with Judge Richard Posner. In September 2007, Dworkin was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize. The award citation of the Holberg Prize Academic Committee recognized that Dworkin has &quot;elaborated a liberal egalitarian theory&quot; and stressed Dworkin&#x27;s effort to develop &quot;an original and highly influential legal theory grounding law in morality, characterized by a unique ability to tie together abstract philosophical ideas and arguments with concrete everyday concerns in law, morals, and politics&quot;.

The New York University &quot;Annual Survey of American Law&quot; honored Dworkin with its 2006 dedication.

In 2006, the Legal Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico honored Dworkin with the Héctor Fix-Zamudio International Award.

In June 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania. In June 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Harvard University. In August 2011, the University of Buenos Aires awarded Dworkin an honorary doctorate. The resolution noted that he &quot;has tirelessly defended the rule of law, democracy and human rights.&quot; These were among a number of honorary doctorates conferred upon him.

On November 14, 2012, Dworkin received the Balzan Prize for Jurisprudence in Quirinale Palace, Rome, from the President of the Italian Republic. The Balzan Prize was awarded &quot;for his fundamental contributions to Jurisprudence, characterized by outstanding originality and clarity of thought in a continuing and fruitful interaction with ethical and political theories and with legal practices&quot;.

He was an honorary Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC).

Dworkin was elected a fellow of the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

<doc id="296729" wikidata="Q724250" url="?curid=296729" title="Wayne Allard">
<text>Alan Wayne Allard (born December 2, 1943) is an American veterinarian and politician who served as a United States Representative (1991–1997) and United States Senator (1997–2009) from Colorado, as well as previously a Colorado State Senator (1983–1991). A member of the Republican Party, he did not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2008. In February 2009, he began work as a lobbyist at The Livingston Group, a Washington, D.C.–based government relations consulting firm.

==Early life==
Allard was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, the son of Sibyl Jean (née Stewart) and Amos Wilson Allard. He is descended from immigrants from Canada and Scotland. He was raised on a ranch near Walden, Colorado. He received a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Colorado State University in 1968.

===State Senate===
Allard continued to run a veterinary practice full-time, while representing Larimer and Weld counties in the Colorado State Senate, from 1983 to 1990. During his tenure he was a strong supporter of fiscal responsibility and the preservation of a citizen legislature. Allard&#x27;s influence on local politics is still felt today as he is the sponsor of Colorado&#x27;s law limiting state legislative sessions to 120 days.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Allard served in the United States House of Representatives from Colorado&#x27;s Fourth Congressional District from 1991 to 1997. As a Colorado Representative, Allard served on the Joint Committee on Congressional Reform, which recommended many of the reforms included in the Contract with America. These reforms became some of the first to be passed by the Republican controlled Congress in 1995 and were the key to their platform.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===
In 1996, Allard was elected to the United States Senate, defeating state Attorney General Gale Norton in the Republican primary and Tom Strickland by five percentage points in the general election. He made a pledge at the time to serve just two terms in the Senate before retiring. In 2002, he was re-elected, defeating Strickland again by the same margin.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Interior Subcommittee (Ranking Member)
** Legislative Branch Subcommittee
** Energy and Water Development Subcommittee
** Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee
** Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee
** Transportation/HUD Subcommittee
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
** Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee (Ranking Member)
** Financial Institutions Subcommittee
** Housing, Transportation, and Community Development Subcommittee
* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
** Subcommittee on Children and Families
** Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety

===Tenure===
In 2003, Allard introduced into the Senate the Federal Marriage Amendment, seeking to ban same-sex marriages. The amendment failed to advance to the House.

In 2004, Allard reintroduced the Federal Marriage Amendment with minor changes. In presenting the amendment, Allard made the case that there is a &quot;master plan&quot; to &quot;destroy the institution of marriage&quot;. Passage of the proposed Amendment failed 227 yea votes to 186 nay votes, where 290 yea votes (two-thirds) are required for passage of a proposed Constitutional amendment.

In an April 2006 article, &quot;Time&quot; named Allard as one of America&#x27;s 5 Worst Senators, dubbing him &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. The article criticised him for being &quot;so bland that his critics have dubbed him &quot;Dullard&quot;&quot;, for &quot;never playing a role in major legislation, even though he&#x27;s on two key Senate committees, Budget and Appropriations&quot; and for &quot;rarely speaking on the floor or holding press conferences to push his ideas&quot;, concluding that &quot;few of the bills he has introduced over the past year have passed&quot;. The article did however note that he was &quot;polite, affable and willing to take on thankless tasks, such as his current role overseeing the construction of a visitors center on Capitol Hill&quot;. In response, two major Colorado newspapers defended the Senator. The &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; retorted that &quot;Time&quot; had made the &quot;wrong call&quot; and that Allard was a &quot;hard-working advocate for Colorado interests.&quot; &quot;The Gazette&quot; (Colorado Springs) also weighed in, saying the article was &quot;... soft, subjective, snide, impressionistic slop – further proof of the low to which this once-serious publication has sunk.&quot; Upon his retirement, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; stated that &quot;While we didn&#x27;t always agree with Sen. Wayne Allard on policy matters, we never doubted that he was working hard for Colorado.&quot;

On January 15, 2007 Allard announced he would fulfill a 1996 campaign promise to serve only two Senate terms and would retire in January 2009.

In April 2007, Allard announced his endorsement of Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. He switched his endorsement to John McCain once he secured his spot as the presumptive Republican nominee.

As part of a statement released by his office in support of a day to honor emergency first responders in 2007, Allard was quoted as saying: &quot;First responders in Colorado have recently provided critical services in the face of blizzards and tornados. Since I don&#x27;t think first responders have really done anything significant in comparison to their counterparts who have dealt with real natural disasters, I have no idea what else to say here …&quot;

In March 2008 the &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked him the second most-conservative U.S. Senator based on his 2007 votes.

One of the legislative staffers in Allard’s Capitol Hill office during his time in the Senate was Cory Gardner, who would eventually succeed Allard in office.

==Political positions==

===Environmental record===
Allard was a co-sponsor of the James Peak Wilderness Bill, which created a preserve around James Peak, and added to the Indian Peak Protection Area. He also sponsored legislation which created Colorado&#x27;s Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. Allard was also chairman and founder of the Senate Renewable Energy and Efficiency Caucus.

In 2006, the environmental group Republicans for Environmental Protection praised Allard for his support of legislation to make the Army Corps of Engineers more accountable for its projects&#x27; environmental and economic impact, but criticized him for supporting oil drilling both offshore and in Alaska&#x27;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters issued Allard a grade of 29% for 2006.

== Later career ==
Shortly after leaving office in 2009, Allard began work at the Washington, D.C.–based lobbying firm, The Livingston Group. In 2011, he joined the American Motorcycle Association in a government relations role.

==Personal life==
While completing veterinary school, Allard married Joan Malcolm, who received her degree in microbiology, also from CSU. They then founded their veterinary practice, the Allard Animal Hospital. The Allards raised their two daughters, Christi and Cheryl, in Loveland, Colorado, and have five grandsons. He is a Protestant.

In 2007, Allard authored &quot;Colorado&#x27;s U.S. Senators: A Biographical Guide&quot;. The book was published by Fulcrum Publishing.

<doc id="296730" wikidata="Q582595" url="?curid=296730" title="USS Powhatan (1850)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; was a sidewheel steam frigate in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for Powhatan, a Native American chief of eastern Virginia. She was one of the last, and largest, of the United States Navy&#x27;s paddle frigates.

&quot;Powhatan&quot; was built by Samuel Hartt and her keel was laid on 6 August 1847 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, then Gosport Shipyard, at Portsmouth, Virginia. Her engines were constructed by Mehaffy &amp; Company. She cost $785,000. She was launched on 14 February 1850 by the Norfolk Navy Yard and commissioned on 2 September 1852, Captain William Mervine in command.

==Service history==
===Home Squadron, 1852===
After shakedown out of the Norfolk Navy Yard, &quot;Powhatan&quot; joined the Home Squadron as flagship of Commodore John T. Newton and sailed for New York where she was visited by the Secretary of the Navy, John P. Kennedy. She departed New York on 16 October 1852 for Vera Cruz with the new Minister to Mexico, Judge Alfred Conkling, on board and returned to Norfolk on 27 November via Havana and Pensacola.
===East India Squadron, 1853–1860===
&quot;Powhatan&quot;, under Comdr. William J. McCluney, was next assigned to the East India Squadron and arrived on station via Cape of Good Hope on 15 June 1853. Her arrival in Chinese waters coincided with an important phase of Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s expedition to open commercial relations with the Japanese. She was Perry&#x27;s flagship during his November visit to Whampoa. On 14 February 1854 she entered Edo Bay with the rest of the squadron, remaining until the Convention of Kanagawa was signed on 31 March 1854 as part of Perry&#x27;s show of force. After the signing of the treaty, the squadron moved to Shimoda, one of the ports opened by the treaty and the site of a future American consulate to conduct surveying operations. While at Shimoda, Yoshida Shoin came aboard and unsuccessfully requested to be taken to the United States.

During August 1855, &quot;Powhatan&quot; accompanied in a successful battle against Chinese pirates off Kowloon, and reached the U.S. on 14 February 1856 with the new treaty.
The US-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed on her deck on 29 July 1858 (19 June in the old Japanese calendar).

The U.S. Minister, Gen. Ward came to Penang on the steamer &quot;Ganges&quot; and was transferred to the &quot;Powhatan&quot; for his journey onto Pekin in May 1859. The American government also at the same time chartered the steamer &quot;Hong Kong&quot; accompany Ward into the north and to return the remains of Ye Mingchen&#x27;s for interment in Canton, 13 May 1859.

On 13 February 1860, the &quot;Powhatan&quot; accompanied by a Japanese capital ship, that departed on 9 February (18 January in the old Japanese calendar), left Yokohama, Japan, en route to San Francisco as part of the first official embassy of the Empire of Japan to the United States of America. The Japanese embassy was formally composed of three men: Ambassador Shinmi Masaoki (新見正興), Vice-Ambassador Muragaki Norimasa (村垣範正), and Observer Oguri Tadamasa (小栗忠順).

===Civil War, 1860–1865===
&quot;Powhatan&quot; remained active throughout the Civil War. She served as Flag Officer Garrett J. Pendergrast&#x27;s flagship at Vera Cruz during October 1860. In April 1861, while under the command of Lt. David Dixon Porter, she assisted in the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida. President Abraham Lincoln had attempted to countermand the order sending the &quot;Powhatan&quot; to Fort Pickens and send the ship to assist in the relief expedition to Fort Sumter instead, but because Secretary of State William H. Seward signed the order &quot;Seward&quot; rather than &quot;Lincoln,&quot; the order was not obeyed. The &quot;Powhatan&quot; assisted in the establishment of the blockade of Mobile, Alabama on 26 May, capturing schooner &quot;Mary Clinton&quot; on 29 May. During July and August &quot;Powhatan&quot; joined the blockade of the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River, retaking schooner &quot;Abby Bradford&quot; on 15 August. From late August to October she pursued CSS &quot;Sumter&quot; throughout much of the West Indies.

&quot;Powhatan&quot; operated off Charleston, South Carolina from October 1862 to August 1863, captured schooner &quot;Major E. Willis&quot; on 19 April and sloop &quot;C. Routereau&quot; on 16 May, and deployed for a second time to the West Indies from November 1863 to September 1864 as flagship of Rear Admiral James L. Lardner. She participated in the successful reduction of Fort Fisher, 24–25 December 1864 and in its capture on 13–15 January 1865.

===South Pacific Squadron, 1866–1869===
After the war, in October 1865, she sailed from Boston with and , escorting monitor to California via Cape Horn. She arrived at San Francisco on 22 June 1866.

&quot;Powhatan&quot; was the flagship of the South Pacific Squadron 1866–1869, commanded by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren from 12 December 1866 to 14 July 1868. In March 1866 she was sent to Valparaíso to protect U.S. interests during the Chincha Islands War.

On 13 August 1868, &quot;Powhatah&quot; sustained damaged to one of her paddle wheels at Callao, Peru during the Arica earthquake.

===North Atlantic Squadron, 1869–1886===
From 1869 to 1886, she was attached to the North Atlantic Squadron and was flagship from 15 September 1869 until 30 December 1870. On 24 August 1873, &quot;Powhatan&quot; was caught in a storm at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. She was driven from her moorings at the Cunard wharf across to the ordnance wharf. She served as flagship again from 4 July 1877 until 10 December 1879. During this period, three &quot;Powhatan&quot; crewman earned the Medal of Honor for rescuing fellow sailors from drowning: Landsman George W. Cutter at Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 May 1872; Seaman Joseph B. Noil at Norfolk on 26 December 1872; and Coxswain William Anderson on 28 June 1878.

In 1877, the ship was ordered to Baltimore, Maryland along with the &quot;Swatara&quot;, on a peacekeeping mission following the city&#x27;s riots, which occurred as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

The ship ended her long and conspicuous career by making numerous cruises in Cuban waters to protect American commerce: July–August 1880, February–May 1882, January–May 1883, January–May 1885, and January–February 1886. &quot;Powhatan&quot; was decommissioned on 2 June 1886 and was sold on 30 July 1886 to Burdette Pond of Meriden, Connecticut, and scrapped 5 August 1887.

<text>Herbert Allen Giles (, 8 December 184513 February 1935) was a British diplomat and sinologist who was the professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge for 35 years. Giles was educated at Charterhouse School before becoming a British diplomat in China. He modified a Mandarin Chinese romanization system established by Thomas Wade, resulting in the widely known Wade–Giles Chinese romanization system. Among his many works were translations of the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot;, the &quot;Lao Tzu (Tao Te Ching)&quot;, the &quot;Chuang Tzu&quot;, and, in 1892, the widely published &quot;A Chinese–English Dictionary&quot;.

==Biography==
Herbert Allen Giles was the fourth son of John Allen Giles (1808–1884), an Anglican clergyman. After studying at Charterhouse, Herbert became a British diplomat to Qing China, serving from 1867 to 1892. He also spent several years (1885–1888) at Fort Santo Domingo in Tamsui, northern Taiwan. Giles&#x27; great-grandson, Giles Pickford, stated in an address at the opening of the Fort Santo Domingo Museum – 8 November 2005, that his great-grandfather, Herbert A Giles, was Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Consul in Tamsui, Fort Santo Domingo from 1885 until 1891. Prior to that time, in 1869, Giles was based at Kaoshiung. He married Catherine Maria (Kate) Fenn in 1870 and was the father of Bertram, Valentine, Lancelot, Edith, Mable, and Lionel Giles. 

In 1897 Herbert Giles became only the second professor of Chinese language appointed at the University of Cambridge, succeeding Thomas Wade. At the time of his appointment, there were no other sinologists at Cambridge. Giles was therefore free to spend most of his time among the ancient Chinese texts earlier donated by Wade, publishing what he chose to translate from his eclectic reading in Chinese literature. Giles published over sixty books, lectures, pamphlets, journal articles, book reviews, and newspaper articles. During his long life he completed a comprehensive Chinese-English Dictionary which took over fifteen years to compile and became a standard reference for many years. Giles also published the first history of Chinese literature and art, which also became a reference work. Some of his translations have stood the test of time and are still among the best available. Giles was not afraid to be controversial and outspoken on numerous topics. To quote his great-grandson, &quot;Most of his enemies were people whose work he had criticized. Such people included E H Parker, a sinologist at Manchester University; Sir Walter Hillier a sinologist from London; and Sir Thomas Wade, Minister to China (1870-76 and 1880-82) and therefore Giles&#x27;s superior in the Consular Service. Wade was later Professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge (1888-95). Giles was to succeed him in this position in 1897.&quot; Giles was also outspoken on the work of Christian Missionaries and British traders because of the overcrowding of Chinese emigrants on British ships. Yet as Charles Aylmer wrote, in his Memoirs of H. A. Giles, &quot;Notwithstanding his reputation for abrasiveness, he would speak to anyone in the street from the Vice-Chancellor to a crossing-sweeper and was remembered by acquaintances as a man of great personal charm. &quot; Giles wrote some of his works in conjunction with his son, Dr. Lionel Giles, also an expert on China, who was employed as the Deputy Keeper of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts at the British Museum.

His later works include a history of the Chinese Pictorial Art in 1905 and his 1914 Hibbert Lectures on Confucianism which was published in 1915 by Williams and Norgate. He dedicated the third edition of &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; (1916) to his seven grandchildren, but at the end of his life was on speaking terms with only one of his surviving children. An ardent agnostic, he was also an enthusiastic freemason. He never became a Fellow at one of the constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge, despite being a university professor for 35 years. Dr. Giles was married twice. His first wife was Miss Catherine Maria Fenn and his second wife was Miss Elise Williamina Edersheim, who died in 1921. On her death, Giles wrote, &quot;In all those 38 years not a syllable came from my pen which was not examined by her and approved before publication.&quot; Elise was herself an author, her best known work being China Coast Tales, which she wrote during her time in Tamsui (1885-1888) and which she published under the pseudonym Lise Boehm. On 4 July 1922, the Royal Asiatic Society awarded Giles their Triennial Gold Medal. His friend L. C. Hopkins, was reported to say the following. &quot;If he were asked to formulate in a sentence the special mark and merit of Professor Giles&#x27;s lifelong labours, he would say that beyond all other living scholars he had humanized Chinese studies. He had by his writings made more readers know more things about China, things that were material, things that were vital – he had diffused a better and a truer understanding of Chinese intellect, its capabilities and achievements, than any other scholar.&quot; Giles finally retired in 1932, and died at Cambridge on 13 February 1935, aged 89.

==Legacy==
Giles received the Prix Julien award from the French Academy in 1897 for his &quot;Chinese Biographical Dictionary&quot;. Generally considered unreliable among modern academics, Endymion Wilkinson described it as: He also ran afoul of the Chinese scholar Ku Hung-ming, who declared Nor did Ku appreciate Giles&#x27; &quot;Chinese-English Dictionary&quot; describing it as . A recent book on Chinese lexicography says Giles&#x27; dictionary has &quot;special significance and interest&quot; and &quot;enjoys pride of place in the history of Chinese bilingual dictionaries as the authoritative source for the Wade-Giles system of Romanization.&quot; (Yong and Peng 2008: 387).

The English sinologist and historian Endymion Wilkinson (2013: 85) says Giles&#x27; dictionary is &quot;still interesting as a repository of late Qing documentary Chinese, although there is little or no indication of the citations, mainly from the Kangxi zidian).&quot; (Wilkinson 2013: 85) In 1917, Giles funded an award, the Prix Giles, in the amount of eight hundred francs. Administered by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, it is given every two years to a French person who has written a work about China, Japan, or East Asia, in general.

<doc id="296748" wikidata="Q2580862" url="?curid=296748" title="Sex and the City (newspaper column)">
<text>&quot;Sex and the City&quot; was a newspaper column written by Candace Bushnell for &quot;The New York Observer&quot; from 1994 to 1996. The column was based on her and her friends&#x27; lifestyles living in New York City in the 1990s. An anthology of Bushnell&#x27;s columns was published as a book of the same name in 1996. The columns became the basis for the HBO television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, which led to the 2008 film of the same name, a 2010 sequel, and the HBO Max (now Max) revival of the series &quot;And Just Like That...&quot;.

== Newspaper column ==
Candace Bushnell was working as a freelance writer in New York City when her editor at &quot;The New York Observer&quot; offered her a column. She based it on her and her friend&#x27;s experiences as single women in their thirties living in the city, &quot;all of whom seemed to have had a never-ending series of freakish and horrifying experiences with men&quot;. The column&#x27;s name, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, is a play on the 1962 advice book &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;. &quot;Sex and the City&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Observer&quot; on November 28, 1994. The column became popular and readers would purchase the &quot;Observer&quot; solely for it. The column has been credited with creating the terms &quot;toxic bachelors&quot; and &quot;serial daters&quot;. Bushnell originally wrote the column from her first-person perspective, but later invented the semi-autobiographical character of &quot;Carrie&quot; so her parents would not be aware that they were reading about her sex life.

=== Characters ===
The columns introduced several characters who were included in the television series:
* Carrie Bradshaw, &quot;a journalist in her mid-30s&quot;, and conceived around the lifestyle of &quot;balancing small paychecks with access to glamour and wealth&quot;. Carrie had no last name until the television series.
* Mr. Big, a businessman and recurring love interest of Carrie. Mr. Big was based on Ron Galotti, the former publisher of &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Talk&quot;, whom Bushnell had dated.
* Samantha Jones, a &quot;40-ish movie producer&quot; known for dating a multitude of younger men. Bushnell based the character on a friend she described as &quot;kind of an expert on men and dating&quot;.
* Charlotte York, an English journalist and friend of Carrie.
* Miranda Hobbes, a cable television executive and friend of Carrie.
* Stanford Blatch, a gay screenwriter and friend of Carrie. Stanford was based on Bushnell&#x27;s friend Clifford Streit.
* Skipper Johnson, an entertainment lawyer and male friend of Carrie who appeared early in the television series.
* Barkley, a 25-year-old artist who Carrie dates, who appears in one episode of the series.

== Book ==

A book anthology of Bushnell&#x27;s columns, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, was published in 1996. It primarily focuses on the columns centered around Carrie, and does not include most of Bushnell&#x27;s early first-person columns or those centered around other characters. It was re-published in 2001, 2006, and in 2008 as a tenth anniversary tie-in edition for the film &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

<doc id="296753" wikidata="Q12857636" url="?curid=296753" title="411 (telephone number)">
<text>411 is a telephone number for local directory assistance in Canada and the United States. Until the early 1980s, &quot;411&quot; – and the related &quot;113&quot; number – were free to call in most jurisdictions.

In the United States, the service is commonly known as &quot;information&quot;, although its official name is &quot;directory assistance&quot;.

==History==
The &quot;411&quot; number has been in use since at least 1930 in New York City, San Francisco, and other large cities where panel and crossbar switching equipment installed by the Bell System was prevalent. However, in smaller Bell System cities as well as almost all areas served by GTE and other companies where step-by-step equipment was the norm such as Los Angeles, &quot;113&quot; was used until at least the 1960s, and in some cases (the Pacific Northwest, for example) until the mid-1980s.

In Canada and the United States, directory assistance was historically a local function, and most companies updated listings at their directory assistance centers frequently, sometimes daily. When long-distance numbers were needed, prior to the full introduction of direct-dialed long-distance service, callers would call either &quot;411&quot; or &quot;0&quot; (Operator) and request a free long-distance connection to the directory assistance center in the distant city.

In 1962, direct-dialed long-distance directory assistance became available. The number in cities with panel and crossbar switching equipment was &quot;[area code]-555-1212&quot;, whereas in cities with step-by-step equipment the number was &quot;1-555-1212&quot; (or &quot;112-555-1212&quot;) for numbers not local but in the same area code and &quot;1-[area code]-555-1212&quot; (or &quot;112-[area code]-555-1212&quot;) for numbers in other area codes. In some area codes, the directory assistance center was able to serve the entire area code, but in many, the operator in the principal city of the area code dialed would connect the caller onward to a more local directory assistance center for the most up-to-date information.

After the introduction of local exchange competition, most telephone companies outsourced directory assistance service to nationwide call centers. This has blurred the distinction between &quot;411&quot; and &quot;555-1212&quot;. For regulatory reasons, where telephone service is provided by traditional local-exchange carriers, the local carrier will determine how to handle 411, the chosen local toll (intra-LATA) carrier will determine how to handle &quot;555-1212&quot; calls for area codes within the LATA, and the chosen long-distance carrier for inter-LATA) calls will determine how to handle [&quot;other-area-code-555-1212&quot;] calls. For service provided by cellular and VoIP carriers where the customer does not have a choice of local toll or long-distance carriers, all calls may be handled the same way.

In North America, all areas formerly using &quot;113&quot; have been converted to using &quot;411&quot;, and &quot;11x&quot; is now reserved for vertical service codes. Outside North America, &quot;11x&quot; numbers are still in use, for these and other services. In most European countries, &quot;11x&quot; numbers are related to emergency services and &quot;112&quot; is the emergency telephone number in the European Union as well as some other European and non-European countries.

==The relationship between &quot;411&quot;, &quot;113&quot;, and long-distance dialing==
Direct-distance dialing (DDD) was first introduced in areas with common-control switching (panel and crossbar) in the 1950s. These areas had used &quot;411&quot; for directory assistance, and because of the ability of common-control switching to analyze the initial digits of a number in a &quot;sender&quot; before routing the call, these areas did not require the dialing of an initial &quot;1&quot; to initiate a long-distance call. There was no ambiguity, because the initial assignment of area codes always used either a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;1&quot; as the second digit, and the second digit of local numbers was never a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;1&quot; because of the use of two-letter plus 5-digit local numbering, with the letters only on digits 2–9 of the dial.

Areas with step-by-step equipment processed the call one digit at a time as dialed by the caller, and thus needed a common prefix to distinguish long-distance dialing from local calls. The Bell System design choice was &quot;1&quot;, but since &quot;113&quot; was in use for directory assistance, along with other &quot;11x&quot; codes (&quot;Repair&quot; was &quot;114&quot;)., changes had to be made in the step-by-step areas. Initially, &quot;112&quot; was used temporarily as the prefix in most of these areas. To simplify long-distance calling, it was desirable to change this to a &quot;1&quot;. Some areas converted immediately to &quot;411&quot; for directory assistance and &quot;611&quot; for repair. Other areas retained &quot;113&quot; by installing what were known as &quot;double-header&quot; trunks, which actually connected the call to the long-distance equipment and then &quot;snatched it back&quot; if the second digit was also a &quot;1&quot;.

The conversion proceeded as follows in Springfield, Massachusetts:
==Directory assistance data==
The services of directory assistance queries is often outsourced to a call center which specializes in the task. Historically, when a single carrier provided most of the telephone services for a region, the data used to satisfy the search could exclusively come for that carrier&#x27;s subscriber rolls. Today, when the market is fragmented amongst many carriers, the data must be aggregated by a data aggregator specializing in directory listings. The data aggregator distributes the data to the &quot;411&quot; services either on a &quot;live&quot; basis, serving each query on-demand, or by periodically transferring large swaths of listings to the call center&#x27;s systems for local searching.

The data aggregator collects the data from the rolls of many telecommunication carriers. Some carriers such as Vonage do not send their customer rolls to the aggregator. Their customers can get their listings in the directory assistance database using a free service such as ListYourself.net.

==Landline telephone directory assistance==
&quot;411&quot; landline service has been historically provided by local telephone companies, including those of the former Bell System or subsequent Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). Telephone carriers since that time may provide the &quot;411&quot; calls to the customer free of charge.

Since the 1984 Bell System divestiture, the RBOCs in the United States have priced &quot;411&quot; use higher to an average of US$1.25 per call, compared to $0.50 CAD in most of Canada, providing opportunities for competing services in the United States, such as ad-sponsored &quot;1-800-FREE-411&quot;.

== Wireless telephone directory listings ==
In addition to the local and long-distance directory services, there is also a &quot;Wireless &quot;411&quot; Service&quot;. As specified by the industry, the service will give wireless subscribers the choice of including their wireless phone numbers in directory assistance services.

Consumers can opt in to listing their name and cellphone number with directory assistance services, such as &quot;411&quot;. The information is currently not published in print or online directories. Additionally, the information is not added to, or otherwise shared with, marketing lists or telemarketing firms.

The service will allow any landline or wireless phone user to call &quot;411&quot; and be connected to the wireless listing of a subscriber who has chosen to participate in the service. Carriers who make up the industry LLC creating the service include Alltel (now absorbed by Verizon Wireless), AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint Nextel (now absorbed by T-Mobile).

==Withdrawal of &quot;411&quot; services==

In the United States cellular market, AT&amp;T announced its withdrawal of &quot;411&quot; service for its wireless phone customers, effective November 1, 2022. AT&amp;T also announced it will discontinue landline &quot;411&quot; services in 21 states starting January 1, 2023.

<doc id="296757" wikidata="Q1923401" url="?curid=296757" title="Dzungar Khanate">
<text>The Dzungar Khanate, also known as the Zunghar Khanate or Junggar Khanate, was an Inner Asian khanate of Oirat Mongol origin. At its greatest extent, it covered an area from southern Siberia in the north to present-day Kyrgyzstan in the south, and from the Great Wall of China in the east to present-day Kazakhstan in the west. The core of the Dzungar Khanate is today part of northern Xinjiang, also called Dzungaria.

About 1620 the western Mongols, known as the Oirats, united in the Junggar Basin in Dzungaria. In 1678, Galdan received from the Dalai Lama the title of &quot;Boshogtu Khan&quot;, making the Dzungars the leading tribe within the Oirats. The Dzungar rulers used the title of Khong Tayiji, which translates into English as &quot;crown prince&quot;. Between 1680 and 1688, the Dzungars conquered the Tarim Basin, which is now southern Xinjiang, and defeated the Khalkha Mongols to the east. In 1696, Galdan was defeated by the Qing dynasty and lost Outer Mongolia. In 1717, the Dzungars conquered Tibet, but were driven out in 1720 by the Qing. From 1755 to 1758, Qing China took advantage of a Dzungar civil war to conquer Dzungaria and killed 70-80% of the Dzungar population. The destruction of the Dzungars led to the Qing conquest of Mongolia, Tibet, and the creation of Xinjiang as a political administrative unit.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Dzungar&quot; is a compound of the Mongolian word &quot;jegün&quot; (züün), meaning &quot;left&quot; or &quot;east&quot; and &quot;γar&quot; meaning &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;wing&quot;. The region of Dzungaria derives its name from this confederation. Although the Dzungars were located west of the Khalkas, the derivation of their name has been attributed to the fact that they represented the left wing of the Oirats. In the early 17th century, the head of the Oirat confederation was the leader of the Khoshut, Gushi Khan. When Gushi Khan decided to invade Tibet to replace the local Tsangpa khan in favor of rule by the Gelug, the Oirat army was organized into left and right wing. The right wing consisting of Khoshuts and Torguts remained in Tibet while the Choros and Khoid of the Left wing retreated north into the Tarim basin, since then the powerful empire of the Choros became known as the Left Wing, i.e. Zuungar.

The region was separately described in contemporary European sources as the Kingdom of the Eleuths, from an infelicitous transcription of the name &quot;Oirats&quot; by French missionaries. This was sometimes vaguely extended to cover wide areas of Central Asia, including Afghanistan.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The Oirats were originally from the area of Tuva during the early 13th century. Their leader, Quduqa Bäki, submitted to Genghis Khan in 1208 and his house intermarried with all four branches of the Genghisid line. During the Toluid Civil War, the Four Oirat (Choros, Torghut, Dörbet, and Khoid) sided with Ariq Böke and therefore never accepted Kublaid rule. After the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s collapse, the Oirats supported the Ariq Bökid Jorightu Khan Yesüder in seizing the Northern Yuan throne. The Oirats held sway over the Northern Yuan khans until the death of Esen Taishi in 1455, after which they migrated west due to Khalkha Mongol aggression. In 1486, the Oirats became embroiled in a succession dispute which gave Dayan Khan the opportunity to attack them. In the latter half of the 16th century, the Oirats lost more territory to the Tumed.

In 1620, the leaders of the Choros and Torghut Oirats, Kharkhul and Mergen Temene, attacked Ubasi Khong Tayiji, the first Altan Khan of the Khalkha. They were defeated and Kharkhul lost his wife and children to the enemy. An all out war between Ubasi and the Oirats lasted until 1623 when Ubasi was killed. In 1625, a conflict erupted between the Khoshut chief Chöükür and his uterine brother Baibaghas over inheritance issues. Baibaghas was killed in the fight. However, his younger brothers Güshi Khan and Köndölön Ubashi took up the fight and pursued Chöükür from the Ishim River to the Tobol River, attacking and killing his tribal followers in 1630. The infighting among the Oirats caused the Torghut chief Kho Orluk to migrate westwards until they came into conflict with the Nogai Horde, which they destroyed. The Torghuts founded the Kalmyk Khanate but still stayed in contact with the Oirats in the east. Every time a great assembly was called, they sent representatives to attend.
In 1632, the Gelug Yellow Hat sect in Qinghai was being repressed by the Khalkha Choghtu Khong Tayiji, so they invited Güshi Khan to come and deal with him. In 1636, Güshi led 10,000 Oirats in an invasion of Qinghai which resulted in the defeat of a 30,000 strong enemy army and the death of Choghtu. He then entered Central Tibet, where he received from the 5th Dalai Lama the title of Bstan-&#x27;dzin Choskyi Rgyal-po (the Dharma King Who Upholds the Religion). He then claimed the title of Khan, the first non-Genghisid Mongol to do so, and summoned the Oirats to completely conquer Tibet, creating the Khoshut Khanate. Among those involved was Kharkhul&#x27;s son, Erdeni Batur, who was granted the title of Khong Tayiji, married the khan&#x27;s daughter Amin Dara, and sent back to establish the Dzungar Khanate on the upper Emil River south of the Tarbagatai Mountains. Batur returned to Dzungaria with the title Erdeni (given by the Dalai Lama) and much booty. During his reign he made three expeditions against the Kazakhs. The conflicts by the Dzungars are remembered in a Kazakh ballad &quot;Elim-ai&quot;. The Dzungars also went to war against the Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Uzbeks when they invaded deep into Central Asia to Yasi (Turkestan) and Tashkent in 1643.

===Succession dispute (1653–1677)===

In 1653, Sengge succeeded his father Batur, but he faced dissent from his half brothers. With the support of Ochirtu Khan of the Khoshut, this strife ended with Sengge&#x27;s victory in 1661. In 1667 he captured Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji, the third and last Altan Khan. However, he himself was assassinated by his half-brothers Chechen Tayiji and Zotov in a coup in 1670.

Sengge&#x27;s younger brother Galdan Boshugtu Khan had been residing in Tibet at the time. Upon his birth in 1644 he was recognized as the reincarnation of a Tibetan lama who had died the previous year. In 1656 he left for Tibet, where he received education from Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama and the 5th Dalai Lama. Upon learning of his brother&#x27;s death, he immediately returned from Tibet and took revenge on Chechen. Allied with Ochirtu Sechen of the Khoshut, Galdan defeated Chechen, and drove Zotov out of Dzungaria. In 1671 The Dalai Lama bestowed the title of Khan on Galdan. Sengge&#x27;s two sons Sonom Rabdan and Tsewang Rabtan revolted against Galdan but they were defeated. Although, already married Anu-Dara, granddaughter of Ochirtu, he came into conflict with his grandfather in law. Fearing Galdan&#x27;s popularity, Ochirtu supported his uncle and rival Choqur Ubashi who refused to recognize Galdan&#x27;s title. The victory over Ochirtu in 1677 resulted Galdan&#x27;s domination of the Oirats. In the next year the Dalai Lama gave the highest title of Boshoghtu (or Boshughtu) Khan to him.

=== Conquest of the Yarkent Khanate (1678–1680) ===
From the late 16th century onward, the Yarkent Khanate fell under the influence of the Khojas. The Khojas were Naqshbandi Sufis who claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad or from the Rashidun caliphs. By the reign of Sultan Said Khan in the early 16th century, the Khojas already had a strong influence in court and over the khan. In 1533, an especially influential Khoja named Makhdum-i Azam arrived in Kashgar, where he settled and had two sons. These two sons hated each other and they passed down their mutual hatred down to their children. The two lineages came to dominate large parts of the khanate, splitting it between two factions: the Aq Taghliq (White Mountain) in Kashgar and the Qara Taghliq (Black Mountain) in Yarkand. Yulbars patronized the Aq Taghliqs and suppressed the Qara Taghliqs, which caused much resentment, and resulted in his assassination in 1670. He was succeeded by his son who ruled from only a brief period before Ismail Khan was enthroned. Ismail reversed the power struggle between the two Muslim factions and drove out the Aq Taghliq leader, Afaq Khoja. Afaq fled to Tibet, where the 5th Dalai Lama aided him in enlisting the help of Galdan Boshugtu Khan.

In 1680, Galdan led 120,000 Dzungars into the Yarkent Khanate. They were aided by the Aq Taghliqs and Hami and Turpan, which had already submitted to the Dzungars. Ismail&#x27;s son Babak Sultan died in the resistance against in the battle for Kashgar. The general Iwaz Beg died in the defense of Yarkand. The Dzungars defeated the Moghul forces without much difficulty and took Ismail and his family prisoner. Galdan installed Abd ar-Rashid Khan II, son of Babak, as puppet khan.

===First Kazakh war (1681–1685)===
In 1681, Galdan invaded the north of Tengeri Mountain and attacked the Kazakh Khanate but failed to take Sayram. In 1683 Galdan&#x27;s armies under Tsewang Rabtan took Tashkent and Sayram. They reached the Syr Darya and crushed two Kazakh armies. After that Galdan subjugated the Black Kyrgyz and ravaged the Fergana Valley. His general Rabtan took Taraz city. From 1685 Galdan&#x27;s forces aggressively pushed westward, forcing the Kazakhs ever further west. The Dzungars established dominion over the Baraba Tatars and extracted yasaq (tribute) from them. Converting to Orthodox Christianity and becoming Russian subjects was a tactic by the Baraba to find an excuse not to pay yasaq to the Dzungars.

===Khalkha war (1687–1688)===

The Oirats had established peace with the Khalkha Mongols since Ligdan Khan died in 1634 and the Khalkhas were preoccupied with the rise of the Qing dynasty. However, when the Jasaghtu Khan Shira lost part of his subjects to the Tüsheet Khan Chikhundorj, Galdan moved his orda near the Altai Mountains to prepare an attack. Chikhundorj attacked the right wing of the Khalkhas and killed Shira in 1687. In 1688, Galdan dispatched troops under his younger brother Dorji-jav against Chikhundorj but they were eventually defeated. Dorji-jav was killed in battle. Chikhundorj then murdered Degdeehei Mergen Ahai of the Jasaghtu Khan who was on the way to Galdan. To avenge the death of his brother, Galdan established friendly relations with the Russians who were already at war with Chikhundorj over territories near Lake Baikal. Armed with Russian firearms, Galdan led 30,000 Dzungar troops into Khalkha Mongolia in 1688 and defeated Chikhundorj in three days. The Siberian Cossacks, meanwhile, attacked and defeated a Khalkha army of 10,000 near Lake Baikal. After two bloody battles with the Dzungars near Erdene Zuu Monastery and Tomor, Chakhundorji and his brother Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Zanabazar fled across the Gobi Desert to the Qing dynasty and submitted to the Kangxi Emperor.

===First Qing war (1690–1696)===

Late in the summer of 1690, Galdan crossed the Kherlen River with a force of 20,000 and engaged a Qing army at Battle of Ulan Butung 350 kilometers north of Beijing near the western headwaters of the Liao River. Galdan was forced to retreat and escaped total destruction because the Qing army did not have the supplies or ability to pursue him. In 1696, the Kangxi Emperor led 100,000 troops into Mongolia. Galdan fled from the Kherlen only to be caught by another Qing army attacking from the west. He was defeated in the ensuing Battle of Jao Modo near the upper Tuul River. Galdan&#x27;s wife, Anu, was killed and the Qing army captured 20,000 cattle and 40,000 sheep. Galdan fled with a small handful of followers. In 1697 he died in the Altai Mountains near Khovd on 4 April. Back in Dzungaria, his nephew Tsewang Rabtan, who had revolted in 1689, was already in control as of 1691.

===Chagatai rebellion (1693–1705)===
Galdan installed Abd ar-Rashid Khan II, son of Babak, as puppet khan in the Yarkent Khanate. The new khan forced Afaq Khoja to flee again, but Abd ar-Rashid&#x27;s reign was also ended unceremoniously two years later when riots erupted in Yarkand. He was replaced by his brother Muhammad Imin Khan. Muhammad sought help from the Qing dynasty, Khanate of Bukhara, and the Mughal Empire in combating the Dzungars. In 1693, Muhammad conducted a successful attack on the Dzungar Khanate, taking 30,000 captives. Unfortunately Afaq Khoja appeared again and overthrew Muhammad in a revolt led by his followers. Afaq&#x27;s son Yahiya Khoja was enthroned but his reign was cut short in 1695 when both he and his father were killed while suppressing local rebellions. In 1696, Akbash Khan was placed on the throne, but the begs of Kashgar refused to recognize him, and instead allied with the Kyrgyz to attack Yarkand, taking Akbash prisoner. The begs of Yarkand went to the Dzungars, who sent troops and ousted the Kyrgyz in 1705. The Dzungars installed a non-Chagatayid ruler Mirza Alim Shah Beg, thereby ending the rule of Chagatai khans forever. Abdullah Tarkhan Beg of Hami also rebelled in 1696 and defected to the Qing dynasty. In 1698, Qing troops were stationed in Hami.

===Second Kazakh war (1698)===
In 1698 Galdan&#x27;s successor Tsewang Rabtan reached Tengiz lake and Turkestan, and the Dzungars controlled Zhei-Su and Tashkent until 1745. The Dzungars&#x27; war on the Kazakhs pushed them into seeking aid from Russia.

===Second Qing war (1718–1720)===
Tsewang Rabtan&#x27;s brother Tseren Dondup invaded the Khoshut Khanate in 1717, deposed Yeshe Gyatso, killed Lha-bzang Khan, and looted Lhasa. The Kangxi Emperor retaliated in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars in the Battle of the Salween River, not far from Lhasa. A second and larger expedition sent by Kangxi expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought Kälzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and installed him as the 7th Dalai Lama in 1721. The people of Turpan and Pichan took advantage of the situation to rebel under a local chief, Amin Khoja, and defected to the Qing dynasty.

===Galdan Tseren (1727–1745)===
Tsewang Rabtan died suddenly in 1727 and was succeeded by his son Galdan Tseren. Galdan Tseren drove out his half-brother Lobszangshunu. He continued the war against the Kazakhs and the Kalkha Mongols. In retaliation against attacks against his Khalkha subjects, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty sent an invasion force of 10,000, which the Dzungars defeated near the Khoton Lake. The next year however, the Dzungars suffered a defeat against the Khalkhas near Erdene Zuu Monastery. In 1731, the Dzungars attacked Turpan, which had previously defected to the Qing dynasty. Amin Khoja led the people of Turpan in a retreat into Gansu where they settled in Guazhou. In 1739, Galdan Tseren agreed to the boundary between Khalkha and Dzungar territory.

===Collapse (1745–1757)===
Galdan Tseren died in 1745, triggering widespread rebellion in the Tarim Basin, and starting a succession dispute among his sons. In 1749 Galden Tseren&#x27;s son Lama Dorji seized the throne from his younger brother, Tsewang Dorji Namjal. He was overthrown by his cousin Dawachi and the Khoid noble Amursana, but they too fought over control of the khanate.

As a result of their dispute, in 1753, three of Dawachi&#x27;s relatives ruling the Dörbet and Bayad defected to the Qing and migrated into Khalkha territory. The next year, Amursana also defected. In 1754, Yusuf, the ruler of Kashgar, rebelled and forcefully converted the Dzungars living there to Islam. His older brother, Jahan Khoja of Yarkand, also rebelled but was captured by the Dzungars due to the treachery of Ayyub Khoja of Aksu. Jahan&#x27;s son Sadiq gathered 7,000 men in Khotan and attacked Aksu in retaliation.

In the spring of 1755, the Qianlong Emperor sent an army of 50,000 against Dawachi. He presented his invasion as benevolent, and aimed at ending the sufferings of the Dzungars, while ascribing their misery to themselves:

====Storming of the Camp at Gädän-Ola (1755)====

The Qing army met almost no resistance and destroyed the Dzungar Khanate within the span of 100 days. The Chinese army, supplemented on the way by Muslim and renegade Dzungar troops, surprised Dawachi at the site of Borotola in June 1755, about 300 &quot;li&quot; from Ili. Dawachi had about 10,000 troops, and retreated to Mount Keteng, about 80 &quot;li&quot; from Ili, while sending messengers for reinforcements, but the messengers were intercepted by the Chinese. The Qing army was able to surprise and capture Dawachi&#x27;s army at the camp, and a charge was led by the Dzungar renegade Ayusi and 20 of his men, who stormed the camp and where able to conduct about 8,000 prisoners to the Chinese camp (an event depicted in the Qing painting &quot;&quot;Storming of the Camp at Gädän-Ola&quot;). Only 2,000 soldiers escaped with Dawachi at their head. Dawachi fled into the mountains north of Aksu but was captured by the Uyghur leader Khojis, beg of Uchturpan, at the request of the Chinese, and delivered to the Qing.
====Surrender of Dawachi (1755)====
Dawachi surrendered to the Qing general Zhaohui. The scene was immortalized in the painting &quot;Zhaohui receives the surrender of Dawachi at Ili&quot;&quot; by the Jesuit court painter Ignatius Sichelbart. Dawachi was taken to Beijing, but was pardoned by the Emperor. Together with his captor Khojis, he was made a Prince, and &quot;awarded banner privileges&quot;.
==Aftermath==
===Amursana&#x27;s rebellion (1755–1757)===

After defeating the Dzungar Khanate, the Qing planned to install khans for each of the four Oirat tribes, but Amursana, who had been an ally of the Qing against Dawachi, wanted to rule over all the Oirats. Instead the Qianlong Emperor made him only khan of the Khoid.

In the summer, Amursana along with Mongol leader Chingünjav led a revolt against the Qing. Amursana was defeated in the &quot;Battle of Oroi-Jalatu&quot; (1756), in which Chinese general Zhao Hui attacked the Dzungars at night in present Wusu, Xinjiang. Unable to defeat the Qing, Amursana fled north to seek refuge with the Russians and died of smallpox in Russian lands in September 1757. In the spring of 1762 his frozen body was brought to Kyakhta for the Manchu to see. The Russians then buried it, refusing the Manchu request that it be handed over for posthumous punishment.

Later encounters took place with the remaining Dzungar forces, in the &quot;Battle of Khorgos&quot;, in which the partisans of Amursana were defeated in 1758 by Prince Cäbdan-jab. Again in 1758, at the &quot;Battle of Khurungui&quot;, General Zhao Hui ambushed and defeated the Dzungarian forces on Mount Khurungui, near Almaty, Kazakhstan.

===Aq Taghliq rebellion (1757–1759)===

When Amursana rebelled against the Qing dynasty, the Aq Taghliq (i.e. &#x27;White Mountaineers&#x27;, also known as Āfāqīs) Khojas Burhanuddin and Jahan rebelled in Yarkand. Their rule was not popular and the people greatly disliked them for appropriating anything they needed from clothing to livestock. In February 1758, The Qing sent Yaerhashan and Zhao Hui with 10,000 troops against the Aq Taghliq regime. Zhao Hui was besieged by enemy forces at Yarkand until January 1759, but otherwise the Qing army did not encounter any difficulties on campaign. The khoja brothers fled to Badakhshan where they were captured by the ruler Sultan Shah, who executed them and handed Jahan&#x27;s head to the Qing. The Tarim Basin was pacified in 1759.

===Genocide===

According to the Qing scholar Wei Yuan (1794–1857), the Dzungar population before the Qing conquest was around 600,000 in 200,000 households. Wei Yuan wrote that about 40 percent of the Dzungar households were killed by smallpox, 20 percent fled to Russia or Kazakh tribes, and 30 percent were killed by Manchu bannermen. For several thousands of li, there were no gers except of those who had surrendered. Wen-Djang Chu wrote that 80 percent of the 600,000 or more Dzungars were destroyed by disease and attack which Michael Clarke described as &quot;the complete destruction of not only the Dzungar state but of the Dzungars as a people&quot;.

It&#x27;s argued by the historian Peter Perdue that the destruction of the Dzungars was the result of an explicit policy of extermination launched by the Qianlong Emperor which lasted for two years. His commanders were reluctant to carry out his orders, which he repeated several times using the term &quot;jiao&quot; (extermination) over and over again. The commanders Hadaha and Agui were punished for only occupying Dzungar lands but letting the people escape. The generals Jaohui and Shuhede were punished for not showing sufficient zeal in exterminating rebels. Qianlong explicitly ordered the Khalkha Mongols to &quot;take the young and strong and massacre them&quot;. The elderly, children, and women were spared but they could not preserve their former names or titles. Mark Levene, a historian whose recent research interests focus on genocide, states that the extermination of the Dzungars was &quot;arguably the eighteenth century genocide par excellence&quot;.

Widespread anti-Dzungar opinion by former Dzungar subjects contributed to their genocide. The Muslim Kazakhs and former people of the Yarkent Khanate in the Tarim Basin (now called Uyghurs), were treated poorly under by the Buddhist Dzungars, who used them as slave labor, and participated in the Qing invasion and attacked the Dzungars. Uyghur leaders like Khoja Emin or Khojis were granted titles within the Qing nobility, and acted as an intermediary with Muslims from the Tarim Basin. They told the Muslims that the Qing only wanted to kill Oirats and that they would leave the Muslims alone. They also convinced the Muslims to aid the Qing in killing Oirates.

===Demographic change in Xinjiang===

After the destruction of the Dzungar Oirat people, the Qing dynasty sponsored the settlement of millions of Han, Hui, Xibe, Daur, Solon, Turkic Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchus in Dzungaria since the land had been emptied. Stanley W. Toops notes that modern Xinjiang&#x27;s demographic situation still reflects the settlement initiative of the Qing dynasty. One third of Xinjiang&#x27;s total population consisted of Han, Hui, and Kazakhs in the north while around two-thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang&#x27;s Tarim Basin. Some cities in northern Xinjiang such as Ürümqi and Yining were essentially made by the Qing settlement policy.

The elimination of the Buddhist Dzungars led to the rise of Islam and its Muslim Begs as the predominant moral political authority in Xinjiang. Many Muslim Taranchis also moved to northern Xinjiang. According to Henry Schwarz, &quot;the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam&quot;. Ironically, the destruction of the Dzungars by the Qing led to the consolidation of Turkic Muslim power in the region, since Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.

In 1759, the Qing dynasty proclaimed that the land formerly belonging to the Dzungars was now part of &quot;China&quot; (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu memorial. The Qing ideology of unification portrayed the &quot;outer&quot; non-Han Chinese like the Mongols, Oirats, and Tibetans together with the &quot;inner&quot; Han Chinese as &quot;one family&quot; united in the Qing state. The Qing described the phrase &quot;Zhong Wai Yi Jia&quot; (中外一家) or &quot;Nei Wai Yi Jia&quot; (內外一家, &quot;interior and exterior as one family&quot;), to convey this idea of &quot;unification&quot; to different peoples.

=== Paintings ===
The Qianlong Emperor took great care to document his successes in the war. He ordered the painting of the 100 most meritorious servitors of the Qing (紫光阁功臣像: brave Qing officers, generals, and also a few Torghut and Dörbed allies, as well as vanquished Choros Oirats, or Muslim Uyghur allies such as Khojis or Amin Khoja), as well as paintings of the battle scenes whenever the Qing were successful. The faces are in Western realistic style, while the bodies were probably drawn by Chinese court artists. According to contemporary Jesuit painter Jean-Denis Attiret: &quot;During the whole duration of this war against the Eleuths and other Tartars, their allies, whenever the imperials troops gained some victories, the painters were ordered to paint them. Those of the most important officers who had played the decisive roles in the events were favoured to appear in the paintings according to what really had happened&quot;. These paintings were all made by foreign artists, specifically the Jesuits under Giuseppe Castiglione, and Chinese court-painters under their direction.

‡ Note: &quot;Although Amursana had de facto control of some areas of Dzungaria during 1755–1756, he could never officially become Khan due to the inferior rank of his clan, the Khoid.&quot;

==Culture==
The Oirats converted to Tibetan Buddhism in 1615.

Oirat society was similar to other nomadic societies. It was heavily dependent on animal husbandry but also practiced limited agriculture. After the conquest of the Yarkent Khanate in 1680, they used people from the Tarim Basin (taranchi) as slave labour to cultivate land in Dzungaria. The Dzungar economy and industry was fairly complex for a nomadic society. They had iron, copper, and silver mines producing raw ore, which the Dzungars made into weapons and shields, including even firearms, bullets, and other utensils. The Dzungars were able to indigenously manufacture firearms to a degree that was unique in Central Asia at the time. In 1762, the Qing army discovered four large Dzungar bronze cannons, eight &quot;soaring&quot; cannons, and 10,000 shells.

In 1640, the Oirats created an Oirat Mongol Legal Code which regulated the tribes and gave support to the Gelug Yellow Hat sect. Erdeni Batur assisted Zaya Pandita in creating the Clear Script.

<text>Barnes &amp; Barnes were an American musical duo, formed in Los Angeles in 1970. Most commonly associated with novelty music and comedy rock, their music also incorporated elements of new wave, synth-pop, and folk rock.

The duo was formed in 1970 by actor Bill Mumy and Robert Haimer (March 2, 1954 – March 4, 2023) who were high school classmates, originally as a private home recording project. By 1978, Barnes &amp; Barnes had gained public recognition with the radio debut of their novelty song &quot;Fish Heads,&quot; on the US nationally syndicated &quot;Dr. Demento Show&quot;.

When recording or performing as Barnes &amp; Barnes, Mumy and Haimer adopt the personae of Art Barnes and Artie Barnes, respectively; twin brothers from the fictional civilization of Lumania. 

==History==
Robert Haimer and Bill Mumy were childhood friends who occasionally performed together on their musical instruments. After the cancellation of Mumy&#x27;s TV series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; in 1968, they shot short films with a Super 8 motion picture camera, dubbed &quot;Art Films&quot;. The two began calling each other &quot;Art&quot; in joking reference to these films.

They formed the band Barnes &amp; Barnes in 1970. They started when they were about 16 with a two track recorder. Their surname &quot;Barnes&quot; was taken from a Bill Cosby comedy routine called &quot;Revenge&quot;, in which a character called Junior Barnes throws a slushball at Cosby as a child. Originally, both Haimer and Mumy were named &quot;Art Barnes&quot;, but Haimer&#x27;s alter ego was publicly renamed &quot;Artie&quot; in 1979 to differentiate between them.

They first received airplay on &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot; in 1978. Haimer was a fan of the show and convinced Mumy to &quot;pick a couple of songs and do them right&quot; to send in, the results being their songs &quot;Boogie Woogie Amputee&quot; and &quot;Fish Heads&quot; which they re-did on a Teac four track machine. The latter recording was released as a single on their own Lumania Records in 1979 and remains their best-known song, as well as the most requested song in the history of &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;.
In 1978, Damaskas and Barnes &amp; Barnes recorded &quot;A Day in the Life of Green Acres,&quot; a song that combined the music of The Beatles &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show &quot;Green Acres&quot;. It was inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps&#x27; similar intertwining of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and the theme to &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Barnes &amp; Barnes released a four-song EP in 1982 featuring the songs, &quot;I had Sex with E.T.&quot; and &quot;I had Sex with Pac-Man.&quot; Both songs had identical music but different lyrics. It was rumored that Spielberg or Universal&#x27;s lawyers requested that the EPs be removed from the shelves, and very few were sold. The &quot;I had Sex with...&quot; songs were never released on any Barnes &amp; Barnes compilation. Both songs ended with, &quot;Eat them up, yum!&quot; Their song &quot;Something&#x27;s In The Bag&quot; was also frequently played on Dr. Demento. 

Haimer died in March 2023.

<text>Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, known as Piero the Gouty (), (1416 – 2 December 1469) was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Florence from 1464 to 1469, during the Italian Renaissance.

==Biography==
Piero was the son of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici the Elder and Contessina de&#x27; Bardi. During his father&#x27;s life, he did not play an extensive role due to his perpetual poor health, the source of his nickname. His brother Giovanni was named as Cosimo&#x27;s executor, but predeceased his father. In 1461, Piero was the last Medici elected to the office of Gonfaloniere. His gout often kept him confined to bed. This meant that his bedroom effectively became his office, where he would conduct political meetings. This led to the Medici palace becoming the seat of government in Florence.

Upon taking over the Medici bank from his father, Piero had a financial overview prepared. The results led him to call up a number of long-standing loans, many to various Medici supporters, which his father had let stand. This immediately drove a good number of the merchants involved into bankruptcy and added to the ranks of those who opposed the Medici. Although not as brilliant a banker as his father, he was able to keep things running smoothly during his tenure.

His time as leader of Florence was marked by an attempted coup led by Luca Pitti, Niccolò Soderini, Diotisalvi Neroni, Angelo Acciaiuoli and his cousin Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, who used troops provided by Borso d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena and Reggio, and commanded by his brother Ercole d&#x27;Este, planned for 26 August 1466. Piero was warned by Giovanni II Bentivoglio and was able to escape the coup, in part because his son Lorenzo discovered a road-block set up by the conspirators to capture Piero in his trip toward the Medici Villa di Careggi; he was not recognized and was able to warn his father. The coup failed, as did an attempted repeat backed by Venice, using troops commanded by Bartolomeo Colleoni. It has been argued that the &quot;coup&quot; was in fact a legitimate attempt to limit the power of the Medici faction and restore a system of government in keeping with Florence&#x27;s traditional republican ideals, and that to refer to it as a &quot;coup&quot; or a &quot;conspiracy&quot; legitimizes Piero&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; and hereditary (but wholly unconstitutional) status as leader of the city.

In 1467, Piero had to face a war against the Republic of Venice prompted by the Florentine support given to Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the new duke of Milan. However, the Venetian army under Colleoni was defeated at the Battle of Molinella by a league of Florence, Naples, the Papal States and Milan.

Piero also continued the family&#x27;s tradition of artistic patronage, including Gozzoli&#x27;s fresco &quot;Procession of the Magi&quot; in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi (in which are also present both of Piero&#x27;s sons, Lorenzo and Giuliano, as well as Piero himself). His taste was more eclectic than that of his father, extending to Dutch and Flemish artworks.

Piero continued to collect rare books, adding many to the Medici collections. With a strong interest in humanism, he commissioned Marsilio Ficino to translate Plato and other classical works. Ficino dedicated several books to him, such as De Sole. 

Piero died in 1469 as a result of gout and lung disease. He is buried in the Church of San Lorenzo, next to his brother Giovanni. The tomb, created by Andrea del Verrocchio, was commissioned by his sons Lorenzo and Giuliano.

==Marriage and issue==
On 3 June 1444, Piero married Lucrezia Tornabuoni (1427–1482). Their children include Lorenzo the Magnificent and Giuliano de&#x27; Medici. All his family is likely portrayed in the famous painting by Botticelli known as the Madonna of the Magnificat, in which Lucrezia Tornabuoni appears as the Virgin Mary.
In all, Lucrezia gave birth to at least six children:
*Bianca (1445–1505) – married Guglielmo Pazzi
*Lucrezia &quot;Nannina&quot; (1448–1493)
*Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449–1492)
*Giuliano (1453–1478)
* Maria (1455–1479) – married Leonetto Rossi and was the mother of Cardinal Luigi de&#x27; Rossi.
*Two sons died as newborn

Before his marriage, Piero had an illegitimate son by an unknown woman: 
*Giovanni. He married Luigia di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici

==Fictional depictions==
A young Piero is portrayed by Alessandro Sperduti in the 2016 television series &quot;&quot;. An older Piero is portrayed by Julian Sands in the first two episodes of the second season, &quot;Medici: The Magnificent&quot;.

<text>From a legal point of view, a contract is an institutional arrangement for the way in which resources flow, which defines the various relationships between the parties to a transaction or limits the rights and obligations of the parties.

From an economic perspective, contract theory studies how economic actors can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of information asymmetry. Because of its connections with both agency and incentives, contract theory is often categorized within a field known as law and economics. One prominent application of it is the design of optimal schemes of managerial compensation. In the field of economics, the first formal treatment of this topic was given by Kenneth Arrow in the 1960s. In 2016, Oliver Hart and Bengt R. Holmström both received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work on contract theory, covering many topics from CEO pay to privatizations. Holmström focused more on the connection between incentives and risk, while Hart on the unpredictability of the future that creates holes in contracts.

A standard practice in the microeconomics of contract theory is to represent the behaviour of a decision maker under certain numerical utility structures, and then apply an optimization algorithm to identify optimal decisions. Such a procedure has been used in the contract theory framework to several typical situations, labeled &quot;moral hazard&quot;, &quot;adverse selection&quot; and &quot;signalling&quot;. The spirit of these models lies in finding theoretical ways to motivate agents to take appropriate actions, even under an insurance contract. The main results achieved through this family of models involve: mathematical properties of the utility structure of the principal and the agent, relaxation of assumptions, and variations of the &quot;time structure&quot; of the contract relationship, among others. It is customary to model people as maximizers of some von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions, as stated by expected utility theory.

== Development and origin ==
Contract theory in economics began with 1991 Nobel Laureate Ronald H. Coase&#x27;s 1937 article &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot;. Coase notes that &quot;the longer the duration of a contract regarding the supply of goods or services due to the difficulty of forecasting, then the less likely and less appropriate it is for the buyer to specify what the other party should do.&quot; That suggests two points, the first is that Coase already understands transactional behaviour in terms of contracts, and the second is that Coase implies that if contracts are less complete then firms are more likely to substitute for markets. The contract theory has since evolved in two directions. One is the complete contract theory and the other is the incomplete contract theory.

=== Complete contract theory ===
Complete contract theory states that there is no essential difference between a firm and a market; they are both contracts. Principals and agents are able to foresee all future scenarios and develop optimal risk sharing and revenue transfer mechanisms to achieve sub-optimal efficiency under constraints. It is equivalent to principal-agent theory.

* Armen Albert Alchian and Harold Demsetz disagree with Coase&#x27;s view that the nature of the firm is a substitute for the market, but argue that both the firm and the market are contracts and that there is no fundamental difference between the two. They believe that the essence of the firm is a team production, and that the central issue in team production is the measurement of agent effort, namely the moral hazard of single agents and multiple agents.
* Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling believe that the nature of a business is a contractual relationship. They defined a business as an organisation. Such an organisation, like the majority of other organisations, as a legal fiction whose function is to act as a connecting point for a set of contractual relationships between individuals.
* James Mirrlees and Bengt Holmström et al. developed a basic framework for single-agent and multi-agent moral hazard models in a principal-agent framework with the help of the favourable labour tool of game theory.
* Eugene F. Fama et al. extend static contract theory to dynamic contract theory, thus introducing the issue of principal commitment and the agent&#x27;s reputation effect into long-term contracts.
*Eric Brousseau and Jean-Michel Glachant believe that contract theory should include incentive theory，incomplete contract theory and the new institutional transaction costs theory.

== Main models of agency problems ==
=== Moral hazard ===
The moral hazard problem refers to the extent to which an employee&#x27;s behaviour is concealed from the employer: whether they work, how hard they work and how carefully they do so.

In moral hazard models, the information asymmetry is the principal&#x27;s inability to observe and/or verify the agent&#x27;s action. Performance-based contracts that depend on observable and verifiable output can often be employed to create incentives for the agent to act in the principal&#x27;s interest. When agents are risk-averse, however, such contracts are generally only second-best because incentivization precludes full insurance.

The typical moral hazard model is formulated as follows. The principal solves:
:formula_1

subject to the agent&#x27;s &quot;individual rationality (IR)&quot; constraint,
:formula_2

and the agent&#x27;s &quot;incentive compatibility (IC)&quot; constraint,
:formula_3,

where formula_4 is the wage for the agent as a function of output formula_5, which in turn is a function of effort:formula_6.

formula_7 represents the cost of effort, and reservation utility is given by formula_8.

formula_9 is the &quot;utility function&quot;, which is concave for the risk-averse agent, is convex for the risk-prone agent, and is linear for the risk-neutral agent.

If the agent is risk-neutral and there are no bounds on transfer payments, the fact that the agent&#x27;s effort is unobservable (i.e., it is a &quot;hidden action&quot;) does not pose a problem. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved that would be attained with verifiable effort: The agent chooses the so-called &quot;first-best&quot; effort level that maximizes the expected total surplus of the two parties. Specifically, the principal can give the realized output to the agent, but let the agent make a fixed up-front payment. The agent is then a &quot;residual claimant&quot; and will maximize the expected total surplus minus the fixed payment. Hence, the first-best effort level maximizes the agent&#x27;s payoff, and the fixed payment can be chosen such that in equilibrium the agent&#x27;s expected payoff equals his or her reservation utility (which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Yet, if the agent is risk-averse, there is a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Moreover, if the agent is risk-neutral but wealth-constrained, the agent cannot make the fixed up-front payment to the principal, so the principal must leave a &quot;limited liability rent&quot; to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility).

The moral hazard model with risk aversion was pioneered by Steven Shavell, Sanford J. Grossman, Oliver D. Hart, and others in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been extended to the case of repeated moral hazard by William P. Rogerson and to the case of multiple tasks by Bengt Holmström and Paul Milgrom. The moral hazard model with risk-neutral but wealth-constrained agents has also been extended to settings with repeated interaction and multiple tasks. While it is difficult to test models with hidden action empirically (since there is no field data on unobservable variables), the premise of contract theory that incentives matter has been successfully tested in the field. Moreover, contract-theoretic models with hidden actions have been directly tested in laboratory experiments.

=== Example of possible solution to moral hazard ===
A study on the solution to moral hazard concludes that adding moral sensitivity to the principal–agent model increases its descriptiveness, prescriptiveness, and pedagogical usefulness because it induces employees to work at the appropriate effort for which they receive a wage. The theory suggests that as employee work efforts increase, so proportional premium wage should increases also to encourage productivity.

=== Adverse selection ===
In adverse selection models, the principal is not informed about a certain characteristic of the agent at the time the contract is written. The characteristic is called the agent&#x27;s &quot;type&quot;. For example, health insurance is more likely to be purchased by people who are more likely to get sick. In this case, the agent&#x27;s type is his or her health status, which is privately known by the agent. Another prominent example is public procurement contracting: The government agency (the principal) does not know the private firm&#x27;s cost. In this case, the private firm is the agent and the agent&#x27;s type is the cost level.

In adverse selection models, there is typically too little trade (i.e., there is a so-called &quot;downward distortion&quot; of the trade level compared to a &quot;first-best&quot; benchmark situation with complete information), except when the agent is of the best possible type (which is known as the &quot;no distortion at the top&quot; property). The principal offers a menu of contracts to the agent; the menu is called &quot;incentive-compatible&quot; if the agent picks the contract that was designed for his or her type. In order to make the agent reveal the true type, the principal has to leave an information rent to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility, which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Adverse selection theory has been pioneered by Roger Myerson, Eric Maskin, and others in the 1980s. More recently, adverse selection theory has been tested in laboratory experiments and in the field.

Adverse selection theory has been expanded in several directions, e.g. by endogenizing the information structure (so the agent can decide whether or not to gather private information) and by taking into consideration social preferences and bounded rationality.

=== Signalling ===
In &quot;signalling&quot; models, one party chooses how and whether or not to present information about itself to another party to reduce the information asymmetry between them. In signaling models, the signaling party agent and the receiving party principal have access to different information. The challenge for the receiving party is to decipher the credibility of the signaling party so as to assess their capabilities. The formulation of this theory began in 1973 by Michael Spence through his job-market signaling model. In his model, job applicants are tasked with &quot;signalling&quot; their skills and capabilities to employers to reduce the probabilities for the employer to choose a lesser qualified applicant over a qualified applicant. This is because potential employers lack the knowledge to discern the skills and capabilities of potential employees.

== Incomplete contracts ==
Contract theory also utilizes the notion of a complete contract, which is thought of as a contract that specifies the legal consequences of every possible state of the world. More recent developments known as the theory of incomplete contracts, pioneered by Oliver Hart and his coauthors, study the incentive effects of parties&#x27; inability to write complete contingent contracts. In fact, it may be the case that the parties to a transaction are unable to write a complete contract at the contract stage because it is either difficult to reach an agreement to get it done or it is too expensive to do so, e.g. concerning relationship-specific investments. A leading application of the incomplete contracting paradigm is the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to the theory of the firm (see Hart, 1995).

Because it would be impossibly complex and costly for the parties to an agreement to make their contract complete, the law provides default rules which fill in the gaps in the actual agreement of the parties.

During the last 20 years, much effort has gone into the analysis of dynamic contracts. Important early contributors to this literature include, among others, Edward J. Green, Stephen Spear, and Sanjay Srivastava.

== Expected utility theory ==
Much of contract theory can be explained through expected utility theory. This theory indicates that individuals will measure their choices based on the risks and benefits associated with a decision. A study analyzed that agents&#x27; anticipatory feelings are affected by uncertainty. Hence why principals need to form contracts with agents in the presence of information asymmetry to more clearly understand each party&#x27;s motives and benefits.

== Examples of contract theory ==
* George Akerlof described adverse selection in the market for used cars.
* In certain models, such as Michael Spence&#x27;s job-market model, the agent can signal his type to the principal which may help to resolve the problem.
* Leland and Pyle&#x27;s (1977) IPO theory for agents (companies) to reduce adverse selection in the market by always sending clear signals before going public.

== Incentive Design ==
In the contract theory, the goal is to motivate employees by giving them rewards. Trading on service level/quality, results, performance or goals. It can be seen that reward determines whether the incentive mechanism can fully motivate employees.

In view of the large number of contract theoretical models, the design of compensation under different contract conditions is different.

=== Rewards on Absolute Performance and Relative Performance ===
Source:

* Absolute performance-related reward: The reward is in direct proportion to the absolute performance of employees.
* Relative performance-related reward: The rewards are arranged according to the performance of the employees, from the highest to the lowest.

Absolute performance-related reward is an incentive mechanism widely recognized in economics in the real society, because it provides employees with the basic option of necessary and effective incentives. But, absolute performance-related rewards have two drawbacks.

# There will be people who cheat
# Vulnerable to recessions or sudden growth

=== Design contracts for multiple employees ===
Source:

Considering absolute performance-related compensation is a popular way for employers to design contracts for more than one employee at a time, and one of the most widely accepted methods in practical economics.

There are also other forms of absolute rewards linked to employees&#x27; performance. For example, dividing employees into groups and rewarding the whole group based on the overall performance of each group. But one drawback of this method is that some people will fish in troubled waters while others are working hard, so that they will be rewarded together with the rest of the group. It is better to set the reward mechanism as the competitive competition, and obtain higher rewards through better performance.

=== Information elicitation ===
A particular kind of a principal-agent problem is when the agent can compute the value of an item that belongs to the principal (e.g. an assessor can compute the value of the principal&#x27;s car), and the principal wants to incentivize the agent to compute and report the true value.

It is a geographically strategic city located in the Liaoxi Corridor, which connects most of the land transports between North China and Northeast China, and is the economic center of western Liaoning.

The total area under the jurisdiction of Jinzhou is , most of which is rural.

==History==

Jinzhou is an ancient city with over a thousand years of history. Originally known as Tuhe (), it was part of Yan in the Warring States period. Under the Qin dynasty, the majority of what is now Jinzhou became part of Liaodong Commandery. It was part of Changli Commandery in the province of Youzhou during the Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms periods, but fell under the jurisdiction of Yingzhou in the Beiwei, Dongwei, and Beiqi periods, before becoming part of Liucheng Commandery and then Yan Prefecture during the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty. During the Tang, it was the seat of the Andong Protectorate.

The name &quot;Jinzhou&quot; came into use in the Liao dynasty, when it belonged to Zhongjing prefecture. In the Jin dynasty, it was part of Dongjing Prefecture and Beijing Prefecture. It belonged to Liaoyang Xingzhongshu in the Mongol Empire/Yuan dynasty and to Liaodong township in the Ming dynasty. It was ruled by Tianfu during the Qing dynasty, when its name was changed from Jinzhou to Jinxian. It is also known in English as Chinhsien and Chinchow.
During the Republican period, Jinzhou was attached to Liaoning Province. When the Chinese Civil War resumed in 1945, Jinzhou was the site of a major battle between the Communist and Nationalist forces, since it is where the main route from Manchuria through Shanhai Pass enters central China. Its capture on 22 November 1945, by Nationalist forces under Du Yuming forced the Communists to agree to a temporary ceasefire that lasted several months.

During the Liaoshen campaign, in which the People&#x27;s Liberation Army began to consolidate control of Northeast China, refugees tried to escape to the city to flee further south. The Republic of China Army, under orders from Chiang Kai-shek not to allow refugees to escape the region, shot at them as they tried to cross the Daling River 30 kilometers north of the city. The Communists commanded by Lin Biao captured the city in September 1948.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Liaoxi Province was founded and Jinzhou became its provincial capital. Jinzhou came back under the administration of Liaoning Province in 1954, when Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces re-merged.

== Geography and climate==

Jinzhou is located in the southwestern portion of Liaoning, and borders Panjin, Anshan, and Shenyang to the east, and Huludao on the west. The city&#x27;s southern coast is the Liaodong Bay. On the north are Chaoyang and Fuxin.

Jinzhou has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), with four distinct seasons; winters are cold but very dry while summers are hot and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from to in July, with the annual mean being . The annual average precipitation is between , the majority of which usually occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45% in July to 68% in three months, the city receives 2,682 hours of bright sunshine annually, with autumn and winter being especially sunny.

Fossil-bearing rocks are exposed in the city&#x27;s vicinity, including the Yixian Formation. A genus of Early Cretaceous birds has been named &quot;Jinzhouornis&quot; in honor of the locality, but it appears to be a junior synonym of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; which was found in the same formation some years earlier.

== Administration ==
Jinzhou has eight immediate sub-municipal divisions:

The above eight are subdivided into 43 towns, 69 townships, and 1680 villages.

== Economy ==
Jinzhou has a wide range of industries. Major traditional industries include petrochemistry, metallurgy, textiles, pharmacy and building materials.

It is among the first province-level development zones approved by Liaoning Province. The development zone enjoys convenient transportation with easy access to Jinzhou Seaport, Jinzhou airport and several state highways.

The most popular way to get around Jinzhou is on foot or by bicycle. Taxis crowd the streets and start at 6 RMB per trip. Bus routes also blanket the city and provide the most economical means of transportation, but are not always reliable.

== Military ==
Jinzhou is headquarters of the 40th Group Army of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, one of the three group armies that comprise the Shenyang Military Region responsible for defending China&#x27;s northeastern borders with Russia and North Korea.

== Tourism ==

The Liaoshen Campaign Memorial () commemorates the Liaoshen Campaign of 1948. It is a large museum that holds and displays over 16,000 pieces of equipment used during the campaign, including rifles, machine guns, mortars, cannons, and tanks. It also holds thousands of pictures and documents. The best known exhibit inside the museum is the Panoramic Picture Hall, which reproduces the complete Battle of Jinzhou on a rotating circular screen.

Yiwulü Mountain is located in the west of Beizhen City of Jinzhou. It is one of the three sacred mountains in Northeast China. Wanghai Mountain is the main peak, with a height of 867 meters above the sea level, and tourist spots such as Beizhen Temple, Shenshui Bridge, Fish Pool, Guanyin Pavilion, Sijiao Pavilion, Kuangguang Pavilion, Lotus Stone, Cloud Pass and Wanghai Temple are scattered throughout the mountain range.

Mount Bijia is an island in the Bohai Sea south of Jinzhou on which is located a Chinese Buddhist temple. During most of the day, Mount Bijia can only be accessed by boat, but when the tide wanes, a natural causeway connects Mount Bijia to the mainland. People can walk to Mount Bijia from the seafront on foot and local people have named this natural wonder &quot;Tian Qiao&quot;, (&quot;lit&quot;: Sky Bridge). On the top of the mountain there is a tall stone pavilion, which resembles a gigantic pen resting on a pen holder, hence the name &quot;Bijiashan&quot;, meaning the &quot;Pen Holder Mountain&quot;.

Guangji Pagoda (): The Guangji Pagoda is located in Guta Park situated at the heart of Jinzhou. The 72-meter-tall tower is an example of beautiful Liao-style architecture, with thirteen levels in an octagonal shape. A quiet temple beneath completes the ancient Chinese setting. Visitors will see locals gather for early morning rituals, exercise and various other activities. There is no fee for admission to the temple grounds.

<doc id="296783" wikidata="Q555329" url="?curid=296783" title="Robert Surcouf">
<text>Robert Surcouf (; 12 December 1773 – 8 July 1827) was a French privateer, businessman and slave trader who operated in the Indian Ocean from 1789 to 1808 during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Capturing over 40 prizes, he later amassed a large fortune from a variety of commercial activities, such as ship-owning, privateering, slave trading and owning land.

Surcouf started his maritime career as an officer on the ships &quot;Aurore&quot;, &quot;Courrier d&#x27;Afrique&quot; and &quot;Navigateur&quot;. Having risen to the rank of captain, he illegally engaged in slave trading onboard the slave ship &quot;Créole&quot;. Surcouf then captained the merchantman &quot;Émilie&quot;, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a letter of marque. He preyed on British shipping, capturing several merchantmen including the East Indiaman &quot;Triton&quot;, before returning to the Isle de France where his prizes were confiscated. Surcouf then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government. Returning to the Indian Ocean, Surcouf captained the privateers &quot;Clarisse&quot; and &quot;Confiance&quot;, raiding British, American, and Portuguese shipping. He captured the East Indiaman on 7 October 1800. Returning to France, Surcouf was awarded the Legion of Honour and settled down as a businessman.

He briefly returned to the Indian Ocean in 1807 on the corvette &quot;Revenant&quot; before returning to France. There, Surcouf sponsored privateers and merchantmen, including slave ships. His privateers led campaigns against British trade in the Indian Ocean and the English Channel. The cutter &quot;Renard&quot;, a ship of his, achieved fame in her victory over on 9 September 1812, with &quot;Alphea&quot; exploding after repulsing French attempts at boarding her. After the Bourbon Restoration in France, Surcouf organised fishing expeditions to Newfoundland and amassed a considerable fortune. He died in 1827 and was buried in Saint-Malo.

==Career==

===Youth===
Robert Surcouf was born 12 December 1773 in Saint-Malo to a family of ship-owners. His father, Charles-Ange Surcouf de Boisgris, was the grandson of Robert Surcouf de Maisonneuve, who had captained the privateer &quot;Aimable&quot; during the reign of Louis XIV. On his mother&#x27;s side, Robert was a distant relative of René Duguay-Trouin. When his parents sent him to Dinan college to become a priest, he fled at age thirteen to enlist on the merchantman &quot;Héron&quot;, which shuttled between Saint-Malo and Cadiz.

On 3 March 1789, he enlisted as a volunteer on the 700-ton &quot;Aurore&quot;, a slave ship bound for India under Captain Tardivet. &quot;Aurore&quot; sailed to Pondicherry and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on the Horn of Africa, &quot;Aurore&quot; was wrecked in the Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 enslaved Africans chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portuguese &quot;San Antoine&quot; in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of the weather, and only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of Pondicherry. Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the &quot;Courrier d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his new ship, &quot;Revanche&quot;. On &quot;Revanche&quot;, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar.

Surcouf enlisted as a helmsman on the French Royal Navy&#x27;s 20-gun fluyt &quot;Bienvenue&quot;, under Lieutenant Haumont, bound for France. &quot;Bienvenue&quot; arrived at Lorient on 2 January 1792, where Surcouf discovered the political changes France had undergone in the wake of the French Revolution.

After six months, Surcouf enlisted as a lieutenant on the slave ship &quot;Navigateur&quot;, under Captain Lejoliff. She departed on 27 August 1792 for Mozambique before sailing to Isle de France, where Surcouf was informed on his arrival of the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Rising to the rank of captain, Surcouf took command of the brig &quot;Créole&quot;, a four-gun slave ship. He departed Isle de France on 3 June 1794 for a journey off Africa and Madagascar, and engaged again in slave trading, even though it had been prohibited by the National Convention and the Assembly of Île Bourbon. Upon his return to Isle de France, agents of the Committee of Public Safety inspected &quot;Créole&quot; for evidence of slave trading, but left empty-handed as Surcouf had already sold his enslaved cargo. When British naval forces arrived to blockade the Isle de France, he served as an auxiliary ensign on the 40-gun frigate &quot;Cybèle&quot; and participated in the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1794.

===Cruise of &quot;Émilie&quot; and capture of &quot;Triton&quot;===

In the spring in 1795, Surcouf took command of the 180-ton, privateer schooner &quot;Modeste&quot;, renamed &quot;Émilie&quot;, with a 32-man crew and four 6-pounder guns, armed by Malroux and Levaillant. Governor Malartic refused to provide a lettre de marque and ordered &quot;Émilie&quot; to go to the Seychelles to purchase tortoises as food for Isle de France.

&quot;Émilie&quot; departed on 3 September 1795 with a &quot;congé de navigation&quot; authorising her to defend herself, but not to take prizes as a privateer. The next day, she made a port call at Saint-Denis before cruising to Mahé. At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but he was able to evade them by sailing through the reefs, at night.

Surcouf then decided to sail to the Mergui Archipelago to load a rice cargo. On 8 December 1795, while in transit, cruising off the Ganges Delta, Surcouf captured his first prize, the ship &quot;Penguin&quot;, loaded with lumber, on which he detached a prize crew under Lieutenant Péru before sending her to Isle de France.

On 19 January 1796, Surcouf met the pilot ship &quot;Cartier&quot; leading two merchantmen, the &quot;Russel&quot; and &quot;Sambolasse&quot;, through the Ganges delta. He attacked and captured them, finding the merchantmen to be carrying rice. After detaching prize crews, Surcouf transferred his command, along with his remaining 22 crew members and &quot;Émilie″&quot;s four guns, to &quot;Cartier&quot;, which (according to Ambroise Louis Garneray) he renamed &quot;Hasard&quot;. Surcouf then sent &quot;Émilie&quot;, under Lieutenant Croizet, together with his prizes, to Isle de France.

On the night of 28 January, Surcouf captured the 12-gun &quot;Diana&quot;, loaded with 6000 bags of rice. The next day, &quot;Cartier&quot; met a 26-gun Indiaman, &quot;Triton&quot;, armed with 12-pounders and a 150-man crew; having decided to attack, and recognising only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent, Surcouf, feeling threatened and unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours at the very last moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, &quot;Triton&quot; suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including her captain, Captain Burnycat, and the first officer, Picket; The prisoners were transferred to &quot;Diana&quot;, which Surcouf released against a 30,000 rupee ransom.

Surcouf returned to Ile de France with his prizes, where he arrived on 10 March 1796, although &quot;Hasard&quot; was captured by HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; on the journey back. As &quot;Émilie&quot; had been armed as a merchant rather than a privateer, the Prize court seized her prizes and sold them for the benefit of the State, although their capture was declared to be legal. Surcouf returned to France to claim his prize money, and on 3 September 1797, the government finally granted him 660,000 francs, of which he only received 80,000.

===Cruise of &quot;Clarisse&quot;===

In early 1798, after 14 months in Paris, Surcouf took command of &quot;Clarisse&quot;, a 14-gun privateer brig armed with four 12-pounders, ten 8-pounders, and manned by a 120-strong complement. He departed from Paimboeuf, Nantes, in February 1798, this time with a proper lettre de marque. During the journey to Isle de France, &quot;Clarisse&quot; chased a British slave ship, which escaped after one of her shots cut off &quot;Clarisse&quot;″s foremast tops. Surcouf captured a British brig South of Cape of Good Hope, which surrendered after a warning shot was fired, on which he sent a prize crew under Captain Dujardin, and arrived La Réunion on 5 December.

In early 1799, Surcouf sailed to the city of Susoh in Aceh, on Sumatra, where he found two 20-gun merchantmen anchored in the harbour, in the process of loading pepper; &quot;Clarisse&quot; dropped anchor close by and opened fire, after which Surcouf sent his older brother Nicolas to head a 20-man board party on &quot;Clarisse&quot;″s boats and board the largest of the ships, while he boarded her with &quot;Clarisse&quot; from the opposite side; assaulted from two sides, she surrendered after a 30-minute battle. The other ship cut her anchor and attempted to flee, but the boats of &quot;Clarisse&quot; overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore. Surcouf returned to Île de France with his prizes in June.
On 16 August, &quot;Clarisse&quot; departed Isle de France for another cruise; she sailed to La Réunion carrying despatches of Malartic to the governor. She then cruised to Java to procure water, where she arrived on 27 September. On 1 October, Surcouf captured a Danish merchantman, which he sent away under Lieutenant Fonroc; on 4 November, the Portuguese merchantman &quot;Nostra Signora de la Conception&quot; carrying 116 000 piastres; on 6, a British ship laden with a salt; and on 11 November, the 20-gun &quot;Auspicious&quot;, with a cargo worth 1,032,580 francs.

Surcouf sailed to Mergui to purchase food and free his prisoners, and put to sail on 10 December. En route, he met the fellow French privateer &quot;Malartic&quot;, under Jean Dutertre; soon after, the privateers met a British frigate, 38-gun frigate HMS &quot;Sybille&quot;, which gave chase and which Surcouf managed to outsail by throwing eight guns overboard, along with various other implements.

On 1 January 1800, &quot;Clarisse&quot; captured a large rice-laden merchantman, the British &quot;James&quot;. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming a line of battle; although &quot;Clarisse&quot; lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape &quot;Sybille&quot; and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. &quot;Clarisse&quot; raked the rear-most ship, the &quot;Louisa&quot;, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, &quot;Mercury&quot;, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize &quot;Louisa&quot;, while &quot;Mercury&quot; escaped. &quot;Clarisse&quot; could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with &quot;Louisa&quot;. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed &quot;Louisa&quot; back to Port Louis.

&quot;Clarisse&quot; continued her patrol, capturing the ships &quot;Catherine&quot;, &quot;Haderbux&quot;, &quot;Anna Maria&quot;, &quot;Nostra Signora de la Cruz&quot;, &quot;Louis&quot;, &quot;Janna&quot;, &quot;Notre Dame de Bon Succès&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot;, before sailing back to Isle de France with her prizes. She arrived in early February 1800.

===Cruise of &quot;Confiance&quot; and capture of &quot;Kent&quot;===

In May 1800, Surcouf took command of &quot;Confiance&quot;, a fast 18-gun brig from Bordeaux, with a 150-man complement; the competition with Dutertre for the captainship of &quot;Confiance&quot; almost degenerated into a duel, and Governor Malartic had to intervene to prevent it, stating that such a confrontation would be &quot;an English victory&quot;. The sailor and painter Ambroise Louis Garneray, future biographer of Surcouf, enlisted at this time.

In late April 1800, &quot;Confiance&quot; cruised off Sunda Strait, where she captured an American ship; she then left the strait to avoid the frigate , which was known to cruise in these waters, and sailed to the Seychelles. There, he escaped a British ship of the line and a frigate, and sailed on to cruise the Bay of Bengal.

On 19 September, &quot;Confiance&quot; captured &quot;Prize&quot;, from Calcutta, which had stored eight of her ten guns in her hold to improve her stability. &quot;Prize&quot; was sent off to Mauritius on the next day with an 85-man prize crew. Surcouf then steered for Ganjam, where he captured three smaller ships.

On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, &quot;Confiance&quot; met the 40-gun East Indiaman &quot;Kent&quot;, of 824 tons burthen, under Captain Robert Rivington. &quot;Kent&quot; had rescued the crew of another ship, &quot;Queen&quot;, destroyed by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over an hour and a half of battle across the decks of the ship, seize control of the &quot;Kent&quot;.

The British had suffered fourteen killed, including the captain, and forty-four wounded, while the French suffered five killed and ten wounded. The privateers were then granted one hour of free pillaging on &quot;Kent&quot; before Surcouf restored order; however, the female passengers were strictly protected and sentries were placed in front of their apartments. Amongst the prisoners were General Frederick St. John and his wife, Arabella Craven.

The first officer of &quot;Confiance&quot;, Joachim Drieux, was sent on &quot;Kent&quot; with a 60-man prize crew, while her passengers were released on a merchantman that Surcouf stopped a few days later. &quot;Confiance&quot; and &quot;Kent&quot; arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port-Louis in November. The capture of &quot;Kent&quot; became a sensation, and the British Admiralty issued a reward for the capture of Surcouf.

After her return to Ile de France, &quot;Confiance&quot; was armed as a merchantman &quot;en aventurier&quot; with an 89-man crew and loaded with colonial goods for her return to France. On the journey, Surcouf still managed to capture a number of ships, notably the Portuguese &quot;Ebre&quot;, with eighteen 12-pounder carronades and a 60-man crew; he released her against a ransom of 10,000 piastres and after exchanging her greatmast with that of &quot;Confiance&quot;.

Upon her return, &quot;Confiance&quot; ran into the British blockade and was chased by a frigate; Surcouf managed to evade her by throwing overboard all but one of her guns, his boats, anchors, chains and even components of his masts. He eventually arrived at La Rochelle on 13 April 1801.

In France, Navy Minister Truguet attempted to enrol Surcouf in the Navy as an auxiliary officer, which he declined. Hennequin states that Bonaparte himself offered him the rank of Captain and the command of two frigates, which Surcouf declined for fear of losing his freedom of action, and awarded him a Sabre of honour. Surcouf was awarded the Legion of Honour at the founding of the Order, on 19 May 1802.
On 28 May, in Saint-Malo, he married Marie Blaize, who had been his fiancée for two years; over the course of their marriage, they had five children together. Around 1805, Surcouf started to arm privateers in Saint-Malo in partnership with his father-in-law Louis Blaize de Maisonneuve, notably &quot;Caroline&quot; which captured four ships in the Indian Ocean under Nicolas Surcouf; &quot;Marsouin&quot;; and &quot;Confiance&quot;, which took two prizes under Joseph Potier.

===Cruise of &quot;Revenant&quot;===

After a five-year retirement, in early 1807, Surcouf ordered the 18-gun &quot;Revenant&quot;, a privateer which he had built on his own specifications. On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew to cruise off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, &quot;Revenant&quot; captured the British slave ship &quot;Aun&quot;, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.

Surcouf arrived at Île de France in June, slipping past the British blockade and capturing several ships on the journey. During the subsequent campaign, which was to be his last, Surcouf captured 16 British merchantmen, partly because they tended to strike their colours as soon as they realised their opponent was Surcouf.

The arrival of Surcouf at Isle de France did not go unnoticed: the authorities and the population reacted with enthusiasm, while British insurance companies on Calcutta doubled the reward for his capture, which amounted to one lakh of rupees, or 250,000 francs. On 3 September 1807, &quot;Revenant&quot; departed to cruise off Bengal. On 25 September, she captured the British 12-gun &quot;Trafalgar&quot; carrying 10,000 bags of rice, and the 14-gun &quot;Mangles&quot;, carrying 11,000; on the 27th, the 12-gun &quot;Admiral Applin&quot;, with 9,500 bags of rice; on 1 October, the 1-gun &quot;Suzannah&quot;, with 5,500 bags of rice; on the 19th, the wood-laden &quot;Success&quot;, which was burnt; on the 30th, the 12-gun &quot;Fortune&quot;, which carried no cargo and was sunk; on 15 November, the Indian &quot;Macauly&quot;; on 18 December, the British 10-gun &quot;Sir William Burroughs&quot;; on the 30th, the Portuguese &quot;Oriente&quot;; and on 6 January 1808, the Arab &quot;Jem lab Dim&quot;. Surcouf sent these with prize crews to Isle de France, and then returned himself on 31 January 1808.

When a British captive officer taunted Surcouf with the words &quot;You French fight for money while we fight for honour&quot;, Surcouf replied &quot;Each of us fights for what he lacks most&quot;.

Surcouf then gave command of &quot;Revenant&quot; to his first officer, Joseph Potier. After a short cruise, Potier returned with a 34-gun prize of the Portuguese East India Company, the &quot;Conceçáo de Santo Antonio&quot;, captured after a one-hour fight.

On 4 July 1808, General Charles Decaen, governor of Isle de France, requisitioned &quot;Revenant&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Iéna&quot;, and commissioned under Lieutenant Morice, with &quot;Lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Albin Roussin as second officer. Surcouf had an altercation with Decaen but had to renounce his ship. He eventually purchased &quot;Sémillante&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Charles&quot;. Returning with this vessel to Saint-Malo, he arrived on 4 February 1809.

===Later life===

From 1809, Surcouf went into business as ship-owner, and over the years, he equipped a number of privateers: , under Pelletier; &quot;Dorade&quot;; &quot;Biscayenne&quot;; &quot;Édouard&quot;; &quot;Espadon&quot;; &quot;Ville-de-Caen&quot;; and his last, , under Leroux. The British captured all the privateers sent into the Channel, with the exception of &quot;Renard&quot;. Surcouf also built the brig &quot;Fantôme&quot; at St. Malo in 1809. Surcouf dispatched &quot;Fantôme&quot; to Isle de France (Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean on her first voyage where the brig took three prizes but was captured by the British in 1810 and commissioned into British service as HMS &quot;Fantome&quot;.

In January 1814, Surcouf was made a colonel in the National Guard of Saint-Malo. During the Hundred Days, he served as a chief of Legion and maintained order. He resigned after the Battle of Waterloo and became a merchant, arming 19 merchantmen and establishing business with Newfoundland.

Between 1814 and 1827, Surcouf organised over 116 commercial expeditions. In 1815, Surcouf engaged in the slave trade, commissioning the ship &quot;Africain&quot; to transport enslaved Africans from Gabon. &quot;Africain&quot; conducted another slave trading journey in 1819. Four other expeditions are also suspected of having been slaving runs: that of &quot;Marie-Anne&quot; in 1819, &quot;Adolphe&quot; in 1820, and in 1821 &quot;Victor&quot; and &quot;Adolphe&quot;, under René Decaen and with Désiré Surcouf as first officer, which sailed under the pretence of sailing to Isle Bourbon (now Réunion), but actually to ferry slaves to Cuba and Philadelphia.

Surcouf died on 8 July 1827, and was buried in Saint-Malo graveyard with military honours. His tomb features a globe showing the Indian Ocean and an anchor, with the epitaph:
==Legacy==

Five ships of the French Navy were named after Surcouf, the first three being a steam aviso (sloop), an armoured cruiser, and a submarine cruiser, which at the time of her launch was the largest submarine in the world. The submarine joined the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War and disappeared mysteriously after liberating Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. The fourth &quot;Surcouf&quot; was a large fleet escort destroyer, which was severely damaged in a collision with a Soviet ship, and the fifth is a modern stealth frigate, one of the first stealth combat ships.

=== Statue in Tribute ===

Ships of the French Navy named Surcouf

A number of legends have grown around Surcouf, he is often stated to have been made a Baron of the Empire, which is untrue. Another legend states that Surcouf had thrown overboard gold seized on &quot;Kent&quot; but &quot;Kent&quot; did not carry gold.

There is a tale that in 1816, Surcouf challenged twelve Prussian officers to a duel and defeated all of them except for the last, which he let go &quot;to tell in his country how a former soldier of Napoleon fights&quot;; this story is a fabrication.

<doc id="296785" wikidata="Q3547414" url="?curid=296785" title="USS Essex (1856)">
<text>USS &quot;Essex&quot; was a 1000-ton ironclad river gunboat of the United States Army and later United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was named by her captain, William Porter, for his father&#x27;s old sailing frigate, the USS Essex. This &quot;Essex&quot; was originally constructed in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana as a steam-powered ferry named &quot;New Era&quot;.

==Service in Tennessee==
In September 1861 &quot;New Era&quot; was purchased by the United States Army for use in its Western Gunboat Flotilla and was modified into a 355-ton timberclad gunboat. In November 1861 USS &quot;New Era&quot; took part in an expedition up the Cumberland River. Shortly thereafter she was renamed USS &quot;Essex&quot; and received an upgrade to iron armor and various other alterations. On 11 January 1862, USS &quot;Essex&quot; engaged Confederate States Navy gunboats near Lucas Bend, Missouri. On 6 February 1862, she took part in the attack on Fort Henry, Tennessee and was badly damaged by Confederate gunfire.

==Battling the CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot;==

Commanding officer William D. Porter upgraded his ship without official authorization into an ironclad gunboat. Under his orders she was lengthened, widened, and completely reengineered, and her appearance was changed drastically. New, more powerful, engines were put in place and she was rearmored. After her upgrade &quot;Essex&quot; took part in operations near Vicksburg, Mississippi. On 15 July 1862, USS &quot;Essex&quot; was engaged with CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; as that ship successfully ran past the Union fleets in front of the city. On 23 July, &quot;Essex&quot; unsuccessfully attacked the &quot;Arkansas&quot; at her moorings but was repelled by the &quot;Arkansas&quot; and the shore guns under whose protection the &quot;Arkansas&quot; lay. Federal forces withdrew from Vicksburg shortly thereafter. After withdrawing, &quot;Essex&quot; joined Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s squadron and was the only Federal ironclad on the lower Mississippi River. On 5 August 1862, &quot;Essex&quot; helped repel a Confederate Army attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

On 6 August, the &quot;Essex&quot; once again engaged CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; as that vessel attempted to relieve the beleaguered Confederates attacking Baton Rouge. As &quot;Essex&quot; approached, the steering mechanism of the &quot;Arkansas&quot; jammed and her crew was forced to scuttle her due to the presence of the &quot;Essex&quot;.

==Transfer to the Navy==
In October 1862 the &quot;Essex&quot; was transferred from the Army to the United States Navy. She was involved in the bombardment of Port Hudson, Louisiana and assisted during the occupation of Baton Rouge. In May–July 1863 under the command of Robert Townsend she participated in the siege and capture of Port Hudson. USS &quot;Essex&quot; took part in the Red River Campaign of March–May 1864.

In December 1864, the USS &quot;Essex&quot; was in Memphis, Tennessee. According to David Redrick, the Rear Admiral&#x27;s cook, some of the boat&#x27;s crew &quot;slipped ashore at night&quot; and &quot;got on a spree&quot;. Boatswain William Bernard Dolen, age 33, was part of a detail sent ashore to &quot;arrest the boys&quot;. During the arrest, he was stabbed in the right chest by a fellow seaman, and was honorably discharged for disability due to the chronicity of the wound, from which he later died in 1878.

==After the war==
&quot;Essex&quot; was decommissioned in July 1865. She was sold in November 1865 and reverted to the civilian name &quot;New Era&quot;. She was scrapped in 1870. USS &quot;Essex&quot; had the reputation as one of the most active gunboats on the Mississippi River, despite her relatively weak armor. It often was damaged in actions.

<text>Moss Icon is an American post-hardcore band formed in late 1986 in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. Its original lineup comprised vocalist Jonathan Vance, guitarist Tonie Joy, bassist Monica DiGialleonardo, and drummer Mark Laurence. Alex Badertscher joined as second guitarist in 1990. Moss Icon is considered to be an early influence on the hardcore punk splinter genre known as post-hardcore, as well as on the eventual development of emo, although the band members themselves have repeatedly denied knowingly contributing to the latter genre in any way.

==History and background==
===Formation to breakup===
The band&#x27;s identifying characteristics, and those that distinguished them from their contemporaries, included noticeable and abrupt transitions from loud to quiet, and Vance&#x27;s esoteric, stream of conscious lyrical content. Earlier recordings of the band are reminiscent of early Joy Division, while later songs embodied a less blunt approach with more exploratory arrangements and riffage. Vance&#x27;s lyrics touched upon vaguely, among other issues, the plight of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and opposed the U.S. government&#x27;s involvement in Nicaragua and Guatemala.

The band played frequently with fellow Annapolis band The Hated. Moss Icon recorded their debut 7&quot;, &quot;Hate in Me&quot;, in January 1988, and entered the studio several months later to record their second 7&quot;, &quot;Mahpiua Luta&quot;. Their &quot;Lyburnum Wits End Liberation Fly&quot; LP was recorded by Les Lentz (who engineered all of their studio recordings) throughout 1988 but was not released until mid-1994, three years after the band&#x27;s break-up, by Vermiform Records. Moss Icon&#x27;s third 7&quot;, entitled &quot;Memorial&quot;, was recorded in January 1991 along with a split LP with Silver Bearing. In 1994 Ebullition Records released the &quot;It Disappears&quot; LP, compiling songs from &quot;Memorial&quot; with live versions of several songs.

In 1990 a splinter project of Moss Icon was formed called Breathing Walker, containing all four members of Moss Icon plus Alex Badertscher on bass, Zak Fusciello on percussion, and Tim Horner on violin. Breathing Walker released a cassette that was re-released on vinyl and CD in 2001 by the Vermin Scum label, along with live tracks.

===Post-breakup and 2001 reformation===
After the dissolution of Moss Icon, guitarist Tonie Joy was a member of the bands Universal Order of Armageddon, Born Against, and The Convocation Of... (later christened The Convocation). Other band members were less involved in music, excepting Laurence&#x27;s drums in Lava, DiGialleonardo&#x27;s Blue Condors, and Vance&#x27;s solo debut LP.

Moss Icon reunited to play two shows with Zak Fusciello on drums, one at the 2001 More Than Music Fest in Columbus, Ohio and the other at the renovated Charles Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland.

===Recent activity===
In July 2008, Moss Icon was named one of the &quot;23 Bands Who Shaped Punk&quot; by &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine in issue No. 240. Vance&#x27;s first officially released book &quot;Tulip Has a Room&quot; was published by Easysubcult.

Since 2007 Joy, Vance, Zak Fusciello, and Alex Badertscher have been occasionally working on new material in Baltimore, MD for a possible new recording. A discography was released in May 2012 on Temporary Residence Limited which featured two discs, photos and lyrics. The band also played a couple live shows (NYC and Washington DC) in December 2014.

A 30th anniversary edition of &quot;Lyburnum Wits&quot; was released by Temporary Residence Limited.
==Notable album art==
Although neither Tonie Joy nor Jonathan Vance recall the specifics of how they discovered the iconic image for their full length &quot;Lyburnum Wits End Liberation Fly&quot; LP, its origin can be traced to a 1971 Scientific American article, which includes an illustration depicting a figure of a warrior modeled in clay is from the final period of occupation at Tepe Yahyii, when a Sassanian military outpost stood on the top of the mound from sometime in the third century B.C. to about A.D. 400. Thereafter only nomads visited the dead city.&quot; Tepe Yahya, midway between Mesopotamia and India, was a busy center of trade 5,500 years ago. An outpost of Mesopotamian urban culture, it played a key role in the spread of civilization from west to east.

<text>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) annually hosted the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards for multimedia entertainment between 1998 and 2002. In 2003, BAFTA announced the award would be split into two separate ceremonies – [[BAFTA Interactive Awards]] and [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Games Awards]] – to take place in February the following year.

The 2004 ceremonies were held on 1 and 2 March 2005, after which the Interactive Awards were quietly retired, leaving only the Games Awards to return in October 2006.

<doc id="296811" wikidata="Q1515082" url="?curid=296811" title="Indian Summer (American band)">
<text>Indian Summer was an American emo band from Oakland, California. 

== History ==
The band was created after the band Sinker broke up, and consisted of twin brothers Adam and Seth Nanaa, Marc Bianchi, and Eyad Kaileh, who replaced Dan Bradley early on due to commitment issues. They named their band after a Doors song from the 1970 album Morrison Hotel.

The band released a 7-inch EP, three splits with Current, Embassy and Ordination of Aaron, appeared in two compilations, and played nearly 100 gigs before disbanding. &quot;Science 1994&quot;, a compilation of Indian Summer&#x27;s discography, was released in 2002 and &quot;Hidden Arithmetic&quot;, an entirely live album consisting of one live set and a live radio broadcast, was released in 2006, both on the Future Recordings label.

&quot;AllMusic&quot; described Indian Summer as &quot;one of the more exciting and influential bands in a crop of underground acts that defined an obscure but inspired era of American emo.&quot; &quot;Science 1994&quot; was named as the 37th best emo album by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

A compilation of their entire studio discography titled &quot;Giving Birth to Thunder&quot; was released by The Numero Group in 2019. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named the release a &quot;Best New Reissue&quot; in September 2019. 

In an Reddit AMA in 2024, Kaileh revealed that the former members had been offered to reunited by Numero for the release of &quot;Giving Birth to Thunder&quot;, but the former members couldn&#x27;t agree on it and the plan fell through. 

== Influences ==
The band was influenced by many of their contemporaries, including Rites of Spring, Moss Icon, Slint, and Fugazi. Kaileh&#x27;s drumming was specifically influenced by the likes of Man Is the Bastard, Econochrist, Neurosis, and Miles Davis.

<text>Jonathan Dayton (October 16, 1760October 9, 1824) was an American Founding Father and politician from New Jersey. At 26, he was the youngest person to sign the Constitution of the United States. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1791 and later served from 1795 to 1799 as its third Speaker. He left the House in 1799 after being elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served one term. Dayton was arrested in 1807 for alleged treason in connection with Aaron Burr&#x27;s conspiracy to establish an independent country in the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. He was exonerated by a grand jury, but his national political career never recovered.

==Biography==
Jonathan Dayton was born in Elizabethtown (now known as Elizabeth), New Jersey. He was the son of Elias Dayton, a merchant prominent in local politics who had served as a militia officer in the French and Indian War, and his wife the former Hannah Rolfe. He graduated from the local academy, run by Tapping Reeve and Francis Barber, where he was classmates with Alexander Hamilton. He then attended the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University). He left college in 1775 to fight in the American Revolutionary War and received an honorary degree in 1776.

==Military career==
Dayton was 15 at the outbreak of the war in 1775 and served under his father in the 3rd New Jersey Regiment as an ensign. On January 1, 1777, he was commissioned a lieutenant and served as paymaster. He saw service under General George Washington, fighting in the battles of Brandywine Creek and Germantown. He remained with Washington at Valley Forge and helped push the British from their position in New Jersey into the safety of New York City. In October 1780, Dayton and an uncle were captured by Loyalists, who held them captive for the winter before releasing them in the following year. Dayton again served under his father in the New Jersey Brigade. On March 30, 1780, at age 19, he was promoted to the rank of captain and transferred to the 2nd New Jersey Regiment, where he took part in the Battle of Yorktown. The Revolutionary War pension records indicate that he served as aide-de-camp to General John Sullivan on his expedition against the Indians from May 1 to November 30, 1779.

At the close of the Revolutionary War, Dayton was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of New Jersey. On July 19, 1799, Dayton was offered a commission as major general in the Provisional United States Army, but he declined.

==Legal and political career==
After the war, Dayton studied law and opened a practice, dividing his time between land speculation, law, and politics. After serving as a New Jersey delegate to the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention (of which he was the youngest member, at age 26), he became a prominent Federalist legislator. He was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly in 1786–1787, and again in 1790, and served in the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) in 1789.

Dayton was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789, but he did not take his seat until he was re-elected in 1791. He served as speaker for the Fourth and Fifth Congresses. Like most Federalists, he supported the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton, and he helped organize the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. He supported the Louisiana Purchase and opposed the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801.

Wealthy from his heavy investments in Ohio, Dayton lent money to Aaron Burr, becoming involved by association in the alleged conspiracy in which Burr was accused of intending to conquer parts of what is now the Southwestern United States. Dayton was exonerated, but his association with Burr effectively ended his political career.

==Late life and family==
Dayton married Susan Williamson in 1779 and had two daughters.

Dayton died on October 9, 1824 in his hometown. He was interred in an unmarked grave that is now under the St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which replaced an original church in 1860. Shortly before Dayton&#x27;s death, Lafayette visited him, as reported in an obituary in the &quot;Columbian Centinel&quot; on October 20, 1824: &quot;In New-Jersey, Hon. JONATHAN DAYTON, formerly Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and a Hero of the Revolution. When the Nation&#x27;s Guest lately passed New-Jersey, he passed the night with General Dayton, and such were the exertions of this aged and distinguished federalist, to honor the Guest, and gratify the wishes of his fellow citizens to see, that he sunk under them; and expired, without regret, a few days after.&quot;

==Commemoration and legacy==
The city of Dayton, Ohio, was named after him. While he never visited the area, he was a signatory to the Constitution and, at the time the city of Dayton was established in 1796, he owned (in partnership with Arthur St. Clair, James Wilkinson and Israel Ludlow) 250,000 acres (1,011 km2) in the Great Miami River basin. The Jonathan Dayton High School in Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey, the Dayton neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, Dayton Street in Madison, Wisconsin, and Dayton, New Jersey, are named in his honor.

<doc id="296815" wikidata="Q1201857" url="?curid=296815" title="Yazoo River">
<text>The Yazoo River is a river in the U.S. states of Louisiana and Mississippi. It is considered by some to mark the southern boundary of what is called the Mississippi Delta, a broad floodplain that was cultivated for cotton plantations before the American Civil War. It has continued to be devoted to large-scale agriculture.

==History==
The Yazoo River was named by French explorer La Salle in 1682 as &quot;Rivière des Yazous&quot; in reference to the Yazoo tribe living near the river&#x27;s mouth at its confluence with the Mississippi. The exact meaning of the term is unclear. One long held belief is that it means &quot;river of death&quot;.

The river is 188 miles (303 km) long and is formed by the confluence of the Tallahatchie and the Yalobusha rivers, where present-day Greenwood developed. The river parallels the Mississippi River in the latter&#x27;s floodplain for some distance before joining it north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Natural levees which flank the Mississippi prevent the Yazoo from joining it before Vicksburg. A &quot;yazoo stream&quot; is a hydrologic term that was coined to describe any river or major stream with similar characteristics. Potamologists believe the Yazoo River had its origins as the lower Ohio River.

The French (and later the Anglo-American settlers) historically called the surrounding area of Mississippi and Alabama the Yazoo lands, after the river. This became the basis for naming the Yazoo Land Scandal of the late 18th and early 19th century.

The river was of major importance during the American Civil War. The Confederates used the first electrically detonated underwater mine in the river in 1862 near Vicksburg to sink the Union ironclad USS &quot;Cairo&quot;. The last section of the &quot;Cairo&quot; was raised on December 12, 1964. It has been restored and is now on permanent display to the public at the Vicksburg National Military Park. There are 29 sunken ships from the Civil War beneath the waters of the river. The steamer &quot;Dew Drop&quot; was reportedly sunk near Roebuck Lake as an obstruction to the United States Navy, but Union sources claim the vessel was captured and burned.

Variant names of the Yazoo River include Zasu River, Yazous River, Yahshoo River, &quot;Rivière des Yasoux&quot;, and &quot;Fiume del Yasous&quot;.

In 1876, the Mississippi River changed its course, shifting west several miles and leaving Vicksburg without a river front. In 1902, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers diverted the Yazoo River into the old river bed, forming the Yazoo Diversion Canal. The modern-day port of Vicksburg is still located on this canal. Commercial navigation of the Yazoo River has declined considerably since the 1990s and is mainly concentrated on the section from Vicksburg to Yazoo City.

At Long Lake, Mississippi, the river measures 18,486 cubic feet per second.

<text>USS &quot;Gyatt&quot; (DD-712/DDG-1/DDG-712) was a of the United States Navy operated between 1945 and 1968. The ship was named for Edward Gyatt, a United States Marine Corps private and Marine Raider killed during the Battle of Guadalcanal. She was laid down in 1944, commissioned in 1945, and missed combat during the Second World War. In 1955, she was converted into the world&#x27;s first guided missile destroyer (DDG) to evaluate the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile and the practicality of similar weapons.

Her service contributed to the development of dedicated air-defense missile escorts and of later anti-air missiles by identifying flaws in both designs. Her goal was completed in 1962, and she was converted into a floating test bed for radars and other electronic equipment. By 1969, structural issues caused by missile launches forced her to be decommissioned and later sunk as a target in 1970.

==Namesake==
Edward Earl Gyatt was born on 4 September 1921 in Syracuse, New York, and later enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942. Private Gyatt served with the 1st Marine Raider Battalion during the Battle of Tulagi, part of the initial landings of the Guadalcanal campaign. He went ashore on Tulagi on 7 August 1942 and reported the approach of a Japanese counterattack that night. He remained at his post and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese force before he was killed by a hand grenade. For his actions, Gyatt was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. The first ship named after the private was DE-550, a &quot;John C. Butler&quot;-class destroyer escort that was canceled before construction began.

== Design and construction ==

=== Development ===
During World War II, the &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers were the main destroyers operated by the US Navy. Yet by 1943, the force had already identified methods to improve the design based on combat experience and further study. To maintain mass-production, a vast majority of the old design was retained aside from several details. The most obvious change was the consolidation of the main battery from five single gun turrets to three twin dual mounted turrets, thereby adding one gun barrel with half the turrets, which freed up immense space on and below deck. This design entered service as the &quot;Allen M. Sumner-&quot;class. Towards the last stages of the Pacific War, destroyers were faced with increasingly distant voyages and faster ships in need of escorting. To rectify this, the &quot;Sumner&quot;-class design was lengthened by to add greater range and cruising speed. The resulting design became the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class, the most advanced US destroyer class of the war. 

=== Design ===
The &quot;Sumner&quot; and &quot;Gearing&quot;-classes were the most heavily armed US destroyers of the war. Her main weapons were the aforementioned three twin 5&quot;/38 dual purpose guns, which allowed her to engage air, land, or sea targets at an average of 15 rounds a minute per barrel. While it was planned that she would have carried two quintuple 21-inch torpedo tube mounts, one was removed to make room for more anti-air guns. Due to the constant threat of enemy aircraft and Kamikazes, her nominal anti-air battery was enlarged to include 16 Bofors 40mm guns in quad and twin mounts and an additional twenty 20 mm Oerlikon guns on dual ad-hoc mounts. To engage submarines, she was also fitted with 2 depth charge tracks and 6 depth charge projectors.

==== Characteristics ====
She had a overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of , giving her a displacement of 2,425 tons and a fully loaded displacement at 3,479 tons. Four Babcock &amp; Wilcox steam boilers produced and a top speed of through two propellers. Her extended hull allowed her to carry 160 more tons of fuel than &quot;Sumner&quot;-class ships, increasing her cruising range by 30% to approximately 4,500 miles (7,200 km). Most ships of her class were manned by a crew of 345. She was laid down at the Federal Shipbuilding yard in Kearny, New Jersey, on 7 September 1944. She was launched on 15 April 1945 and commissioned on 2 July of the same year by the namesake&#x27;s mother.

==Service history==
=== Early history ===
Following a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, &quot;Gyatt&quot; was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, where she conducted patrols along the East Coast. She also participated in training exercises in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, visiting several South American ports to demonstrate American naval presence. In 1946, she was reassigned to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, where she regularly operated in the region and the North Atlantic for the next several years.

=== DDG ===
Since World War II, the primary role of destroyers and screening ships in a carrier fleet had been to provide air defense. Following this doctrine, the US Navy began developing new escort ships in the early 1950s, equipping them with advanced surface-to-air missile systems that promised greater effectiveness than older weapons. However, many of these new weapons, such as the RIM&quot;-2&quot; Terrier, were still unproven for use on small destroyers. &quot;Gyatt&quot; was chosen to be fitted with a Terrier battery as a proof-of-concept for the weapon as they were slated for use on the upcoming &quot;Farragut&quot;-class destroyers. A weakness of early American guided missiles was a slow reaction time and difficulty engaging multiple targets, leaving ships susceptible to simultaneous attacks. It was hoped that having numerous small destroyers would mitigate the flaws, allowing a large number of Terriers to protect a carrier.
==== Terrier System ====
For her new role, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 26 September 1955 and was decommissioned on 31 October for conversion into the world&#x27;s first guided missile destroyer. Her entire aft - including a twin 5&quot;/38 gun and parts of the superstructure and upper deck - were removed. In their place was the Terrier launcher and a 14-missile magazine.

To fire, the launcher would align itself along the centerline and with the magazine deckhouse. Inside was two cylindrical magazines that rotated the next missile into place, which allowed a loading arm to move each missile onto a rail and push it through a blast door and onto the launcher, achieving a reload speed of 2 missiles a minute. While the magazine took up the entire width of the ship, there was only space for 7 missiles per each arm of the launcher, greatly limiting &quot;Gyatt&quot;&#x27;s practicality in any engagement. Missiles of the era were powerful and sensitive, and there was major concern regarding an accidental detonation inside the exposed magazine. To mitigate the threat, it was fitted with blowout ducts and pipes while the inside was air-conditioned. With each launch also producing temperatures up to , the superstructure and deck was also reinforced with Special Treatment Steel to absorb the loads.

To manage the weapon, she was fitted a variation of the Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System. To identify incoming aircraft, she was the first ship in the Navy to be mounted with the AN/SPS-49 search radar. Once a target was identified, her MK 25 gun director would track the target with a radar beam, allowing a launched Terrier to hone into the aircraft. She was armed to fire the RIM-2A and RIM-2B Terriers, initial and immature models of the weapon that had a range of about , a flight ceiling of , and a top speed of Mach 2.

To keep the destroyer stable during missile launches, she was equipped with the Navy&#x27;s first stabilizer fins. The system consisted of two 45 square foot (4m2) retractable fins that extended out from midship below the waterline that mitigated the pitching and rolling produced by each launch. To compensate for the weight of the new systems, her remaining two Bofors were swapped with twin 3&quot;/50 caliber guns and her torpedo tubes were ripped out. In addition, the Navy wanted &quot;Gyatt&quot; and other anti-air escorts to be able to engage threats aside from aircraft. During the refit, she was also equipped with the most modern anti-submarine weapon suite available, which consisted of two MK 32 triple anti-submarine torpedo tubes and two Hedgehog depth charge projectors. Once refurbishment was complete, she was recommissioned in December 1956 and assigned the hull number DDG-712 as a guided missile destroyer.

==== Weapon experimentation ====

For the next three years, she was evaluated on various sailings along the Atlantic coast. In recognition of her novel position, her hull number was changed to DDG-1, signifying her as the first guided missile destroyer. She then sailed to join the 6th Fleet on 28 January 1960 and became the first DDG to deploy overseas. By the time of her arrival back in Charleston, her new home port on 31 August, &quot;Gyatt&quot; had trained with fleets throughout the Mediterranean. Upon her return, she joined the United States&#x27; space program. For several days in 1960 and 1961, she was stationed to recover nose-cones that fell to Earth from Project Mercury launches. As the Berlin Crisis inflamed Cold War tensions, she then joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean to serve as an American counterbalance. After her return home, she operated out of Charleston, South Carolina.

==== Legacy ====
Her main contributions during the decade was her use as a missile test bed. The ship&#x27;s various trainings demonstrated the &quot;Terrier&quot;&#x27;s application onboard escorts, seeing the system adopted to the Navy&#x27;s rapidly growing fleet of air-defense destroyer leaders. However, the battery proved to be too large for &quot;Gyatt&quot;&#x27;s small hull, as immense strain was placed on her electrical grid, little room was left for other systems or modifications, and the design itself was overtly complicated. The experience dissuaded further efforts to convert destroyers into air-defense missile ships, and the Navy instead opted to convert the rest of her class into modernized anti-submarine escorts as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. Her weapon tests also demonstrated the need for a smaller surface-to-air missile system, informing the development of the more compact RIM-24 Tartar, which was fitted on the next generation of guided missile destroyers. Issues regarding the Terrier were largely rectified with the larger &quot;Farragut&quot;-class destroyers as they were the first ships in the Navy built from the keel-up to provide missile air defense. With lessons in mind from &quot;Gyatt&quot;, the new ships displaced twice as much and carried two launchers and nearly three times as many missiles than her in better protected magazines. In the modern age, all destroyers are fitted with at least one kind of guided missile, especially in relations to air defense. 
=== Radar test ship ===

With her original goal fulfilled, she was retrofitted for service with the Operational Test and Evaluation Force in 1962. On 29 June, she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard to have her Terriers removed and a mast fitted on top of the old missile magazine. The purpose of the new mast was to carry electronics and other experimental equipment so they could be tested at sea. Now designated as a radar test ship, her hull number was reverted to DD-712. On 1 January 1963, she reported to Norfolk and operated with the Naval Electronics Facility and tested new technology, primarily radars and sensors, along the US East Coast and Caribbean.

===Sinking===
By the late 1960s, her hull began to crack from stress caused by the missile launches. As it was cheaper to prematurely dispose of her than fix the hull, she was transferred to the reserve fleet and homeported to Washington, D.C. in 1968. She was then stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 22 October 1969 and sunk as a target off Virginia on 11 June 1970.

<text>Alexander Campbell (12 September 1788 – 4 March 1866) was an Ulster Scots immigrant who became an ordained minister in the United States and joined his father Thomas Campbell as a leader of a reform effort that is historically known as the Restoration Movement, and by some as the &quot;Stone-Campbell Movement.&quot; It resulted in the development of non-denominational Christian churches, which stressed reliance on scripture and few essentials.

Campbell was influenced by similar efforts in Scotland, in particular, by James and Robert Haldane, who emphasized their interpretation of Christianity as found in the New Testament. In 1832, the group of reformers led by the Campbells merged with a similar movement that began under the leadership of Barton W. Stone in Kentucky. Their congregations identified as Disciples of Christ or Christian churches.

Several church groups have some historical ties with Campbell&#x27;s efforts. The three main groups are the Churches of Christ, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ. Additionally, there are the International Churches of Christ, the International Christian Church, the Churches of Christ in Australia, the Churches of Christ in Europe, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada. Campbell also founded Bethany College in what became Bethany, West Virginia.

==Early life and education==

Alexander Campbell was born 12 September 1788 near Ballymena, in the parish of Broughshane, County Antrim, Ireland. His parents were Thomas Campbell and Jane Corneigle Campbell, who were of Scots descent. Like his father, he was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he was greatly influenced by Scottish Enlightenment philosophy. He was also influenced by the English philosopher John Locke. 

In 1809 at the age of 21, Alexander emigrated to the United States with his mother and siblings from Scotland, to join his father Thomas, who had emigrated there in 1807. They sailed from Scotland on the &quot;Latonia&quot; on 3 August 1809 and landed in New York City on 29 September, then traveled overland to Philadelphia. They continued to western Pennsylvania, where the senior Campbell was serving as a minister in Washington County on the frontier. Alexander was ordained by his father&#x27;s Brush Run Church on 1 January 1812.

==Marriage and personal life==
The year before, Campbell had married Margaret Brown on 12 March 1811. Margaret&#x27;s father John Brown owned a significant amount of land in the Bethany, Virginia, area (now in West Virginia). The couple resided in what is now known as the Alexander Campbell Mansion near Bethany, and had eight children. Their first child, a daughter, was born on 13 March 1812. 

His daughter&#x27;s birth spurred Campbell to study the subject of baptism. He ultimately concluded that scripture did not support the baptism of infants. He came to believe that individuals had to choose conversion for themselves and baptism was not appropriate until they did so.

After the death of Margaret in 1827, Campbell married again the next year, to Selina Huntington Bakewell on 31 July 1828; they had six children.

==Public life==
From 1815 to 1824, Campbell and his father kept the Brush Run Church affiliated with a local Baptist association. After disagreements over some issues, they allied with the Mahoning Baptist Association.

Campbell&#x27;s only formal political service was as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830, held in Richmond. He met some of the leading politicians of the day and was invited to preach in several churches in the capital city.

In 1840, Campbell founded Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia). He believed that the clergy should be college educated. Many future leaders of the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ graduated from the college, although some latter congregations did not attach the same value to theological study and professional clergy.

Campbell visited the United Kingdom in 1847. During the trip he gave public lectures in England and Scotland. He went to Ireland to deliver funds that U.S. Restoration Movement churches had raised for relief in the Great Famine. While at Glasgow, he was challenged by James Robertson to a debate on the subject of slavery, which the American South protected and Campbell defended as moral. As a result of the fierce exchange, Robertson sued Campbell for libel. The American denied the charge, but he was arrested and imprisoned for ten days. Campbell was released when the warrant for his arrest was declared to be illegal. The case was ultimately tried, and the jury decided in his favor.

==Writings and works==

While in his early 20s, Campbell wrote several moral essays under the pseudonym &quot;Clarinda.&quot; and published them in a local paper. In 1820, his debate with the Presbyterian John Walker was published, reminding him of the efficacy of writing and publishing. He bought a press and built a small print shop in 1823, establishing what proved to be a successful publishing operation.

Campbell edited and published two journals. The first was the &quot;Christian Baptist,&quot; which he edited from 1823 through 1830. The second was &quot;The Millennial Harbinger,&quot; which he began in 1830 and continued to edit until his death in 1866. He became less active in it during the 1850s. In both, he advocated the reform of Christianity along the lines as it was practiced on the American frontier. He encouraged contributions by writers who thought differently from him, and the journals encouraged a lively dialogue about issues in the reform movement.

Campbell expanded his printing operation in 1830 for the &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot;. The change from the &quot;Christian Baptist&quot; to the &quot;Harbinger&quot; was prompted by several concerns. Differences of opinion were arising between Campbell and the Baptists, and in many cases Baptist associations were expelling persons connected with the Campbell movement. He was concerned that &quot;Christian Baptist&quot; – which he considered to be less appropriate than the biblical term &quot;Disciples&quot; – was becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; name of the group. He also wanted the new journal to have a more positive tone, promoting reform and preparing the world for the millennium and the second coming of Christ.

Campbell wrote several books, including &quot;The Christian System&quot;. He also wrote hymns, including &quot;Upon the Banks of Jordan Stood&quot;. Campbell compiled and published a translation of the New Testament under the title &quot;The Living Oracles&quot;. Published in 1826, it was based on an 1818 translation by George Campbell, James MacKnight and Philip Doddridge, and included edits and extensive notes by Campbell.

His known works include:
* &quot;The Living Oracles&quot; (1826) – Campbell&#x27;s translation of the New Testament
* &quot;Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot; (1828)
* &quot;Prospectus of the Millennial Harbinger&quot; (1829)
* &quot;Delusions: An Analysis of the Book of Mormon&quot; (1832)
* &quot;The Christian Preacher&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1836)
* &quot;The Christian System&quot; (1839) – summary of Campbell&#x27;s theology
* &quot;The Christian Hymnbook&quot; (1843)
* &quot;A Tract for the People of Kentucky&quot; (1849)
* &quot;Christian Baptism—Its Antecedents and Consequents&quot; (1851)
* &quot;The Acts of the Apostles&quot; (1858) – Campbell&#x27;s translation
* &quot;Memoirs of Elder Thomas Campbell&quot; (1861)
* &quot;Popular Lectures and Addresses&quot; (1863)
* &quot;Familiar Lectures on the Pentateuch&quot; (1867)

==Public debates==
For a time, Campbell was wary of public debates. In June 1820, he debated with Rev. John Walker, a Baptist preacher, at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, on baptism, and since then, regularly participated in debates. Some of them gained national and international attention after their transcripts were published. In 1823, he debated with Rev. William L. McCalla, a Presbyterian minister, on infant baptism; in April 1829, with Robert Owen on socialism and Christianity; in January 1837, with Archbishop of Cincinnati, John Baptist Purcell on Protestantism and Roman Catholicism; in September 1843, he defended the Restoration Movement in a debate with Rev. Nathan L. Rice, who represented traditional Presbyterianism.

==Death, legacy, and honors==
Alexander Campbell died at the age of 77 on 4 March 1866 at Bethany, West Virginia. His widow died more than three decades later, on 28 June 1897. His nephew Archibald Campbell (1833–1899) had already become an important abolitionist and Republican party leader, and as editor of the &quot;Wheeling Daily Intelligencer&quot; helped found what became the state of West Virginia.

*Campbell was instrumental in the Restoration Movement, which resulted in a new direction for American Christians and founding of numerous new, non-denominational churches as well as the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
*His house in Bethany, West Virginia, the Alexander Campbell Mansion, was designated as a National Historic Landmark.
*The Alexander Campbell Auditorium at Culver-Stockton College is named in his honor.
*Campbell is known to have preached at the Slash Church, now on the National Register of Historic Places in rural Hanover County, Virginia and still used by a Disciples of Christ congregation.

<doc id="296829" wikidata="Q117684" url="?curid=296829" title="The Exploited">
<text>The Exploited are a Scottish punk rock band from Edinburgh, formed in 1978 by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan, with Buchan soon replaced by his brother Wattie Buchan. They signed to Secret Records in March 1981, and their debut EP, &quot;Army Life&quot;, and debut album, &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot;, were both released that year. The band maintained a large cult following in the 1980s among a hardcore working class punk and skinhead audience. Originally a street punk band, the Exploited eventually evolved into a crossover thrash band with the release of their album &quot;Death Before Dishonour&quot; in 1987.

Although the Exploited continue to perform live, they have not released any studio material since their 2003 album, &quot;Fuck the System&quot;. Their songs have been covered by Slayer and others. Despite numerous lineup changes, Wattie has remained the Exploited&#x27;s singer and leader.

==Career==

===Formation and early days (1979–1980)===

The original line-up consisted of Terry Buchan (vocals), Stevie Ross (guitar), Colin Erskine (bass) and Andy McNiven (drums). After a few gigs in and around Edinburgh, Stevie Ross left following an appearance in Aberdeen supporting the UK Subs.

Stevie Ross was briefly replaced by guitarist Stevey Hay (Hayboy), who died on 14 July 2013 after a successful career as a blues musician. Guitar duties were then taken over by Big John Duncan.

Stevie Ross continues to write songs and, in addition to solo performances, he also plays in The Station Road Band.

===Early releases and &quot;Punk&#x27;s Not Dead&quot; (1980–1981)===
Influenced by 1970s punk rock music, such as that by the Sex Pistols, the quartet developed a straightforward, no-frills sound characterised by speed and aggression. In 1980, the group founded their own independent record label, Exploited Records, and released their debut EP &quot;Army Life&quot;, which ranked #6 in the Indie/Independent charts for eight weeks and remained in the Top 20 for eighteen months. The B-side was titled &quot;Fuck the Mods / Crashed Out&quot;, and the record&#x27;s back cover featured the message, &quot;To all the Edinburgh punks and skins - keep on mod-bashing!!&quot;.

They then released another single, &quot;Barmy Army&quot;, which ascended the independent charts and remained there for 53 weeks, peaking at #4. Their single &quot;Dead Cities&quot; reached #31 on the UK Charts. Their single &quot;Exploited Barmy Army&quot; peaked at #4 on the Independent/Indie chart.

In March 1981, the band signed to Secret Records and spent a month recording their debut album, &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot;. The Exploited released the single &quot;Dogs of War&quot;, which peaked at #2 on the Independent charts and #63 on the UK Charts. Also in 1981, the band released their first live album, &quot;On Stage&quot;, recorded during a concert in Edinburgh. Subsequently, the band toured with Discharge, Anti-Nowhere League, Anti-Pasti and Chron Gen on a tour titled &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, which was recorded and released as a live album. Their album &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot;, released in April 1981, reached #20 in May, and then climbed to number 1 on the Independent Charts. During this period, the Exploited appeared on the popular mainstream TV programme, Many fans of the Exploited were unhappy with the band&#x27;s decision to appear on the show. The hardcore punk band Conflict wrote the song &quot;Exploitation&quot; about this appearance, which led to a long-standing rivalry between Conflict and the Exploited, dividing the punk fan base.

===&quot;Troops of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a War&quot;, and &quot;Horror Epics&quot; (1982–1986)===
The band released the albums &quot;Troops of Tomorrow&quot; in 1982, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a War&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Horror Epics&quot; in 1985. The period between these albums was marked by severe discord over the band&#x27;s musical direction: guitarist Big John Duncan and bassist Gary McCormack both left to form new bands—&quot;bands with disco beats and guitar solos, total shit&quot;, in Wattie&#x27;s words—and the band experienced a rapid succession of drummers, one of whom allegedly left after a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. The band was driven away from the Secret label by new management who demanded unrealistic changes in style and personnel. Their next label, a small enterprise named Pax Records, folded after its owner fled with all its assets.

The concert album &quot;Live at the Whitehouse&quot; was recorded in Washington, D.C., in 1985 at the 9:30 Club and was released the following year in 1986. They also released the studio EP &quot;Jesus Is Dead&quot; in 1986, followed by &quot;Live and Loud&quot;, a videography of the Exploited performing across Europe and the United States. During the US tour, Wattie and Karl Morris had an altercation on stage, and Karl left shortly afterwards. He was briefly replaced by Mad Mick, who then disappeared without trace. Nigel Swanson was then appointed as the new guitarist.

===&quot;Death Before Dishonour&quot;, &quot;The Massacre&quot; and &quot;Beat the Bastards&quot; (1987–2002)===

&quot;Sexual Favours&quot;, a single from the album &quot;Death Before Dishonour&quot;, was released in 1987. The album only ranked in the top 200 of the British Alternative Music chart. However, the album sold out quickly. The album&#x27;s cover featured artwork from the American punk artist Pushead, who complained that he was neither paid nor credited for the work.

In 1990, the Exploited released their album &quot;The Massacre&quot;. The album is a crossover thrash album. The band went on to release a &quot;Singles Collection&quot; album in 1993. The Exploited also released the videography &quot;Live in Japan&quot; in 1993. Their album &quot;Beat the Bastards&quot; was released in April 1996.

===&quot;Fuck the System&quot; and next album (2003–present)===
In early 2003, the band released the album &quot;Fuck the System&quot; on Dream Catcher Records, and in the following year, they toured the UK and the US. On 14 October 2003, around 500 fans sparked a riot in Montreal, Canada after an Exploited concert was cancelled due to the band being denied entry into the country. Rioters overturned and set fire to eight cars, broke eleven shop windows, and caused other damage. The band was banned from performing in Mexico City as a result of the riot.

In a 2012 interview, Wattie Buchan stated that a new album was nearing completion. In February 2014, Wattie Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage during a performance in Lisbon as part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Taste of Chaos&quot; Tour with Hatebreed and Napalm Death. He was taken to hospital, where he was expected to remain for at least a week for treatment. The band signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records, and it was planned that many of their albums would be reissued in March 2014. The band also confirmed that their first album in a decade would be released during the 2010s.

In March 2020, Wattie Buchan responded to the coronavirus outbreak that was forcing bands to cancel or postpone tours. He made a pointed remark about Green Day (a band he had frequently stated he disliked), saying, &quot;Fuck coronavirus! I have had 5 heart attacks, a quadruple heart bypass and a heart pacemaker fitted. Cancel gigs for a virus? We ain&#x27;t fucking Green Day piss – We are the real deal. No danger will we be cancelling our upcoming gigs. Punks Not Dead!&quot; The Australian leg of the tour was cancelled four days later, although the band completed all the scheduled New Zealand gigs.

==Legacy==
The Exploited are one of the iconic bands of the UK 82 punk movement, alongside Charged GBH and . The term &quot;UK 82&quot; was derived from the Exploited&#x27;s song &quot;UK 82&quot;. AllMusic described the Exploited as &quot;one of the most riveting British punk rock units of the early 1980s&quot;.

The Exploited has been categorised as crossover thrash, punk rock, thrash metal, speed metal, punk metal, anarchist punk, street punk and Originally playing street punk and oi!, The Exploited evolved into a crossover thrash band with their album &quot;Death Before Dishonour&quot;. The Exploited&#x27;s influences include Sex Pistols, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, the Vibrators, the Threats, Alternative, the Belsen Horrors, and Johnny Moped. Wattie Buchan has also mentioned being influenced by James Brown and has expressed his admiration for The Cure&#x27;s first four albums.

==Lyrics==
The Exploited have been controversial for their aggressive lyrics and rowdy gigs. Ian Glasper described them as &quot;cartoon punks.&quot; Glasper wrote: &quot;For many, the Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses-searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter &#x27;Wattie&#x27; Buchan&#x27;s archetypal orange mohican.&quot; 

The Exploited are known for their lyrics addressing anarchy, politics and anti-authority themes. In a 1983 interview, the Exploited stated that they were not a political band, but their lyrics became increasingly political in the late 1980s. Wattie Buchan noted in the documentary &quot;Punk&#x27;s Not Dead&quot; that punk is defined by its politics. As a band with anarchist-themed lyrics, the Exploited&#x27;s vocalist Wattie Buchan identifies as an anarchist and has openly expressed disdain for politics. The Exploited have written songs about former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and have conveyed a negative view towards her. The song &quot;Maggie&quot; from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Horror Epics&quot; is specifically about Thatcher. The Exploited&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a War... (Said Maggie One Day),&quot; centres on Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War. Other themes explored in the album include police-led riots, war, unemployment, and a sense of hopelessness. Many songs from the mid-1980s focus on the threat of nuclear war.

The fans of the Exploited were nicknamed &quot;the Barmy Army&quot;. During the rivalry between the Exploited and Conflict, there were occasional clashes with fans of Conflict, known as &quot;the Conflict Crew&quot;. In addition to the anti-social behaviour of the band and some of their fans, the Exploited would often cancel gigs at short notice in the 1980s, which led many venues to refuse to work with them. 

After the 1981 Southall riot, Oi! bands, in general, became associated with racism, and the Exploited were sometimes believed to be a racist band due to Wattie&#x27;s swastika tattoo, an incident in the early 1980s where Wattie fought with a group of Asians in a café, and in 1985 when &quot;Deptford John&quot; joined from the skinhead band Combat 84. The band has denied all accusations of racism.

As of August 2017, the band&#x27;s website includes a history that mentions some of the issues surrounding their gigs, such as a riot after a show at the Rainbow in Finsbury Park, London, when the Jam were playing nearby and Wattie incited fans to attack the Mods, and a statement made onstage in Argentina that the Falkland Islands are British forever. George Same has written about the fighting after the Finsbury Park gig in his book on modern music, &quot;Backward Moddy Boy&quot;. In a documentary about the band, former manager Gem Howard stated that he would often sneak the band out of hotels late at night, as they would frequently vandalise the hotel and steal items from the rooms.

<doc id="296834" wikidata="Q542293" url="?curid=296834" title="The Murder on the Links">
<text>The Murder on the Links is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the US by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co in March 1923, and in the UK by The Bodley Head in May of the same year. It is the second novel featuring Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6), and the US edition at $1.75.

The story takes place in northern France, giving Poirot a hostile competitor from the Paris Sûreté. Poirot&#x27;s long memory for past or similar crimes proves useful in resolving the crimes. The book is notable for a subplot in which Hastings falls in love, a development &quot;greatly desired on Agatha&#x27;s part... parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine.&quot;

Reviews when it was published compared Mrs Christie favourably to Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Remarking on Poirot, still a new character, one reviewer said he was &quot;a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings travel to Merlinville-sur-Mer, France, to meet Paul Renauld, who has requested their help. When they arrive, local police greet them with the news that Renauld was found dead that morning, stabbed in the back with a knife and left in a newly dug grave adjacent to a local golf course. His wife, Eloise Renauld, claims masked men broke into the villa at 2am, tied her up, and took her husband away with them. Upon inspecting his body, Eloise collapses with grief at seeing her dead husband. Monsieur Giraud of the Sûreté leads the police investigation, and resents Poirot&#x27;s involvement.

Poirot notes four key facts about the case: a piece of lead piping is found near the body; only three female servants were in the villa as both Renauld&#x27;s son Jack and his chauffeur had been sent away; an unknown person visited the day before; and Renauld&#x27;s immediate neighbour, Madame Daubreuil, had placed 200,000 francs into her bank account over recent weeks.

When Renauld&#x27;s secretary, Gabriel Stonor, returns from England, he suggests blackmail, as his employer&#x27;s past is a complete mystery prior to his career in South America. Meanwhile, Hastings unexpectedly encounters a young woman he had met on the train, known only as &quot;Cinderella.&quot; She asks to see the crime scene and then disappears with the murder weapon.

Poirot discovers that the case is nearly identical to one from 22 years ago, in which a man called Georges Conneau and his lover, Madame Beroldy, conspired to kill Madame Beroldy&#x27;s husband. Poirot travels to Paris to discover more about the Conneau murder. He finds a photograph of Madame Beroldy that shows that she is really Madame Daubreuil. On returning, Poirot learns that the body of a tramp has been found, stabbed through the heart with the murder weapon. An examination shows that he died before Renauld&#x27;s murder from an epileptic seizure and was stabbed later.

Giraud arrests Jack on the basis that he wanted his father&#x27;s money. Poirot reveals Renauld changed his will two weeks before his murder, disinheriting Jack. Jack is released from prison after Bella Duveen, an English stage performer he loves, confesses to the murder. Both had come across the body on the night of the murder, and each assumed the other had killed Renauld. Poirot reveals neither did, as the real killer was Marthe Daubreuil, daughter of the neighbor.

Poirot elaborates on his theory: Paul Renauld was really Georges Conneau, who returned to France after fleeing years ago. By misfortune, he found that his immediate neighbour would be Madame Beroldy, his old lover; like him, she had changed her identity, becoming Mme. Daubreuil. Blackmailed by her over his past, Renauld found his situation worsened when Jack becomes attracted to her daughter. When a tramp died on his grounds, he saw an opportunity to stage his own death and escape Mme Daubreuil. He would disfigure the tramp&#x27;s face with the pipe, and then bury the tramp and the pipe beside the golf course, before fleeing the area by train. Anyone who would recognise that the body was not his would be sent away. However, the plan was discovered by Marthe, who followed Renauld and stabbed him after he dug the grave for the tramp&#x27;s body. Her motive is money; Jack will inherit his father&#x27;s fortune on his mother&#x27;s death. To expose Marthe as the killer, Poirot asked Eloise to openly state she will disinherit Jack. Marthe attempts to kill Eloise in her villa but dies in a struggle with Hastings&#x27;s Cinderella.

Marthe&#x27;s mother disappears again. Jack and his mother plan to go to South America, joined by Hastings and his Cinderella, who is revealed as Bella Duveen&#x27;s twin sister Dulcie.

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; reviewed the novel in its issue of 7 June 1923. The review compared the methods of detection of Poirot to Sherlock Holmes and concluded favourably that the book &quot;provides the reader with an enthralling mystery of an unusual kind&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 25 March 1923 began, &quot;Here is a remarkably good detective story which can be warmly commended to those who like that kind of fiction.&quot; After detailing the set-up of the story the review continued, &quot;The plot has peculiar complications and the reader will have to be very astute indeed if he guesses who the criminal is until the last complexity has been unravelled. The author is notably ingenious in the construction and unravelling of the mystery, which develops fresh interests and new entanglements at every turn. She deserves commendation also for the care with which the story is worked out and the good craftsmanship with which it is written. Although there is not much endeavour to portray character, except in the case of M. Poirot, several of the personages are depicted with swiftly made expressive and distinctive lines.&quot;

The unnamed reviewer in &quot;The Observer&quot; of 10 June 1923 said, &quot;When Conan Doyle popularised Sherlock Holmes in the &quot;Strand&quot; of the &#x27;nineties he lit such a candle as the publishers will not willingly let out. Not a week passes which does not bring a &#x27;detective&#x27; story from one quarter or another, and several of the popular magazines rely mainly on that commodity. Among the later cultivators of this anything but lonely furrow the name of Agatha Christie is well in the front. If she has not the touch of artistry which made &quot;The Speckled Band&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; things of real horror, she has an unusual gift of mechanical complication.&quot; The reviewer went on to compare the novel with &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, which they called &quot;a remarkable piece of work&quot;, but warned that &quot;it is a mistake to carry the art of bewilderment to the point of making the brain reel&quot;. They did admit that &quot;[n]o solution could be more surprising&quot; and stated that the character of Poirot was &quot;a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;Super-complicated early whodunit, set in the northerly fringes of France so beloved of the English bankrupt. Poirot pits his wits against a sneering sophisticate of a French policeman while Hastings lets his wander after an auburn-haired female acrobat. Entertaining for most of its length, but the solution is one of those &#x27;once revealed, instantly forgotten&#x27; ones, where ingenuity has triumphed over common sense&quot;.

In a modern work of literary criticism, Christie biographer Laura Thompson writes:

She notes as well that the book, the second novel featuring Poirot, is notable for a subplot in which Hastings falls in love, a development &quot;greatly desired on Agatha&#x27;s part... parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine.&quot;

The novel received its first true publication as a four-part serialisation in the &quot;Grand Magazine&quot; from December 1922 to March 1923 (Issues 214–217) under the title of &quot;The Girl with the Anxious Eyes&quot; before it was issued in book form by The Bodley Head in May 1923. This was Christie&#x27;s first published work for the &quot;Grand Magazine&quot; which went on to publish many of her short stories throughout the 1920s.

Christie&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; recounts how she objected to the illustration of the dustjacket of the UK first edition stating that it was both badly drawn and unrepresentative of the plot. It was the first of many such objections she raised with her publishers over the dustjacket. It would appear that Christie won her argument over the dustjacket as the one she describes and objected to (&quot;a man in his pyjamas, dying of an epileptic on a golf course&quot;) does not resemble the actual jacket which shows Monsieur Renauld digging the open grave on the golf course at night.

===Book dedication===
Christie dedicated her third book as follows:

Christie refers here to her first husband, Archibald Christie (1890–1962) from whom she was divorced in 1928.

===Dustjacket blurb===
The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead it carried quotes of reviews for &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; whilst the back jacket flap carried similar quotes for &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Theatre===
&quot;The Murder on the Links&quot; was adapted for the stage by American playwright Steven Dietz in 2021. Performed by an ensemble cast of six, with Poirot and Hastings played by either male or female actors, this serio-comic adaptation is scheduled to premiere in San Diego (North Coast Repertory Theatre) and at the Laguna Playhouse in 2023.

===Radio===
&quot;The Murder on the Links&quot; was presented as a one-hour, thirty-minute radio adaptation in the &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; strand on BBC Radio 4 on 15 September 1990, the centenary of Christie&#x27;s birth. It was repeated on 8 July 1991 and again in 2015. John Moffatt starred as Poirot. The play&#x27;s recording took place on 21 June 1989 at Broadcasting House. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell and produced and directed by Enyd Williams.

===Television===

====British adaptation====
An adaptation of the novel was made for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; on 11 February 1996. It was produced by Carnival Films, and starred David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, and Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings. While much of the novel&#x27;s plot was retained, the adaptation featured a number of changes, which included the setting being changed to Deauville, France, where filming took place on-site. The wager between Poirot and Giraud is changed; instead of 500 Francs, the stakes are Giraud&#x27;s famous pipe against Poirot&#x27;s mustache. In the end, Poirot returns the pipe, observing that Giraud will think of him whenever he uses it. Jack is Paul&#x27;s stepson who was adopted by him and took his last name, instead of being his biological son. The denouement is different. Bella is a singer, who introduces herself to Hastings as “Isabelle”. She still confuses things by confessing to the crime, but she no longer loves Jack. It is Stonor who shoots Marthe with her own gun when—as Poirot predicts—she breaks in and tries to kill Madame Renaud. Marthe&#x27;s mother does not escape, but is arrested. There is no twin sister. Bella is now in love with Hastings, who is staying in Deauville to make sense of it all. Poirot brings her to the promenade on the seaside, where they share a long kiss. Fade out.

<text>In mathematics, and particularly in set theory, category theory, type theory, and the foundations of mathematics, a universe is a collection that contains all the entities one wishes to consider in a given situation.

In set theory, universes are often classes that contain (as elements) all sets for which one hopes to prove a particular theorem. These classes can serve as inner models for various axiomatic systems such as ZFC or Morse–Kelley set theory. Universes are of critical importance to formalizing concepts in category theory inside set-theoretical foundations. For instance, the canonical motivating example of a category is [[Category of sets|Set]], the category of all sets, which cannot be formalized in a set theory without some notion of a universe.

In type theory, a universe is a type whose elements are types.

==In a specific context==

Perhaps the simplest version is that &quot;any&quot; set can be a universe, so long as the object of study is confined to that particular set. If the object of study is formed by the real numbers, then the real line R, which is the real number set, could be the universe under consideration. Implicitly, this is the universe that Georg Cantor was using when he first developed modern naive set theory and cardinality in the 1870s and 1880s in applications to real analysis. The only sets that Cantor was originally interested in were subsets of R.

This concept of a universe is reflected in the use of Venn diagrams. In a Venn diagram, the action traditionally takes place inside a large rectangle that represents the universe &quot;U&quot;. One generally says that sets are represented by circles; but these sets can only be subsets of &quot;U&quot;. The complement of a set &quot;A&quot; is then given by that portion of the rectangle outside of &quot;A&quot;&#x27;s circle. Strictly speaking, this is the relative complement &quot;U&quot; \ &quot;A&quot; of &quot;A&quot; relative to &quot;U&quot;; but in a context where &quot;U&quot; is the universe, it can be regarded as the absolute complement &quot;A&quot;C of &quot;A&quot;. Similarly, there is a notion of the nullary intersection, that is the intersection of zero sets (meaning no sets, not null sets).

Without a universe, the nullary intersection would be the set of absolutely everything, which is generally regarded as impossible; but with the universe in mind, the nullary intersection can be treated as the set of everything under consideration, which is simply &quot;U&quot;. These conventions are quite useful in the algebraic approach to basic set theory, based on Boolean lattices. Except in some non-standard forms of axiomatic set theory (such as New Foundations), the class of all sets is not a Boolean lattice (it is only a relatively complemented lattice).

In contrast, the class of all subsets of &quot;U&quot;, called the power set of &quot;U&quot;, is a Boolean lattice. The absolute complement described above is the complement operation in the Boolean lattice; and &quot;U&quot;, as the nullary intersection, serves as the top element (or nullary meet) in the Boolean lattice. Then De Morgan&#x27;s laws, which deal with complements of meets and joins (which are unions in set theory) apply, and apply even to the nullary meet and the nullary join (which is the empty set).

==In ordinary mathematics==
However, once subsets of a given set &quot;X&quot; (in Cantor&#x27;s case, &quot;X&quot; = R) are considered, the universe may need to be a set of subsets of &quot;X&quot;. (For example, a topology on &quot;X&quot; is a set of subsets of &quot;X&quot;.) The various sets of subsets of &quot;X&quot; will not themselves be subsets of &quot;X&quot; but will instead be subsets of PX&quot;, the power set of &quot;X&quot;. This may be continued; the object of study may next consist of such sets of subsets of &quot;X&quot;, and so on, in which case the universe will be P(PX&quot;). In another direction, the binary relations on &quot;X&quot; (subsets of the Cartesian product may be considered, or functions from &quot;X&quot; to itself, requiring universes like or &quot;X&quot;&quot;X&quot;.

Thus, even if the primary interest is &quot;X&quot;, the universe may need to be considerably larger than &quot;X&quot;. Following the above ideas, one may want the superstructure over &quot;X&quot; as the universe. This can be defined by structural recursion as follows:
* Let S0&quot;X&quot; be &quot;X&quot; itself.
* Let S1&quot;X&quot; be the union of &quot;X&quot; and P&quot;X&quot;.
* Let S2&quot;X&quot; be the union of S1&quot;X&quot; and P(S1&quot;X&quot;).
* In general, let S&quot;n&quot;+1&quot;X&quot; be the union of Sn&quot;X&quot; and P(S&quot;n&quot;&quot;X&quot;).
Then the superstructure over &quot;X&quot;, written S&quot;X&quot;, is the union of S0&quot;X&quot;, S1&quot;X&quot;, S2&quot;X&quot;, and so on; or
: formula_1

No matter what set &quot;X&quot; is the starting point, the empty set {} will belong to S1&quot;X&quot;. The empty set is the von Neumann ordinal [0].
Then {[0]}, the set whose only element is the empty set, will belong to S2&quot;X&quot;; this is the von Neumann ordinal [1]. Similarly, {[1]} will belong to S3&quot;X&quot;, and thus so will {[0],[1]}, as the union of {[0]} and {[1]}; this is the von Neumann ordinal [2]. Continuing this process, every natural number is represented in the superstructure by its von Neumann ordinal. Next, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; belong to the superstructure, then so does , which represents the ordered pair (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;). Thus the superstructure will contain the various desired Cartesian products. Then the superstructure also contains functions and relations, since these may be represented as subsets of Cartesian products. The process also gives ordered &quot;n&quot;-tuples, represented as functions whose domain is the von Neumann ordinal [&quot;n&quot;], and so on.

So if the starting point is just &quot;X&quot; = {}, a great deal of the sets needed for mathematics appear as elements of the superstructure over {}. But each of the elements of S{} will be a finite set. Each of the natural numbers belongs to it, but the set N of &quot;all&quot; natural numbers does not (although it is a &quot;subset&quot; of S{}). In fact, the superstructure over {} consists of all of the hereditarily finite sets. As such, it can be considered the &quot;universe of finitist mathematics&quot;. Speaking anachronistically, one could suggest that the 19th-century finitist Leopold Kronecker was working in this universe; he believed that each natural number existed but that the set N (a &quot;completed infinity&quot;) did not.

However, S{} is unsatisfactory for ordinary mathematicians (who are not finitists), because even though N may be available as a subset of S{}, still the power set of N is not. In particular, arbitrary sets of real numbers are not available. So it may be necessary to start the process all over again and form S(S{}). However, to keep things simple, one can take the set N of natural numbers as given and form SN, the superstructure over N. This is often considered the &quot;universe of ordinary mathematics&quot;. The idea is that all of the mathematics that is ordinarily studied refers to elements of this universe. For example, any of the usual constructions of the real numbers (say by Dedekind cuts) belongs to SN. Even non-standard analysis can be done in the superstructure over a non-standard model of the natural numbers.

There is a slight shift in philosophy from the previous section, where the universe was any set &quot;U&quot; of interest. There, the sets being studied were &quot;subset&quot;s of the universe; now, they are &quot;members&quot; of the universe. Thus although P(SX&quot;) is a Boolean lattice, what is relevant is that SX&quot; itself is not. Consequently, it is rare to apply the notions of Boolean lattices and Venn diagrams directly to the superstructure universe as they were to the power-set universes of the previous section. Instead, one can work with the individual Boolean lattices PA&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is any relevant set belonging to SX&quot;; then PA&quot; is a subset of SX&quot; (and in fact belongs to S&quot;X&quot;). In Cantor&#x27;s case &quot;X&quot; = R in particular, arbitrary sets of real numbers are not available, so there it may indeed be necessary to start the process all over again.

==In set theory==
It is possible to give a precise meaning to the claim that SN is the universe of ordinary mathematics; it is a model of Zermelo set theory, the axiomatic set theory originally developed by Ernst Zermelo in 1908. Zermelo set theory was successful precisely because it was capable of axiomatising &quot;ordinary&quot; mathematics, fulfilling the programme begun by Cantor over 30 years earlier. But Zermelo set theory proved insufficient for the further development of axiomatic set theory and other work in the foundations of mathematics, especially model theory.

For a dramatic example, the description of the superstructure process above cannot itself be carried out in Zermelo set theory. The final step, forming S as an infinitary union, requires the axiom of replacement, which was added to Zermelo set theory in 1922 to form Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the set of axioms most widely accepted today. So while ordinary mathematics may be done &quot;in&quot; SN, discussion &quot;of&quot; SN goes beyond the &quot;ordinary&quot;, into metamathematics.

But if high-powered set theory is brought in, the superstructure process above reveals itself to be merely the beginning of a transfinite recursion.
Going back to &quot;X&quot; = {}, the empty set, and introducing the (standard) notation &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; for S&quot;i&quot;{}, &quot;V&quot;0 = {}, &quot;V&quot;1 = P{}, and so on as before. But what used to be called &quot;superstructure&quot; is now just the next item on the list: &quot;V&quot;ω, where ω is the first infinite ordinal number. This can be extended to arbitrary ordinal numbers:
: formula_2.
Every individual &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a set, but their union &quot;V&quot; is a proper class. The axiom of foundation, which was added to ZF set theory at around the same time as the axiom of replacement, says that &quot;every&quot; set belongs to &quot;V&quot;.

: &quot;Kurt Gödel&#x27;s constructible universe &quot;L&quot; and the axiom of constructibility&quot;
: &quot;Inaccessible cardinals yield models of ZF and sometimes additional axioms, and are equivalent to the existence of the Grothendieck universe set&quot;

==In predicate calculus==
In an interpretation of first-order logic, the universe (or domain of discourse) is the set of individuals (individual constants) over which the quantifiers range. A proposition such as is ambiguous, if no domain of discourse has been identified. In one interpretation, the domain of discourse could be the set of real numbers; in another interpretation, it could be the set of natural numbers. If the domain of discourse is the set of real numbers, the proposition is false, with as counterexample; if the domain is the set of naturals, the proposition is true, since 2 is not the square of any natural number.

==In category theory==

There is another approach to universes which is historically connected with category theory. This is the idea of a Grothendieck universe. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set inside which all the usual operations of set theory can be performed. This version of a universe is defined to be any set for which the following axioms hold:
# formula_3 implies formula_4
# formula_5 and formula_6 imply {&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;}, (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;), and formula_7.
# formula_4 implies formula_9 and formula_10
# formula_11 (here formula_12 is the set of all finite ordinals.)
# if formula_13 is a surjective function with formula_14 and formula_15, then formula_16.

The most common use of a Grothendieck universe &quot;U&quot; is to take &quot;U&quot; as a replacement for the category of all sets. One says that a set &quot;S&quot; is U-small if &quot;S&quot; ∈&quot;U&quot;, and U-large otherwise. The category &quot;U&quot;-Set of all &quot;U&quot;-small sets has as objects all &quot;U&quot;-small sets and as morphisms all functions between these sets. Both the object set and the morphism set are sets, so it becomes possible to discuss the category of &quot;all&quot; sets without invoking proper classes. Then it becomes possible to define other categories in terms of this new category. For example, the category of all &quot;U&quot;-small categories is the category of all categories whose object set and whose morphism set are in &quot;U&quot;. Then the usual arguments of set theory are applicable to the category of all categories, and one does not have to worry about accidentally talking about proper classes. Because Grothendieck universes are extremely large, this suffices in almost all applications.

Often when working with Grothendieck universes, mathematicians assume the Axiom of Universes: &quot;For any set &quot;x&quot;, there exists a universe &quot;U&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ∈&quot;U&quot;.&quot; The point of this axiom is that any set one encounters is then &quot;U&quot;-small for some &quot;U&quot;, so any argument done in a general Grothendieck universe can be applied. This axiom is closely related to the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals.

==In type theory==
In some type theories, especially in systems with dependent types, types themselves can be regarded as terms. There is a type called the universe (often denoted formula_17) which has types as its elements. To avoid paradoxes such as Girard&#x27;s paradox (an analogue of Russell&#x27;s paradox for type theory), type theories are often equipped with a countably infinite hierarchy of such universes, with each universe being a term of the next one. 

There are at least two kinds of universes that one can consider in type theory: Russell-style universes (named after Bertrand Russell) and Tarski-style universes (named after Alfred Tarski). A Russell-style universe is a type whose terms are types. A Tarski-style universe is a type together with an interpretation operation allowing us to regard its terms as types.

<text>Guan Hanqing (, 1241–1320); sobriquet Yǐzhāi (已齋), Yīzhāi (一齋), Yǐzhāisǒu (已齋叟); was a Chinese dramatist, playwright, and poet during the Yuan Dynasty. He has been described as among the most prolific and highly regarded dramatists of the Yuan period.

==Life==
Guan Hanqing was undoubtedly the most productive and creative playwright of northern plays. Described by Jia Zhongming as “the leader of the Pear Garden” (liyuan lingxiu 梨園領袖), Guan was fully immersed in the theatrical scene of his time and was well known amongst both actors and his fellow peers. He is even said to have painted and powdered his face (mianfu fenmo 面傅粉墨) while acting on stage. He is credited with the writing of 68 plays, of which only 18 survive, three in fragments. These were written mostly in the vernacular of the time. In some cases, attribution is highly disputed. In addition to playwriting, Guan Hanqing is also said to be a master of songs (sanqu 散曲). 57 of his songs (xiaoling 小令) and 14 song suites (taoshu 套數) survive. Guan spent much of his later life in Dadu and to Hangzhou in the south. Above all, Guan Hanqing is celebrated for his uplifting portrayal of the downtrodden.

==Works==
* &quot;The Injustice to Dou E&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Snow in Midsummer&quot; (感天動地竇娥冤 &quot;Gǎn Tiān Dòng Dì Dòu É Yuān&quot;)
:The Injustice to Dou E That Touched Heaven and Earth, also known as Snow in Midsummer, is regarded as one of Guan Hanqing&#x27;s most popular plays. A young girl named Dou Duanyun is sold as a child bride in order for her father to pay the necessary funds to travel to the capital for an official exam. She is then forced to change her name to “Dou E”. The play begins after Dou E&#x27;s husband has died two years after their marriage, leaving Dou E and her mother in law alone. After Dou&#x27;s mother in law is almost strangled to death by a doctor who refused to give back the money he owed them, they are rescued by a man named Zhang Lü’er. Zhang then moves in for the purpose of “offering protection”, but eventually tries to force Dou E into marriage. After Dou E&#x27;s mother gets a sudden craving for soup, Zhang Lü’er devises a plan to poison her so he can take Dou E for himself. This plan however backfires and Zhang&#x27;s father ends up eating the soup and dies. Dou E is framed for this crime, and is later sentenced to death after being tortured and eventually confessing to spare her step mother from torture. As she is brought to the execution ground she swears by her innocence and states that it will be proven by the following three events that will occur after her death: her blood will float up onto the hanged white ribbons but will not drip onto the ground, there will be heavy snowfall in the midst of summer that will cover her dead body, and Chuzhou will experience drought for three years. All three events happened after Dou E&#x27;s death.
* &quot;Saving the Dusty-windy&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Saving the Prostitute&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Rescued by a Coquette&quot; (趙盼兒風月救風塵 &quot;Zhào Pàn Ér Fēng Yuè Jiù Fēng Chén&quot;)
* &quot;The Conference of a Single Dao&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Meeting the Enemies Alone&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Lord Guan Goes to the Feast&quot; (關大王獨赴單刀會 &quot;Guān Dà Wáng Dú Fù Dān Dāo Huì&quot;)
* &quot;The Pavilion of Moon-Worship&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Secluded Chamber&quot; (閨怨佳人拜月亭 &quot;Guī Yuàn Jiā Rén Bài Yuè Tíng&quot;)
* &quot;A Butterfly Dream&quot; (包待制三勘蝴蝶夢 &quot;Bāo Dài Zhì Sān Kān Hú Dié Mèng&quot;)
:Guan Hanqing is renowned for his courtroom dramas that typically display poetic justice in which morality and legality work hand in hand. However, this is not the case in “A Butterfly Dream”. In this drama, three brothers accidentally kill a noble man whose horse trampled their father while attempting to bring him to court. The accused parties, including the mother of the three brothers, are eventually acquitted of their crimes after showing their virtuous character by attempting to accept fault for one another. This work showed a more flexible and complex version of justice than traditional confucian law allowed and discusses the grey areas between moral culpability and lawful justice.
* &quot;The Wife-Snatcher&quot; (包待制智斬魯齋郎 &quot;Bāo Dài Zhì Zhì Zhǎn Lǔ Zhāi Láng&quot;)
* &quot;The Riverside Pavilion&quot; (望江亭中秋切膾旦 &quot;Wàng Jiāng Tíng Zhōng Qiū Qiē Kuài Dàn&quot;)
* &quot;The Jade Mirror-Stand&quot; (溫太真玉鏡臺 &quot;Wēn Tài Zhēn Yù Jìng Tái&quot;)
* &quot;Death of the Winged-Tiger General&quot; (鄧夫人苦痛哭存孝 &quot;Dèng Fū Rén Kǔ Tòng Kū Cún Xiào&quot;)

<doc id="296845" wikidata="Q314464" url="?curid=296845" title="Tokugawa Hidetada">
<text>was the second &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty, who ruled from 1605 until his abdication in 1623. He was the third son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate.

==Early life (1579–1593)==
Tokugawa Hidetada was born to Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Lady Saigō on May 2, 1579. This was shortly before Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu&#x27;s official wife, and their son Tokugawa Nobuyasu were executed on suspicion of plotting to assassinate Oda Nobunaga, who was Nobuyasu&#x27;s father-in-law and Ieyasu&#x27;s ally. By killing his wife and son, Ieyasu declared his loyalty to Nobunaga. In 1589, Hidetada&#x27;s mother fell ill, her health rapidly deteriorated, and she died at Sunpu Castle. Later Hidetada with his brother, Matsudaira Tadayoshi, was raised by Lady Acha, one of Ieyasu&#x27;s concubines. His childhood name was , later becoming .

The traditional power base of the Tokugawa clan was Mikawa. In 1590, the new ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi enlisted Tokugawa Ieyasu and others in attacking the domain of the Hōjō in what became known as the Siege of Odawara (1590). Hideyoshi enlisted Ieyasu for this campaign by promising to exchange the five provinces under Ieyasu&#x27;s control for the eight Kantō provinces, including the city of Edo. In order to keep Ieyasu from defecting to the Hōjō side (since the Hōjō and the Tokugawa were formerly on friendly terms), Hideyoshi took the eleven-year-old Hidetada as a hostage. In 1592 Hideyoshi presided over Hidetada&#x27;s coming of age ceremony; it was then that Ieyasu&#x27;s son dropped his childhood name, Takechiyo (竹千代), and assumed the name Hidetada. He was named the heir of the Tokugawa family, being the eldest surviving son of Ieyasu, and his favorite (since Ieyasu&#x27;s eldest son had been previously executed, and his second son was adopted by Hideyoshi while still an infant). In 1593, Hidetada returned to his father&#x27;s side.

In 1590, Hidetada married O-Hime (1585–1591), daughter of Oda Nobukatsu and adopted daughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. O-Hime died in 1591, and was given the posthumous Buddhist name Shunshoin. In 1595, Hidetada married Oeyo, daughter of Azai Nagamasa and adopted daughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Their wedding was held in Fushimi Castle.

==Military achievements (1593–1605)==
In 1595, Hidetada married Oeyo of the Oda clan and they had two sons, Tokugawa Iemitsu and Tokugawa Tadanaga. They also had several daughters, one of whom, Senhime, married twice. The other daughter, Kazuko &quot;hime&quot;, married Emperor Go-Mizunoo (of descent from the Fujiwara clan).

Knowing his death would come before his son Toyotomi Hideyori came of age, Hideyoshi named five regents—one of whom was Hidetada&#x27;s father, Ieyasu—to rule in his son&#x27;s place. Hideyoshi hoped that the bitter rivalry among the regents would prevent any one of them from seizing power. But after Hideyoshi died in 1598 and Hideyori became nominal ruler, the regents forgot all vows of eternal loyalty and were soon vying for control of the nation. Tokugawa Ieyasu was one of the strongest of the five regents, and began to rally around himself an Eastern faction. A Western faction rallied around Ishida Mitsunari. The two factions clashed at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu won decisively, which set the stage for Tokugawa rule.

Hidetada had led 16,000 of his father&#x27;s men in a campaign to contain the Western-aligned Uesugi clan in Shinano. Ieyasu then ordered Hidetada to march to Sekigahara in anticipation of the decisive battle against the Western faction. But the Sanada clan managed to tie down Hidetada&#x27;s force, so he arrived too late to assist in his father&#x27;s narrow but decisive victory. Ieyasu was incensed with Hidetada and was only convinced by his advisors not to punish his son. On 3 December 1601, Hidetada&#x27;s first son, , was born to a young maiden from Kyoto named Onatsu. In September 1602, Chōmaru fell ill and died; his funeral was held at Zōjō-ji temple in Shibe.

In 1603 Emperor Go-Yōzei granted Ieyasu the title of &quot;shōgun&quot;. Thus Hidetada became the heir to the shogunate.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1605–1623)==
To avoid his predecessor&#x27;s fate, Ieyasu established a dynastic pattern soon after becoming shogun by abdicating in favor of Hidetada in 1605. Ieyasu retained significant power until his death in 1616; but Hidetada nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the bakufu bureaucracy.

Much to the dismay of Ieyasu, in 1612, Hidetada engineered a marriage between Sen, Ieyasu&#x27;s favorite granddaughter, and Toyotomi Hideyori, who was living as a commoner in Osaka Castle with his mother. When this failed to quell Hideyori&#x27;s intrigues, Ōgosho Ieyasu and Shogun Hidetada brought an army to Osaka. 

In 1614-1615, at Siege of Osaka, father and son once again disagreed on how to conduct this campaign against the recalcitrant Toyotomi forces in Osaka. In the ensuing siege Hideyori and his mother were forced to commit suicide. Even Hideyori&#x27;s infant son (Kunimatsu), that he had with a concubine, was not spared. Only Sen was spared; she later remarried and had a new family.

After Ieyasu&#x27;s death in 1616, Hidetada took control of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. He strengthened the Tokugawa hold on power by improving relations with the Imperial court. To this end he married his daughter Kazuko to Emperor Go-Mizunoo. The product of that marriage, a girl, eventually succeeded to the throne of Japan to become Empress Meishō. The city of Edo was also heavily developed under his reign.

Historian Michifumi Isoda opined that the total isolationism policy implemented by Hidetada has gradually weaken the military of Japan under Tokugawa shogunate in the long run.

==&quot;Ogosho&quot; (1623–1632)==
In &quot;Genna&quot; 9 (1623), Hidetada resigned the government to his eldest son and heir, Tokugawa Iemitsu. Like his father before him, Hidetada became &quot;Ōgosho&quot; or retired &quot;shōgun&quot;, and retained effective power. He enacted anti-Christian measures, which Ieyasu had only considered: he banned Christian books, forced Christian &quot;daimyōs&quot; to commit suicide, ordered other Christians to apostatize under penalty of death; and executed fifty-five Christians (both Japanese and foreign) who refused to renounce Christianity or to go into hiding, by burning them along with their children, in Nagasaki in 1628.

&quot;Ōgosho&quot; Hidetada died in &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; 9, on the 24th day of the 1st month (March 14, 1632). His Buddhist posthumous name is . His ashes were ceremoniously laid to rest in the Taitoku-in Mausoleum in Edo.

<text>Christian mortalism is the Christian belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal and may include the belief that the soul is &quot;sleeping&quot; after death until the Resurrection of the Dead and the Last Judgment, a time known as the intermediate state. &quot;Soul sleep&quot; is often used as a pejorative term, so the more neutral term &quot;mortalism&quot; was also used in the nineteenth century, and &quot;Christian mortalism&quot; since the 1970s. Historically the term psychopannychism was also used, despite problems with the etymology and application. The term thnetopsychism has also been used; for example, Gordon Campbell (2008) identified John Milton as believing in the latter.

Christian mortalism stands in contrast with the traditional Christian belief that the souls of the dead immediately go to heaven, or hell, or (in Catholicism) purgatory. Christian mortalism has been taught by several theologians and church organizations throughout history while also facing opposition from aspects of Christian organized religion. The Catholic Church condemned such thinking in the Fifth Council of the Lateran as &quot;erroneous assertions&quot;. Supporters include eighteenth-century religious figure Henry Layton, among many others.

==Etymology and terminology==
Since the phrases &quot;soul sleep&quot; or &quot;soul death&quot; do not occur either in the Bible or in early Patristic materials, an explanation is required for the origin of the term. Additionally, several other terms have been introduced which relate to the view. Modern theologians have used the term &quot;Christian mortalism&quot; and related wordings from the 21st century onwards.

===Soul sleep===
The phrase &quot;soul sleep&quot; appears to have been popularized by John Calvin in the subtitle to his Latin tract &quot;Psychopannychia&quot; (, , , ). The title of the booklet comes from Greek &quot;psyche&quot; (soul, mind) with &quot;pan-nychis&quot; (παν-νυχίς, all-night vigil, all-night banquet), so &quot;Psychopannychia&quot;, originally, represents Calvin&#x27;s view that the soul was conscious and active after death.

The title and subtitle of the 1542 Strasbourg 1st edition read: .

The title and subtitle of the 1545 2nd Latin edition read: .

The 1558 French edition was a translation of that of the 1545 2nd edition: 

===Other terms===
* &quot;Psychopannychism&quot; – In the Latin it is clearer that &quot;Psychopannychia&quot; is actually the refutation of, the opposite of, the idea of soul sleep. The version may have caused the confusion that by &quot;-pannychis&quot; Calvin meant sleep (in Greek &quot;-hypnos&quot;, sleep, not &quot;-pannychis&quot;, vigil). The subtitle was taken up as . The tract first appeared in English as .

Luther&#x27;s use of similar language (but this time defending the view) appears in print only a few years after Calvin:
* &quot;Hypnopsychism&quot; – from &quot;hypno-&quot; + &quot;psyche&quot; (&quot;sleep of soul&quot;) was a more correct coinage from Greek than that of Calvin&#x27;s editor. Eustratios of Constantinople (after 582) denounced mortalism as a heresy using this term.
* &quot;Thnetopsychism&quot; – A possibly contrasting phrase is (from Greek &quot;thnetos&quot; [mortal] + &quot;psyche&quot; [soul, mind]). The term has its origin in the descriptions of Eusebius of Caesarea and John of Damascus of mortalist views among Arab Christians, In the 1600s also this phrase was applied also to the views of Tyndale, Luther and other mortalists, from awareness that Calvin&#x27;s term &quot;Psychopannychia&quot; originally described his own belief, not the belief he was calling error. The term is also used of the view of the Anabaptists. Their view is that the soul dies, with the body to be recalled to life at the resurrection of the dead, or that the soul is not separate from the body and so there is no &quot;spiritual&quot; self to survive bodily death. In both cases, the deceased does not begin to enjoy a reward or suffer a punishment until Judgment Day.

==Mortalist arguments==
Historically, Christian mortalists have advanced theological, lexical, and scientific arguments in support of their position.

===Theological arguments===
Theological arguments which contended that the continued existence of the soul was not taught in the Bible were made by mortalists such as Francis Blackburne, Joseph Priestley, and Samuel Bourne. Mortalists such as Richard Overton advanced a combination of theological and philosophical arguments in favor of soul sleep. Thomas Hobbes likewise made extensive use of theological argumentation. Some mortalists viewed their beliefs as a return to original Christian teaching. Mortalists’ theological arguments were also used to contest the Catholic doctrine of purgatory and masses for the dead.

The British Evangelical Alliance ACUTE report states the doctrine of soul sleep is a &quot;significant minority evangelical view&quot; that has &quot;grown within evangelicalism in recent years&quot;. Although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of soul sleep into Eastern Orthodox thought about life after death, it has never been a part of traditional Eastern Orthodox teaching, and it even contradicts the Eastern Orthodox understanding of the intercession of the Saints.

Mortalists argue for soul sleep using Bible verses such as Psalm 6:5, 115:17, 146:4, Ecclesiastes 9:5, Luke 8:52-53, John 11:11–14, 1 Corinthians 15:51-54, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. Mortalists point to Genesis 2 and Revelation 22, where the Tree of Life is mentioned. It is argued that these passages, along with Genesis 3:22–24 teach that human beings will naturally die without continued access to God&#x27;s life-giving power.

As a general rule, soul sleep goes hand in hand with annihilationism; that is, the belief that the souls of the wicked will be destroyed in Gehenna (often translated “hell,” especially by non-mortalists and non-annihilationists) fire rather than suffering eternal torment. The two ideas are not exactly equivalent, however, because in principle God may annihilate a soul which was previously created immortal. While annihilationism places emphasis on the &quot;active&quot; destruction of a person, soul sleep places emphasis on a person&#x27;s dependence upon God for life; the extinction of the person is thus a &quot;passive&quot; consequence of separation from God, much like natural death is a consequence of prolonged separation from food, water, and air.

Mortalist writers, such as Thomas Hobbes in &quot;Leviathan&quot;, have often argued that the doctrine of natural (or innate) immortality stems not from Hebrew thought as presented in the Bible, but rather from pagan influence, particularly Greek philosophy and the teachings of Plato, or Christian tradition. Bishop of Durham N.T. Wright noted that 1 Timothy 6:15-16 teaches &quot;God… alone is immortal,&quot; while in 2 Timothy 1:10 it says that immortality only comes to human beings as a gift through the gospel. Immortality is something to be sought after (Romans 2:7) therefore it is not inherent to all humanity.

These groups may claim that the doctrine of soul sleep reconciles two seemingly conflicting traditions in the Bible: the ancient Hebrew concept that the human being is mortal with no meaningful existence after death (see שאול, Sheol and the Book of Ecclesiastes), and the later Jewish and Christian belief in the resurrection of the dead and personal immortality after Judgment Day.

===Lexical arguments===
In the late eighteenth century, the standard Hebrew lexicon and grammar of John Parkhurst expressed the view that the traditional rendering of the Hebrew word &quot;nephesh&quot; as reference to an immortal soul, had no lexical support. Mortalists in the nineteenth century used lexical arguments to deny the traditional doctrines of hell and the immortal soul.

===Scientific arguments===
The eighteenth-century mortalist Henry Layton presented arguments based on physiology. Scientific arguments became important to the nineteenth-century discussion of soul sleep and natural immortality, and mortalist Miles Grant cited extensively from a number of scientists who observed that the immortality of the soul was unsupported by scientific evidence.

==Historical proponents of the mortality of the soul==
The mortality of the soul has had a number of advocates throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity.

===Judaism===

Modern scholars believe the concept of an immortal soul going to bliss or torment after death entered mainstream Judaism after the Babylonian exile and existed throughout the Second Temple period, though both &#x27;soul sleep&#x27; and &#x27;soul death&#x27;, were also held.

Soul sleep is present in certain Second Temple period pseudepigraphal works, later rabbinical works, and among medieval era rabbis such as Abraham Ibn Ezra (1092–1167), Maimonides (1135–1204), and Joseph Albo (1380–1444).

Some authorities within Conservative Judaism, notably Neil Gillman, also support the notion that the souls of the dead are unconscious until the resurrection.

Traditional rabbinic Judaism, however, has always been of the opinion that belief in immortality of at least most souls, and punishment and reward after death, was a consistent belief back through the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. Traditional Judaism reads the Torah accordingly. As an example, the punishment of kareth (excision) is understood to mean that the soul is cut off from God in the afterlife.

===Christian views===

====Second century====
In the second half of the second century, Tatian wrote: &quot;The soul is not in itself immortal... If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved.&quot; Tatian&#x27;s contemporary Athenagoras of Athens taught that souls sleep dreamlessly between death and resurrection: &quot;[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life.&quot;

In Octavius, an account of a debate between a Pagan and a Christian by Marcus Minucius Felix, the Christian in the debate takes mortalism to be a matter of common agreement:

====Third to seventh centuries====

Mortalism in the early church in this period is testified by Eusebius of Caesarea:
 
This synod in Arabia would have been during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (244–249). Redepenning (1841) was of the opinion that Eusebius&#x27; terminology here, &quot;the human soul dies&quot; was probably that of their critics rather than the Arabian Christians&#x27; own expression and they were more likely simply &quot;psychopannychists&quot;, believers in “soul sleep”.

Some Syriac writers such as Aphrahat, Ephrem and Narsai believed in the &quot;dormition&quot;, or &quot;sleep&quot;, of the soul, in which &quot;...souls of the dead...are largely inert, having lapsed into a state of sleep, in which they can only dream of their future reward or punishments.&quot; John of Damascus denounced the ideas of some Arab Christians as &quot;thnetopsychism&quot; (&quot;soul death&quot;). Eustratios of Constantinople (after 582) denounced this and what he called &quot;hypnopsychism&quot; (&quot;soul sleep&quot;). The issue was connected to that of the intercession of saints. The writings of Christian ascetic Isaac of Nineveh (d. 700), reflect several perspectives which include soul sleep.

====Ninth to fifteenth centuries====
Soul sleep evidently persisted since various Byzantine writers had to defend the doctrine of the veneration of saints against those who said the saints sleep. John the Deacon (eleventh century) attacked those who &quot;dare to say that praying to the saints is like shouting in the ears of the deaf, as if they had drunk from the mythical waters of Oblivion.&quot;

Pope John XXII inadvertently caused the beatific vision controversy (1331–1334) by suggesting that the saved do not attain the beatific vision, or &quot;see God&quot; until Judgment Day (in Italian: &quot;Visione beatifica differita&quot;, &quot;deferred beatific vision&quot;), which was a view possibly consistent with soul sleep. The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John conceded to the more orthodox understanding. His successor, in that same year, Pope Benedict XII, declared that the righteous do see Heaven prior to the final judgement. In 1336, Pope Benedict XII issued the papal bull Benedictus Deus. This document defined the Church&#x27;s belief that the souls of the departed go to their eternal reward immediately after death, as opposed to remaining in a state of unconscious existence until the Last Judgment.

====The Reformation====
Soul sleep re-emerged in Christianity when it was promoted by some Reformation leaders, and it survives today mostly among Restorationist sects, such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Conti has argued that during the Reformation both psychosomnolence (the belief that the soul sleeps until the resurrection) and thnetopsychism (the belief that the body and soul both die and then both rise again) were quite common.

Anglican cleric William Tyndale (1494–1536) argued against Thomas More in favor of soul sleep:

Morey suggests that John Wycliffe (1320–1384) and Tyndale taught the doctrine of soul sleep &quot;as the answer to the Catholic teachings of purgatory and masses for the dead.&quot;

Some Anabaptists in this period, such as Michael Sattler (1490–1527), were Christian mortalists.

Martin Luther (1483–1546) is said to have advocated soul sleep, though certain scholars, such as Trevor O’Reggio, argue that his writings reflect a nuanced position on the subject. In writing on Ecclesiastes, Luther says:

Elsewhere Luther states that:

Jürgen Moltmann (2000) concludes from this that &quot;Luther conceived the state of the dead as a deep, dreamless sleep, removed from time and space, without consciousness and without feeling.&quot; That Luther believed in soul sleep is also the view of Michael R. Watts. Some writers have claimed that Luther changed his view later in life. Gottfried Fritschel (1867) claims that quotations from Luther&#x27;s Latin works had been misread in Latin or in German translation to contradict or qualify specific statements and what he perceived as Luther&#x27;s overall teaching, namely that the sleep of the dead was unconscious. These readings can still be found in some English sources.

Several passages, including the following examples, show that Luther&#x27;s views are more nuanced, or are even cited to show that he adhered to the doctrine of the immortality of the soul:
*

As such, Lutheran churches in the Missouri Synod affirm that &quot;The Confessions rule out the contemporary view that death is a pleasant and painless transition into a perfect world&quot; and reject both the ideas that &quot;the soul is by nature and by virtue of an inherent quality immortal&quot; and that &quot;the soul &#x27;sleeps&#x27; between death and the resurrection in such a way that it is not conscious of bliss&quot;.

On the other hand, others believing in soul sleep included Camillo Renato (1540), Mátyás Dévai Bíró (1500–45), Michael Servetus (1511–1553), Laelio Sozzini (1562), Fausto Sozzini (1563), the Polish Brethren (1565 onwards), Dirk Philips (1504–1568), Gregory Paul of Brzezin (1568), the Socinians (1570–1800), John Frith (1573), George Schomann (1574) and Simon Budny (1576).

====Seventeenth to eighteenth centuries====
Soul sleep was a significant minority view from the eighth to the seventeenth centuries, and it became increasingly common from the Reformation onwards.

Soul sleep has been called a &quot;major current of seventeenth century protestant ideology.&quot; John Milton wrote in his unpublished &quot;De Doctrina Christiana&quot;,

Gordon Campbell (2008) identifies Milton&#x27;s views as &quot;thnetopsychism&quot;, a belief that the soul dies with the body but is resurrected at the last judgment. however Milton speaks also of the dead as &quot;asleep&quot;.

Those holding this view include: 1600s: Sussex Baptists d. 1612: Edward Wightman 1627: Samuel Gardner 1628: Samuel Przypkowski 1636: George Wither 1637: Joachim Stegmann 1624: Richard Overton 1654: John Biddle (Unitarian) 1655: Matthew Caffyn 1658: Samuel Richardson 1608–1674: John Milton 1588–1670: Thomas Hobbes 1605–1682: Thomas Browne 1622–1705: Henry Layton 1702: William Coward 1632–1704: John Locke 1643–1727: Isaac Newton 1676–1748: Pietro Giannone 1751: William Kenrick 1755: Edmund Law 1759: Samuel Bourn 1723–1791: Richard Price 1718–1797: Peter Peckard 1733–1804: Joseph Priestley Francis Blackburne (1765).

====Nineteenth to twentieth centuries====
Belief in soul sleep and the annihilation of the unsaved became increasingly common during the nineteenth century, entering mainstream Christianity in the twentieth century. From this point it is possible to speak in terms of entire groups holding the belief, and only the most prominent individual nineteenth-century advocates of the doctrine will be mentioned here.

Others include: Millerites (from 1833), Edward White (1846), Christadelphians (from 1848), Thomas Thayer (1855), François Gaussen (d. 1863), Henry Constable (1873), Louis Burnier (Waldensian, d. 1878), the Baptist Conditionalist Association (1878), Cameron Mann (1888), Emmanuel Pétavel-Olliff (1891), Miles Grant (1895), George Gabriel Stokes (1897).

===Modern Christian groups===
Present-day defenders of soul sleep include Nicky Gumbel, Primitive Baptist Universalists, some Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Advent Christian Church, the Afterlife group, Christadelphians, the Church of God (Seventh Day), Church of God (7th day) – Salem Conference, the Church of God Abrahamic Faith, and various other Church of God organizations and related denominations which adhered to the older teachings of Herbert W. Armstrong&#x27;s Worldwide Church of God, and the Bible Student movement.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses teach a form of thnetopsychism, in that the soul is the body (Genesis 2:7) and that it dies (Ezekiel 18:20; Ecclesiastes 9:5,10). They believe that 144,000 chosen ones will receive immortality in heaven to rule as kings and priests with Christ in Heaven (Rev 7:4; 14:1,3) but all the other saved will be raised from the dead on the last day (John 5:28,29) to receive eternal life on a Paradise Earth (Revelation 7:9,14,17).

Seventh-day Adventists believe that death is a state of unconscious sleep until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as Ecclesiastes 9:5 which states &quot;the dead know nothing&quot;, and 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 which contains a description of the dead being raised from the grave at the second coming. These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.

==Critics/opponents==

===Immortality of the soul===
The orthodox Christian belief about the intermediate state between death and the Last Judgment is immortality of the soul followed immediately after death of the body by particular judgment. In Catholicism some souls temporarily stay in Purgatory to be purified for Heaven (as described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030–1032). Eastern Orthodoxy, Methodism, Anglicanism, and Mormonism use different terminology, but generally teach that the soul waits in the Abode of the Dead, specifically Hades or the Spirit World, until the resurrection of the dead, the saved resting in light and the damned suffering in darkness. According to James Tabor this Eastern Orthodox picture of particular judgment is similar to the first-century Jewish and possibly Early Christian concept that the dead either &quot;rest in peace&quot; in the Bosom of Abraham (mentioned in the Gospel of Luke) or suffer in Hades. This view was also promoted by John Calvin, although Calvin taught that immortality was not in the nature of the soul but was imparted by God. Nineteenth-century Reformed theologians such as A. A. Hodge, W. G. T. Shedd, and Louis Berkhof also taught the immortality of the soul, but some later Reformed theologians such as Herman Bavinck and G. C. Berkouwer rejected the idea as unscriptural. 

Opponents of (soul sleeping) and (the temporary death of the soul) include the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church (that also teach about Intercession of saints, connected to this subject), most mainline Protestant denominations, and most conservative Protestants, Evangelicals, and Fundamentalists.

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church has called soul sleep a serious heresy:
=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===

The idea that the spirit continues as a conscious, active, and independent agent after mortal death is an important teaching of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Concerning the post-death, pre-judgment place of human spirits, LDS scripture states that &quot;the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life&quot; (Alma 40:11). They are then assigned to a state of paradise or hell (called Spirit Prison) in the spirit world depending on their faith in Christ and the manner of their mortal life (Alma 40:12–14). The Spirits remain in these states until the final judgment, when they are either received into a state of glory in the Kingdom of God, or they are cast off into Outer Darkness.

Latter-Day Saint doctrine teaches that the souls in Prison who ended up there due to ignorance or inability to accept Christ may be preached to while in Prison so that they may accept Christ. This is derived from the LDS interpretation of 1 Peter 3:18–20 where Christ is described as preaching to the &quot;dead who were in prison&quot; and 1 Peter 4:5–6, which states:
Like many Eastern Orthodox and Catholics, the LDS Church teaches that the prayers of the righteous living may be of help to the dead, but the LDS Church takes this one step further with vicarious sacraments (called &quot;ordinances&quot; but with a sacramental theological meaning). The LDS Church preaches the necessity of baptism by water and the Holy Ghost (Baptism and Confirmation) for salvation. They teach that previously ignorant spirits who accept Christ in Spirit Prison may receive saving ordinances through vicarious Baptism and Confirmation of the living. This is drawn from 1st Corinthians 15, wherein the Apostle Paul is arguing against a group of Christians who are mistakenly denying the physical resurrection of the dead. Paul asks them in 1st Corinthians 15:29:
:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

The LDS Church believes that this is a reference to vicarious work for the dead which was practiced by the ancient Christian Church and considered orthodox in Early Christianity, including by the Apostle Paul, hence his use of it as an example of the correct doctrine of the resurrection. This is the origin of the LDS practice of baptism for the dead. As such, a great deal of LDS doctrine and practice is tied to the idea of the continued existence and activity of the human spirit after death and before judgment.

==Modern scholarship==
As early as 1917 Harvey W. Scott wrote &quot;That there is no definite affirmation, in the Old Testament of the doctrine of a future life, or personal immortality, is the general consensus of Biblical scholarship.&quot; The scholarly consensus of the 20th century held that the canonical teaching of the Old Testament made no reference to an immortal soul independent of the body in at least its earlier periods. This view is represented consistently in a wide range of scholarly reference works. In recent times, a minority of scholars have partially dissented from this view. According to Stephen Cook, scholars &quot;now hotly debate the older, commonplace position that the idea of a soul, separable from the body, played little or no role in preexilic Israel&quot; and that &quot;recent approaches to Israelite religion that are increasingly informed by archaeological artifacts are defending the view that Israel’s beliefs in an afterlife were much more vibrant than many scholars have been willing to admit.&quot;

According to Donelley, &quot;Twentieth century biblical scholarship largely agrees that the ancient Jews had little explicit notion of a personal afterlife until very late in the Old Testament period,&quot; and &quot;only the latest stratum of the Old Testament asserts even the resurrection of the body.&quot; Scholars have noted that the notion of the &quot;disembodied existence of a soul in bliss&quot; is not in accordance with a Hebrew world view: &quot;While Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities.&quot; Gillman argues that

However, N. T. Wright suggests that &quot;the Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death.&quot; While Goldingay suggests that Qohelet points out that there is no evidence that &quot;human beings would enjoy a positive afterlife,&quot; Philip Johnston argues that a few Psalms, such as Psalm 16, Psalm 49 and Psalm 73, &quot;affirm a continued communion with God after death,&quot; but &quot;give no elaboration of how, when or where this communion will take place.&quot;

Neyrey suggests that &quot;for a Hebrew, &#x27;soul&#x27; indicated the unity of a human person,&quot; and &quot;this Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. Avery-Peck argues that

Regardless of the character of the soul&#x27;s existence in the intermediate state, biblical scholarship affirms that a disembodied soul is unnatural and at best transitional. Bromiley argues that &quot;the soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man. Disembodied existence in Sheol is unreal. Paul does not seek a life outside the body, but wants to be clothed with a new and spiritual body (1 Cor. 15; 2 Cor. 5).&quot;

The mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul, is affirmed as biblical teaching by a range of standard scholarly Jewish and Christian sources. The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought (1995) says, &quot;There is no concept of an immortal soul in the Old Testament, nor does the New Testament ever call the human soul immortal.&quot; Harper&#x27;s Bible Dictionary (1st ed. 1985) says that &quot;For a Hebrew, &#x27;soul&#x27; indicated the unity of a human person; Hebrews were living bodies, they did not have bodies&quot;. says, &quot;But to the Bible man is not a soul in a body but a body/soul unity&quot;. says, &quot;Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul&quot; and &quot;The notion of the soul as an independent force that animates human life but that can exist apart from the human body—either prior to conception and birth or subsequent to life and death—is the product only of later Judaism&quot;. The says that the Septuagint translated the Hebrew word &quot;nefesh&quot; by the Greek word &quot;psyche&quot;, but the latter does not have the same sense in Greek thought. The says, &quot;Far from referring simply to one aspect of a person, &quot;soul&quot; refers to the whole person&quot;. The says, &quot;Possibly Jn. 6:33 also includes an allusion to the general life-giving function. This teaching rules out all ideas of an emanation of the soul.&quot; and &quot;The soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man&quot;. The says, &quot;Indeed, the salvation of the &quot;immortal soul&quot; has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical.&quot; The says &quot;The Hebrew Bible does not present the human soul (nepeš) or spirit (rûah) as an immortal substance, and for the most part it envisions the dead as ghosts in Sheol, the dark, sleepy underworld&quot;. The says, &quot;there is practically no specific teaching on the subject in the Bible beyond an underlying assumption of some form of afterlife (see immortality)&quot;. The says &quot;It is this essential soul-body oneness that provides the uniqueness of the biblical concept of the resurrection of the body as distinguished from the Greek idea of the immortality of the soul&quot;.

The mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul is also affirmed as biblical teaching by various modern theologians, and Hebblethwaite observes the doctrine of immortality of the soul is &quot;not popular amongst Christian theologians or among Christian philosophers today&quot;.

<doc id="296847" wikidata="Q458464" url="?curid=296847" title="John Astin">
<text>John Allen Astin (born March 30, 1930) is an American retired actor and director who has appeared in numerous stage, television and film roles, primarily in character roles. He is widely known for his role as patriarch Gomez Addams in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1964–1966), reprising the role in the television film &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; (1977) and the animated series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1992–1993).

Astin starred in the TV film &quot;Evil Roy Slade&quot; (1972). Other notable film roles include &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962), &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot; (1963), &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (1976), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996). Astin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for his directorial debut, the comedic short &quot;Prelude&quot; (1968).

Astin has been married three times. His second wife was actress Patty Duke, and Astin is the adoptive father of Duke&#x27;s son, actor Sean Astin.

==Early years==
Astin was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Margaret Linnie () and Allen Varley Astin, a physicist, who was the director of the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). At that time, Astin and his family resided on Battery Lane in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1952, after transferring from Washington &amp; Jefferson College. He studied mathematics at Washington &amp; Jefferson and then drama at Johns Hopkins; he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at Johns Hopkins.

==Career==

Astin started his performing career in theater, making his first Broadway appearance as an understudy in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1954) and also did voice-over work for commercials. He appeared as &quot;Ready-Money Matt&quot; in the long-running off-Broadway production of &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (which began in 1954), starring Lotte Lenya. His first big film break came with a small role in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961).

During this period, his talent for also playing comedy was spotted by actor Tony Randall, leading to guest starring roles on the sitcom &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, starring Jay North; &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;; and &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot;, starring Pat O&#x27;Brien, the first show broadcast on CBS and the latter two shows broadcast on ABC. In 1961, Astin appeared in the final episode of the ABC police drama &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;. On April 7, 1961 he played the role of Charlie in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, &quot;A Hundred Yards Over the Rim&quot; which starred Cliff Robertson.

During the 1962–63 television season, Astin had his first lead in a television series, the ABC sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot;, co-starring with Marty Ingels. Astin played Harry Dickens to Ingels&#x27;s Arch Fenster, as two trouble-prone carpenters. The series combined witty dialogue with moments of slapstick comedy. &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot; received critical raves, but was against two high-rated shows, &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; on NBC and &quot;Route 66&quot; on CBS. By the time &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot; gained a following and started winning its time slot, ABC had already canceled the show. A total of 32 episodes were produced.

Astin is widely known for &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, a popular sitcom that ran on ABC from 1964 to 1966, based on cartoons created by Charles Addams. Astin starred as Gomez Addams, the head of the macabre family. He later reprised the role of Gomez in the 1977 made-for-television film &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; and voiced the role of Gomez in the animated series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; from 1992 to 1993. In the Canadian-American television series &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, which ran from 1998 to 1999, Astin appeared as Grandpapa Addams, with the role of Gomez played by Glenn Taranto. With the death of Lisa Loring, who played Wednesday, in January 2023, Astin is the last surviving cast member of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

Astin joined the retooled &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot; (re-titled &quot;The Phyllis Diller Show&quot;) for the second half of the 1966–67 season, playing Diller&#x27;s brother-in-law, Angus Pruitt. He also played the Riddler in the second season of &quot;Batman&quot; (Frank Gorshin returned for the third and final season.)

Astin played submarine commander Matthew Sherman on the 1970s television series &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;. He also made several appearances in the first two seasons of the popular mystery series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, as scheming real estate developer (and finally Sheriff) Harry Pierce, who ends up as the murderer in his last episode. He had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; as Buddy, eccentric former mental patient and the father of lead character Harry Stone, who often ended his conversations with a big smile and the phrase,&quot;...but I&#x27;m feeling MUCH better now!&quot;

Astin played the regular role of Ed LaSalle on the short-lived Mary Tyler Moore sitcom &quot;Mary&quot; during the 1985–86 television season. He also guest starred on numerous television series, including appearances on &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;Homeboys in Outer Space&quot;, Jack Palance&#x27;s ABC circus drama &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, and a 1967 episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; as Festus Haggen&#x27;s cousin Henry.

Astin received an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Prelude&quot;, a short film that he wrote, produced, and directed. He was nominated for an Ace Award for his work on &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, and received an Emmy Award nomination for the cartoon voice of Gomez on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. He also voiced the character Bull Gator on the animated series &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;. Astin served for four years on the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America, and has been active in community affairs in Los Angeles and Santa Monica.

Astin has continued to work in acting, appearing in a string of &quot;Killer Tomatoes&quot; films as Professor Gangreen and as Professor Wickwire in &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;. In 1996 he featured as The Judge, the ghost of an Old West gunslinger, in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Frighteners&quot;. He also has toured the one-man play &quot;Edgar Allan Poe: Once Upon a Midnight&quot;, written by Paul Day Clemens and Ron Magid. In a December 2007 &quot;Baltimore Examiner&quot; interview, Astin said of his acting experience: 

Astin is a member of the board of directors of the Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts in Columbia, Maryland.

==Teaching==

Until his retirement in 2021, Astin was director of the Theater Arts and Studies Department and Homewood Professor of the Arts at Johns Hopkins University, his alma mater, which offers an undergraduate minor program. Commenting on his dual career, he said in 2007, &quot;I don&#x27;t know one major university that has a known actor teaching every day.&quot; Astin noted that he is one of only a handful to earn a drama degree from Hopkins. He taught at Hopkins from 2001 until 2021. Devika Bhise has been working with the university to create &quot;The Astin Fund&quot;, an endowed chair that would allow theater to be a major at Johns Hopkins University for undergraduates.

==Personal life==
Astin has five children; three (David, Allen, and Ashley) with his first wife, Suzanne Hahn, and two with his second wife, actress Patty Duke – one adopted (Sean, Patty&#x27;s son from an earlier relationship, whom Astin adopted during their marriage) and one biological (Mackenzie).

Astin married Valerie Ann Sandobal in 1989, and they live in Baltimore, Maryland. Astin is a vegetarian. He practices Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the worldwide Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International.

<text>John Donald Wade (September 28, 1892 – October 9, 1963) was an American biographer, author, essayist, and teacher.

==Early life==
Wade was born in Marshallville, Georgia. His father was a country doctor who served as a surgeon in the Civil War. Wade was descended from the first governor of Georgia, John Adam Treutlen.

Wade received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Georgia in 1914. While a student there, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and was awarded Phi Beta Kappa. Wade later earned a master&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1915. Since Harvard didn&#x27;t have a concentration in American literature at that time, Wade completed his Doctorate at Columbia University in 1924, studying under Dr. Trent. He served in World War I.

==Career==
Wade was a teacher at the University of Georgia between 1919 and 1926 where he was a key founder of the graduate program in American literature.

Wade developed an interest in biography and published &quot;Augustus Baldwin Longstreet: A Study in the Development of Culture in the South&quot; in 1925 and published a biography of Methodist Church leader John Wesley in 1930. His research for his Wesley biography was financed by a Guggenheim grant and took him to England to gather information. Wade researched and wrote 116 biographical sketches for the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; and served as an assistant editor for that work in 1927 and 1928.

By 1930 Wade was teaching at Vanderbilt University as a member of the English faculty and became involved with the Southern Agrarians. Wade is probably best remembered for his contribution to the Agrarian manifesto &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot;, which was named by Wade and published that year. His contribution to the manifesto was &quot;The Live and Death of Cousin Lucius,&quot; an exemplum of the Agrarian life. He also contributed to the Agrarian follow-up to &quot;I&quot;ll Take My Stand&quot; with his essay &quot;Of the Mean and Sure Estate.&quot;

He returned to the University of Georgia to be the head of the Department of Language and Literature, a position he held for many years.

In the 1930s and 1940s Wade wrote critical essays on Southern culture and biographical sketches of Southern literary and political figures that were published in learned journals such as the Virginia Quarterly. He also continued to support his agrarian ideals in his writing.

In 1941 he co-edited &quot;Masterworks of World Literature&quot;. In 1950 he retired from active teaching but continued to work as founding editor of &quot;The Georgia Review&quot; and was active in his local community, forming the Marshallville Foundation to foster his home town. He became a horticulturist and planted many gardens with plants from all over the world.

==Death==
Wade died on October 9, 1963, in Marshallville.

<text>Ernest Becker (September 27, 1924 – March 6, 1974) was an American cultural anthropologist and author of the 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ernest Becker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents. Serving in the infantry during World War II, he would help liberate a Nazi concentration camp. After he completed his military service, Becker attended Syracuse University in New York. Upon graduation he joined the U.S. Embassy in Paris as an administrative officer.

In his early 30s, he returned to Syracuse University to pursue graduate studies in cultural anthropology, and would complete his PhD in 1960. The first of his nine books, &quot;Zen: A Rational Critique&quot; (1961) was based on his doctoral dissertation.

===Professional career===

After graduating from Syracuse University in 1960, Becker began &quot;the short 14-year period of his professional career&quot;
as a professor and writer. Initially, he taught anthropology in the Department of Psychiatry at the Upstate Medical College in Syracuse, New York, but was summarily fired, along with other non-tenured professors, for supporting tenured Professor Thomas Szasz in a dispute with the administration over academic freedom. After a year in Italy, Becker was hired back at Syracuse University, this time in the School of Education.

In 1965, Becker acquired a lecturer position at the University of California, Berkeley in the anthropology program. However, trouble again arose between Becker and the administration, leading to his departure from the university. At the time, thousands of students petitioned to keep Becker at the school and offered to pay his salary, but the petition did not succeed in retaining Becker. In 1967, he taught at San Francisco State&#x27;s Department of Psychology until January 1969, when he resigned in protest against the administration&#x27;s stringent policies against student demonstrations.

In 1969, Becker began a professorship at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, where he spent the final years of his academic life. During this time, Becker worked on the second edition of &quot;The Birth and Death of Meaning,&quot; to which he made extensive revisions. Next he wrote his 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning work &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;. Finally, he worked on drafts of &quot;Escape from Evil&quot;, but the latter was not completed at the time of his death.

Becker&#x27;s insistence on interdisciplinary work, along with the fact that students flocked to his lectures, which were marked by a high level of theatricality, did not endear him to many of his colleagues. Referring to his insistence on the importance symbolism plays in the human animal, he wrote, &quot;I have tried to correct... bias by showing how deep theatrical &#x27;superficialities&#x27; really go.&quot;

===Death===
In November 1972, Becker was diagnosed with colon cancer. Sixteen months later, on 6 March 1974, he would die from disease at the age of 49 in Burnaby, British Columbia. Shortly before his death, he participated in a series of interviews with Sam Keen for &quot;Psychology Today&quot;.

==Ideas and concepts==

As related above, Becker did not attain tenure when he was fired from his first academic position at Upstate Medical College in Syracuse, NY. This was a result of a dispute the school had with &quot;anti-psychiatrist&quot; Thomas Szasz, with whom Becker sided. This may be the reason Szasz&#x27;s views are sometimes imputed to Becker. However, Becker&#x27;s support of Szasz was limited to the issue of academic freedom: that is, whether or not Szasz (who had tenure) had the right to teach his views to psychiatry students.

During the final decade of his life, Becker used the ideas and concepts from many different writers and thinkers to write his books and teach his classes. To list just a few of these thinkers who helped formulate many of his theories, many point to how Becker draws on the work of Søren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Norman O. Brown, Erich Fromm, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and especially Otto Rank.

===&quot;The Birth and Death of Meaning&quot; ===
&quot;The Birth and Death of Meaning&quot;, published in 1962 and then extensively revised and republished in 1971, was &quot;Becker&#x27;s first attempt to explain the human condition.&quot; It takes its title from the concept of mankind progressing from simple-minded ape to a world of symbols and illusions, and then deconstructing those illusions through our own evolving intellect.

=== &quot;Revolution in Psychiatry&quot; ===
During this early period, Becker was formulating a &quot;fully transactional&quot; view of mental health that eventually formed the basis of his book, &quot;Revolution in Psychiatry&quot; (1964). Although Szasz is cited on a few key points in this book, Becker pursues a very distinct path.

=== &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; ===
In his 1973 book &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;, Becker came to believe that an individual&#x27;s character is essentially formed around the process of denying one&#x27;s own mortality, that this denial is a necessary component of functioning in the world, and that this character-armor masks and obscures genuine self-knowledge. Much of the evil in the world, he believed, was a consequence of this need to deny death.

=== &quot;Escape From Evil&quot; ===
Becker eventually came to the position that psychological inquiry can only bring us to a distinct threshold beyond which belief systems must be invoked to satisfy the human psyche. The reach of such a perspective consequently encompasses science and religion, and led to what Sam Keen suggested was Becker&#x27;s greatest achievement: the writing of &quot;Escape from Evil&quot;, left unfinished at the time of Becker&#x27;s death, but posthumously published in 1975.

==Influence and legacy==

Two months after his death, Becker was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his book, &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; (1973), posthumously gaining him wider recognition. &quot;Escape From Evil&quot; (1975) was intended as a significant extension of the line of reasoning begun in &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;, developing the social and cultural implications of the concepts explored in the earlier book. Although the manuscript&#x27;s second half was left unfinished at the time of his death, it was completed from the manuscript that existed as well as from notes on the unfinished chapter.

Since his death Becker&#x27;s work, particularly as expressed in his later books, &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; and &quot;Escape from Evil&quot;, has had a significant impact on social psychology and the psychology of religion. &quot;Terror management theory&quot;, an important research programme in social psychology that has spawned over 200 published studies has turned Becker&#x27;s views on the cultural influence of death anxiety into a scientific theory that helps to explain such diverse human phenomena as self-esteem, prejudice, and religion.

After his death, the Ernest Becker Foundation was founded, focused on multidisciplinary inquiries into human behavior. The foundation would focus on reducing violence in human society, using Becker&#x27;s basic ideas to support research and application at the interfaces of science, the humanities, social action, and religion.

&quot;Flight From Death&quot; (2003) is a documentary film directed by Patrick Shen, based on Becker&#x27;s work, and partially funded by the Ernest Becker Foundation.

<doc id="296851" wikidata="Q6458749" url="?curid=296851" title="LINE (combat system)">
<text>LINE is a close-quarters combat system, derived from various martial arts, utilized by the United States Marine Corps between 1989 and 1998, and then from 1998 to 2007 by US Army Special Forces. It was developed by Ron Donvito, USMC (Retired).

Officially, the name stands for &quot;Linear Involuntary Neural-override Engagement&quot;; this is, however, a backronym coined during the project&#x27;s inception.

== Design ==

The system was designed to be executed within specific and stringent combat-oriented conditions: 

* (a.) all techniques must not be vision dominant; techniques may be executed effectively in low-light conditions, or other impaired visibility conditions (i.e., smoke or gas)
* (b.) extreme mental and physical fatigue
* (c.) usable by the Marine / soldier while wearing full combat gear
* (d.) proper execution of the techniques must cause death to the opponent
* (e.) gender neutrality; must be usable by—and against—either gender

These parameters were viewed as the most likely conditions that a combat Marine or Soldier would face in close-range combat, since most close combat engagements were likely to occur at night or under reduced visibility, while the Marine or Soldier was fatigued and wearing their combat load, and when facing asymmetrical odds, such as a numerically superior force. These requirements meant that many flamboyant techniques, exotic kicks, or movements requiring extraordinary feats of strength or agility were excluded from consideration under the LINE system. Techniques like classic judo &quot;hip throws&quot;, for instance, were excluded because of the possibility of entanglement on a practitioner&#x27;s war-belt.

The system&#x27;s techniques were designed to be easily learned and retained through repetition. The requirement and demands that the system be drilled, repeated, and constantly revisited led to some criticism since the primary usersmilitary, including special operations, personneloften had enormous demands upon their time, and as a consequence often lacked the ability to maintain high degrees of proficiency in the techniques.

== History ==

===USMC===
LINE was adopted by the Marine Corps in 1989 at a Course Content Review Board (CRB) at Quantico, Virginia. All techniques were demonstrated for and deemed medically feasible by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (given a single attack opponent) and a board of forensic pathologists from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in 1991. LINE was replaced by the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) by Marine Corps Order 1500.54, published in 2002, although it had been actually dropped in 1998, as a &quot;revolutionary step in the development of martial arts skills for Marines and replaces all other close-combat related systems preceding its introduction.&quot;

===US Army Special Forces===

The LINE System was adopted in 1998 by U.S. Army Special Forces at the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC). Primary instruction took place during phase II and was remediated in phases III and V at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. LINE was replaced by the Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP) in October 2007.

===US Air Forces===

In 2007 the Chief of Staff of the Air Force read an article in the Air Force Times about Airmen training in the LINE system and ordered a review of all hand-to-hand combat in the Air Force which resulted in the Air Force adopting a program based upon the Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP).

<text>The University of Arkansas (U of A, UArk, or UA) is a public land-grant research university in Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States. It is the flagship campus of the University of Arkansas System. Founded as Arkansas Industrial University in 1871, classes were first held in 1872, with its present name adopted in 1899.

The university campus consists of 378 buildings spread across of land in Fayetteville, Arkansas. As of Fall 2023, total enrollment was 32,140. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and had spent $164.4 million on research in FY 2021.

The University of Arkansas&#x27;s athletic teams, the Arkansas Razorbacks, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) with eight men&#x27;s teams and eleven women&#x27;s teams in thirteen sports.

==History==

=== Early developments ===
The University of Arkansas was founded in 1871 on the site of a hilltop farm that overlooked the Ozark Mountains, giving it the nickname &quot;The Hill&quot;.

The university was established under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862. The university&#x27;s founding also satisfied the provision in the Arkansas Constitution of 1868 that the General Assembly was to &quot;establish and maintain a State University.&quot;

Bids from state towns and counties determined the university&#x27;s location. The citizens of Fayetteville and Washington County. pledged the most: $130,000 toward securing the university. Classes started on January 22, 1872.

=== Notable landmarks ===
Completed in 1875, Old Main, a two-towered brick building designed in the Second Empire style, was the primary instructional and administrative building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its design was based on the plans for the main academic building at the University of Illinois, which has since been demolished. At Arkansas, the taller tower is the bell tower, and the shorter tower is the clock tower. In addition to the regular chimes of the clock, the university&#x27;s Alma Mater plays at 5 pm every day.

Old Main contains classrooms, the restored Giffels Auditorium, as well as the administrative offices of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. The lawn at Old Main serves as an arboretum.

Beginning with the class of 1876, the names of students at University of Arkansas are inscribed in &quot;Senior Walk&quot; and wind across campus for more than four miles. More recently, the names of all the recipients of honorary degrees were added, including J. Edgar Hoover, Queen Noor, President Bill Clinton, and Hillary Clinton.

One unusual structure at Arkansas is the Chi Omega Greek Theatre, a gift to the school by the sorority&#x27;s national headquarters. It marked the first time a national sorority presented a memorial of its foundation to the institution where it was founded. Chi Omega was organized in 1895, at the University of Arkansas, and is the mother (Psi) chapter of the national organization. The largest crowd ever assembled in the theatre was for a concert by the Army Air Corps Band during World War II. From 1934 to 1991, the space under the stage was used for a rifle range by the Army ROTC.

=== African American history and African studies program ===
The first African American student, James McGahee, attended the University of Arkansas in 1872, following the university&#x27;s opening in 1871 during the Reconstruction era, to “prepare for the ministry of the Episcopal Church”. He is noted as having a grade average deemed excellent. Alongside McGahee, two other African American men, Mark W. Alexander and Isom Washington, are noted as having attended Arkansas Industrial College, however no record of their enrollment has been found. Following the end of Reconstruction, the racial dynamic shifted at the university and it is unknown if McGahee was able to continue his education following 1873.

Former state senator and U.S. congressman John N. Tillman served as president of the University of Arkansas from 1905 to 1912. In the Arkansas State Senate he proposed the Separate Coach Law of 1891, a Jim Crow law to segregate African American passengers. The bill became law and was enforced for many decades.

The University of Arkansas admitted Silas Herbert Hunt of Texarkana, an African American veteran of World War II to the university&#x27;s School of Law in 1948. Hunt&#x27;s enrollment was regarded as the first successful school integration below the Mason–Dixon line of that era. While Hunt was admitted into the university, his attendance was not met without controversy. African American students were permitted to attend the university, under the condition that they enroll as graduate or law students, and be taught in segregated classes. Unfortunately, Silas Hunt was only able to complete one year of education. In April 1949, Hunt was admitted to the VA hospital, where he later died of tuberculosis, aggravated by injuries he had sustained in the war.

Roy Wilkins, administrator of the NAACP, wrote in 1950 that Arkansas was the &quot;very first of the Southern states to accept the new trend without fighting a delaying action or attempting to... limit, if not nullify, bare compliance.&quot; In the fall of 1948 changes were made to the university&#x27;s segregation policy, which allowed for the admittance of African American students into regular classes. The first to follow Hunt was a law school student by the name of Jackie L. Shropshire, would later go on to become the university&#x27;s first black graduate in 1951. 1952 University of Arkansas Medical School graduate Edith Irby Jones, who was also admitted to the University of Arkansas in 1948, would be the first African American to be admitted in any Southern school. Several African American students followed in his footsteps, attending various graduate programs at the university. Arkansas was freely admitting African American students as early as 1957, while many southern states still prohibited black students from attending all white universities. The events in Little Rock at this time did some damage to race relations at the university that would not be fixed for some time.

In 1969, the university created the Black Studies Advisory Committee to facilitate the creation of a Black Studies program, which began in the fall semester of 1968 with 19 courses offered.

In 2004, the university provided resources to help support the program, establishing the John White Scholarship, Sankofa Registered Student Organization, and Ghana study abroad tour. In 2008, The Black Studies program was renamed the African and African American Studies (AAST) program and expanded its course offerings and student enrollment. In 2014, the program moved to a new space in Memorial Hall and was added to the University Core. A year later, an online minor and graduate certificate in African and African American Studies was established. The university hosted its first annual AAST Graduate Fellows search symposium in 2016 and established the Roy S. Bryce-Laporte scholarship later in 2018. In 2019, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees voted to rename halls B and C of the Northwest Quad in honor of Gordon Morgan and Margaret Clark, respectively. The university has also hosted guest lectures by Aldon D. Morris, Carol Anderson, and Nikole Hannah-Jones related to African and African American studies.

==== Notable people in African and African American history at the university ====
* Gordon Daniel Morgan – An alumnus and one of the first Black professors at the University of Arkansas, and was hired to teach sociology
* Margaret Clark – One of the first Black professors at the University of Arkansas, and was hired to teach world languages 
* Gerald Jordan – attended the University of Arkansas School of Journalism and Media, and is the university&#x27;s current Faculty and Athletics Representative to NCAA and SEC

==Campus==

The University of Arkansas campus sweeps across hilltops on the western side of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Among the 378 buildings on the campus, 11 buildings have been added to the National Register of Historic Places individually, with most buildings in the historic core being named as contributing properties to the University of Arkansas Campus Historic District.

Construction began on Old Main in 1873 and was completed by 1875 in the Second Empire architectural style. Built with local brick and sandstone, Old Main serves as the university&#x27;s signature building. The building has remained on campus despite its recommended removal in the 1925 master plan from the architects of Jamieson and Spearl. This plan included destruction of all existing campus buildings and reconstruction in the Collegiate Gothic style. Several buildings were built in this style near the core of campus, including the Vol Walker Hall, Engineering Hall, Chemistry Building, Agriculture Building, and Home Economics Building. The plan ran out of funds and was never completed, leading to a somewhat haphazard arrangement of buildings after the 1930s.

The university&#x27;s oldest tradition is Senior Walk, which contains the names of graduates from each class of the university. Beginning at the front steps of Old Main and running along the sidewalks across campus, Senior Walk is adorned with more than 170,000 names of former students. This tradition is unique to American universities.

The Fine Arts Center was designed by Fayetteville native Edward Durell Stone, who also designed Radio City Music Hall and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. The buildings are indicative of Stone&#x27;s idiosyncratic modern style which included patterns of ornament. Stone also designed a fraternity house, now used for academic purposes, and an apartment complex named Carlson Terrace on campus, which has since been demolished.

The east end of the University of Arkansas campus is adjacent to Dickson Street, which is one of the premier entertainment districts in the state. To the south of the university is Fayetteville High School, which contains nationally recognized academic and athletics programs.

Many buildings are listed as part of the University of Arkansas Campus Historic District on the United States National Register of Historic Places.

===Sustainability===
One of the university&#x27;s stated goals is &quot;promote environmental sustainability.&quot; In 2008, Arkansas adopted a climate action plan, including the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020 and to become carbon-neutral by 2040. In 2008, the university signed a $22.9 million contract with Energy Systems Group to make energy improvements to 56 buildings, a program named &quot;Razor&#x27;s EDGE.&quot; The program was designed with a payback period of 13 years based upon projected electricity and water savings.

===System facilities===

Altogether there are thirteen branches and six other units in the University of Arkansas System, including the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock; four-year campuses in Fayetteville, Fort Smith, Little Rock, Monticello, and Pine Bluff; and two-year community or technical college campuses in Batesville, De Queen, Helena-West Helena, Hope, Mena, North Little Rock, and Morrilton. Units also under the UA System include the Clinton School of Public Service, the Criminal Justice Institute, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, the Division of Agriculture, the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute, and the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts.

The University of Arkansas was the home for the Southeastern Conference Academic Consortium, SECAC, where the 14 member schools of the Southeastern Conference pool resources to assist each other academically (the Consortium later relocated to Birmingham, Alabama, where the SEC has its headquarters).

==Academics==
The University of Arkansas offers more than 200 programs of study leading to bachelors, masters, doctoral, and law degrees. Academic programs are organized into numerous departments and schools based out of the ten primary colleges on the main campus. The following degree-granting academic divisions are located on the Fayetteville campus:



The Honors College and Global Campus do not award degrees but provide degree programs with honors coursework and distance education opportunities, respectively, for the Fayetteville campus:
=== Research ===
Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA Agricultural Chemistry Professor Barnett Sure. Sure co-discovered vitamin E and extended knowledge of how vitamin E, amino acids, and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik also developed the process for parboiling rice (a major agricultural crop in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of Agricultural Chemistry, which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.

In the 1920s, Loy Barton, an engineering graduate student at the University of Arkansas, set forth the principle of high-level Class B plate modulation for radio transmission and developed the technology that allowed small- and medium-size AM radio stations to flourish across the United States. Barnett later joined RCA and continued research on broadcast technology into the 1960s.

The most widely implemented automated mail sorting equipment in the world–the Wide Area Bar Code Reader–was developed by the University of Arkansas College of Engineering. A $50,000 grant from the United States Postal Service (USPS) to Professors Dwight F. Mix and J.E. Bass in 1989 began the research and development effort. By 1999, more than 15,000 University of Arkansas bar code readers were located in every major USPS facility, increasing the efficiency of processing 20 billion pieces of mail a year at a savings of $200 million. This R&amp;D effort has spawned four additional electronic systems to help the USPS &quot;read the mail.&quot;

During the 1980s, Professors Allen Hermann and Zhengzhi Sheng of the Department of Physics researched superconductivity, the phenomenon whereby Direct Current (DC) electricity, once started, can flow essentially forever. The Thallium-based material they discovered at Arkansas held the world&#x27;s record for high temperature, 125K, for five years (1988–93) and drew international attention to the university. Their work led to patents and a manufacturing agreement, as well as further advances in high-density electronics.

University of Arkansas plant pathologists conducted research in the early 1970s that led to COLLEGO, the first biological herbicide for weed control in a field crop. Other UA scientists and students worked on the project that resulted in EPA registration of COLLEGO by Upjohn in 1982 for control of northern jointvetch in rice and soybeans. The work provided a model used worldwide to develop biological herbicides. Leadership in this area helped the U of A obtain grants from the USDA and others for construction of the Rosen Center for Alternative Pest Control.

Professor Peter Ungar, a palaeoanthropologist and palaeoecologist in the Department of Environmental Dynamics, has pioneered novel methods of reconstructing the diets of extant and extinct animals. In particular, Ungar has used dental microwear to determine the diets of extinct hominins such as &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, and &quot;Homo naledi&quot;, overturning earlier assumptions about ancient hominin diets based solely on jaw and tooth morphology. In addition to his work on hominins, Ungar has also used dental microwear to study the diets of extinct lemurs, rodents, canids, ursids, tragulids, cervids, bovids, and suids. In 2024, Ungar was chosen to become a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America for his contributions to the study of the diets of ancient organisms.

==Athletics==

The mascot for the University of Arkansas is the Razorback, a type of wild boar, and Arkansas teams are often referred to as the Hogs (shortened version of Razorbacks). The school competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in Division I of the NCAA. 
From 1971 through 2007, Arkansas had separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic departments. On January 1, 2008, the two departments merged, leaving fellow SEC school Tennessee as the only remaining NCAA Division I school with separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic programs.

===Football===
A football team began representing the University of Arkansas in 1894 and has since become one of the nation&#x27;s top 25 programs in terms of all-time wins at the Football Bowl Subdivision level. The program was a charter member of the Southwest Conference (SWC) in 1915 and remained in that conference until departing for the Southeastern Conference in 1991, where Arkansas has remained. From 1915 to 1991, the Razorbacks won the SWC championship 13 times and the national championship in the 1964 season, with great success coming under coaches Frank Broyles, Lou Holtz and Ken Hatfield. Today, the team plays its home games on campus at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, or at War Memorial Stadium, located in Little Rock, making the University of Arkansas the only Division I program with two home stadia. Arkansas has also had recent success in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era, obtaining its first BCS berth in the 2011 Sugar Bowl and climbing as high as #3 in the BCS rankings in 2011 under Bobby Petrino.

===Basketball===
Men&#x27;s Basketball: The men&#x27;s basketball team plays their home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus, one of the largest home arenas in college basketball. The team won the 1994 National Championship under coach Nolan Richardson, and has been to six Final Fours (1941, 1945, 1978, 1990, 1994, 1995). Arkansas basketball was the winningest program in the Southwest Conference, winning the conference 22 times, the most of any of the SWC schools. This conference dominance led the Hogs to be named the eighth-best program in history by &quot;Street and Smith&#x27;s&quot; magazine.

Women&#x27;s Basketball: The Razorback women&#x27;s basketball team, like the men&#x27;s basketball team, plays home games in Bud Walton Arena, often referred to as the &quot;Basketball Palace of Mid-America.&quot; The building is located on the University of Arkansas campus. The women&#x27;s basketball team completed its 39th season in 2014–15, and has made 21 post season appearances. The Razorbacks made their first NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four appearance in 1998, with the help of team leader Christy Smith, and made history as the lowest seed (#9) in the west to advance. On March 7, 2020, the team made it to the semifinals in the SEC tournament in Greenville, South Caroline, with coach Mike Neighbors and were ranked #22 for the 2019–20 season, which has been the team&#x27;s highest ranking since January 2011. This was also the first time the Lady Razorbacks have been ranked in the top 25 since 2015 and started off the season in the top 25 since 2002.

=== Baseball and Softball ===
Men&#x27;s Baseball: The Arkansas baseball team has had success both in the Southwest Conference, and in the Southeastern Conference. Between 1979 and 1989, the Diamond Hogs appeared in the College World Series four times, including a runner-up finish in 1979. Since joining the SEC, the team has been to the 2004, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2022 College World Series. The team plays home games in Baum Stadium, recognized in 1998 by Baseball America magazine as being one of the top collegiate ballparks in America, and was #3 in 2009 according to Rivals.com. The stadium has recently undergone expansion, including 20 new skyboxes (34 in all) and seats behind the bullpen in left field, and further expansion to enclose the park with seating has been included in the Athletic Facilities Master Plan. On April 7, 2009, a stadium record 11,044 fans saw a 7–3 Razorbacks victory over the #1 Arizona State Sun Devils. A weekend series with LSU in 2007 drew 29,931, which is the SEC all-time attendance record for a three-game series.

Women&#x27;s Softball: The Arkansas Razorback softball team plays their home games at Bogle Park, located on the University of Arkansas campus. Bogle Park was made possible thanks to the lead gift made by Bob and Marilyn Bogle and the Bogle family, who have also made significant contributions to the university and the Athletics Department over the course of many years. An event celebrating the naming was held Friday, October 26, 2009. The Lady Razorbacks participate in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference, also known as the SEC. The team has made NCAA Tournament appearances in: 2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

===Track and Field===
Men&#x27;s Track and Field: The most successful program in NCAA history, the Arkansas men&#x27;s track and field and cross country teams are the most decorated teams in the athletics department. The program has won a total of 41 national titles (19 Indoor Championships, 11 Outdoor Championships, and 11 Cross Country Championships), the last being the 2013 Indoor Track and Field National Championship (the 2004 and 2005 Outdoor Championships were later vacated due to NCAA infractions). One of its most famous stars is graduate Alistair Cragg who competed for Ireland at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. Other Olympians have included Michael Conley, Daniel Lincoln, Graham Hood, Wallace Spearmon, Paul Donovan, and Matt Hemingway. The team has a home indoor track at the Randal Tyson Track Center and outdoor field at John McDonnell Field, which hosted the 2009 NCAA Outdoor Track Championships. The team won the 2009, 2010, and 2012 SEC Indoor Track Championships, along with the 2009 and 2011 SEC Outdoor Championships and the 2010, 2011 and 2012 SEC Cross Country Championships. The men&#x27;s track and field team won the triple crown in 2012.

Women&#x27;s Track and Field: The women&#x27;s track and field team won its first national championship at the 2015 NCAA Indoor Championships, held in Fayetteville. Coached by Lance Harter, team members took first place in pole vault, the 3000-meter run and the distance-medley relay. Top competitors include Olympians Veronica Campbell-Brown and Deena Kastor, who set the American marathon record at the 2006 London Marathon. Since then, the team has won four NCAA Division I championships, two in indoor track and field, and two in outdoor track and field. The team also swept the 2019 calendar, winning the indoor, outdoor and cross country national championships. The athletes have access to indoor training and racing facilities at the Randal Tyson Track Center and outdoor facilities at John McDonnell Field located on the University of Arkansas campus.

===Women&#x27;s Athletics===

The women teams at the University of Arkansas are also referred to as Razorbacks. There are 11 varsity women sports: basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, and volleyball. Among the most successful women teams are volleyball with 11 SEC Western Division titles; cross country with more SEC championships than any member institution; basketball with 12 postseason appearances in 30 years, including the 1998 NCAA Final Four; track &amp; field with six SEC titles and the first back-to-back women&#x27;s SEC triple crowns; and gymnastics, nationally ranked since the start of the program in 2002 with five NCAA Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Championship appearances. Sprinter Veronica Campbell was the first Razorback woman to win a gold medal in the Olympics, with marathoner Deena Kastor, an alumna, bringing home a bronze medal in 2004.

Gymnastics: In 2019, Jordyn Wieber was hired as the University of Arkansas head coach, following the retirement of Mark Cook. Wieber has a very impressive background, as she was one of the &quot;Fierce Five,&quot; in the 2012 Summer Olympics. The gymnastics team, referred to as the GymBacks, practice at the Bev Lewis Center for Women&#x27;s Athletics and compete in Barnhill Arena. As for the 2020 season, the team now holds seven beam titles and nine floor titles. The GymBacks started the 2020 season ranked #19 by the Women&#x27;s Collegiate Gymnastics Association. This is the 14th year in a row the gymnastics team has been ranked in the top 20.

Volleyball: The Razorback volleyball team practices and plays in the legendary Barnhill Arena, which used to house the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams before moving to Bud Walton Arena in 1993. As of 2013, the volleyball team had made 11 NCAA Tournament appearances. In 2015, the Razorbacks were one of just three teams ranked top 10 nationally in both hitting percentage and opponent hitting percentage. In more recent years, four Razorback volleyball players were invited to the US Women&#x27;s Volleyball tryouts in February 2020.

Swim and Dive: In 2016, the swim and dive team placed 11th at the SEC Conference Championship and, the following year, the team placed 10th. The 2020–21 season was kicked off on November 7, with the team facing the Missouri Tigers. There were fourteen events held that day and the Razorbacks won seven of them. The impressive Brooke Schultz, earned NCAA Zone qualifying scores on the 3-meter and 1-meter springboard events.

==Student life==
There are over 350 registered student organizations on campus including special interest, religious, international and cultural organizations, honorary and professional service groups, and more.

The most recognized student organization on campus is the Associated Student Government, sometimes simply called &quot;ASG.&quot; The student government is active in managing student fees, meeting with key university administrators and is actively involved in many important decisions made on the University of Arkansas Campus. Perhaps the most significant program on campus, ASG, along with University Parking &amp; Razorback Transit, and with the support of the DRJ-III Memorial Foundation, manage the Safe Ride program which gives students a safe ride home from any unsafe or uncomfortable situation.

Arkansas is home of &quot;The Razorback&quot;, a national award-winning student yearbook, UATV, a student-run television station, and The Arkansas Traveler, a national-award-winning student newspaper established in 1906. The university is also home to two radio stations: KUAF, a public radio station and NPR affiliate, and KXUA, an eclectic student-run station.

The University of Arkansas Press is known for publishing works on local and Southern history, as well as its strong poetry series, including books of poetry by former President Jimmy Carter and the former national poet laureate Billy Collins.

===Greek life===
There are dozens of fraternities and sororities on campus. 31% of University of Arkansas students participate in Greek Life.

==Traditions==

===Senior walk===

The names of University of Arkansas students, starting with the first senior class of 1876, are carved into one of the concrete walkways or sidewalks on campus. This tradition was started by the 1905 graduating class of students, who drew their names into the walkway in front of Old Main. Through most of the 20th century, the names were impressed in wet cement using brass letters. In 1986, the university&#x27;s physical plant developed a special machine to engrave the thousands of names required each year. In 2020, to preserve the walk, the university replaced it with high-grade monumental concrete, reinforced with steel bar, and the names were sandblasted in their original handwriting.

=== Spoofer&#x27;s Stone ===

Sitting at the edge of Old Main lawn is Spoofer&#x27;s Stone, a large chunk of limestone left behind by a broken oxcart after the completion of the construction of Old Main in 1875. The large stone quickly became a resting spot for students. At this time, male and female students were not allowed to interact on campus. Female students began leaving letters in the rock for their male friends (or romantic interests). In 1933, the female students at the university noticed the damage done to the stone from regular wear and tear and decided to have the stone mounted in a concrete base. A plaque was added to the stone commemorating the 1932-33 class who raised the money for the repair. In the years after, Spoofer&#x27;s Stone became a popular engagement spot for couples who met while attending the University of Arkansas. It became tradition for couples who were engaged there to chip off a small piece of the stone as a memento.

=== &quot;Calling the Hogs&quot; ===

Fans of the University of Arkansas have been &quot;Calling the Hogs&quot; since the 1920s. This tradition, which refers to the school&#x27;s most popular cheer at sporting events, is said to have begun when a group of farmers attending a game began issuing hog calls to encourage a lagging Razorback football team. The encouragement worked and the attending crowd took notice of the farmers&#x27; calling. By the next game, a group of men had organized to cry &quot;Wooo, Pig, Sooie&quot;. The call has since become the school&#x27;s best-known cheer.

===Alma mater===
The University of Arkansas &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was written in 1909 by Brodie Payne, an alumnus of the University of Arkansas. Henry D. Tovey, director of the Glee Club at the time, set the song to music.

===Fight song===

Originally known as the &quot;Field Song&quot;, the words and tune of the University of Arkansas Fight Song were written in 1913 by William Edwin Douglas while he was an undergraduate. Music was added by Henry D. Tovey, Douglas&#x27;s music professor, and the song eventually became adopted as the &quot;Arkansas Fight Song&quot;.

===School colors and mascot===
The school color of cardinal red (Pantone #201) was chosen as the official school color by a vote of the student body in 1895. The two color choices were cardinal and heliotrope. White was added as a complementary color at a later date.
The University of Arkansas mascot has not always been the Razorbacks. From 1894, when the football program began, until 1910, the official mascot was the Cardinals to complement the school color of cardinal red. In 1909, according to school lore, the head football coach Hugo Bezdek gave a speech to a large group of students at the Fayetteville train station after returning from a victory over LSU in 1909 during an undefeated season. Coach Bezdek informed the crowd that his team had performed &quot;like a wild band of Razorback hogs.&quot; Although students had begun referring to the team as the Razorbacks as early as 1907, Bezdek&#x27;s statement popularized the use of Razorback for the team. The Razorback, which is characterized by a ridged back and tenacious wild fighting ability, had long been associated with the backwoods of Arkansas. The students loved the comparison, and the nickname became increasingly popular. In 1910, the student body voted to change the official university mascot from the Cardinal to the Razorback.

Live hogs were occasionally brought to football games as early as the 1920s, but providing a permanent live mascot dates back to the 1960s and a number of hogs have represented Arkansas since then. Tusk, a 380-pound Russian boar that closely resembles a wild razorback hog, is the current official live mascot. He resides on a local farm and leaves his home to attend all Arkansas home football games, and other select events.

Additionally, the University of Arkansas has a family of uniformed mascots. &quot;Big Red&quot;, (also known as the &quot;Fighting Razorback&quot;), is the traditional mascot for the university and attends all athletic events. &quot;Sue E&quot; is the female hog and &quot;Pork Chop&quot; is the kid mascot. &quot;Boss Hog&quot; is a nine-foot inflatable mascot that joined the mascot family during the 1998–99 football season.

===Razorback Marching Band===

The Razorback Marching Band, one of the oldest collegiate bands in the United States, was formed in 1874 as the Cadet Corps Band as part of the military art department. The band participated in all the formalities of the Military Art Department, as well as playing for football games, pageants, and commencement exercises. In 1947, following a steady post World War II growth, the Cadet Corp Band was divided into the three current bands, a football band, a concert band, and an R.O.T.C. band. In 1956, the band adopted the name &quot;Marching Razorbacks.&quot; In 2006, the Razorback Marching Band was awarded the highest honor bestowed upon a collegiate marching band, the Sudler Trophy. The band has also performed at the 2011 Allstate Sugar Bowl, the 2012 AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic, many other bowl games and even at Dallas Cowboys football games. As of 2020, the 350-member Razorback Marching Band, along with the Hogwild Pep Band and four concert bands, make up over two percent of the university&#x27;s undergraduate population.

===Schola Cantorum===

The University of Arkansas Schola Cantorum was created in 1957 by founding director Richard Brothers. Since then, Schola Cantorum has proudly represented the University of Arkansas across the country and on various international concert tours. In 1962, Schola Cantorum was the first choir to win The Guido d&#x27;Arezzo Award—at the prestigious International Polyphonic Competition in Arezzo, Italy. In honor of its achievement, Schola Cantorum soon after appeared on NBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; and performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden. At every graduation ceremony, Schola Cantorum sings the National Anthem, the alma mater, and an invocation. The choir participates at national and global events, as well as a number of events on campus.

<text>Bori Bunder (also known as Bori Bandar) is an area along the Eastern shore line of Mumbai, India.

== Background ==
This place was used as a storehouse for goods imported and exported from Mumbai. In the local language, &#x27;Bori&#x27; mean sack and &#x27;Bandar&#x27; means port. It could also be a corruption of &#x27;Bhandaar&#x27; meaning store.

== Transport ==
In the 1850s, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway built its railway terminus in this area and the station took its name as Bori Bunder.

<text>211 is a special abbreviated telephone number reserved in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) as an easy-to-remember three-digit code to reach information and referral services to health, human, and social service organizations.

Like the emergency telephone number 911, 211 is one of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).

== History ==
===United States===
For many years, New York Telephone (now a unit of Verizon) used 211 as an automated credit request number for disconnected or misdialed calls. This service was in service from the 1970s through the early 2000s.

Before the introduction of direct long-distance dialing, the long-distance operator was reached by dialing 211 for placing a long-distance call. When the states in the US and provinces in Canada were assigned area codes in 1947 by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), direct distance dialing (DDD) using the area code and the local number was introduced starting in 1951, eventually eliminating the use of the prefix. After that, the local telephone providers designated &quot;00&quot; for long-distance operator access.

In 1986, the United Way of San Diego created its INFO LINE in partnership with the County and City of San Diego. The United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta introduced a 211 service in 1997. Many states began implementation plans soon after, aided by the United Way of America in partnership with the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems, or AIRS (renamed Inform USA in July 2023)AIRS operates as a charitable organization, providing information and referral services for nonprofit and government sectors. On July 20, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved 211 for nationwide use as a short number in the United States along with 5-1-1 for transportation. In Texas, particularly in the Coastal Bend area, 211 is also the number to call for elderly and disabled people needing evacuation assistance in the event of a pending disaster such as a hurricane. The role of libraries in information and referral including 211 has been considered with a case study in Mississippi,

As of 2017, close to 95% of the population in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.) has access to 211 services. More than two-hundred agencies, including United Ways, provide 211 services. The largest population without access to 211 was the metro-Chicago area up until January 2023. In 2017, the 211 network in the U.S. answered close to 15 million requests for assistance through phone, text, and web chat.

===Canada===
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the use of 211 throughout Canada on August 9, 2001. The first Canadian 211 service opened in Toronto on June 13, 2002. 211 services are free of charge and multilingual in Canada.

As of October 2020, the whole of Canada, including the territories, has had access to 2–1–1 thanks to a nationwide expansion, following the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Canada, 211 offers free and confidential information and referral for all non emergency needs.

== Operation ==
211 center hours vary. Many are open 24/7 to refer callers to organizations that provide services in such areas as:

*Addiction counseling
*Affordable housing
*Alzheimer&#x27;s assistance
*Child care
*Debt counseling
*Disaster relief
*Donation opportunities
*Education
*Emergency food, such as food banks and soup kitchens
*ESL
*Financial assistance
*Homeless services
*Job counseling
*Parenting programs
*Psychotherapy counseling
*Senior citizen programs
*Suicide prevention
*Telephone reassurance, care for the elderly
*Volunteer opportunities
*Youth programs

Where available, 211 is operated by a private non-profit community-service organization, local government or local United Ways, which are part of the broader United Way Worldwide network. 211 provides information and referral to callers on where to obtain assistance from local and national social service programs, local and national governmental agencies and local and national non-profit organizations as well as where to volunteer or make a donation locally. Referrals are often given from databases accessed by call specialists. These databases are maintained by 211 staff following stringent data management guidelines. The databases are typically local but in some cases linked together to form statewide databases.

Many 211 centers are exploring Memorandums of Understanding with state and federal governments to facilitate the efficient handling of future disasters. Television or radio stations could easily tell citizens to call 211 in the event of an emergency. Call specialists at these centers would be informed of current disaster plans or places to receive help and could then inform the public of the correct course of action. After Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast region, 211 centers were instrumental in coordinating with local government officials and providing information to communities before and after local disasters. Furthermore, 211 providers in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Florida were called upon to provide assistance to individuals fleeing Puerto Rico&#x27;s devastation.

== Availability ==
=== United States ===
As of May 2017, the service is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and 95% of the U.S. population has access to 211 services by dialing 211 on a landline or cell phone. In 2017, the 211 network answered close to 15 million requests for assistance by phone, text, and chat.

The &quot;Windsor Star&quot; has reported on March 20, 2003, that Windsor, Ontario, intended to have a 211 service up by 2009, as the Provincial Government allocated $311,000 to start it up, with much of the money being donated by the United Way of Canada, but had a set time limit on how long those funds would be available. On November 26, 2007, the City of Windsor&#x27;s website announced that 211 service for Windsor and Essex County began, and was being run by the United Way (who also runs the local 3-1-1 service).

Plans to introduce 211 services are also in development in other Canadian communities. Ontario extended 211 province-wide in 2012 and Nova Scotia&#x27;s province-wide 211 deployment will be fully operational in 2014. In British Columbia, 211 services are administered by bc211, and is available on Vancouver Island\Gulf Islands and in the Metro Vancouver, Squamish-Lillooet, Sunshine Coast Regional District and Fraser Valley and regional districts, with plans to expand the services provincially.

In some communities, unused X-1-1 codes were assigned as plant test numbers for telephone installers testing individual lines. In the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, for instance, when 211 was dialed, it caused a busy signal to occur and the dialer&#x27;s telephone line would &quot;go dead&quot; for several minutes afterward. These codes must first be &quot;recovered&quot; by moving the test functions elsewhere (958 and 959 are standard reserved local and long-distance test exchanges in most areas) to permit redeployment as local public information numbers.

== Accreditation ==
=== United States ===
The American accrediting body for 211 centers is Inform USA, formerly the Alliance of Information &amp; Referral Systems (AIRS). Inform USA provides an accreditation process for 211 centers and certifies 211 Call Center Representatives as Certified Information and Referral Specialists (CIRS), Certified Information and Referral Specialists for Aging (CIRS-A) and Certified Resource Specialists (CRS) annually. Inform USA standards have been created to provide a benchmark for 211 centers and its staff. The standards regulate nationally how a 211 centers provides services and how they collect and store information.

INFOLINE of Los Angeles, an information and referral services agency serving the greater Los Angeles area, developed a national taxonomy of human services that provides a standard language for information and referral providers nationally. AIRS adopted this taxonomy as its national standard for use in the field of information and referral. This taxonomy provides standard definition of terms, an exact coding structure for referrals and search methodology for providing referrals to consumers.

Accredited 211 centers must have active Memorandums of Understanding with local 9-1-1 service as well as domestic violence providers, elder care providers, mental health providers and local law enforcement.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, professional certification is handled by InformCanada InformCanada – Fédération Inform Canada. The national 211 initiative is a partnership between InformCanada and United Way of Canada – Centraide Canada.

Work is underway to create a bilingual, Canadian Taxonomy of human services based on the AIRS/Infoline Taxonomy. This project is led by InformCanada and significant steps have been made on the creation of a starter taxonomy by the 211 Ontario phase 2 project, funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation and the government of Canada. Updates on the Canadian Taxonomy Project are maintained by 211.ca.

== Implementation process ==
The number 211 must be captured and approved for assigning through the local telecom companies providing services in the local area. The process of implementing a 211 service in a community has taken many paths since its beginning in 1997. Some places have a centralized statewide system while others have decentralized regional networks with different types of affiliations.

In the United States, each implementation is monitored by the national accrediting entity Alliance of Information &amp; Referral Systems (AIRS) and its local statewide affiliate.

In Canada, the deployment of 211 service is subject to InformCanada accreditation and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approval.

<text>The Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love (also called the &quot;Manual&quot; or &quot;Handbook&quot;) is a compact treatise on Christian piety written by Augustine of Hippo in response to a request by an otherwise unknown person, named Laurentius, shortly after the death of Saint Jerome in 420. It is intended as a model for Christian instruction or catechesis.

As the title indicates, the work is organized according to the three graces necessary for the Christian worship of God: Faith, Hope and Love. Under Faith, Augustine explains the use of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, in teaching Christian doctrine and in refuting heresies. Under Hope, he briefly explains the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as a model of Christian prayer. The final part is a discourse on Christian love.

<text>Giuliano de&#x27; Medici (28 October 1453 – 26 April 1478) was the second son of Piero de&#x27; Medici (the Gouty) and Lucrezia Tornabuoni. As co-ruler of Florence, with his brother Lorenzo the Magnificent, he complemented his brother&#x27;s image as the &quot;patron of the arts&quot; with his own image as the handsome, sporting &quot;golden boy&quot;. He was killed in a plot known as the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478.

==Personal life==
In 1478, Giuliano was promised in marriage to Semiramide Appiani Aragona, daughter of Iacopo III Appiani, Prince of Piombino and niece of his presumed lover Simonetta Vespucci, though died before the wedding could take place. After Giuliano&#x27;s death, Semiramide married his cousin, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, in 1482.

Giuliano had an illegitimate son by his mistress Fioretta Gorini, Giulio di Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, who would later become Pope Clement VII.

The Pazzi conspirators attempted to lure Giuliano and Lorenzo away from Florence to kill them outside the boundaries of the city – first on the road to Piombino, then in Rome, and finally at a banquet hosted by the Medici at their villa in Fiesole. Giuliano did not come, claiming to be ill. The choice to commit the murder at high mass was a last minute choice.

==Death==

As the opening stroke of the Pazzi conspiracy, Giuliano was assassinated on 26 April 1478 – in the Duomo of Florence, Santa Maria del Fiore, by Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi and Bernardo Baroncelli. During Mass, at the sounding of the Elevation, he received a fatal sword wound to the head and was stabbed 19 times. He died lying on the cathedral floor. Lorenzo, who had escaped to the Medici palace, did not learn of his brother&#x27;s death for several hours.

After a modest funeral on 30 April 1478, Giuliano was buried in his father&#x27;s tomb in the Church of San Lorenzo, but later, with his brother Lorenzo, was reinterred in the Medici Chapel of the same church, in a tomb surmounted by a statue of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; of Michelangelo. After his death, at least two sonnets about Giuliano circulated in Florence, one of them written by Luigi Pulci for Lucrezia Tornabuoni the mother of Giuliano.

==Portrayals in media==
Angelo Poliziano wrote two works which include Giuliano de&#x27; Medici as a major character. &quot;Stanze cominciate per la giostra del Magnifico Giuliano de’ Medici&quot; was written to commemorate a joust that Giuliano won in 1475. It is mostly fictionalized and involves Giuliano&#x27;s love for Simonetta Vespucci. It was left unfinished, for both of his protagonists (Giuliano and Simonetta) died. The other work is &quot;Coniurationis Commentarium&quot;, which was written in 1478 to commemorate Giuliano&#x27;s murder. It explains the people involved in the plot and the events of the day of his assassination.

Giuliano&#x27;s portrait by Sandro Botticelli is thought to have been painted shortly after his death. The open window and dove were known symbols of death, and some have suggested that the lowered eyelids suggest that a death mask may have been used as reference.

Giuliano makes a brief appearance in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; (2009) where he is murdered by Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi and other conspirators of the Pazzi conspiracy who were seeking to take over Florence under the command of Rodrigo Borgia, the future Pope Alexander VI.

Giuliano is portrayed by Tom Bateman in Starz&#x27;s original series &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot; (2013–2015). He has an affair with Vanessa, who becomes pregnant with his child. He is murdered in the season 1 finale. Giuliano de&#x27; Medici was portrayed by Bradley James in the second season of the TV series &quot;&quot; (2016–2019).

Giuliano&#x27;s murder is described in Jack Dann&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Shadows in the Stone&quot;.

<text>Giuliano di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (12 March 1479 – 17 March 1516) was an Italian nobleman, the third son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and a ruler of Florence.

==Biography==

Born in Florence, he was raised with his brothers Piero and Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, who became Pope Leo X; as well as his cousin Giulio de&#x27; Medici, who became Pope Clement VII.

His older brother Piero was briefly the ruler of Florence after Lorenzo&#x27;s death, until the republican faction drove out the Medici in 1494. Giuliano moved therefore to Venice. The Medici family was restored to power after the Holy League drove the French forces that had supported the Florentine republicans from Italy. This effort was headed by Spain with the support of Pope Julius II. Giuliano reigned in Florence following his brother&#x27;s election to the papacy in 1513, until he died in 1516.

He married Filiberta (1498–1524), daughter of Philip II, Duke of Savoy, on 22 February 1515 at the court of France, thanks to the intercession of his brother Giovanni, now pope as Leo X, in the same year that King Francis I of France (Filiberta&#x27;s nephew) invested him with the title Duke of Nemours (which had recently reverted once again to the French crown) on the occasion. The French were apparently grooming him for the throne of Naples (in which the French maintained a historical interest), when Giuliano died prematurely. He was succeeded in Florence by his nephew Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici.

Giuliano left a single illegitimate son, Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, who became a cardinal.

His portrait, painted in Rome by Raphael (a painter favored by Leo), shows Rome&#x27;s Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo behind a curtain. (A studio version is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)

Giuliano&#x27;s tomb in the Medici Chapel of the Church of San Lorenzo, Florence, is ornamented with the &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Day&quot; of Michelangelo, along with a statue of Giuliano by Michelangelo. He shares an identical common name (Giuliano de&#x27; Medici) with his uncle Giuliano di Piero de&#x27; Medici, whose tomb is also in the Medici Chapel and who is famous for having been assassinated in the Pazzi Conspiracy.

<doc id="296869" wikidata="Q375595" url="?curid=296869" title="The Injustice to Dou E">
<text>Dou E Yuan, commonly translated as The Injustice to Dou E, and also known as Snow in Midsummer, is a Chinese zaju play written by Guan Hanqing (c. 1241–1320) during the Yuan dynasty. The full Chinese title of the play is Gan Tian Dong Di Dou E Yuan, which roughly translates to &quot;The Injustice to Dou E that Touched Heaven and Earth&quot;. 

The story follows a child bride turned widow, Dou E, who is wrongly convicted of crimes by a corrupt court official for actions perpetrated by a rejected suitor, Zhang the mule. After her execution, three prophesied phenomena occur to prove her innocence, including blood raining from the sky, snow in June and a three-year drought. After a visit from the ghost of Dou E, her father eventually brings the corrupt court official, a doctor and Mule Zhang to justice, thereby vindicating his daughter. 

Today, the phrase &quot;snowing in June&quot; is still widely used among Chinese speakers as a metaphor for a miscarriage of justice. The story has been repeatedly used and modified by later dramatists and remains one of Guan&#x27;s most popular works.

==Story==

===Prologue===
Dou Duanyun, a young maiden from Chuzhou (楚州; present-day Huai&#x27;an District, Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu), is sold to the Cai family as a child bride because her father, Dou Tianzhang, owed large amounts of money and could not repay his debts. She is renamed &#x27;Dou E&#x27;.

===Act 1===
Dou E&#x27;s husband died two years after their marriage, leaving behind Dou E and her mother-in-law to depend on each other. Dou E and her mother-in-law are bullied by Sai Lu Yi, an unscrupulous physician. Sai Lu Yi almost kills Dou&#x27;s mother-in-law by strangling her. Dou E and her mother-in-law are saved by the hooligan Zhang Lü&#x27;er and his father. Zhang pretends to offer them &quot;protection&quot; and moves into their house against their will, and then tries to force Dou E to marry him but she refuses.

===Act 2===
Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law has a sudden craving for soup. Zhang Lü&#x27;er plots to murder Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law so that he can seize Dou E for himself after the older woman dies. He blackmails Sai Lu Yi for poison by threatening to report the physician to the authorities for his earlier attempt to murder Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law. He puts the poison in the soup and hopes that Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law will drink it and die. However, Zhang&#x27;s father drinks the soup instead and dies from poisoning. Zhang Lü&#x27;er then frames Dou E for murdering his father.

Dou E is arrested and brought before the prefecture governor, Tao Wu, who subjects her to various tortures to force her to confess to the crime. Then Tao Wu threatens Dou E by torturing her mother-in-law. Dou E does not want her mother-in-law to be implicated so she admits to the murder. Tao Wu sentences her to death by beheading.

===Act 3===
Dou E is brought to the execution ground. Before her execution, she swears that her innocence will be proven if the following three events occur after she dies:

* Her blood will spill on her white clothes, not a single drop will drip onto the ground.
* There will be heavy snowfall in the sixth lunar month (in the midst of summer) and the thick snow will cover her dead body.
* Chuzhou will experience a drought for three years.

All three events happened after Dou E&#x27;s death.

===Act 4===
Three years later, Dou E&#x27;s ghost appears before her father, Dou Tianzhang, who has become a &quot;lianfangshi&quot; (廉訪使; a senior government official) in the Anhui and Jiangsu region, and tells him all her grievances. Dou Tianzhang orders a reinvestigation of the case and the truth finally comes to light. Dou E is posthumously proclaimed innocent while the guilty parties receive their due punishments: Sai Lu Yi is exiled to a distant land; Tao Wu is dismissed and barred from entering office again; Zhang Lü&#x27;er is given the death penalty.

Dou E also wishes that her father can allow her mother-in-law to live with him, and that he will help to take care of her mother-in-law. Dou E&#x27;s father agrees. The play ends here.

==Main characters==
* Dou E (竇娥), the main character, originally named Dou Duanyun (竇端雲). She was a devoted daughter-in-law who was framed for killing Zhang Lü&#x27;er&#x27;s father and sentenced to death. Subsequently, she was ultimately proven innocent after her death.
* Dou Tianzhang (竇天章), Dou E&#x27;s father. He became an official in the end and played a major role to posthumously prove his executed daughter&#x27;s innocence.
* Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law, referred to as Granny Cai (蔡婆) in the play. She was originally meant to be killed by Zhang Lü&#x27;er through lethal poisoning, but in a twist of fate, she escapes death as Zhang&#x27;s father was the one who drank the poison instead.
* Zhang Lü&#x27;er (張驢兒; literally &quot;Zhang the mule&quot; or &quot;Zhang the donkey&quot;), the main antagonist of the play, and the man responsible for Dou E&#x27;s plight. He was eventually executed by lingchi, as retribution for his crimes.
* Zhang Lü&#x27;er&#x27;s father, referred to as Zhang&#x27;s father (張父) in the play. He was killed by the poison that was meant for Dou E&#x27;s mother-in-law.
* Sai Lu Yi (賽盧醫; literally &quot;equivalent to the Physician from Lu&quot;), the physician who provided the poison that killed Zhang Lü&#x27;er&#x27;s father. &quot;Physician from Lu&quot; (盧醫) is the nickname of Bian Que, a famous physician in ancient China. Guan Hanqing was probably adding a touch of satire or irony when he named this character.
* Tao Wu (桃杌), the corrupt prefecture governor who sentenced Dou E to death. He was later dismissed from office upon the revelation of Dou E&#x27;s innocence and given a lifetime ban from taking up any governmental post.

==Problems of text and translation==
The scholar Stephen H. West notes that the texts of Yuan drama were edited and &quot;extensively altered&quot; by Zang Maoxun (1550–1620), whose &quot;Yuanqu xuan&quot; (元曲選) became the standard anthology. Zang rationalised both the language and the format of the plays he edited, rather than the &quot;coarser and more rugged – sometimes ragged – registers of language found in the early commercial editions of Yuan drama.&quot;

Almost all English translations before those in the anthology by West and Idema were based on Zang&#x27;s recensions. David Rolston remarks that &quot;West and Idema are clearly very interested in the levels of language in the plays they translate (their translations do not shy from highlighting the rawer or racier elements of plays in ways generally ignored or suppressed by other translators).&quot; Their translations, he says, will be more useful to those who are interested in the history of the theater and the plays, while the emphasis on readability in translations based on Zang&#x27;s texts, such as that by George Kao in the &quot;Columbia Anthology&quot;, will be more appealing to general readers.

==Adaptations==
===Chinese opera===
The play has been adapted into kunqu, as well as a 1956 Cantonese opera, &quot;The Summer Snow&quot;, by librettist Tang Ti-sheng.

Modern versions include the co-composition of Chen Zi and Du Yu in the 1960s, and Taiwanese composer Ma Shui-Long&#x27;s 1990 version.

===Theatre===
A contemporary reimagining of the play was staged in 2017 by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The play was directed by Justin Audibert, translated by Gigi Chang, and specially adapted by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig. It premiered in the US at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2018.

===Film and television===
The play has been adapted into films and television series:

* &quot;Snow Storm in June&quot; (), a 1959 film starring Cantonese opera actress Fong Yim Fun (芳豔芬) as Dou E and actress Yam Kim Fai (任劍輝) as Cai Changzong (蔡昌宗), her husband. Both actresses had the same roles in Tang Ti-sheng&#x27;s 1956 adaptation for stage performance.
* &quot;Chinese Folklore&quot; (民間傳奇), a 1976 Hong Kong television series produced by TVB, about various Chinese folk tales. One part is about Dou E, starring Louise Lee.
* &quot;Tianshi Zhong Kui&quot; (天師鍾馗; &quot;Heavenly Master Zhong Kui&quot;), a 1994 Taiwanese-Singaporean co-produced television series about Zhong Kui. One part of the series, titled &quot;Liu Yu Xue&quot; (六月雪; &quot;Snow in the Sixth Month&quot;), is about Dou E, starring Fu Juan (傅娟).
* &quot;Qian Nü Qiyuan&quot; (倩女奇冤), a 1998 Chinese television series adapted from the story of Dou E and other tales.
* &quot;Zhongguo Chuanshi Jingdian Mingju&quot; (中國傳世經典名劇), a 2005 Chinese television film series based on several well-known Chinese operas and plays. One section, spanning three episodes, is about Dou E, starring Su Jin (蘇瑾).

It is also at the centre of the plot of a 2023 Malaysian film, &quot;Snow in Midsummer.&quot;
