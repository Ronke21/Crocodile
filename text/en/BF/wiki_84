<text>Murray State University (MSU) is a public university in Murray, Kentucky, in the Southern United States. In addition to the main campus in Calloway County in southwestern Kentucky, Murray State operates extended campuses offering upper-level and graduate courses in Paducah, Hopkinsville, Madisonville, and Henderson.

==History==
Murray State University was founded after the passage of Senate Bill 14 by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which created two normal schools in the early 20th century to address the growing demand for professional teachers. One was to be located in the western part of the state, and many cities and towns bid for the new normal school. Rainey T. Wells spoke on behalf of the city of Murray to convince the Normal School Commission to choose his city. On September 2, 1922, Murray was chosen as the site of the western normal school, while Morehead was chosen for the eastern normal school. On November 26, 1922, John Wesley Carr was elected the first president of the Murray State Normal School by the State Board of Education. Believing it had the authority to elect the president, the Normal School Commission picked Rainey Wells as the first president. On May 15, 1923, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled for the State Board of Education, and Carr became Murray&#x27;s first president.

Murray State Normal School opened on September 24, 1923. In 1924, the first building on Murray State&#x27;s campus, the Administrative Building, was constructed. Before this, all MSU classes had been held on the first floor of what is now Murray Middle School, located on Main Street. Designed by Joseph &amp; Joseph in the Collegiate Gothic style the Administrative Building, later known as Wrather Hall, housed classrooms, a dining hall, offices, and a chapel. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and renovated soon after, finally being renamed to Wrather West Kentucky Museum, named for Murray State executive vice-president Marvin O. Wrather. All students lived at home or boarded with local families until the first dormitory, Wells Hall, was constructed in 1925. Wilson Hall was also completed under Carr&#x27;s presidency, with other structures in progress.

In 1926, Rainey T. Wells, recognized as the founder of Murray State, became its second president. Wells served from 1926 to 1932, and during this time Lovett Auditorium, Carr Health Building, and Pogue Library were all completed. In 1926, the Normal School was renamed Murray State Normal School and Teachers College, with a four-year curriculum, and the General Assembly granted it authority to confer baccalaureate degrees. In 1928, the college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1930, the name was changed to Murray State Teachers College and it was granted authority to offer liberal arts and pre-professional courses. The name was changed again in 1948 to Murray State College, with the expansion of the programs to include graduate-level courses, in 1966 the General Assembly authorized the Board of Regents to change the name to Murray State University.

== Shield ==
The &quot;Shield&quot; has the heraldic coat of arms of the family of William Murray, Earl of Mansfield, and Lord Chief Justice of Great Britain in 1756. William Murray is an ancestor of the Murray family from whom the city and the university take their names. The shield is blue with a double gold border—its three stars represent hope, endeavor, and achievement.

==Campus==

===Quad===

The oldest and most easily recognizable buildings on the Murray State campus are situated around a large, grassy, tree-lined area on the south side of the campus. This part of the campus, known as the Quad, is bounded by 16th Street to the west, 15th Street to the east, Lovett Auditorium to the north, and Wilson Hall to the south.

In the southwest corner of the Quad is the oldest building on campus, now known as Wrather West Kentucky Museum. It was first known as the Administration Building and then as Wrather Hall, and housed classrooms and offices, before it became a museum. Ground for Wrather was broken on October 15, 1923, and it has been in use since 1924. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and features a large auditorium that is frequently used for lectures and meetings.

Faculty Hall, Wells Hall, and the Business Building line the western edge of the Quad. The Lowry Center, Pogue Library, and the Price Doyle Fine Arts Center line the eastern side of the Quad. The 11-story Doyle Fine Arts Center is the tallest building on campus, housing numerous classrooms, practice rooms, recital halls, the Robert E. Johnson Theatre, Clara Eagle Art Gallery, WKMS-FM, and television studios used for student work.

Directly south of the Quad is Sparks Hall. The five-story, 39,000-square-foot (3,600 m2), Sparks Hall was completed in 1967 for $1,308,514, and functions as the main administrative building, housing the offices of student financial aid, admissions and registration, accounting and financial services, vice president for administrative services, Center for Continuing Education and Academic Outreach, human resources and university communications.

To the south of the Quadrangle, and directly west of Sparks Hall is Oakhurst, the residence of the university president. Construction of the mansion, originally known as Edgewood, began in 1917 and was completed in 1918. The home was built by Dr. and Mrs. Rainey T. Wells. The Board of Regents purchased the home from Rainey T. Wells in June 1936. It was remodeled that year and renamed Oakhurst in preparation for James H. Richmond&#x27;s occupation of the house.

===Central campus===
The central portion of the Murray State campus lines 15th Street between Chestnut Street and Olive Boulevard. This portion of 15th Street was originally open to automobile traffic but has since been closed and converted into a pedestrian thoroughfare. Along the west side of the pedestrian pathway are the Martha Layne Collins Center for Industry and Technology, Blackburn Science Building, and Oakley Applied Science Building. To the east of the pedestrian pathway lies the Curris Center, Carr Health Building and Cutchin Fieldhouse, Waterfield Library, Mason Hall, and the front facade of the now-demolished Ordway Hall. Woods Hall, a former dormitory located behind Waterfield Library, was razed in the summer of 2019, and the space it occupied will soon be replaced with a park.

Ordway Hall was the most historic building in the central portion of campus. It was completed in 1931. Originally used as a men&#x27;s dormitory, 38,600-square-foot Ordway Hall later housed event space and several offices. Because of costly renovation needs, Ordway was razed in 2013. The front facade was retained as a monument to its significance.

===Science campus===

An aggressive building campaign on campus has resulted in a westward expansion of the main academic campus of Murray State. The expansion began with a massive renovation and expansion of what is now known as Alexander Hall on the west side of 16th Street near Calloway Avenue. The project was the first to unveil a new architectural style that would become consistent through all renovation and new construction projects on campus. Alexander Hall houses classrooms and offices for the College of Education. Construction continued with the new state-of-the-art science complex for biology and chemistry that is located just to the southwest of Alexander Hall. The massive new science complex was constructed in phases, with the Biology Building opening in 2004, and the rest of the complex and centerpiece clock tower reaching completion in March 2008. The new clock tower was dedicated in 2007 as the Jesse L. Jones Family Clock Tower. A physics and engineering building was completed in the summer of 2017.

===Sports and recreation facilities===

The majority of the university&#x27;s sports and recreation facilities are located on the northernmost edge of the campus, along the KY-121 Bypass. The most prominent structure in the sports complex is Roy Stewart Stadium. The stadium, the home field to the Murray State Racers football program, was completed in 1973 and named for former Murray State football coach Roy Stewart. It seats 16,800. The outdated AstroTurf surface was replaced with FieldTurf in 2007. Located on the second floor of the seven-story press box and seating structure is the Pat Spurgin Rifle Range, home of the three-time NCAA champion rifle squad. The 8,602-seat CFSB Center was completed in 1998 to replace the aging Racer Arena, which had been outgrown by the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Racer Arena remains in use by the women&#x27;s volleyball team.

On April 16, 2005, the new Susan E. Bauernfeind Student Recreation and Wellness Center was dedicated. The student recreation center includes a swimming pool, two racquetball courts, a walking/jogging track, an aerobic studio, basketball courts, and free weights and cardio workout machines. The center is located just north of the residential colleges, near Roy Stewart Stadium.

===Residence halls===
A building campaign is underway to replace many of the older residence halls. A replacement building for Clark College was completed and ready for residents at the beginning of the 2007 fall semester. Clark Hall was the newest building, and the first residence hall specifically designed around the residential college concept and model. A new four-story, 270-bed, 79,900-square foot Richmond Hall was opened for James H. Richmond Residential College in fall 2009. It has a similar concept and design as Clark College. In the fall of 2009, the old Clark Hall building was torn down.

Following the completion of the spring 2011 semester, the university began renovation to Elizabeth Hall, which houses the Elizabeth Residential College. The $7.2 million renovation project closed the building for the entire 2011–12 academic year as the highrise was upgraded to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. The renovation also included new heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver status. The renovated Elizabeth Hall reopened on August 18, 2012. Hester Hall is the next highrise residence hall scheduled for renovation; however, the timeline for that project has not been announced.

==Academics==
Murray State University offers eleven associate programs, 64 bachelor programs, 42 master and specialist programs, and three doctoral programs which are administered through four academic colleges, two schools, 30 departments, and one joint program shared by the College of Business and the College of Science, Engineering, and Technology. The College of Business is the largest at Murray State, enrolling 23% of the undergraduate students.

Murray State has been institutionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, continuously since 1928. It is one of eight schools in the state of Kentucky to achieve AACSB accreditation of business programs; however, the school is not AACSB-accredited in accounting programs. Several other programs have achieved specialized accreditation: primarily programs in teaching, fine arts and nursing. As a former normal school and teachers&#x27; college, Murray State is best known for its NCATE-accredited education programs. The Clinical Psychology Master&#x27;s program is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC). The university has also gained national recognition for its fine arts programs. The Department of Music has been a member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1936.

===Rankings===
For 29 years, Murray State University has been recognized by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; as one of the top regional universities in the United States. The 2019 rankings listed Murray State at 11th place among the public regional universities in the South and 24th overall among all regional universities in the South. Murray State has consistently been one of the top-ranked public regional universities in Kentucky in the Regional Universities-South category, which consists of both private and public schools. Murray State has also been ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; among America&#x27;s Top Colleges since 2008.

==Tuition policies==
Presumably, due to its location near multiple state borders, Murray State offers discounts from its normal out-of-state tuition rates to residents of several regional states. These discounts apply only to residential students; all online students pay the same rate regardless of residency. Tuition for doctoral students also does not vary by state of residence.
* Residents of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Mississippi receive what Murray State calls a &quot;regional&quot; rate for both undergraduate and graduate programs.
* Residents of Tennessee receive the regional rate for graduate programs, but undergraduate programs receive a special rate between the regional and in-state rates.
* Residents of specific counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee are treated as Kentucky residents for tuition purposes:
** Illinois: Massac County (directly across the Ohio River from Paducah, the largest city in Murray State&#x27;s home Purchase region)
** Indiana: Posey, Vanderburgh, and Warrick Counties (all directly across the Ohio from Kentucky; Evansville is in Vanderburgh County)
** Tennessee: Henry, Montgomery, Obion, Stewart, and Weakley Counties (all bordering Kentucky; Clarksville is in Montgomery County)

==International students==
401 international students from 45 countries studied at Murray State as of 2021. MSU has several international student groups, including the International Student Organization, the Saudi Student Association, and the Indian Student Association.

Murray State University provides an English as a Second Language (ESL) program to assist international students who are not fluent in English to come to Kentucky to study. This program provides English-speaking, listening, reading, and writing instruction while teaching students about American culture. The ESL program also offers conversation partner practice, where international students are paired with students from the United States to practice speaking English.

==Campus life==

===Residential colleges===

As of fall 2012, Murray State had 2,831 students living on campus. Murray State was the first public university in the United States to adopt a successful campus-wide residential college program. The residential college structure, which took form on the campus in 1996, is based on similar, but much more established programs at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom as well as Yale University, Harvard College and Princeton University in the United States.

The Murray State model does not include some components of the classical residential college model, such as dining halls and libraries at each college. In the Murray State model students do share central dining areas and recreation areas. However, as the older structures are being phased out, the university is taking steps with the new residential colleges to address many of those needs.

Although the physical structures of all of Murray State&#x27;s residential colleges do not match those of institutions such as Oxford or Yale, the basic residential college concept was successfully implemented. All faculty, staff, and students, even those who live off-campus, are assigned to one of the eight residential colleges. Once assigned to a residential college, a person remains a member of that college throughout their time at the university.

==== Eight colleges ====
# Clark College, named for Lee Clark, who assisted Rainey T. Wells in founding the university. Clark later served as the superintendent of grounds and buildings. The current Clark College opened in August 2007 as the first new residence hall built on campus since 1970. It is also the first residence hall at Murray to be specifically designed to support the residential college concept.
# Elizabeth College, named for Elizabeth Harkless Woods, wife of fourth Murray State President Ralph H. Woods
# Hart College, named for George Hart, a Board of Regents member and former mayor of Murray
# Hester College, named for Cleo Gillis Hester, who served Murray State University from 1927 to 1960, as registrar
# Regents College, named in honor of the outstanding citizens who have served on Murray State University&#x27;s Board of Regents; completed in 1970
# Richmond College, named for the third president of the university, James H. Richmond
# Springer-Franklin College, named for O.B. Springer, member of the Board of Regents from 1950 to 1958 and 1960 to 1970, and Hollis C. Franklin, who served on the board from 1947 to 1956
# White College, named for R.H. &quot;Bob&quot; White, a Board of Regents member

===Student Government Association===
The Student Government Association (SGA) is the officially organized body governing all students and student organizations at Murray State University. Its purpose is to promote the welfare, growth, and development of student life in an environment of academic excellence, to represent the students in all phases of administrative effort, and to provide a means of promoting cooperative efforts for the general welfare of the university community. The SGA is made up of four branches: Senate, Campus Activities Board, Judicial Board, and the Residential College Association. The Senate is the main branch of SGA, and it is the governing body with the power to pass resolutions, bills, rules, and regulations necessary for the general welfare of the university, and to implement and maintain any programs consistent with SGA purposes. The president of SGA holds the student seat on the Board of Regents.

===Greek life===
Murray State is home to twenty-six chapters of both social and professional Greek organizations. The oldest social fraternity on campus is Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and the oldest professional fraternity is Sigma Alpha Iota (both relating to music) with the oldest social sorority being Sigma Sigma Sigma. As of the spring 2016 semester, 1,438 students were officially reported to be involved with Greek life, representing 19% of the undergraduate student population. 

As of Fall 2019, 16% of undergraduate students make up Murray State Greek Life. The average chapter size for the Panhellenic Council is 93; Interfraternity Council is 50; and National Pan-Hellenic Council is 5. The average Greek GPA is 3.20. (All statistics come from the Murray State University Office of Greek Life website.) 

Greek life has been banned on campus several times in past decades, namely 2012 and 2018. The 2012 incidents involved Alpha Gamma Rho and Alpha Tau Omega fraternity houses. The 2018 ban on Greek life and social events followed the death of 19-year-old Zach Wardrip. In both cases, several persons were hospitalized for alcohol poisoning and ensuing violence. In 1998, a fatal dormitory fire on campus was attributed to GLOs.

===Traditions===

====Alma mater====
The alma mater of Murray State University is sung to the tune of &quot;Annie Lisle&quot; and has two verses. A.B. Austin, one-time Dean of Men, wrote the words in 1935. It is traditionally sung at student orientation, convocation and commencement ceremonies, athletic events, and other special events on campus.

====All-Campus Sing====
All-Campus Sing is an annual event, first held in 1958, that takes place each April in which residential colleges, fraternities, sororities, and other student organizations compete in a choreographed song and dance competition. The event is hosted by the Iota Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota (the original organizer of the event), with financial assistance from the MSU Alumni Association and the Office of Student Affairs. It is held on the steps of historic Lovett Auditorium.

====Campus Lights====
Campus Lights is the longest-running student-produced and performed musical in the South. The show was started in 1938 by the Gamma Delta chapter of Phi Mu Alpha as a fundraiser to pay the chapter&#x27;s chartering fees. Campus Lights is now produced by a joint effort of the Gamma Delta chapter of Phi Mu Alpha and the Iota Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota. All proceeds from the show are given to the Department of Music to fund scholarships.

====Racer One====
In 1976, the tradition of having a thoroughbred run around the track after every MSU football touchdown began. The name of that first racehorse was Violet Cactus. She died in 1984 and was buried at Roy Stewart Stadium, near the area where the current Racer One begins its run around the football field after a Racer touchdown. She is the only mascot to be interred inside the walls of the stadium. Since 1985, each horse that has circled the football field after touchdowns has been known as Racer One. Several horses have filled the role of Racer One since 1985, and the position is currently held by a horse named Vegas. Each fall, sophomores and juniors with riding experience can try out to serve as jockeys of Racer One for the following football season. The position is typically held by a student in his or her senior year.

====Shoe Tree====

Located in front of Pogue Library, Murray State tradition dictates if a couple gets married after meeting at Murray State, they return to the Quad and each one nails one of their shoes to the &quot;Shoe Tree.&quot; Many of the shoes include names and dates written on them. If the couple has a baby, the baby&#x27;s shoes are sometimes also nailed to the tree. The shoe tree tradition originated around 1965. This tree (due to the high zinc content from the nails) is a common target of lightning and has caught fire in the past. Previous incarnations of the Shoe Tree were removed in 1999 and 2015 due to safety reasons; the tradition continues through the third tree. The Shoe Tree was featured in Danish pop band Lukas Graham&#x27;s September 2018 music video for their song &quot;Love Someone.&quot;

====Tent City====
An annual tradition since 1989, Tent City is an event that takes place before every homecoming football game. At Tent City, more than 50 tents are set up on the track at Roy Stewart Stadium, representing fraternities, sororities, student organizations, and residential colleges. An average of 100 organizations participate each year. Students use this event as a chance to talk to and meet with alumni to help raise money for their activities throughout the school year.

==Athletics==


The Murray State athletic teams are called the Racers. Their historic nickname had been the &quot;Thoroughbreds&quot;, but all teams changed over time to &quot;Racers&quot;, with the last holdout of baseball making the change in 2014. The university is a member of the NCAA Division I ranks (for football, the Football Championship Subdivision), primarily competing in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) since the 2022–23 academic year. The Racers previously competed in the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) from 1948–49 to 2021–22; and in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (currently known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016–17 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1933–34 to 1947–48.

Murray State competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, and golf; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball; and co-ed sports include rifle.

===Move to the MVC===
In July 2022, Murray State and Belmont will both leave the OVC to join the MVC. Because the MVC does not sponsor football, Murray State plans to remain in OVC football for the 2022 season before leaving for the Missouri Valley Football Conference (a separate entity from the MVC) in 2023. MSU will also maintain OVC membership in rifle, another sport not sponsored by the MVC.

===Accomplishments===
Murray State is particularly renowned for its men&#x27;s basketball program, which has made 18 appearances in the NCAA Tournament, most recently in 2022. In 2010, as a 13-seed, Murray State won their second-ever NCAA tournament game on a buzzer-beater against 4th-seeded Vanderbilt. Former Alabama head basketball coach Mark Gottfried coached the Racers to three Ohio Valley Conference Championships all three years he coached there, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark. The Racer men&#x27;s basketball team was also led to the 2012 OVC championship by Coach Steve Prohm. The basketball program has been recognized as one of the top 30 basketball programs in modern history by ESPN.

Murray State also is home to one of the nation&#x27;s top rifle programs. The Racers claimed national championships in 1978 (NRA), 1985 (NCAA) and 1987 (NCAA) and have produced six individual NCAA national champions, including two-time national titlist and 1984 Summer Olympics gold medalist Pat Spurgin. In addition, MSU is also recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark (NHCL) for William Kelly&#x27;s Iron and Steel Making Process [NHCL, American Chemical Society, 2015].

The football program has become a stepping-stone to major college-coaching success. Frank Beamer, the former Virginia Tech head coach who built that program into a national power in the 1990s and early 2000s, and former Ole Miss head coach Houston Nutt are both former Racers head coaches. Former Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen was a Racers assistant under Beamer, and former Illinois head coach Ron Zook was an assistant under former ESPN college football analyst Mike Gottfried, who was Beamer&#x27;s predecessor as head coach.

Murray State is also the home of a nationally ranked collegiate bass fishing team that has won multiple titles, including national championships.

==Publications==

&quot;The Murray State News&quot; is the student newspaper of Murray State University. The newspaper has been the recipient of several ACP Pacemaker awards, the highest award given to collegiate newspapers, most recently in 2004. In October 2013 the newspaper won third place best-in-show for four-year weekly broadcast at the National College Media Convention in New Orleans. &quot;The Murray State News&quot; gained notoriety between 1998 and 2001 through the work of cartoonist Darin Shock. Shock earned the honor of top college cartoonist in the nation from the College Media Advisers in 2000. He had earned second-place honors the previous year.

&quot;Gateway Magazine&quot; is a full-color, glossy magazine published annually as an imprint of &quot;The Murray State News.&quot;

The school yearbook, &quot;The Shield&quot;, was awarded three Pacemaker awards and two CSPA Silver Crowns. &quot;The Shield&quot; ceased publication with its 2008 edition due to financial concerns.

The university&#x27;s national literary magazine, &quot;New Madrid&quot; with editor Ann Neelon, featured work from a range of nationally recognized authors and received acclaim from sources as diverse as &quot;La Bloga&quot;, a leading Hispanic journal, and &quot;New Pages&quot;, a leading national review of literary magazines. A lack of funding led to the suspension of publication in 2018.

==Radio==
WKMS-FM (91.3 FM) is a non-commercial, educational National Public Radio-affiliated station licensed and operated by Murray State University. It features a variety of NPR programming and local music shows ranging from classical music, bluegrass, alternative rock, jazz, electronica, and world music.

<doc id="305256" wikidata="Q205545" url="?curid=305256" title="Eleftherios Venizelos">
<text>Eleftherios Kyriakou Venizelos (, ; – 18 March 1936) was a Cretan Greek statesman and prominent leader of the Greek national liberation movement. As leader of the Liberal Party, he held office as prime minister of Greece for over 12 years, spanning eight terms between 1910 and 1933. During his governance, Venizelos modernized Greece by promoting liberal-democratic policies. Moreover, Greece was expanded through military and diplomatic cooperation with the Great Powers, and he profoundly shifted Greece from the eastern to the western domain of influence. Therefore, he has been labeled &quot;The Maker of Modern Greece&quot; and is still widely known as the &quot;Ethnarch&quot;.

His first entry into the international scene was with his significant role in the autonomy of the Cretan State and later in the union of Crete with Greece. In 1909, he was invited to Athens to resolve the political deadlock and became Prime Minister. He initiated constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society and reorganized both the Greek Army and the Greek Navy in preparation for future conflicts. Before the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, Venizelos&#x27; catalytic role helped gain Greece&#x27;s entrance to the Balkan League, an alliance of the Balkan states against the Ottoman Empire. Through his diplomatic acumen with the Great Powers and with the other Balkan countries, Greece doubled its area and population with the liberation of Macedonia, Epirus, and most of the Aegean islands.

In World War I (1914–1918), he brought Greece on the side of the Allies, further expanding the Greek borders. However, his pro-Allied foreign policy brought him into conflict with the nonaligned faction of Constantine I of Greece, causing the National Schism of the 1910s. The Schism became an unofficial civil war, with the struggle for power between the two groups polarizing the population between the royalists and Venizelists for decades. Following the Allied victory, Venizelos secured new territorial concessions in Western Anatolia and Thrace in an attempt to accomplish the Megali Idea, which would have united all Greek-speaking people along the Aegean Sea under the banner of Greece. He was, however, defeated in the 1920 General Election, which contributed to the eventual Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22). Venizelos, in self-imposed exile, represented Greece in the negotiations that led to the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the agreement of a mutual population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

In January 1933, he became prime minister for the last time, and in March 1935, after a coup attempt, he fled to Paris, where he died. He was buried on a hill at the head of the Akrotiri peninsula beside the eastern outskirts of Chania city in Crete, close to the place where he was born. The Venizelos family graves are today one of the attractions of Chania.

==Origins and early years==

===Ancestry===

The ancestors of Venizelos, named Crevvatas, lived in Mystras, in southern Peloponnese. During the Ottoman raids in the peninsula in 1770, a member of the Krevvatas family (Venizelos Krevvatas), the youngest of several brothers, managed to escape to Crete where he established himself. His sons discarded their patronymic and called themselves Venizelos. The family was of Laconic, Maniot, and Cretan origin. Venizelos&#x27; mother, Styliani Ploumidakis, descended from the village of Theriso in Crete.

However, during the National Schism, politician Konstantinos Krevattas denied that his family had any relation to Venizelos. In a letter to a Cretan partner, Venizelos wrote that his father Kyriakos had taken part in the siege of Monemvasia in 1821 with his brother Hatzinikolos Venizelos and 3 more brothers. His grandfather probably was Hatzipetros Venizelos, a merchant from Kythira.

===Family and education===

Eleftherios was born in Mournies, near Chania (formerly known as Canea) in then-Ottoman Crete to Kyriakos Venizelos, a Cretan merchant and revolutionary, and Styliani Ploumidaki. When the Cretan revolution of 1866 broke out, Venizelos&#x27; family fled to the island of Syros, due to the participation of his father in the revolution. They were not allowed to return to Crete and stayed in Syros until 1872, when Abdülaziz granted an amnesty.

He spent his final year of secondary education at a school in Ermoupolis in Syros, from which he received his certificate in 1880. In 1881, he enrolled at the University of Athens Law School and got his degree in Law with excellent grades. He returned to Crete in 1886 and worked as a lawyer in Chania. Throughout his life, he maintained a passion for reading and was constantly improving his skills in English, Italian, German, and French.

===Entry into politics===

The situation in Crete during Venizelos&#x27; early years was fluid. The Ottoman Empire was undermining the reforms, which were made under international pressure, while the Cretans desired to see the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, abandon &quot;the ungrateful infidels&quot;. Under these unstable conditions, Venizelos entered politics in the elections of 2 April 1889 as a member of the island&#x27;s liberal party. As a deputy, he was distinguished for his eloquence and radical opinions.

==Political career in Crete==

===Cretan uprising===

====Background====

The numerous revolutions in Crete, during and after the Greek War of Independence (1821, 1833, 1841, 1858, 1866, 1878, 1889, 1895, 1897) were the result of the Cretans&#x27; desire for &quot;enosis&quot; — union with Greece. In the Cretan revolution of 1866, the two sides, under the pressure of the Great Powers, came to an agreement, which was finalized in the Pact of Chalepa. Later the Pact was included in the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin, which was supplementing previous concessions granted to the Cretans — e.g. the Organic Law Constitution (1868) designed by William James Stillman. In summary, the Pact granted a large degree of self-government to Greeks in Crete as a means of limiting their desire to rise up against their Ottoman overlords. However the Muslims of Crete, who identified with Ottoman Empire, were not satisfied with these reforms, as in their view the administration of the island was delivered to the hands of the Christian Greek population. In practice, the Ottoman Empire failed to enforce the provisions of the Pact, thus fueling the existing tensions between the two communities; instead, the Ottoman authorities attempted to maintain order by dispatching substantial military reinforcements during 1880–1896. Throughout that period, the &quot;Cretan Question&quot; was a major issue of friction in the relations of independent Greece with the Ottoman Empire.

In January 1897, violence and disorder escalated on the island, thus polarizing the population. Massacres against the Christian population took place in Chania and Rethimno. The Greek government, pressured by public opinion, intransigent political elements, extreme nationalist groups such as Ethniki Etaireia, and the reluctance of the Great Powers to intervene, decided to send warships and army personnel to defend the Cretan Greeks. The Great Powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island, but they were late. A Greek force of about 2,000 men had landed at Kolymbari on 3 February 1897, and its commanding officer, Colonel Timoleon Vassos declared that he was taking over the island &quot;in the name of the King of the Hellenes&quot; and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece.This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers decided to blockade Crete with their fleets and land their troops, thus stopping the Greek army from approaching Chania.

====Events at Akrotiri====

Venizelos, at that time, was on an electoral tour of the island. Once he &quot;saw Canea in flames&quot;, he hurried to Malaxa, near Chania, where a group of about 2,000 rebels had assembled and established himself as their header. He proposed an attack, along with other rebels, on the Turkish forces at Akrotiri to displace them from the plains (Malaxa is at a higher altitude). Venizelos&#x27; subsequent actions at Akrotiri form a central set-piece in his myth. People composed poems on Akrotiri and his role there; editorials and articles spoke about his bravery, visions, and diplomatic genius as the inevitable accompaniment of later greatness. Venizelos spent the night in Akrotiri and a Greek flag was raised. The Ottoman forces requested help from the foreign admirals and attacked the rebels, with the ships of the Great Powers bombarding the rebel positions at Akrotiri. A shell threw down the flag, which was raised up again immediately. The mythologizing became more pronounced when we come to his actions in that February, as the following quotes display:



On the same evening of the bombardment, Venizelos wrote a protest to the foreign admirals, which was signed by all the chieftains present at Akrotiri. He wrote that the rebels would keep their positions until everyone was killed by the shells of European warships in order not to let the Turks remain in Crete. The letter was deliberately leaked to international newspapers, evoking emotional reactions in Greece and in Europe, where the idea of Christians, who wanted their freedom, being bombarded by Christian vessels, caused popular indignation. Throughout Western Europe much popular sympathy for the cause of the Christians in Crete was manifested, and much popular applause was bestowed on the Greeks.

====War in Thessaly====



The Great Powers sent a verbal note on 2 March to the governments of Greece and the Ottoman Empire, presenting a possible solution to the &quot;Cretan Question&quot;, under which Crete to become an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Sultan. The Porte replied on 5 March, accepting the proposals in principle, but on 8 March the Greek government rejected the proposal as a non-satisfactory solution and instead insisted on the union of Crete with Greece as the only solution.

As a representative of the Cretan rebels, Venizelos met the admirals of the Great Powers on a Russian warship on 7 March 1897. Even though no progress was made at the meeting, he persuaded the admirals to send him on a tour of the island, under their protection, in order to explore the people&#x27;s opinions on the question of autonomy versus union. At the time, the majority of the Cretan population initially supported the union, but the subsequent events in Thessaly turned the public opinion towards autonomy as an intermediate step.

In reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, the Ottomans had relocated a significant part of their army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly, close to the borders with Greece. Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces, who were members of the &quot;Ethniki Etairia&quot; (followers of the Megali Idea) acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts, leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece on 17 April. The war was a disaster for Greece. The Turkish army was better prepared, in large part due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under Baron von der Goltz, and the Greek army was in retreat within weeks. The Great Powers again intervened, and an armistice was signed in May 1897.

====Conclusion====

The defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish war, costing small territorial losses at the borderline in northern Thessaly and an indemnity of £4,000,000, turned into a diplomatic victory. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy), following the massacre of Greeks in Heraklion on 6 September, imposed a final solution on the &quot;Cretan Question&quot;; Crete was proclaimed an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty.

Venizelos played an important role in this solution, not only as the leader of the Cretan rebels but also as a skilled diplomat with his frequent communication with the admirals of the Great Powers. The four Great Powers assumed the administration of Crete; and Prince George of Greece, the second son of King George I of Greece, became High Commissioner, with Venizelos serving as his minister of Justice from 1899 to 1901.

===Autonomous Cretan State===

Prince George of Greece was appointed High Commissioner of the Cretan State for a three-year term. On 13 December 1898, he arrived at Chania, where he received an unprecedented reception. On 27 April 1899, the High Commissioner created an Executive Committee composed of the Cretan leaders. Venizelos became minister of Justice, and with the rest of the Committee, they began to organize the State and create a &quot;Cretan constitution&quot;. Venizelos insisted on not making reference to religion so all the residents of Crete would feel represented. For his stance, he was later accused of pro-Turk (pro-Muslim) by his political opponents on the island.

After Venizelos submitted the complete juridical legislation on 18 May 1900, disagreements between him and Prince George began to emerge. Prince George decided to travel to Europe and announced to the Cretan population that &quot;When I am traveling in Europe, I shall ask the Powers for annexation, and I hope to succeed on account of my family connections&quot;. The statement reached the public without the knowledge or approval of the Committee. Venizelos said to the Prince that it would not be proper to give hope to the population for something that was not feasible at the given moment. As Venizelos had expected, during the Prince&#x27;s journey, the Great Powers rejected his request.

The disagreements continued on other topics; the Prince wanted to build a palace, but Venizelos strongly opposed it as that would mean the perpetuation of the current arrangement of Governorship; Cretans accepted it only as temporary until a final solution was found. Relations between the two men became increasingly soured, and Venizelos repeatedly submitted his resignation.

In a meeting of the Executive Committee, Venizelos expressed his opinion that the island was not autonomous since the military forces of the Great Powers were still present and that the Great Powers were governing through their representative, the Prince. Venizelos suggested that once the Prince&#x27;s service expired, then the Great Powers should be invited to the Committee, which, according to article 39 of the constitution (which was suppressed in the conference of Rome) would elect a new sovereign, thereby removing the need for the presence of the Great Powers. Once the Great Powers&#x27; troops and their representatives left the island, the union with Greece would be easier to achieve. This proposal was exploited by Venizelos&#x27; opponents, who accused him of wanting Crete to be an autonomous hegemony. Venizelos replied to the accusations by submitting his resignation once again, with the reasoning that it would be impossible henceforth to collaborate with the Committee&#x27;s members; he assured the Commissioner, however, that he did not intend to join the opposition.

On 6 March 1901, in a report, he exposed the reasons that compelled him to resign to the High Commissioner, which was, however, leaked to the press. On 20 March, Venizelos was dismissed because &quot;he, without any authorization, publicly supported opinions opposite of those of the Commissioner&quot;. Henceforth, Venizelos assumed the leadership of the opposition to the Prince. For the next three years, he carried out a hard political conflict until the administration was virtually paralyzed, and tensions dominated the island. Inevitably, these events led in March 1905 to the Theriso Revolution, whose leader he was.

===Revolution of Theriso===

On 10 March 1905, the rebels gathered in Theriso and declared &quot;the political union of Crete with Greece as a single free constitutional state&quot;. The resolution was given to the Great Powers, where it was argued that the illegitimate provisional arrangement was preventing the island&#x27;s economic growth and that the only logical solution to the &quot;Cretan Question&quot; was the unification with Greece. The High Commissioner, with the approval of the Great Powers, replied to the rebels that military force would be used against them. However, more deputies joined with Venizelos in Theriso. The Great Powers&#x27; consuls met with Venizelos in Mournies in an attempt to achieve an agreement, but without any results.

The revolutionary government asked that Crete be granted a regime similar to that of Eastern Rumelia. On 18 July, the Great Powers declared martial law, but that did not discourage the rebels. On 15 August, the regular assembly in Chania voted in favor of most of the reforms that Venizelos proposed. The Great Powers&#x27; consuls met Venizelos again and accepted his proposed reforms. This led to the end of the Theriso revolt and to the resignation of Prince George as the High Commissioner. The Great Powers assigned the authority for selecting the island&#x27;s new High Commissioner to King George I of Greece, thereby &quot;de facto&quot; nullifying the Ottoman suzerainty. An ex-Prime Minister of Greece, Alexandros Zaimis, was chosen for the place of High Commissioner, and Greek officers and non-commissioned officers were allowed to undertake the organization of the Cretan Gendarmerie. As soon as the Gendarmerie was organized, the foreign troops began to withdraw from the island. This was also a personal victory for Venizelos, who, as a result, achieved fame not only in Greece but also in Europe.

Following the Young Turk Revolution, which Venizelos welcomed, Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire on 5 October 1908, and one day later Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria announced the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Encouraged by these events, on the same day, the Cretans, in turn, rose up. On that day, thousands of citizens in Chania and the surrounding regions formed a rally in which Venizelos declared the union of Crete with Greece. Having communicated with the government of Athens, Zaimis left for Athens before the rally.

An assembly was convened and declared the independence of Crete. The civil servants were sworn in the name of King George I of Greece, while a five-member Executive Committee was established, with the authority to control the island on behalf of the King and according to the laws of the Greek state. Chairman of the committee was Antonios Michelidakis, and Venizelos became Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs. In April 1910, a new assembly was convened, and Venizelos was elected chairman and then Prime Minister. All foreign troops departed from Crete, and power was transferred entirely to Venizelos&#x27; government.

==Political career in Greece==

===Goudi military revolution of 1909===

In May 1909, a number of officers in the Greek army emulating the Young Turk Committee of Union and Progress, sought to reform their country&#x27;s national government and reorganize the army, thus creating the Military League. The League, in August 1909, camped in the Athenian suburb of Goudi with their supporters, forcing the government of Dimitrios Rallis to resign, and a new one was formed with Kiriakoulis Mavromichalis. An inaugurating period of direct military pressure upon the Chamber followed, but initial public support for the League quickly evaporated when it became apparent that the officers did not know how to implement their demands. The political dead-end remained until the League invited Venizelos from Crete to undertake the leadership.

Venizelos went to Athens, and after consulting with the Military League and with representatives of the political world, he proposed a new government and Parliament&#x27;s reformation. His proposals were considered by the King and the Greek politicians dangerous for the political establishment. However, King George I, fearing an escalation of the crisis, convened a council with political leaders and recommended they accept Venizelos&#x27; proposals. After many postponements, the King agreed to assign Stephanos Dragoumis (Venizelos&#x27; indication) to form a new government that would lead the country to elections once the League was disbanded. In the elections of 8 August 1910, almost half the seats in the parliament were won by Independents, who were newcomers to the Greek political scene. Venizelos, despite doubts as to the validity of his Greek citizenship and without having campaigned in person, finished at the top of the electoral list in Attica. He was immediately recognized as the leader of the independents, and thus, he founded the political party, &quot;Komma Fileleftheron&quot; (Liberal Party). Soon after his election, he decided to call for new elections in the hope of winning an absolute majority. The old parties boycotted the new election in protest and on 11 December 1910, Venizelos&#x27; party won 307 seats out of 362, with most of the elected citizens being new in the political scene. Venizelos formed a government and started to reorganize the economic, political, and national affairs of the country.

===Reforms in 1910–1914===

Venizelos tried to advance his reform program in the realms of political and social ideologies, education, and literature by adopting practically viable compromises between often conflicting tendencies. In education, for example, the dynamic current in favor of the use of the popular spoken language, dimotiki, provoked conservative reactions, which led to the constitutionally embedded decision (Article 107) in favor of a formal &quot;purified&quot; language, katharevousa, which looked back to classical precedents.

On 20 May 1911, a revision of the Constitution was completed, which focused on strengthening individual freedoms, introducing measures to facilitate the legislative work of the Parliament, establishing obligatory elementary education, the legal right for compulsory expropriation, ensuring permanent appointment for civil servants, the right to invite foreign personnel to undertake the reorganization of the administration and the armed forces, the re-establishment of the State Council and the simplification of the procedures for the reform of the Constitution. The aim of the reform program was to consolidate public security and the rule of law as well as to develop and increase the wealth-producing potential of the country. In this context, the long-planned &quot;eighth&quot; Ministry, the Ministry of National Economy, assumed a leading role. This Ministry, from the time of its creation at the beginning of 1911, was headed by Emmanuel Benakis, a wealthy Greek merchant from Egypt and friend of Venizelos. Between 1911 and 1912 a number of laws aiming to initiate labor legislation in Greece were promulgated. Specific measures were enacted that prohibited child labor and night-shift work for women, regulated the hours of the working week and the Sunday holiday, and allowed for labor organizations. Venizelos also took measures for the improvement of management, justice, and security and for the settlement of the landless peasants of Thessaly.

===Balkan Wars===

====Background====

At the time, there were diplomatic contacts with the Ottoman Empire to initiate reforms in Macedonia and in Thrace, which at the time were under the control of the Ottoman Empire, for improving the living conditions of the Christian populations. Failure of such reforms would leave a single option to remove the Ottoman Empire from the Balkans, an idea that most Balkan countries shared. This scenario appeared realistic to Venizelos because the Ottoman Empire was under a constitutional transition, and its administrative mechanism was disorganized and weakened. There was also no fleet capable of transporting forces from Asia Minor to Europe, while in contrast, the Greek fleet was dominating the Aegean Sea. Venizelos did not want to initiate any immediate major movements in the Balkans, until the Greek army and navy were reorganized (an effort that had begun from the last government of Georgios Theotokis) and the Greek economy was revitalized. In light of this, Venizelos proposed to Ottoman Empire to recognize the Cretans the right to send deputies to the Greek Parliament, as a solution for closing the &quot;Cretan Question&quot;. However, the Young Turks (feeling confident after the Greco-Turkish war in 1897) threatened that they would make a military walk to Athens, if the Greeks insisted on such claims.

====Balkan League====

Venizelos, seeing no improvements after his approach with the Turks on the &quot;Cretan Question&quot; and at the same time not wanting to see Greece remain inactive as in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877 (where Greece&#x27;s neutrality left the country out of the peace talks), he decided that the only way to settle the disputes with Ottoman Empire, was to join the other Balkan countries, Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro, in an alliance known as the Balkan League. Crown Prince Constantine was sent to represent Greece to a royal feast in Sofia, and in 1911 Bulgarian students were invited to Athens. These events had a positive impact and on 30 May 1912 Greece and the Kingdom of Bulgaria signed a treaty that ensured mutual support in case of a Turkish attack on either country. Negotiations with Serbia, which Venizelos had initiated to achieve a similar agreement, were concluded in early 1913, before that there were only oral agreements.

Montenegro opened hostilities by declaring war on the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912. On 17 October 1912, Greece along with her Balkan allies, declared war on the Ottoman Empire, thus joining the First Balkan War. On 1 October, in a regular session of the Parliament Venizelos announced the declaration of war to the Ottomans and accepting the Cretan deputies, thus closing the &quot;Cretan Question&quot;, with the declaration of the union of Crete with Greece. The Greek population received these developments very enthusiastically.

====First Balkan War – The first conflict with Prince Constantine====

The outbreak of the First Balkan War caused Venizelos a great deal of trouble in his relations with Crown Prince Constantine. Part of the problems can be attributed to the complexity of the official relations between the two men. Although Constantine was a Prince and the future King, he also held the title of army commander, thus remaining under the direct order of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and subsequently under Venizelos. But his father, King George, in accordance with the constitutional conditions of the time, had been the undisputed leader of the country. Thus in practical terms, Venizelos&#x27; authority over his commander of the army was diminished due to the obvious relation between the Crown Prince and the King.

In these conditions, the army started a victorious march to Macedonia under the command of Constantine. Soon, the first disagreement between Venizelos and Constantine emerged, and it concerned the aims of the army&#x27;s operations. The Crown Prince insisted on the clear military aims of the war: to defeat the opposed Ottoman army as a necessary condition for any occupation, wherever the opponent army was or was going, and the main part of the Ottoman army soon started retreating to the north towards Monastir. Venizelos was more realistic and insisted on the political aims of the war: to liberate as many geographical areas and cities as fast as possible, particularly Macedonia and Thessaloniki; thus heading east. The debate became evident after the victory of the Greek army at Sarantaporo, when the future direction of the armies&#x27; march was to be decided. Venizelos intervened and insisted that Thessaloniki, as a major city and strategic port in the surrounding area, should be taken at all costs and thus a turn to the east was necessary. In accordance to his views, Venizelos sent the following telegraph to the General Staff:

and tried to keep frequent communication with the key figure, the King, in order to prevent the Crown Prince from marching north. Subsequently, although the Greek army won the Battle of Giannitsa situated 40 km west of Salonika, Constantine&#x27;s hesitation in capturing the city after a week had passed, led into an open confrontation with Venizelos. Venizelos, having accurate information from the Greek embassy in Sofia about the movement of the Bulgarian army towards the city, sent a telegram to Constantine in a strict tone, holding him responsible for the possible loss of Thessaloniki. The tone in Venizelos&#x27; telegram and that in the answer from Constantine that followed to announce the final agreement with the Turks, is widely considered as the start of the conflict between the two men that would lead Greece into the National Schism during World War I. Finally, on 26 October 1912, the Greek army entered Thessaloniki, shortly ahead of the Bulgarians. But soon a new reason of friction emerged due to Venizelos&#x27; concern about Constantine&#x27;s acceptance of the Bulgarian request to enter the city. A small Bulgarian unit, which soon became a full division, moved into the city and immediately started an attempt to establish a condominium in spite of initial assurances to the contrary, showing no intentions to leave. After Venizelos&#x27; protest, Constantine asked him to take responsibility (as a prime minister) by ordering him to force them out, but that was hardly an option since that would certainly lead to confrontation with the Bulgarians. To Venizelos&#x27; view, since Constantine allowed the Bulgarians to enter the city, he now passed the responsibility of a possible conflict with them to him, in an attempt to deny his initial fault. To Constantine, it was an attempt by Venizelos to get involved in clearly military issues. Most historians agree that Constantine failed to see the political dimensions of his decisions. As a consequence, both incidents increased mutual misunderstanding shortly before Constantine&#x27;s accession to the throne.

Once the campaign in Macedonia was completed, a large part of the Greek army under the Crown Prince was redeployed to Epirus, and in the Battle of Bizani, the Ottoman positions were overcome and Ioannina taken on 22 February 1913. Meanwhile, the Greek navy rapidly occupied the Aegean islands, which were still under Ottoman rule. After two victories, the Greek fleet established naval supremacy over the Aegean, preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements to the Balkans.

On 20 November, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria signed a truce treaty with Turkey. It followed a conference in London, in which Greece took part, although the Greek army still continued its operations in the Epirus front. The conference led to the Treaty of London between the Balkan countries and Turkey. These two conferences gave the first indications of Venizelos&#x27; diplomatic efficiency and realism. During the negotiations and facing the dangers of Bulgarian maximalism, Venizelos succeeded in establishing close relations with the Serbs. A Serbian-Greek military protocol was signed on 1 June 1913, ensuring mutual protection in case of a Bulgarian attack.

====Second Balkan War====



Despite all this, the Bulgarians still wanted to become a hegemonic power in the Balkans and made excessive claims to this end, while Serbia asked for more territory than what was initially agreed with the Bulgarians. Serbia was asking for a revision of the original treaty since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers&#x27; decision to establish the state of Albania in an area that had been recognized as a Serbian territory of expansion under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Bulgarians also laid claims on Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia. In the conference of London, Venizelos rebuffed these claims, citing the fact that it had been occupied by the Greek army, and that Bulgaria had denied any definite settlement of territorial claims during the pre-war discussions, as it had done with Serbia.

The rupture between the allies, due to the Bulgarian claims, was inevitable, and Bulgaria found herself standing against Greece and Serbia. On 19 May 1913, a pact of alliance was signed in Thessaloniki between Greece and Serbia. On 19 June, the Second Balkan War began with a surprise Bulgarian assault against Serbian and Greek positions. Constantine, now King after his father&#x27;s assassination in March, neutralized the Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki and pushed the Bulgarian army further back with a series of hard-fought victories. Bulgaria was overwhelmed by the Greek and Serbian armies, while in the north Romania interfered against Bulgaria and the Romanian army was marching towards Sofia; Ottomans also took advantage of the situation and retook most of the territory taken by Bulgaria. The Bulgarians asked for a truce. Venizelos went to Hadji-Beylik, where the Greek headquarters were, to confer with Constantine on the Greek territorial claims in the peace conference. Then he went to Bucharest, where a peace conference was assembled. On 28 June 1913 a peace treaty was signed with Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Romania on one side and Bulgaria on the other. Thus, after two successful wars, Greece had doubled its territory by gaining most of Macedonia, Epirus, Crete and the rest of the Aegean Islands, although the status of the latter remained as yet undetermined and a cause of tension with the Ottomans.

===World War I and Greece===

====Dispute over Greece&#x27;s role in World War I====

With the outbreak of World War I and the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia, a major issue started regarding the participation of Greece and Bulgaria in the war. Greece had an active treaty with Serbia, which was the treaty activated in the 1913 Bulgarian attack that caused the Second Balkan War. That treaty was envisaged in a purely Balkan context and was thus invalid against Austria-Hungary, as was supported by Constantine and his advisors.

The situation changed when the Allies, in an attempt to help Serbia, offered Bulgaria the Monastir–Ochrid area of Serbia and the Greek Eastern Macedonia (the Kavala and Drama areas) if she joined the Entente. Venizelos, having received assurances over Asia Minor if the Greeks participated in the alliance, agreed to cede the area to Bulgaria.

But Constantine&#x27;s anti-Bulgarism made such a transaction impossible. Constantine refused to go to war under such conditions, and the men parted. As a consequence, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and invaded Serbia, an event that led to Serbia&#x27;s final collapse. Greece remained neutral. Venizelos supported an alliance with the Entente, not only believing that Britain and France would win but also that it was the only choice for Greece because the combination of the strong Anglo-French naval control over the Mediterranean and the geographical distribution of the Greek population to the coast, could have ill effects in the case of a naval blockade, as he characteristically remarked:

On the other hand, Constantine favored the Central Powers and wanted Greece to remain neutral. He was influenced both by his belief in the military superiority of Germany and also by his German wife, Queen Sophia, and his pro-German court. He therefore strove to secure a neutrality, which would be favorable to Germany and Austria.

In 1915, Winston Churchill (then First Lord of the Admiralty) suggested that Greece take action in Dardanelles on behalf of the allies. Venizelos saw this as an opportunity to bring the country on the side of the Entente in the conflict. However, the King and the Hellenic Army General Staff disagreed and Venizelos submitted his resignation on 21 February 1915. Venizelos&#x27; party won the elections and formed a new government.

====National Schism====

Even though Venizelos promised to remain neutral, after the elections of 1915, he said that Bulgaria&#x27;s attack on Serbia, with which Greece had a treaty of alliance, obliged him to abandon that policy. A small-scale mobilization of the Greek army took place.

The dispute between Venizelos and the King reached its height shortly after that, and the King invoked a Greek constitutional provision that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government unilaterally. Meanwhile, using the excuse of saving Serbia, in October 1915, the Entente disembarked an army in Thessaloniki, after invitation by Venizelos. Prime Minister Venizelos&#x27;s action enraged Constantine.

The dispute continued between the two men, and in December 1915, King Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling for new elections. Venizelos left Athens and moved back to Crete. Venizelos did not take part in the elections, as he considered the dissolution of Parliament unconstitutional.

On 26 May 1916 the Fort Rupel (a significant military fort in Macedonia) was unconditionally surrendered by the royalist government to Germano-Bulgarian forces. This produced a deplorable impression. The Allies feared a possible secret alliance between the royalist government and the Central Powers, placing their armies in grave danger in Macedonia. On the other hand, the surrender of Fort Rupel for Venizelos and his supporters meant the beginning of the destruction of Greek Macedonia. Despite German assurances that the integrity of the Kingdom of Greece would be respected, they were unable to restrain the Bulgarian forces, which had started dislocating the Greek population, and by 4 September Kavala was occupied.

On 16 August 1916, during a rally in Athens, and with the support of the allied army that had landed in Thessaloniki under the command of General Maurice Sarrail, Venizelos publicly announced his total disagreement with the Crown&#x27;s policies. The effect of this was to further polarize the population between the royalists (also known as &quot;anti-Venezelists&quot;), who supported the crown, and Venizelists, who supported Venizelos. On 30 August 1916, Venizelist army officers organized a military coup in Thessaloniki, and proclaimed the &quot;Provisional Government of National Defence&quot;. Venizelos, along with Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis and General Panagiotis Danglis agreed to form a provisional government, and on 9 October, they moved to Thessaloniki and assumed command of the National Defence to oversee the Greek participation in the allied war effort. The triumvirate, as the three men became known, had formed this government in direct conflict with the Athens political establishment. There they founded a separate &quot;provisional state&quot; including Northern Greece, Crete, and the Aegean Islands, with the support of the Entente. Primarily, these areas comprised the &quot;New Lands&quot; won during the Balkan Wars, in which Venizelos enjoyed broad support, while &quot;Old Greece&quot; was mostly pro-royalist. However, Venizelos declared, &quot;we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians&quot;. He didn&#x27;t want to abolish the monarchy and continued his efforts to persuade the King to join the Allies, blaming his &quot;bad advisors&quot; for his stance.

The National Defence government started assembling an army for the Macedonian front and soon participated in operations against the Central Powers forces.

====&quot;Noemvriana&quot; – Greece enters World War I====

In the months following the creation of the provisional government in Thessaloniki in late August, negotiations between the Allies and the king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army as a counterbalance to the royalist government&#x27;s unconditional surrender of Fort Rupel and the military evacuation of Thessaly to ensure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. On the other hand, the king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize Venizelos&#x27; provisional government or further support it, guarantees that Greece&#x27;s integrity and neutrality would be respected, and a promise that any war material surrendered to the Allies would be returned after the war.

The Franco-British use of Greece&#x27;s territory in co-operation with the Venizelos government throughout 1916 was opposed in royalist circles and therefore increased Constantine&#x27;s popularity, and caused much excitement and several anti-Allied demonstrations took place in Athens. Moreover, a growing movement had been developed in the army among lower officers, led by military officers Ioannis Metaxas and Sofoklis Dousmanis, determined to oppose disarmament and the surrender of any war materials to the Allies.

The Allies&#x27; pressure on the government of Athens continued. On the next day, 24 November, du Fournet presented a new ultimatum ending on 1 December to the government of Athens, demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten mountain batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France&#x27;s demands. He advised the king that according to his orders, he would land an Allied contingent with the aim to occupy certain positions in Athens until his demands were satisfied. In reply, the King claimed that he was pressed by the army and the people not to submit to disarmament and refused to make any commitment. However, he promised that the Greek forces would receive orders not to fire against the Allied contingent. Despite the gravity of the situation, both the royalist government and the Allies let the events take their own course. The royalist government decided to reject the admirals&#x27; demands on 29 November, and armed resistance was organized. By 30 November, military units and royalist militia (the &quot;epistratoi&quot;, &quot;reservists&quot;) from surrounding areas had been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 men) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon. On the other hand, the Allied authorities failed in their assessment of the prevailing temper. A diplomat characteristically insisted that the Greeks were bluffing, and in the face of force, they would &quot;bring the cannons on a plater&quot;; a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared.

The Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on . However, it met organized resistance, and an armed confrontation took place for a day till a compromise was reached. After the evacuation of the Allied contingent from Athens the following day, a royalist mob raged through the city for three days, targeting supporters of Venizelos. The incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece, which was using the Old Style calendar at the time, and drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and their political opponents, deepening what would become known as the National Schism.

After the armed confrontation in Athens, on , Britain and France officially recognized the government under Venizelos as the lawful government, effectively splitting Greece into two separate entities. On , Venizelos&#x27; provisional government officially declared war on the Central Powers. In reply, a royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was issued and the Archbishop of Athens, under pressure by the royal house, anathematised him. The Allies, unwilling to risk a new fiasco but determined to solve the problem, established a naval blockade around southern Greece, which was still loyal to the king, and that caused extreme hardship to people in those areas. In June, France and Great Britain decided to invoke their obligation as &quot;protecting powers&quot;, who had promised to guarantee a constitutional form for Greece at the time the Kingdom was created, to demand the king&#x27;s resignation. Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went to exile, leaving his son Alexander on the throne as demanded (whom the Allies considered as pro-Entente), instead of his elder son and crown prince, George. His departure was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalists, especially army officers such as Ioannis Metaxas, to exile in France and Italy.

The course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917, and Greece, now unified, officially entered the war on the side of the Allies. Subsequently, the entire Greek army was mobilized (though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers army on the Macedonian front.

====Conclusion of World War I====



By the fall of 1918, the Greek army had 300,000 soldiers, and it was the largest single national component of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The presence of the entire Greek army gave the critical mass that altered the balance between the opponents in the Macedonian front. Under the command of French General Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French, and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army, starting on 14 September 1918. After the first heavy fighting (see Battle of Skra), the Bulgarians gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 24 September, the Bulgarian government asked for an armistice, which was signed five days later. The Allied army then pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces that tried to halt the Allied offensive. By October 1918, the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and prepared to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the Austro-Hungarian empire&#x27;s dissolution. The breaking of the Macedonian front was one of the important breakthroughs of the military stalemate and helped to bring an end to the War. Greece was granted a seat under Venizelos at the Paris Peace Conference.

====Treaty of Sèvres and assassination attempt====

Following the conclusion of World War I, Venizelos took part in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 as Greece&#x27;s chief representative. During his absence from Greece for almost two years, he acquired a reputation as an international statesman of considerable stature. President Woodrow Wilson was said to have placed Venizelos first in point of personal ability among all delegates gathered in Paris to settle the terms of Peace.

In July 1919, Venizelos reached an agreement with the Italians on the cession of the Dodecanese, and secured an extension of the Greek area in the periphery of Smyrna. The Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria on 27 November 1919, and the Treaty of Sèvres with the Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, were triumphs both for Venizelos and for Greece. As the result of these treaties, Greece acquired Western Thrace, Eastern Thrace, Smyrna, the Aegean islands Imvros, Tenedos and the Dodecanese except Rhodes.

In spite of all this, fanaticism continued to create a deep rift between the opposing political parties and to impel them towards unacceptable actions. On his journey home on 12 August 1920, Venizelos survived an assassination attack by two royalist soldiers at the Gare de Lyon railway station in Paris. This event provoked unrest in Greece, with Venizelist supporters engaging in acts of violence against known anti-Venizelists, and provided further fuel for the national division. The persecution of Venizelos&#x27; opponents reached a climax with the assassination of the idiosyncratic anti-Venizelist Ion Dragoumis by paramilitary Venizelists on 13 August. After his recovery, Venizelos returned to Greece, where he was welcomed as a hero because he had liberated areas with Greek populations and had created a state stretching over &quot;five seas and two continents&quot;.

===1920 electoral defeat, self-exile, and the Great Disaster===

King Alexander of Greece died of blood poisoning caused by a monkey bite two months after the signing of the treaty on 25 October 1920. His death revived the constitutional question of whether Greece should be a monarchy or a republic and transformed the November elections into a contest between Venizelos and the return of the exiled King Constantine I of Greece, Alexander&#x27;s father. In the elections anti-Venizelists, most of them supporters of Constantine, secured 246 out of 370 seats. The defeat came as a surprise to most people, and Venizelos failed even to get elected as an MP. Venizelos himself attributed this to the war-weariness of the Greek people that had been under arms with almost no intermission since 1912. Venizelists believed that the promise of demobilization and withdrawal from Asia Minor was the most potent weapon of opposition. Abuse of power by Venizelists in the period of 1917–1920 and prosecution of their adversaries were also a further cause for people to vote in favor of the opposition. Thus, on 6 December 1920, King Constantine was recalled by a plebiscite. This caused great dissatisfaction not only to the newly liberated populations in Asia Minor but also to the Great Powers who opposed the return of Constantine. As a result of his defeat, Venizelos left for Paris and withdrew from politics.

Once the anti-Venizelists came to power, it became apparent that they intended to continue the campaign in Asia Minor. However, the dismissal of the war experienced pro-Venizelist military officers for political reasons and underestimating the capabilities of the Turkish army, influenced the subsequent course of the war. Italy and France also found a useful pretext in the royal restoration for making peace with Mustafa Kemal (leader of the Turks). By April 1921, all Great Powers had declared their neutrality; Greece was alone in continuing the war. Mustafa Kemal launched a massive attack on 26 August 1922, and the Greek forces were routed to Smyrna, which soon fell to the Turks on 8 September 1922 (see Great Fire of Smyrna).

Following the defeat of the Greek army by the Turks in 1922 and the subsequent armed insurrection led by Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, King Constantine was dethroned (and succeeded by his eldest son, George), and six royalist leaders were executed. Venizelos assumed the leadership of the Greek delegation that negotiated peace terms with the Turks. He signed the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey on 24 July 1923. The effect of this was that more than a million Greeks (Christians) were expelled from Turkey in exchange for the more than 500,000 Turks (Muslims) expelled from Greece, and Greece was forced to give up claims to eastern Thrace, Imbros, and Tenedos to Turkey. Following a failed pro-royalist insurrection led by General Ioannis Metaxas, King George II of Greece was forced into exile. Venizelos returned to Greece and served as prime minister until 1924, when quarrels with anti-monarchists forced him back into exile.

During these absences from power, he translated Thucydides into modern Greek, although the translation and incomplete commentary were only published in 1940, after his death.
===Return to power (1928–32): Greco-Turkish alliance, assassination attempt and subsequent exile===

In the elections held on 5 July 1928, Venizelos&#x27; party regained power and forced the government to hold new elections on 19 August of the same year; this time, his party won 228 out of 250 places in Parliament. During this period, Venizelos attempted to end Greece&#x27;s diplomatic isolation by restoring normal relations with the country&#x27;s neighbors. His efforts proved to be successful in the cases of the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Italy. Firstly, Venizelos signed an agreement on 23 September 1928 with Benito Mussolini in Rome, and then he started negotiations with Yugoslavia, which resulted in a Treaty of Friendship signed on 27 March 1929. An additional protocol settled the status of the Yugoslav free trade zone of Thessaloniki in a way favorable to Greek interests. Nevertheless, despite the co-ordinated British efforts under Arthur Henderson in 1930–1931, full reconciliation with Bulgaria was never achieved during his premiership. Venizelos was also cautious towards Albania, and although bilateral relations remained at a good level, no initiative was taken by either side aiming at the final settlement of the unresolved issues (mainly related with the status of the Greek minority of South Albania).

Venizelos&#x27; greatest achievement in foreign policy during this period was the reconciliation with Turkey. Venizelos had expressed his will to improve the bilateral Greek–Turkish relations even before his electoral victory in a speech in Thessaloniki (23 July 1928). Eleven days after the formation of his government, he sent letters to both the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs of Turkey (İsmet İnönü and Tevfik Rüştü Aras respectively), declaring that Greece had no territorial aspirations to the detriment of their country. İnönü&#x27;s response was positive and Italy was eager to help the two countries reach an agreement. Negotiations, however, stalled because of the complicated issue of the properties of the exchanged populations. Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on 30 April 1930; on 25 October, Venizelos visited Turkey and signed a treaty of friendship. Venizelos even forwarded Atatürk&#x27;s name for the 1934 Nobel Peace Prize, highlighting the mutual respect between the two leaders. The German Chancellor Hermann Müller described the Greek-Turkish rapprochement as the &quot;greatest achievement seen in Europe since the end of the Great War&quot;. Nevertheless, Venizelos&#x27; initiative was criticized domestically not only by the opposition but also by members of his own party that represented the Greek refugees from Turkey. Venizelos was accused of making too many concessions on the issues of naval armaments and of the properties of the Greeks who were expelled from Turkey according to the Treaty of Lausanne.

In 1929, the Venizelos government, in an effort to avoid reactions from the lower classes whose conditions had worsened due to the wave of immigration, introduced the so-called Idionymon (#4229), a law that restricted civil liberties and initiated the repression against unionism, left-wing supporters and communists.

His domestic position was weakened, however, by the effects of the Great Depression in the early 1930s; and in the elections of 1932 he was defeated by the People&#x27;s Party under Panagis Tsaldaris. The political climate became more tense, and in 1933 Venizelos was the target of a second assassination attempt. The pro-royalist tendencies of the new government led to two Venizelist coup attempts by General Nikolaos Plastiras: one in 1933 and the other in 1935. The failure of the latter proved decisive for the future of the Second Hellenic Republic. After the coup&#x27;s failure, Venizelos left Greece once more, while in Greece, trials and executions of prominent Venizelists were carried out, and he himself was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. The severely weakened Republic was abolished in another coup in October 1935 by General Georgios Kondylis, and George II returned to the throne following a rigged referendum in November.

==Death==

Venizelos left for Paris and on 12 March 1936 wrote his last letter to Alexandros Zannas. He suffered a stroke on the morning of the 13th and died five days later in his flat at 22 rue Beaujon. The absolution was performed on 21 March at St. Stephen&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Church; his body was deposed in the crypt before its transportation on the 23rd at the beginning of the afternoon to the Gare de Lyon. His body was then taken by the destroyer &quot;Pavlos Kountouriotis&quot; to Chania, avoiding Athens in order not to cause unrest. A great ceremony with wide public attendance accompanied his burial at Akrotiri, Crete.

==Legacy==

One of the main contributions of Venizelos to Greek political life was the creation, in 1910, of the Liberal Party, which contrasted with the Greek parties of that period. Until the early twentieth century, the Greek parties were inspired by the protecting powers (French or English Party for example) or clustered around a political personality, such as Charilaos Trikoupis. The Liberal Party was based on the ideas of Venizelos (and the military coup of Goudi), but it survived its creator. In addition, the birth of a leading party would coincide with the birth of an opposing party. The opposing party was reflected around the personality of the king, but that survived the various abolitions of the monarchy. Venizelism, from its inception, is essentially a liberal Republican movement which opposes anti-Venizelist monarchist and conservative ideologies. These two competed for power throughout the inter-war period.

Its main ideas, adapted from its creator, were: opposition to the monarchy; the defense of the Megali Idea; formation of alliances with Western democratic countries, in particular, the United Kingdom and France against Germany during the First and Second World Wars, and later with the United States against the Soviet Union during the Cold War; and finally a protectionist economic policy.

Themistoklis Sofoulis was, from the 1920s, the successor of Venizelos as leader of the Liberal Party, which survived policy failures, exile, and ultimately, the death of the historical founder. In 1950, the son of Venizelos, Sophoklis Venizelos, succeeded as head of the Liberal Party at a time when an agreement was formed with the populists (name of the Royalist party) against the communists during the civil war. The Center Union (Enosis Kendrou), founded in 1961 by Georgios Papandreou, became the ideological descendant of the Liberal Party. 

Venizelos was one Greek politician who achieved worldwide fame during his lifetime, and in the six years between 1915 and 1921, five biographies of him were published in English together with numerous profiles in the newspapers. The character of Constantine Karolides, the able and charismatic prime minister of Greece in John Buchan&#x27;s 1915 adventure spy novel &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, is a thinly disguised version of Venizelos. Venizelos&#x27;s advocacy throughout his career in varying ways of a bloc of Balkan states led the press, especially in Britain, to portray him as a far-sighted statesman who was bringing peace and stability to the unstable Balkans.
Athens International Airport is named after Venizelos.

==Personal life and family==

In December 1891, Venizelos married Maria Katelouzou, daughter of Eleftherios Katelouzos. The newlyweds lived on the upper floor of the Chalepa house, while Venizelos&#x27; mother and his brother and sisters lived on the ground floor. There, they enjoyed the happy moments of their marriage and also had the birth of their two children, in 1892 and Sofoklis in 1894. Their married life was short and marked by misfortune. Maria died of post-puerperal fever in November 1894 after the birth of their second child. Her death deeply affected Venizelos, and as a sign of mourning, he grew his characteristic beard and mustache, which he retained for the rest of his life.

After his defeat in the November elections of 1920, he left for Nice and Paris in self-imposed exile. In September 1921, twenty-seven years after the death of his first wife Maria, he married Helena Schilizzi (sometimes referred to as Elena Skylitsi or Stephanovich) in London. Advised by police to be wary of assassination attempts, they held the religious ceremony in private at Witanhurst, the mansion of a family friend and socialite Lady Domini Crosfield. The Crosfields were well connected and Venizelos met Arthur Balfour, David Lloyd George and the arms dealer Basil Zaharoff in subsequent visits to the house.

The married couple settled down in Paris in a flat at 22 rue Beaujon. He lived there until 1927 when he returned to Chania.

<doc id="305257" wikidata="Q948495" url="?curid=305257" title="Washington Consensus">
<text>The Washington Consensus is a set of ten economic policy prescriptions considered in the 1980s and 1990s to constitute the &quot;standard&quot; reform package promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by the Washington, D.C.-based institutions the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and United States Department of the Treasury. The term was first used in 1989 by English economist John Williamson. The prescriptions encompassed free-market promoting policies such as trade liberalization, privatization and finance liberalization. They also entailed fiscal and monetary policies intended to minimize fiscal deficits and minimize inflation.

Subsequent to Williamson&#x27;s use of the terminology, and despite his emphatic opposition, the phrase Washington Consensus has come to be used fairly widely in a second, broader sense, to refer to a more general orientation towards a strongly market-based approach (sometimes described as market fundamentalism or neoliberalism). In emphasizing the magnitude of the difference between the two alternative definitions, Williamson has argued that his ten original, narrowly defined prescriptions have largely acquired the status of &quot;motherhood and apple pie&quot; (i.e., are broadly taken for granted), whereas the subsequent broader definition, representing a form of neoliberal manifesto, &quot;never enjoyed a consensus [in Washington] or anywhere much else&quot; and can reasonably be said to be dead.

Discussion of the Washington Consensus has long been contentious. Partly this reflects a lack of agreement over what is meant by the term, but there are also substantive differences over the merits and consequences of the policy prescriptions involved. Some critics take issue with the original Consensus&#x27;s emphasis on the opening of developing countries to the global marketplace and transitioning to an emerging market in what they see as an excessive focus on strengthening the influence of domestic market forces, arguably at the expense of governance which will affect key functions of the state. For other commentators, the issue is more what is &quot;missing&quot;, including such areas as institution-building and targeted efforts to improve opportunities for the weakest in society through equal opportunity, social justice and poverty reduction.

==History==

===Original sense: Williamson&#x27;s Ten Points===
The concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by John Williamson, an economist from the Institute for International Economics, an international economic think tank based in Washington, D.C.

The consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:
# Fiscal policy discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;
# Redirection of public spending from subsidies (&quot;especially indiscriminate subsidies&quot;) toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and infrastructure investment;
# Tax reform, broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;
# Interest rates that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;
# Competitive exchange rates;
# Trade liberalization: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs;
# Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment;
# Privatization of state enterprises;
# Deregulation: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of financial institutions;
# Legal security for property rights.

====Origins of policy agenda====
Although Williamson&#x27;s label of the Washington Consensus draws attention to the role of the Washington-based agencies in promoting the above agenda, a number of authors have stressed that Latin American policy-makers arrived at their own packages of policy reforms primarily based on their own analysis of their countries&#x27; situations. Thus, according to Joseph Stanislaw and Daniel Yergin, authors of &quot;The Commanding Heights&quot;, the policy prescriptions described in the Washington Consensus were &quot;developed in Latin America, by Latin Americans, in response to what was happening both within and outside the region.&quot; Joseph Stiglitz has written that &quot;the Washington Consensus policies were designed to respond to the very real problems in Latin America and made considerable sense&quot; (though Stiglitz has at times been an outspoken critic of IMF policies as applied to developing nations). In view of the implication conveyed by the term Washington Consensus that the policies were largely external in origin, Stanislaw and Yergin report that the term&#x27;s creator, John Williamson, has &quot;regretted the term ever since&quot;, stating &quot;it is difficult to think of a less diplomatic label.&quot;

Williamson regretted the use of &quot;Washington&quot; in the Washington Consensus, as it incorrectly suggested that development policies stemmed from Washington and were externally imposed on others. Williamson said in 2002, &quot;The phrase &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; is a damaged brand name... Audiences the world over seem to believe that this signifies a set of neoliberal policies that have been imposed on hapless countries by the Washington-based international financial institutions and have led them to crisis and misery. There are people who cannot utter the term without foaming at the mouth. My own view is of course quite different. The basic ideas that I attempted to summarize in the Washington Consensus have continued to gain wider acceptance over the past decade, to the point where Lula has had to endorse most of them in order to be electable. For the most part they are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.&quot;

According to a 2011 study by Nancy Birdsall, Augusto de la Torre, and Felipe Valencia Caicedo, the policies in the original consensus were largely a creation of Latin American politicians and technocrats, with Williamson&#x27;s role having been to gather the ten points in one place for the first time, rather than to &quot;create&quot; the package of policies. Kate Geohegan of Harvard University&#x27;s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies credited Peruvian neoliberal economist Hernando de Soto for inspiring the Washington Consensus. Williamson partly credited de Soto himself for the prescriptions, saying his work was &quot;the outcome of the worldwide intellectual trends to which Latin America provided&quot; and said that de Soto was directly responsible for the recommendation on legal security for property rights.

===Broad sense===
The Washington Consensus is not interchangeable with the term &quot;neoliberalism.&quot; Williamson recognizes that the term has commonly been used with a different meaning from his original prescription; he opposes the alternative use of the term, which became common after his initial formulation, to cover a broader market fundamentalism or &quot;neoliberal&quot; agenda.

More specifically, Williamson argues that the first three of his ten prescriptions are uncontroversial in the economic community, while recognizing that the others have evoked some controversy. He argues that one of the least controversial prescriptions, the redirection of spending to infrastructure, health care, and education, has often been neglected. He also argues that, while the prescriptions were focused on reducing certain functions of government (e.g., as an owner of productive enterprises), they would also strengthen government&#x27;s ability to undertake other actions such as supporting education and health. Williamson says that he does not endorse market fundamentalism, and believes that the Consensus prescriptions, if implemented correctly, would benefit the poor. In a book edited with Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, &quot;second-generation&quot; reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues.

As noted, in spite of Williamson&#x27;s reservations, the term Washington Consensus has been used more broadly to describe the general shift towards free market policies that followed the displacement of Keynesianism in the 1970s. In this broad sense the Washington Consensus is sometimes considered to have begun at about 1980. Many commentators see the consensus, especially if interpreted in the broader sense of the term, as having been at its strongest during the 1990s. Some have argued that the consensus in this sense ended at the turn of the century, or at least that it became less influential after about the year 2000. More commonly, commentators have suggested that the Consensus in its broader sense survived until the time of the 2008 global financial crisis. Following the strong intervention undertaken by governments in response to market failures, a number of journalists, politicians and senior officials from global institutions such as the World Bank began saying that the Washington Consensus was dead. These included former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who following the 2009 G-20 London summit, declared &quot;the old Washington Consensus is over&quot;. Williamson was asked by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in April 2009 whether he agreed with Gordon Brown that the Washington Consensus was dead. He responded:

After the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit announced that it had achieved agreement on a Seoul Development Consensus, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; editorialized that &quot;Its pragmatic and pluralistic view of development is appealing enough. But the document will do little more than drive another nail into the coffin of a long-deceased Washington consensus.&quot;

==Context==
The widespread adoption by governments of the Washington Consensus was to a large degree a reaction to the macroeconomic crisis that hit much of Latin America, and some other developing regions, during the 1980s. The crisis had multiple origins: the drastic rise in the price of imported oil following the emergence of OPEC, mounting levels of external debt, the rise in US (and hence international) interest rates, and—consequent to the foregoing problems—loss of access to additional foreign credit. The import-substitution policies that had been pursued by many developing country governments in Latin America and elsewhere for several decades had left their economies ill-equipped to expand exports at all quickly to pay for the additional cost of imported oil (by contrast, many countries in East Asia, which had followed more export-oriented strategies, found it comparatively easy to expand exports still further, and as such managed to accommodate the external shocks with much less economic and social disruption). Unable either to expand external borrowing further or to ramp up export earnings easily, many Latin American countries faced no obvious sustainable alternatives to reducing overall domestic demand via greater fiscal discipline, while in parallel adopting policies to reduce protectionism and increase their economies&#x27; export orientation.

Many countries have endeavored to implement varying components of the reform packages, the implementation sometimes being a condition for receiving loans from the IMF and World Bank.

== Effects ==
According to a 2020 study, the implementation of policies associated with the Washington Consensus significantly raised real GDP per capita over a 5- to 10-year horizon. According to a 2021 study, the implementation of the Washington Consensus in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico had &quot;mixed results&quot;: &quot;macroeconomic stability is much improved, but economic growth has been heterogeneous and generally disappointing, despite improvement relative to the 1980s.&quot; Another 2021 study found that the implementation of the Washington Consensus in sub-Saharan Africa led to &quot;initial declines in per capita economic growth over the 1980s and 1990s&quot; but &quot;notable increases in per capita real GDP growth in the post–2000 period.&quot; The study found that &quot;the ability to implement pro-poor policies alongside market-oriented reforms played a central role in successful policy performance.&quot;

Williamson has summarized the overall results on growth, employment and poverty reduction in many countries as &quot;disappointing, to say the least&quot;. He attributed this limited impact to three factors: (a) the Consensus &quot;per se&quot; placed no special emphasis on mechanisms for avoiding economic crises, which proved very damaging; (b) the reforms—both those listed in his article and, &quot;a fortiori&quot;, those actually implemented—were incomplete; and (c) the reforms cited were insufficiently ambitious with respect to targeting improvements in income distribution, and need to be complemented by stronger efforts in this direction. Rather than an argument for abandoning the original ten prescriptions, though, Williamson concludes that they are &quot;motherhood and apple pie&quot; and &quot;not worth debating&quot;.

=== Latin America ===
The Washington Consensus resulted with the &quot;La Década Perdida&quot; or &quot;The Lost Decade&quot; in Latin America, when many nations in the region faced sovereign debt crises. It has been argued that the Washington Consensus resulted in socioeconomic exclusion and weakened trade unions in Latin America, resulting with unrest in the region. Countries who followed the consensus initially alleviated high inflation and excessive regulation, though economic growth and poverty relief was insignificant. The consensus resulted with a shrinking middle class in Latin America that prompted dissatisfaction of neoliberalism, a turn to the political left and populist leaders by the late-1990s, with economists saying that the consensus established support for Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.

==== Argentina ====
The Argentine economic crisis of 1999–2002 is held out as an example of the economic consequences said by some to have been wrought by application of the Washington Consensus. 

In October 1998, the IMF invited Argentine President Carlos Menem, to talk about the successful Argentine experience, at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors. President Menem&#x27;s Minister of Economy (1991–1996), Domingo Cavallo, the architect of the Menem administration&#x27;s economic policies, specifically including &quot;convertibility&quot;, said:

The problems which arise with reliance on a fixed exchange rate mechanism (above) are discussed in the World Bank report &quot;Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform&quot;, which questions whether expectations can be &quot;positively affected by tying a government&#x27;s hands&quot;. In the early 1990s there was a point of view that countries should move to either fixed or completely flexible exchange rates to reassure market participants of the complete removal of government discretion in foreign exchange matters. After the Argentina collapse, some observers believe that removing government discretion by creating mechanisms that impose large penalties may, on the contrary, actually itself undermine expectations. Velasco and Neut (2003) &quot;argue that if the world is uncertain and there are situations in which the lack of discretion will cause large losses, a precommitment device can actually make things worse&quot;. In chapter 7 of its report (&quot;Financial Liberalization: What Went Right, What Went Wrong?&quot;) the World Bank analyses what went wrong in Argentina, summarizes the lessons from the experience, and draws suggestions for its future policy.

The IMF&#x27;s Independent Evaluation Office has issued a review of the lessons of Argentina for the institution, summarized in the following quotation:

While President Néstor Kirchner&#x27;s reliance on price controls and similar administrative measures (often aimed primarily at &quot;foreign-invested&quot; firms such as utilities) clearly ran counter to the spirit of the Consensus, his administration in fact ran an extremely tight fiscal ship and maintained a highly competitive floating exchange rate; Argentina&#x27;s immediate bounce-back from crisis, further aided by abrogating its debts and a fortuitous boom in prices of primary commodities, leaves open issues of longer-term sustainability. &quot;The Economist&quot; has argued that the Néstor Kirchner administration will end up as one more in Argentina&#x27;s long history of populist governments. In October 2008, Kirchner&#x27;s wife and successor as president, Cristina Kirchner, announced her government&#x27;s intention to nationalize pension funds from the privatized system implemented by Menem-Cavallo. Accusations have emerged of the manipulation of official statistics under the Kirchners (most notoriously, for inflation) to create an inaccurately positive picture of economic performance. &quot;The Economist&quot; removed Argentina&#x27;s inflation measure from its official indicators, saying that they were no longer reliable.

In 2003, Argentina&#x27;s and Brazil&#x27;s presidents, Néstor Kirchner and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signed the &quot;Buenos Aires Consensus&quot;, a manifesto opposing the Washington Consensus&#x27; policies. Skeptical political observers note, however, that Lula&#x27;s rhetoric on such public occasions should be distinguished from the policies actually implemented by his administration.

==== Venezuela ====


In the 1980s, a fall in oil prices and the start of the Latin American debt crisis brought economic difficulties to Venezuela. Additionally, President Luis Herrera Campins&#x27; economic policies led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolívar against the US dollar in a day that would be known as &quot;Viernes Negro&quot; (). Following the oil price crisis, the Herrera Campins government declared bankruptcy to the international banking community and then enacted currency restrictions. The policies centred on the establishment of an exchange-rate regime, imposing a restriction on the movement of currencies, and were strongly objected to by the then-president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, Leopoldo Díaz Bruzual. The currency controls devalued Venezuelan purchasing power by 75% in a matter of hours; banks did not open on Viernes Negro, and even the Central Bank did not have many reserves of foreign currencies, causing the government to devalue the bolívar by 100%.

Carlos Andrés Pérez based his campaign for the 1988 Venezuelan general election in his legacy of abundance during his first presidential period and initially rejected liberalization policies. Venezuela&#x27;s international reserves were only US$300 million at the time of Pérez&#x27; election into the presidency; Pérez decided to respond to the debt, public spending, economic restrictions and rentier state by liberalizing the economy and proceeded to implement Washington consensus reforms. He announced a technocratic cabinet and a group of economic policies to fix macroeconomic imbalances known as &quot;&quot; (), called by detractors as &quot;El Paquetazo Económico&quot; (). Among the policies there was the reduction of fuel subsidies and the increase of public transportation fares by thirty percent (VEB 16 Venezuelan bolívares, or US$0.4). The increase was supposed to be implemented on 1 March 1989, but bus drivers decided to apply the price rise on 27 February, a day before payday in Venezuela. In response, protests and rioting began on the morning of 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, a town near Caracas; a lack of timely intervention by authorities, as the was on a labor strike, led to the protests and rioting quickly spreading to the capital and other towns across the country.

By late 1991, as part of the economic reforms, Carlos Andrés Pérez&#x27; administration had sold three banks, a shipyard, two sugar mills, an airline, a telephone company and a cell phone band, receiving a total of US$2,287 million. The most remarkable auction was CANTV&#x27;s, a telecommunications company, which was sold at the price of US$1,885 million to the consortium composed of American AT&amp;T International, General Telephone Electronic and the Venezuelan Electricidad de Caracas and Banco Mercantil. The privatization ended Venezuela&#x27;s monopoly over telecommunications and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, with over US$1,000 million above the base price and US$500 million more than the bid offered by the competition group. By the end of the year, inflation had dropped to 31%, Venezuela&#x27;s international reserves were now worth US$14,000 million and there was an economic growth of 9% (called as an &quot;Asian growth&quot;), the largest in Latin America at the time. The Caracazo and previous inequality in Venezuela were used to justify the subsequent 1992 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempts and led to the rise of Hugo Chávez&#x27;s Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200, who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments. Once elected in 1998, Chávez began to revert the policies of his predecessors.

==Criticism==

As of the 2000s, several Latin American countries were led by socialist or other left wing governments, some of which—including Argentina and Venezuela—have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus policies. Other Latin American countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, in practice adopted the bulk of the policies included in Williamson&#x27;s list, even though they criticized the market fundamentalism that these are often associated with.

General criticism of the economics of the consensus is now more widely established, such as that outlined by US scholar Dani Rodrik, Professor of International Political Economy at Harvard University, in his paper &quot;Goodbye Washington Consensus, Hello Washington Confusion?&quot;.

As Williamson has pointed out, the term has come to be used in a broader sense than its original intention, as a synonym for market fundamentalism or neoliberalism. In this broader sense, Williamson states, it has been criticized by people such as George Soros and Joseph Stiglitz. The Washington Consensus is also criticized by others such as some Latin American politicians and heterodox economists such as Erik Reinert. The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and the influence of the United States, and globalization more broadly, on countries&#x27; national sovereignty.

Some US economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Dani Rodrik, have challenged what are sometimes described as the &#x27;fundamentalist&#x27; policies of the IMF and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; treatment of individual economies. According to Stiglitz the treatment suggested by the IMF is too simple: one dose, and fast—stabilize, liberalize and privatize, without prioritizing or watching for side effects.

Besides the excessive belief in market fundamentalism and international economic institutions in attributing the failure of the Washington consensus, Stiglitz provided a further explanation about why it failed. In his article &quot;The Post Washington Consensus Consensus&quot;, he claims that the Washington consensus policies failed to efficiently handle the economic structures within developing countries. The cases of East Asian states such as Korea and Taiwan are known as a success story in which their remarkable economic growth was attributed to a larger role of the government by undertaking industrial policies and increasing domestic savings within their territory. From the cases, the role for government was proven to be critical at the beginning stage of the dynamic process of development, at least until the markets by themselves can produce efficient outcomes.

The critique laid out in the World Bank&#x27;s study &quot;Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform&quot; (2005) shows how far discussion has come from the original ideas of the Washington Consensus. Gobind Nankani, a former vice-president for Africa at the World Bank, wrote in the preface: &quot;there is no unique universal set of rules... [W]e need to get away from formulae and the search for elusive &#x27;best practices&#x27;...&quot; (p. xiii). The World Bank&#x27;s new emphasis is on the need for humility, for policy diversity, for selective and modest reforms, and for experimentation.

The World Bank&#x27;s report &quot;Learning from Reform&quot; shows some of the developments of the 1990s. There was a deep and prolonged collapse in output in some (though by no means all) countries making the transition from communism to market economies (many of the Central and East European countries, by contrast, made the adjustment relatively rapidly). Academic studies show that more than two decades into the transition, some of the former communist countries, especially parts of the former Soviet Union, had still not caught up to their levels of output before 1989. A 2001 study by economist Steven Rosefielde posits that there were 3.4 million premature deaths in Russia from 1990 to 1998, which he party blames on the shock therapy imposed by the Washington Consensus. Neoliberal policies associated with the Washington Consensus, including pension privatization, the imposition of a flat tax, monetarism, cutting of corporate taxes, and central bank independence, continued into the 2000s. Many Sub-Saharan African&#x27;s economies failed to take off during the 1990s, in spite of efforts at policy reform, changes in the political and external environments, and continued heavy influx of foreign aid. Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique were among countries that showed some success, but they remained fragile. There were several successive and painful financial crises in Latin America, East Asia, Russia, and Turkey. The Latin American recovery in the first half of the 1990s was interrupted by crises later in the decade. There was less growth in per capita GDP in Latin America than in the period of rapid post-War expansion and opening in the world economy, 1950–80. Argentina, described by some as &quot;the poster boy of the Latin American economic revolution&quot;, came crashing down in 2002.

A significant body of economists and policy-makers argues that what was wrong with the Washington Consensus as originally formulated by Williamson had less to do with what was &quot;included&quot; than with what was &quot;missing&quot;. This view asserts that countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, largely governed by parties of the left in recent years, did not—whatever their rhetoric—in practice abandon most of the substantive elements of the Consensus. Countries that have achieved macroeconomic stability through fiscal and monetary discipline have been loath to abandon it: Lula, the former President of Brazil (and former leader of the Workers&#x27; Party of Brazil), has stated explicitly that the defeat of hyperinflation was among the most important positive contributions of the years of his presidency to the welfare of the country&#x27;s poor, although the remaining influence of his policies on tackling poverty and maintaining a steady low rate of inflation are being discussed and doubted in the wake of the Brazilian Economic Crisis currently occurring in Brazil.

These economists and policy-makers would, however, overwhelmingly agree that the Washington Consensus was &quot;incomplete&quot;, and that countries in Latin America and elsewhere need to move beyond &quot;first generation&quot; macroeconomic and trade reforms to a stronger focus on productivity-boosting reforms and direct programs to support the poor. This includes improving the investment climate and eliminating red tape (especially for smaller firms), strengthening institutions (in areas like justice systems), fighting poverty directly via the types of Conditional Cash Transfer programs adopted by countries like Mexico and Brazil, improving the quality of primary and secondary education, boosting countries&#x27; effectiveness at developing and absorbing technology, and addressing the special needs of historically disadvantaged groups including indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant populations across Latin America.

In a book edited with future president of Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, John Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, &quot;second-generation&quot; reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues.

Nobel laureate Michael Spence has defended the Washington Consensus, arguing &quot;I continue to find that when properly interpreted as a guide to the formulation of country-specific development strategies, the Washington Consensus has withstood the test of time quite well.&quot; According to Spence, &quot;The Washington Consensus was never intended as a complete or a one-size-fits-all development program.&quot; He does however note that the Washington Consensus &quot;was vulnerable to misuse due to the absence of an accompanying and explicit development model.&quot;

===Anti-globalization movement===
Many critics of trade liberalization, such as Noam Chomsky, Tariq Ali, Susan George, and Naomi Klein, see the Washington Consensus as a way to open the labor market of underdeveloped economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers allow the free movement of goods across borders according to market forces, but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a visa or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the Third World economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said to be offset by inflation, whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.

Despite macroeconomic advances, poverty and inequality remain at high levels in Latin America. About one of every three people—165 million in total—still live on less than $2 a day. Roughly a third of the population has no access to electricity or basic sanitation, and an estimated 10 million children suffer from malnutrition. These problems are not, however, new: Latin America was the most economically unequal region in the world in 1950, and has continued to be so ever since, during periods both of state-directed import-substitution and (subsequently) of market-oriented liberalization.

Some socialist political leaders in Latin America have been vocal and well-known critics of the Washington Consensus, such as the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, Cuban ex-President Fidel Castro, Bolivian President Evo Morales, and Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador. In Argentina, too, the recent Justicialist Party government of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner undertook policy measures which represented a repudiation of at least some Consensus policies.

===Proponents of the &quot;European model&quot; and the &quot;Asian way&quot;===
Some European and Asian economists suggest that &quot;infrastructure-savvy economies&quot; such as Norway, Singapore, and China have partially rejected the underlying Neoclassical &quot;financial orthodoxy&quot; that characterizes the Washington Consensus, instead initiating a pragmatist development path of their own based on sustained, large-scale, government-funded investments in strategic infrastructure projects: &quot;Successful countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea still remember the harsh adjustment mechanisms imposed abruptly upon them by the IMF and World Bank during the 1997–1998 &#x27;Asian Crisis&#x27; […] What they have achieved in the past 10 years is all the more remarkable: they have quietly abandoned the Washington Consensus by investing massively in infrastructure projects […] this pragmatic approach proved to be very successful&quot;.

While opinion varies among economists, Rodrik pointed out what he claimed was a factual paradox: while China and India increased their economies&#x27; reliance on free market forces to a limited extent, their general economic policies remained the exact opposite to the Washington Consensus&#x27; main recommendations. Both had high levels of protectionism, no privatization, extensive industrial policies planning, and lax fiscal and financial policies through the 1990s. Had they been dismal failures they would have presented strong evidence in support of the recommended Washington Consensus policies. However they turned out to be successes. According to Rodrik: &quot;While the lessons drawn by proponents and skeptics differ, it is fair to say that nobody really believes in the Washington Consensus anymore. The question now is not whether the Washington Consensus is dead or alive; it is what will replace it&quot;.

Rodrik&#x27;s account of Chinese or Indian policies during the period is not universally accepted. Among other things those policies involved major turns in the direction of greater reliance upon market forces, both domestically and internationally.

==Subsidies for agriculture==
The Washington Consensus as formulated by Williamson includes provision for the redirection of public spending from subsidies (&quot;especially indiscriminate subsidies&quot;) toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and infrastructure investment. This definition leaves some room for debate over specific public spending programs. One area of public controversy has focused on the issues of subsidies to farmers for fertilizers and other modern farm inputs: on the one hand, these can be criticized as subsidies, on the other, some experts argued that smallholder farmers often lack access to technical information, and these funding can generate positive externalities that might justify the subsidy involved.

Some critics of the Washington Consensus cite Malawi&#x27;s experience with agricultural subsidies, for example, as exemplifying perceived flaws in the package&#x27;s prescriptions. For decades, the World Bank and donor nations pressed Malawi, a predominantly rural country in Africa, to cut back or eliminate government fertilizer subsidies to farmers. World Bank experts also urged the country to have Malawi farmers shift to growing cash crops for export and to use foreign exchange earnings to import food. For years, Malawi hovered on the brink of famine; after a particularly disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid. Malawi&#x27;s president Bingu wa Mutharika then decided to reverse policy. Introduction of deep fertilizer subsidies (and lesser ones for seed), abetted by good rains, helped farmers produce record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007; according to government reports, corn production leapt from 1.2 million metric tons in 2005 to 2.7 million in 2006 and 3.4 million in 2007. The prevalence of acute child hunger has fallen sharply and Malawi turned away emergency food aid in 2006.

In a commentary on the Malawi experience prepared for the Center for Global Development, development economists Vijaya Ramachandran and Peter Timmer argue that fertilizer subsidies in parts of Africa (and Indonesia) can have benefits that substantially exceed their costs. They caution, however, that how the subsidy is operated is crucial to its long-term success, and warn against allowing fertilizer distribution to become a monopoly. Ramachandran and Timmer also stress that African farmers need more than just input subsidies—they need better research to develop new inputs and new seeds, as well as better transport and energy infrastructure. The World Bank reportedly now sometimes supports the temporary use of fertilizer subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets: &quot;In Malawi, Bank officials say they generally support Malawi&#x27;s policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out&quot;.

==Alternative usage vis-à-vis foreign policy==
In early 2008, the term &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; was used in a different sense as a metric for analyzing American mainstream media coverage of U.S. foreign policy generally and Middle East policy specifically. Marda Dunsky writes, &quot;Time and again, with exceedingly rare exceptions, the media repeat without question, and fail to challenge the &quot;Washington consensus&quot;—the official mind-set of US governments on Middle East peacemaking over time.&quot; According to syndicated columnist William Pfaff, Beltway centrism in American mainstream media coverage of foreign affairs is the rule rather than the exception: &quot;Coverage of international affairs in the US is almost entirely Washington-driven. That is, the questions asked about foreign affairs are Washington&#x27;s questions, framed in terms of domestic politics and established policy positions. This invites uninformative answers and discourages unwanted or unpleasant views.&quot;

<text> (; ) is a Greek-language work written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII. It is a domestic and foreign policy manual for the use of Constantine&#x27;s son and successor, the Emperor Romanos II. It is a prominent example of Byzantine encyclopaedism.

==Author and background==
The emperor Constantine VII &quot;Porphyrogenitus&quot; (905–959) was only surviving son of the emperor Leo VI the Wise (886–912). Leo VI gave the crown to young Constantine VII in 908 and he became the co-emperor. Leo VI died in May 912, and his brother and co-emperor Alexander became the ruler of Constantinople, but Alexander died in 913.

Constantine VII was too young to rule on his own, and the governorship was created. Later in May 919 Constantine VII married Helena Lekapene, daughter of Romanos Lekapenos. In December 920, Romanos I Lekapenos (920–944) was crowned a co-emperor, but he really took over the imperial reign in Constantinople. From 920, Constantine VII become increasingly distant from the imperial authorities; until December 944, when the sons of Emperor Romanos I suddenly rebelled and cloistered their father. Constantine VII, with the help of his supporters, cloistered his brothers-in-law, and personally ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire from January 945 to his death in November 959.

Constantine&#x27;s father, Leo was known for his learning and writings, and, correctly or not, Constantine VII also believed that his mother, Zoe Karbonopsina, was a relative of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, one of the Middle Byzantine Historians. Constantine VII was a scholar-emperor, who sought to foster learning and education in the empire. He gathered a group of educated people and dedicated himself to writing books about the administration, ceremonies, and history of the empire. A circle of educated people formed around Constantine VII wrote three unfinished books (, &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; and On the Themes) and finished a biography of his grandfather, Basil I.

The text known as was written by emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, but he had at least one educated &quot;Anonymous Collaborator&quot;. Constantine VII&#x27;s direct appeals to his son Romanus II and Constantine&#x27;s first-person commentaries are located both at the beginning of the treatise in the Proem and in chapter 13, as well as at the end of the text, in chapter 51. In this text his son Romanus II is never designated as a self-sustained ruler. Thus, the whole must have been written while Constantine VII was still alive.

It is said that was written between 948 and 952. Chapters 27, 29, and 45 of the work support that view. Chapter 29 says, &quot;now (today) is the VII indiction, the year 6457 from the creation of the world,&quot; and Byzantine year 6457 from the creation of the world corresponds with 948/949 CE. Chapter 45 says, &quot;now (today) is the X indiction, the year from the creation of the world 6460 in the reign of Constantine [VII] and Romanus [II],&quot; and Byzantine year 6460 from the creation of the world corresponds with 951/952 CE. From this, it would appear that some parts of the work were written in the period 948-952 CE. According to other researchers, was compiled at some point after 952 and before November 959 when Constantine VII died. Still others believe the book just an unfinished manuscript written between about 926 and November 959.

In the beginning of the , Constantine VII wrote that the work was a set of knowledge which his son Romanos II (born in 938, and ruled 959–963) will need. The intention of Emperor Constantine VII to write a manual for his successor, Romanos II, reduces the possibility that large untruths have been written. Therefore, is one of the most important sources for the study of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) and its neighbors.

It contains advice on ruling the heterogeneous empire as well as fighting foreign enemies. The work combines two of Constantine&#x27;s earlier treatises, &quot;On the Governance of the State and the various Nations&quot; (), concerning the histories and characters of the nations neighbouring the Empire, including the Hungarians, Pechenegs, Kievan Rus&#x27;, South Slavs, Arabs, Lombards, Armenians, and Georgians; and the &quot;On the Themes of East and West&quot; (, known in Latin as &quot;De Thematibus&quot;), concerning recent events in the imperial provinces. To this combination were added Constantine&#x27;s own political instructions to his son, Romanus.

==Content==
The book content, according to its preface, is divided into four sections:
*a key to the foreign policy in the most dangerous and complicated area of the contemporary political scene, the area of northerners and Scythians, 
*a lesson in the diplomacy to be pursued in dealing with the nations of the same area
*a comprehensive geographic and historical survey of most of the surrounding nations and 
*a summary of the recent internal history, politics and organization of the Empire.

As to the historical and geographic information, which is often confusing and filled with legends, this information is in essence reliable.

The historical and antiquarian treatise, which the Emperor had compiled during the 940s, is contained in the chapters 12–40. This treatise contains traditional and legendary stories of how the territories surrounding the Empire came in the past to be occupied by the people living in them in the Emperor&#x27;s times (Saracens, Lombards, Venetians, Serbs, Croats, Magyars, Pechenegs). Chapters 1–8, 10—12 explain imperial policy toward the Pechenegs and Turks. Chapter 13 is a general directive on foreign policy coming from the Emperor. Chapters 43—46 are about contemporary policy in the north-east (Armenia and Georgia). The guides to the incorporation and taxation of new imperial provinces, and to some parts of civil and naval administration, are in chapters 49–52. These later chapters (and chapter 53) were designed to give practical instructions to the emperor Romanus II, and are probably added during the year 951–52, in order to mark Romanus&#x27; fourteenth birthday (952).

==Manuscripts and editions==
There are four surviving copies:
The Greek text in its entirety was published seven times. The &quot;editio princeps&quot;, which was based on V, was published in 1611 by Johannes Meursius, who gave it the Latin title by which it is now universally known, and which translates as &quot;On Administering the Empire&quot;. This edition was published six years later with no changes. The next edition – which belongs to the A. Bandur (1711) – is collated copy of the first edition and manuscript P. Banduri&#x27;s edition was reprinted twice: in 1729 in the Venetian collection of the &quot;Byzantine Historians&quot;, and in 1864 Migne republished Banduri&#x27;s text with a few corrections.

Constantine himself had not given the work a name, preferring instead to start the text with the standard formal salutation: &quot;Constantine, in Christ the Eternal Sovereign, Emperor of the Romans, to [his] own son Romanos, the Emperor crowned of God and born in the purple&quot;.

==Language==
The language Constantine uses is rather straightforward High Medieval Greek, somewhat more elaborate than that of the Canonic Gospels, and easily comprehensible to an educated modern Greek. The only difficulty is the regular use of technical terms which – being in standard use at the time – may present &quot;prima facie&quot; hardships to a modern reader. For example, Constantine writes of the regular practice of sending &quot;basilikoí&quot; ( &quot;royals&quot;) to distant lands for negotiations. In this case, it is merely meant that &quot;royal men&quot;, i.e. imperial envoys, were sent as ambassadors on a specific mission. In the preamble, the emperor makes a point that he has avoided convoluted expressions and &quot;lofty Atticisms&quot; on purpose, so as to make everything &quot;plain as the beaten track of common, everyday speech&quot; for his son and those high officials with whom he might later choose to share the work. It is probably the extant written text that comes closest to the vernacular employed by the imperial palace bureaucracy in 10th-century Constantinople.

==Modern editions==
In 1892 R. Vari planned a new critical edition of this work and J.B. Bury later proposed to include this work in his collection of Byzantine Texts. He gave up the plan for an edition, surrendering it to Gyula Moravcsik in 1925. The first modern edition of the Greek text (by Gy. Moravscik) and its English translation (by R. J. H. Jenkins) appeared in Budapest in 1949. The next editions appeared in 1962 (Athlone, London) then in 1967 and 1993 (Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, Washington D.C.).

<text>An underwater environment is a environment of, and immersed in, liquid water in a natural or artificial feature (called a body of water), such as an ocean, sea, lake, pond, reservoir, river, canal, or aquifer. Some characteristics of the underwater environment are universal, but many depend on the local situation.

Liquid water has been present on Earth for most of the history of the planet. The underwater environment is thought to be the place of the origin of life on Earth, and it remains the ecological region most critical to the support of life and the natural habitat of the majority of living organisms. Several branches of science are dedicated to the study of this environment or specific parts or aspects of it.

A number of human activities are conducted in the more accessible parts of the underwater environment. These include research, underwater diving for work or recreation, and underwater warfare with submarines. It is hostile to humans in many ways and often inaccessible, and therefore relatively little explored.

==Extent==

Three quarters of the planet Earth are covered by water. Most of the planet&#x27;s solid surface is abyssal plain, at depths between below the surface of the oceans. The solid surface location on the planet closest to the center of the geoid is the Challenger Deep, located in the Mariana Trench at a depth of . There is a smaller part of the surface covered by bodies of fresh water and a large volume of underground water in aquifers. The underwater environment is hostile to humans in many ways and therefore little explored. It can be mapped by sonar, or more directly explored via manned, remotely operated, or autonomous submersibles. The ocean floors have been surveyed via sonar to at least a coarse resolution; particularly-strategic areas have been mapped in detail, to assist in navigating and detecting submarines, though the resulting maps may be classified.

===Oceans and seas===
An ocean is a body of water that composes much of a planet&#x27;s hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word &quot;ocean&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;sea&quot; in American English. Strictly speaking, a &quot;sea&quot; is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land, though &quot;the sea&quot; refers also to the oceans.

Saline water covers approximately and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth&#x27;s surface and 90% of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere. The ocean contains 97% of Earth&#x27;s water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 100% of the World Ocean has been explored. The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly .

===Lakes, ponds, and rivers===
A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them. Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.

A pond is an area filled with water, either natural or artificial, that is smaller than a lake. It may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or be a somewhat isolated depression (such as a kettle, vernal pool, or prairie pothole). It may contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. Ponds are frequently man-made or expanded beyond their original depth and bounds. Among their many uses, ponds provide water for agriculture and livestock, aid in habitat restoration, serve as fish hatcheries, are components of landscape architecture, may store thermal energy as solar ponds, and treat wastewater as treatment ponds. Ponds may be fresh, saltwater, or brackish.

A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing under the influence of gravity on ocean, lake, another river, or into the ground. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle; water generally collects in a river from precipitation in a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snow. Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.

===Subterranean water===


An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt). The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology. If an impermeable layer overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.

Aquifers may be classified as porous or karst, where a porous aquifer contains the water in the spaces between the grains of a loose sediment or rock (typically sand or sandstone), while a karst aquifer contains water mainly in relatively large voids in relatively impermeable rock, such as limestone or dolomite.

Water filled caves can be classified as active and relict: active caves have water flowing through them; relict caves do not, though water may be retained in them. Types of active caves include inflow caves (&quot;into which a stream sinks&quot;), outflow caves (&quot;from which a stream emerges&quot;), and through caves (&quot;traversed by a stream&quot;).

===Artificial bodies of water===

A reservoir is, most commonly, an enlarged natural or artificial lake, pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water. Reservoirs can be created in a number of ways, including controlling a watercourse that drains an existing body of water, interrupting a watercourse to form an embayment within it, through excavation, or building retaining walls or levees. Canals are artificial waterways which may have dams and locks that create reservoirs of low speed current flow.

==Physical characteristics==
Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. Water at the surface of the Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Water seldom exists in a pure form, it almost always contains dissolved substances, and usually other matter in suspension.

===Density===
The density of water is about The density varies with temperature, but not linearly: as the temperature increases, the density rises to a peak at and then decreases; this is unusual. Regular, hexagonal ice is also less dense than liquid water—upon freezing, the density of water decreases by about 9%. These effects are due to the reduction of thermal motion with cooling, which allows water molecules to form more hydrogen bonds that prevent the molecules from coming close to each other. While below 4 °C the breakage of hydrogen bonds due to heating allows water molecules to pack closer despite the increase in the thermal motion (which tends to expand a liquid), above 4 °C water expands as the temperature increases. Water near the boiling point is about 4% less dense than water at .
The unusual density curve and lower density of ice than of water is vital to life—if water were most dense at the freezing point, then in winter the very cold water at the surface of lakes and other water bodies would sink, the lake could freeze from the bottom up, and all life in them would be killed. Furthermore, given that water is a good thermal insulator (due to its heat capacity), some frozen lakes might not completely thaw in summer. The layer of ice that floats on top insulates the water below. Water at about 4 °C (39 °F) also sinks to the bottom, thus keeping the temperature of the water at the bottom constant (see diagram).

The density of sea water depends on the dissolved salt content as well as the temperature. Ice still floats in the oceans, otherwise they would freeze from the bottom up. The salt content lowers the freezing point by about 1.9 °C and lowers the temperature of the density maximum of water to the fresh water freezing point at 0 °C. This is why, in ocean water, the downward convection of colder water is &quot;not&quot; blocked by an expansion of water as it becomes colder near the freezing point. The oceans&#x27; cold water near the freezing point continues to sink. So creatures that live at the bottom of cold oceans like the Arctic Ocean generally live in water 4 °C colder than at the bottom of frozen-over fresh water lakes and rivers.

As the surface of sea water begins to freeze (at −1.9 °C for salinity 3.5%) the ice that forms is essentially salt-free, with about the same density as freshwater ice. This ice floats on the surface, and the salt that is &quot;frozen out&quot; adds to the salinity and density of the sea water just below it, in a process known as &quot;brine rejection&quot;. This denser salt water sinks by convection. This produces essentially freshwater ice at −1.9 °C on the surface. On a large scale, the process of brine rejection and sinking cold salty water results in ocean currents forming to transport such water away from the Poles, leading to a global system of currents called the thermohaline circulation.

====Pressure====

The density of water causes ambient pressures that increase dramatically with depth. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 14.7 pounds per square inch or around 100 kPa. A comparable hydrostatic pressure occurs at a depth of only ( for sea water). Thus, at about 10 m below the surface, the water exerts twice the pressure (2 atmospheres or 200 kPa) as air at surface level.

====Buoyancy====

Any object immersed in water is subjected to a buoyant force that counters the force of gravity, appearing to make the object less heavy. If the overall density of the object exceeds the density of water, the object sinks. If the overall density is less than the density of water, the object rises until it floats on the surface.

===Penetration of light===
With increasing depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and the amount of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is turbid, in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33 feet). At 100 m (330 ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.

The euphotic depth is the depth at which light intensity falls to 1% of the value at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a few metres underwater in a turbid estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the open ocean. At the euphotic depth, plants (such as phytoplankton) have no net energy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.

===Temperature===
There are three layers of ocean temperature: the surface layer, the thermocline, and the deep ocean. The average temperature of surface layer is about 17 °C. About 90% of ocean&#x27;s water is below the thermocline in the deep ocean, where most of the water is below 4 °C.

There are temperature anomalies at active volcanic sites and hydrothermal vents, where deep-water temperatures can significantly exceed 100 °C.

===Thermal conductivity===
Water conducts heat around 25 times more efficiently than air. Hypothermia, a potentially fatal condition, occurs when the human body&#x27;s core temperature falls below 35 °C. Insulating the body&#x27;s warmth from water is the main purpose of diving suits and exposure suits when used in water temperatures below 25 °C.

===Acoustic properties===

Sound is transmitted about 4.3 times faster in water (1,484 m/s in fresh water) than in air (343 m/s). The human brain can determine the direction of sound in air by detecting small differences in the time it takes for sound waves in air to reach each of the two ears. For these reasons, divers find it difficult to determine the direction of sound underwater. Some animals have adapted to this difference and many use sound to navigate underwater.

==Ecosystems==

An aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem in a body of water. Communities of organisms that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems.

Marine ecosystems are the largest of Earth&#x27;s aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by waters that have a high salt content. Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth&#x27;s water supply and 90% of habitable space on Earth. Marine ecosystems include nearshore systems, such as the salt marshes, mudflats, seagrass meadows, mangroves, rocky intertidal systems and coral reefs. They also extend from the coast to include offshore systems, such as the surface ocean, pelagic ocean waters, the deep sea, oceanic hydrothermal vents, and the sea floor. Marine ecosystems are characterized by the biological community of organisms that they are associated with and their physical environment. As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere, it is integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The World Ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million.
Freshwater ecosystems include lakes and ponds, rivers, streams, springs, aquifers, bogs, and wetlands. They have a lower salt content than marine ecosystems. Freshwater habitats can be classified by different factors, including temperature, light penetration, nutrients, and vegetation. Freshwater ecosystems can be divided into lentic ecosystems (still water) and lotic ecosystems (flowing water).

Aquatic ecosystems are characterised by the limitation on ambient lighting due to absorption by the water itself and by dissolved and suspended matter in the water column, and by the support provided by buoyancy. Nutrients usable by plants are dissolved in the water, making them easily available. However, the interaction of light absorption by water, matter and living organisms themselves leads to very different light and light spectrum conditions depending on the respective ecosystem and its water depth. This affects photosynthesis and the ecology of plants and phytoplankton. Outside the euphotic zone, photosynthesis cannot occur and life must use other sources of energy than sunlight.

==Humans==

Although a number of human activities are conducted underwater—such as research, underwater diving for work or recreation, and underwater warfare with submarines, the underwater environment is hostile to humans in many ways and therefore little explored.

An immediate obstacle to human activity under water is that human lungs cannot naturally function in this environment. Unlike the gills of fish, human lungs are adapted to the exchange of gases at atmospheric pressure. Any penetration into the underwater environment for more than a few minutes requires artificial aids to maintain life.

For solid and liquid tissues like bone, muscle and blood, the high ambient pressure is not much of a problem; but it is a problem for any gas-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the gas in those spaces is much more compressible than the solids and liquids, and reduces in volume much more when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10 ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. The raised pressure also affects the solution of breathing gases in the tissues over time, and can lead to a range of adverse effects, such as inert gas narcosis, and oxygen toxicity. Decompression must be controlled to avoid bubble formation in the tissues and the consequent symptoms of decompression sickness.

With a few exceptions, the underwater environment tends to cool the unprotected human body. This heat loss will generally lead to hypothermia eventually.

===Hazards===

There are several classes of hazards to humans inherent to the underwater environment. 
*Absence of breathable gas, which can cause asphyxia, specifically by drowning.
*Ambient pressures which could cause barotrauma, or toxic effects of breathing gas components at raised partial pressures.
*Ambient temperatures which may lead to hypothermia, or in unusual cases, to hyperthermia, due to high rates of heat exchange.
*Solution of inert breathing gas components may lead to decompression sickness if decompression is too rapid.
*Entrainment of diver by moving water in currents and waves can cause injury by impacting the diver against hard objects or moving them to inappropriate depths.
*Dangerous aquatic organisms of various sorts.

===Ambient pressure diving===

In ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Immersion in water and exposure to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful work to be done underwater.

===Atmospheric pressure diving===
A diver can be isolated from the ambient pressure by using an atmospheric diving suit (ADS), which is a small one-person articulated anthropomorphic submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure resisting joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for relatively deep dives of up to for many hours, and eliminates the majority of significant physiological dangers associated with deep diving; the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, nor is there danger of decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis, and the diver is effectively isolated from most aquatic organisms. Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers, but mobility and dexterity are significantly degraded.

===Submersibles and submarines===

A submersible is a small watercraft designed to operate underwater. The term &quot;submersible&quot; is often used to differentiate from other underwater vessels known as submarines, in that a submarine is a fully autonomous craft, capable of renewing its own power and breathing air, whereas a submersible is usually supported by a surface vessel, platform, shore team or sometimes a larger submarine. There are many types of submersibles, including both manned and unmanned craft, otherwise known as remotely operated vehicles or ROVs.

=== Remotely operated or autonomous vehicles ===

Remotely operated underwater vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles are part of a larger group of undersea systems known as unmanned underwater vehicles. ROVs are unoccupied, usually highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew either aboard a vessel/floating platform or on proximate land. They are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether, or a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The umbilical cable contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. In high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump for propulsion and to power equipment. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle&#x27;s capabilities. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots that travel underwater without requiring input from an operator. Underwater gliders are a subclass of AUVs.

<doc id="305273" wikidata="Q572887" url="?curid=305273" title="8 Canada Square">
<text>8 Canada Square is a 45 floor skyscraper in Canary Wharf, London. The building is the global headquarters of HSBC Holdings.

==Design and construction==
Having been commissioned by the owners of the Canary Wharf Site to undertake the outline design prior to gaining site-wide outline planning permission, and because he had designed HSBC&#x27;s head office in Hong Kong, Sir Norman Foster was appointed as architect.

Construction began in January 1999, with work beginning on the installation of the 4,900 glass panels commencing in the summer of 2000. The work was carried out by Canary Wharf Contractors. 

The topping out ceremony took place on 7 March 2001, with the hoisting in of the final steel girder attended by bankers, journalists and contractors. The first HSBC employees began work in the building on 2 September 2002, with phased occupation completed by 17 February 2003, and the building&#x27;s official opening, by Sir John Bond, taking place on 2 April 2003.

==Floors ==
==Ownership==
In April 2007, HSBC Tower was sold to Spanish property company Metrovacesa, becoming the first building in Britain to be sold for more than £1bn. As part of the sale, HSBC retained occupancy control and agreed a 20-year lease at a cost of £43.5m per annum.

In December 2008, after Metrovacesa encountered problems with re-financing the bridging loan that HSBC had provided it and as part of a wider debt restructure for Metrovacesa, the bank bought back the property. HSBC stated it had made a £250m profit on the deal.

In November 2009, HSBC once again sold the building, this time to the National Pension Service (&quot;NPS&quot;), the public pension fund for South Korea. HSBC&#x27;s income statement on completion declared a gain of approximately £350million resulting from the transaction.

In December 2014, Qatar Investment Authority completed the purchase of the building at an undisclosed price, but the building was expected to fetch more than £1.1 billion (US$1.73 billion). NPS was advised by the estate agents Jones Lang LaSalle and GM Real Estate.

==Occupancy issues==
In September 2022, a leaked internal memo stated that HSBC was considering whether to renew its lease on the building when it expires in 2027, or whether it would relocate to other premises in London.

In February 2023, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that roughly 10 floors had been mothballed, having embraced home-working.

In June 2023, the bank subsequently confirmed its intention to move out of the building by 2027 in favour of a property in the City of London.

==Crane accident==
On 21 May 2000, three workmen employed by Hewden Tower Cranes were killed in a crane accident when the top of a Wolf Luffing crane snapped off into the adjacent North Colonnade area. 

An inquest three years later had heard a special safety plug was missing and that there was no anemometer in the crane cab to measure wind speed, although there were no weather problems that day.

The three workmen were Michael Whittard who was 36 from Leeds, Martin Burgess who was 31 from Castleford, West Yorkshire, and Peter Clark who was 33, from Southwark in South London.

A memorial plaque under a tree opposite 8 Canada Square is in memory of these three men who lost their lives that day.

==Falling glass==
In the summer of 2003, one year after the completion of the tower, the first incident of a glass panel was recorded when it had fallen from the 42nd floor. This incident was during the early morning hours, and no one was injured.

On 9 June 2004, another window panel fell from the plant floor of the tower on the 43rd floor. This had mirrored an almost identical incident a year prior, this time with a reported near miss by a security guard in the afternoon.

Another incident was reported seven years later in 2011, when part of the HSBC signage fell off and smashed to the ground. The glass had fallen over onto the building&#x27;s western entrance. The North Colonnade area of Canary Wharf was subsequently closed off while inspection took place. There were no reports of any injuries.

==Extinction Rebellion==
On the morning of 22 April 2021 - coinciding with Earth Day, the environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion vandalised the lobby windows of the tower using chisels and hammers, attempting to smash the glass as part of the protesting against the bank&#x27;s fossil fuel financing. 

Those involved were subsequently arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Damages relating to the vandalism amounted to approximately £500,000 were caused by the group. 

Similar actions of vandalism were carried out by the group at Barclays Head Office also in Canary Wharf at One Churchill Place earlier that month.

==Renovations==
In early 2013, the tower underwent significant renovation work relating to the installation of new signage, replacing both the embedded lettering and hexagons within the glass panels across all four sides. 

This work was carried out by contractors Tara Signs, who engineered and installed the new signage. The project was finished in late 2014. 

The now current signage uses a specially formulated LED enhancing Polycarbonate, giving the appearance of black lettering during the day, and illuminated white during the night. 

Lighting behind the tiles were also replaced from fluorescent tube lighting to LED, although rarely used. 

As of 2018, the HSBC logo installed on the tower is now out-of-date, displaying the previously used font and positioning of the hexagon. It is assumed that the signage will not be updated in the near future due to the bank&#x27;s intention to vacate the premises in 2027.

== Future redevelopment ==
In July 2024 the Canary Wharf Group and QIA announced plans on redeveloping the property. This would take place after HSBC vacate the property in 2027. The plans involve repurposing the building for multipurpose use. This would include space for retail, leisure, and residential use. The property will also continue to maintain office space. The ambitious plan involves carving out sections of the building and creating a viewing deck. 

Several architects were invited to submit plans for the redeveloped and in July 2024 it was announced the Kohn Pedersen Fox won the competition. 

==Stephen and Stitt==
Stephen and Stitt are found at the main entrance of 8 Canada Square. The pair were commissioned for the towers opening in 2002, soon to be the groups new headquarters.

The lions were cast within sight of the development by the Bronze Age Sculpture Casting Foundry in Limehouse.

<doc id="305282" wikidata="Q5724396" url="?curid=305282" title="Henry Kirke White">
<text>Henry Kirke White (21 March 1785 – 19 October 1806) was an English poet and hymn-writer. He died at the young age of 21.

==Life==
White was born in Nottingham, the son of a butcher, a trade for which he was himself intended. However, he was greatly attracted to book-learning. By age seven, he was giving reading lessons (unbeknownst to the rest of the family, being offered after the household were abed) to a family servant. After being briefly apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, he was articled to a lawyer, George Coldham. While in this position, he excelled in studying Latin and Greek. When his health deteriorated due to tuberculosis, his employers gave him leave of absence for a month. He chose to live in Wilford at the crossroads, opposite Wilford House between 1804 and 1805. He drew inspiration for much of his poetry from Wilford and the surrounding area.

He wrote many of his poems in the gazebo which stands in the grounds of St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church, Wilford. Here he wrote:-

Seeing the results of White&#x27;s diligent studies and his deteriorating health, his master offered to release him from his contract if he had sufficient means to go to college. He received encouragement from Capel Lofft, the friend of Robert Bloomfield, and published in 1803, aged 17,&quot;Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems&quot;, dedicated to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. One of the better known ones was &#x27;The Fair Maid of Clifton&#x27; and another was &#x27;Clifton Grove&#x27; in which were the controversial lines:-

The book was violently attacked in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; (February 1804), but White was rewarded with a kind letter from Robert Southey.

Through the efforts of his friends, he was able to enter St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, having spent a year beforehand with a private tutor, the Rev. Lorenzo Grainger, at Winteringham, Lincolnshire. Close application to study induced a serious illness—consumption was the disease, according to Sir Harris Nicholas&#x27;s memoir—to which he ultimately became a victim, and to which White made many allusions in his poems and letters. Fears were also entertained for his sanity, but he went into residence at Cambridge, with a view to taking holy orders, in the autumn of 1805. The strain of continuous study quickly worsened his already deteriorating health resulting in his death.

He was buried in All Saints&#x27; Church, Cambridge, which stood opposite the gates of St John&#x27;s College, but has since been demolished. The monument marking the grave was sculpted by Francis Chantrey.

The genuine piety of his religious verses secured a place in popular hymnology for some of his hymns, in particular the still popular &quot;O Lord, another day is flown&quot;. Much of his fame was due to sympathy inspired by his early death; but Lord Byron agreed with Southey about the young man&#x27;s promise. Robert Southey said of him: &quot;...he could not rest satisfied till he had formed his principles upon the basis of Christianity.&quot;

A metal plaque can be seen in Exchange Arcade, Cheapside in Nottingham, on the site of Kirke White&#x27;s birthplace. Originally a Holbrook plaque was erected on the actual dwelling but was removed when that was demolished prior to the erection of the Council House.

St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church, Wilford contains two memorials. One is a marble plaque inside the nave, the second is a memorial stained glass window, c.1870, by O&#x27;Connor.

==Literary legacy==
His &quot;Remains&quot;, with his letters (which along with White&#x27;s poems contain many allusions to himself that they may almost be considered an autobiography) and an account of his life, were edited (5 vols., 1807–1822) by Robert Southey. See prefatory notices by Sir Harris Nicolas to his &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (new ed., 1866) in the Aldine Press &quot;British poets&quot;; by Harry Kirke Swann in the volume of selections (1897) in the &quot;Canterbury Poets&quot;; and by John Drinkwater to the edition in the &quot;Muses&#x27; Library.&quot; See also John Thomas Godfrey and J. Ward, &quot;The Homes and Haunts of Henry Kirke White&quot; (1908). Lord Byron said of White in a tributary eulogy &#x27;while life was in its spring, thy young muse just waved her joyous wing&#x27;. White&#x27;s complete works were published in 1923.

<text>Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) is a program that facilitates radio communications between licensed amateur radio operators and crew members aboard the International Space Station using the amateur-satellite service. The primary goal or ARISS is &quot;to promote exploration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics topics&quot; and inspire individuals to pursue careers in STEM.

ARISS was established in 1996 and is managed by an international consortium of amateur radio organizations and space agencies including NASA, Russia&#x27;s space agency Roscosmos, Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Japan Aeronautics Exploration Space Agency (JAXA), and European Space Agency (ESA). 

ARISS was previously called the Space Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and before that the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment.

Students and amateur radio operators all over the world are able to speak directly to astronauts and cosmonauts via handheld, mobile, or home radio stations. Low power radios and small antennas can be used to establish communications. It is also possible to send digital data to the ISS via laptop computers, similar to an email communication, using radio frequencies instead of telephone or cable connections .

On November 12, 2000 the first amateur radio contacts were made from the International Space Station during Expedition 1. Sometime between 06:30 and 10:10 UTC Sergei Krikalev (callsign U5MIR) contacted the ARISS team in Russia. At 10:55 UTC Kiralev and William Shepherd (callsign KF5GSL) operating as NA1SS contacted the amateur radio club at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. A few minutes later they would talk to the Johnson Space Center club, W5RRR. The team noted in the mission log, &quot;Comm quality of the VHF circuit was excellent. Signal to noise and readability of the ham radio is better than our other comm circuits.&quot;

In 2011, Kenwood Electronics launched an advertising campaign capitalizing on the fact that their TM-D700A transceiver is currently in use on the ISS.

Many of the space station crew are also amateur radio operators. After their standard work day (based on UTC time), they might use their evening free time to communicate with family and other hams via amateur radio. Crew member Kjell N. Lindgren spoke with a young operator in the UK during the summer of 2022 and later they exchanged photos and cards. Crew members from ISS Expedition 69 and Expedition 70 as well as Axiom 1 and Axiom 2 have made recent space to ground contacts with schools via Amateur Radio.

==Interoperable Radio System (IORS)==
Interoperable Radio System (IORS) is the foundation element of the ARISS next-generation radio system on ISS. A total of four flight units and ten total units are being built by the ARISS hardware team. This first IORS radio was flown to ISS on SpaceX CRS-20 and installed in the ISS Columbus module by Expedition 63 Commander, Chris Cassidy on September 2, 2020. System activation was first observed at 01:02 UTC on September 2 by ARISS control station and amateur radio ground operators. Initial operation of the new radio system began as an FM cross band repeater.

A second flight unit has launched on a later 2020 cargo flight for installation in the Russian Service module. Since 2022 ARISS has been using IORS radios in both the Columbus and Service Modules. The Columbus Module radio typically functions as the crossband voice repeater when not being used for contacts with students. The Service Module IORS radio typically is used for packet radio operations like Automatic Packet Reporting System activities or Slow-scan television events. The IORS consists of a special, modified JVCKenwood D710GA transceiver, an AMSAT-developed multi voltage power supply and interconnecting cables.

The IORS has a higher power radio, an enhanced voice repeater, updated digital packet radio (APRS) capabilities and slow scan television (SSTV) capabilities for both the US and Russian segments.

<doc id="305286" wikidata="Q145909" url="?curid=305286" title="Legume">
<text>Legumes () are plants in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), or the fruit or seeds of such plants. When used as a dry grain for human consumption, the seeds are also called pulses. Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for human consumption, but also as livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include beans, chickpeas, peanuts, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, tamarind, alfalfa, and clover. Legumes produce a botanically unique type of fruit – a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides.

Most legumes have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Rhizobia, in structures called root nodules. Some of the fixed nitrogen becomes available to later crops, so legumes play a key role in crop rotation.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;pulse&quot;, as used by the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is reserved for legume crops harvested solely for the dry seed. This excludes green beans and green peas, which are considered vegetable crops. Also excluded are seeds that are mainly grown for oil extraction (oilseeds like soybeans and peanuts), and seeds which are used exclusively for sowing forage (clovers, alfalfa). However, in common usage, these distinctions are not always clearly made, and many of the varieties used for dried pulses are also used for green vegetables, with their beans in pods while young.

Some Fabaceae, such as Scotch broom and other Genisteae, are leguminous but are usually not called legumes by farmers, who tend to restrict that term to food crops.

The FAO recognizes 11 primary pulses, excluding green vegetable legumes (e.g. green peas) and legumes used mainly for oil extraction (e.g., soybeans and groundnuts) or used only as seed (e.g., clover and alfalfa).

== Distribution ==

Legumes are widely distributed as the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species, constituting about seven percent of flowering plant species.

== Ecology ==

=== Nitrogen fixation ===


Many legumes contain symbiotic bacteria called &quot;Rhizobia&quot; within root nodules of their root systems (plants belonging to the genus &quot;Styphnolobium&quot; are one exception to this rule). These bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric, molecular nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3). The chemical reaction is:

Ammonia is converted to another form, ammonium (), usable by (some) plants, by the following reaction:

This arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes, making them relatively rich in nitrogenous amino acids and protein. Nitrogen is therefore a necessary ingredient in the production of proteins.

When a legume plant dies in the field, for example following the harvest, all of its remaining nitrogen, incorporated into amino acids inside the remaining plant parts, is released back into the soil. In the soil, the amino acids are converted to nitrate (), making the nitrogen available to other plants, thereby serving as fertilizer for future crops.

In many traditional and organic farming practices, crop rotation or polyculture involving legumes is common. By alternating between legumes and non-legumes, or by growing both together for part of the growing season, the field can receive a sufficient amount of nitrogenous compounds to produce a good result without adding nitrogenous fertilizer. Legumes are often used as green manure.

Sri Lanka developed the polyculture practice known as coconut-soybean intercropping. Grain legumes are grown in coconut (&quot;Cocos nuficera&quot;) groves in two ways: intercropping or as a cash crop. These are grown mainly for their protein, vegetable oil and ability to uphold soil fertility. However, continuous cropping after 3–4 years decrease grain yields significantly.

=== Pests and diseases ===
A common pest of grain legumes that is noticed in the tropical and subtropical Asia, Africa, Australia and Oceania are minuscule flies that belong to the family &quot;Agromyzidae&quot;, dubbed &quot;bean flies&quot;. They are considered to be the most destructive. The host range of these flies is very wide amongst cultivated legumes. Infestation of plants starts from germination through to harvest, and they can destroy an entire crop in early stage. Black bean aphids are a serious pest to broad beans and other beans. Common hosts for this pest are fathen, thistle and dock. Pea weevil and bean weevil damage leaf margins leaving characteristics semi-circular notches. Stem nematodes are very widespread but will be found more frequently in areas where host plants are grown.

Common legume diseases include anthracnose, caused by &quot;Colletotrichum trifolii&quot;; common leaf spot caused by &quot;Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae&quot;; crown wart caused by &quot;Physoderma alfalfae&quot;; downy mildew caused by &quot;Peronospora trifoliorum&quot;; root rot caused by &quot;Fusarium&quot; spp.; rust caused by &quot;Uromyces striatus&quot;; crown and stem rot caused by &quot;Sclerotinia trifoliorum&quot;; Southern blight caused by &quot;Sclerotium rolfsii&quot;; pythium (browning) root rot caused by &quot;Pythium&quot; spp.; fusarium wilt caused by &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;; root knot caused by &quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot;. These are all classified as biotic problems.

Abiotic problems include nutrient deficiencies, (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, magnesium, manganese, boron, zinc), pollutants (air, water, soil, pesticide injury, fertilizer burn), toxic concentration of minerals, and unfavorable growth conditions.

== Storage ==

Seed viability decreases with longer storage time. Studies of vetch, broad beans, and peas show that they last about 5 years in storage. Environmental factors that are important in influencing germination are relative humidity and temperature. Two rules apply to moisture content between 5 and 14 percent: the life of the seed will last longer if the storage temperature is reduced by 5 degree Celsius. Secondly, the storage moisture content will decrease if temperature is reduced by 1 degree Celsius.

== Uses ==

Cultivated legumes encompass a diverse range of agricultural classifications, spanning forage, grain, flowering, pharmaceutical/industrial, fallow/green manure, and timber categories. A notable characteristic of many commercially cultivated legume species is their versatility, often assuming multiple roles concurrently. The extent of these roles is contingent upon the stage of maturity at which they are harvested.

=== Human consumption ===

Grain legumes are cultivated for their seeds, for humans and animals to eat, or for oils for industrial uses. Grain legumes include beans, lentils, lupins, peas, and peanuts.

Legumes are a key ingredient in vegan meat and dairy substitutes. They are growing in use as a plant-based protein source in the world marketplace. Products containing legumes grew by 39% in Europe between 2013 and 2017.

There is a common misconception that adding salt before cooking prevents them from cooking through. Legumes may not soften because they are old, or because of hard water or acidic ingredients in the pot; salting before cooking results in better seasoning.

==== Nutritional value ====

Legumes are a significant source of protein, dietary fibre, carbohydrates, and dietary minerals; for example, a 100 gram serving of cooked chickpeas contains 18 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for protein, 30 percent DV for dietary fiber, 43 percent DV for folate and 52 percent DV for manganese.

Legumes are an excellent source of resistant starch; this is broken down by bacteria in the large intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids (such as butyrate) used by intestinal cells for food energy.

=== Forage ===

Forage legumes are of two broad types. Some, like alfalfa, clover, vetch (&quot;Vicia&quot;), stylo (&quot;Stylosanthes&quot;), or &quot;Arachis&quot;, are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock. Others, such as &quot;Leucaena&quot; or &quot;Albizia&quot;, are woody shrubs or trees that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide fodder. Legume-based feeds improve animal performance over a diet of perennial grasses. Factors include larger consumption, faster digestion, and higher feed conversion rate.

The type of crop grown for animal rearing depends on the farming system. In cattle rearing, legume trees such as &quot;Gliricidia sepium&quot; can be planted along edges of fields to provide shade for cattle, the leaves and bark are often eaten by cattle. Green manure can be grown between harvesting the main crop and the planting of the next crop.

===Other uses===

Legume species grown for their flowers include lupins, which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide. Industrially farmed legumes include &quot;Indigofera&quot; and &quot;Acacia&quot; species, which are cultivated for dye and natural gum production, respectively. Fallow or green manure legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil in order to exploit the high levels of captured atmospheric nitrogen found in the roots of most legumes. Numerous legumes farmed for this purpose include &quot;Leucaena&quot;, &quot;Cyamopsis&quot;, and &quot;Sesbania&quot; species. Various legume species are farmed for timber production worldwide, including numerous &quot;Acacia&quot; species and &quot;Castanospermum australe&quot;.

Some legume trees, like the honey locust (&quot;Gleditsia&quot;) can be used in agroforestry. Others, including the black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;), Kentucky coffeetree (&quot;Gymnocladus dioicus&quot;), &quot;Laburnum,&quot; and the woody climbing vine &quot;Wisteria&quot;, have poisonous elements.

== History ==
Neanderthals and early modern humans used wild pulses when cooking meals 70,000 to 40,000 years ago. Traces of pulse production have been found around the Ravi River (Punjab), the seat of the Indus Valley civilisation, from 3300 BC. Meanwhile, evidence of lentil cultivation has also been found in Egyptian pyramids and cuneiform recipes. Dry pea seeds have been discovered in a Swiss village that are believed to date back to the Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests that these peas must have been grown in the eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamian regions at least 5,000 years ago and in Britain as early as the 11th century. The soybean was domesticated around 5,000 years ago in China from a descendant of the wild vine &quot;Glycine soja.&quot;

The oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in Guitarrero Cave, an archaeological site in Peru, and dated to around the second millennium BCE. Genetic analyses of the common bean &quot;Phaseolus&quot; show that it originated in Mesoamerica, and subsequently spread southward, along with maize and squash, traditional companion crops. In the United States, the domesticated soybean was introduced in 1770 by Benjamin Franklin after he sent seeds to Philadelphia from France.

=== International Year of Pulses ===


The International Year of Pulses 2016 was declared by the Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was nominated to facilitate the implementation of the year in collaboration with governments, relevant organizations, non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders. Its aim was to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses as part of sustainable food production aimed towards food security and nutrition. The year created an opportunity to encourage connections throughout the food chain that would better use pulse-based proteins, further global production of pulses, better use crop rotations and address challenges in the global trade of pulses.

<text>Sir (Nicholas) Harris Nicolas (10 March 1799 – 3 August 1848) was an English antiquary.

==Life==

The fourth son of Commander John Harris Nicolas RN (1758–1844) and Margaret (née Blake), he was born at Dartmouth. He was the brother of Rear Admiral John Toup Nicolas RN CB KH; 1st Lt Paul Harris Nicolas RM; and Lt Keigwin Nicholas RN.

Having served in the navy from 1812 to 1816, he studied law and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1825. His work as a barrister was confined principally to peerage cases before the House of Lords, and he devoted the rest of his time to the study of genealogy and history.

In 1831, he was made a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order, and, in 1832, chancellor and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), being advanced to Grand Cross of the order in 1840. He became a member of the council of the Society of Antiquaries in 1826, but soon began to criticise the management of the Society&#x27;s affairs, and withdrew in 1828. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838.

He criticised the Record Commission, which he regarded as too expensive. These attacks, which brought him into controversy with Francis Palgrave, led in 1836 to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the public records. Nicolas was also responsible for several reforms at the British Museum.

In 1822, he married Sarah (d. 1867), daughter of John Davison of Loughton, Essex, a reputed descendant of the Tudor statesman William Davison. They had two sons and six daughters. Financial difficulties compelled Nicolas to leave England, and he died near Boulogne.

==Works==
The most important of Nicolas&#x27; works is his &quot;History of the Orders of Knighthood of the British Empire; of the Order of the Guelphs; and of Medals, Clasps, &amp;c., for Naval and Military Services&quot; (London, 1841–1842), which was the first attempt to write a general history of the British honours. Among his numerous other writings are:
*&quot;The Chronology of History&quot; (London, 1833)
*&quot;Life of William Davison&quot; (London, 1823); Nicholas Harris Nicolas, &quot;Life of William Davison: Secretary of State and Privy Counsellor to Queen Elizabeth&quot;, Nichols (1823)
*&quot;Synopsis of the Peerage of England&quot; (London, 1825)
*&quot;Life and Times of Sir Christopher Hatton&quot; (London, 1847)
*an uncompleted &quot;History of the Royal Navy&quot; (London, 1847).
He edited &quot;Proceedings and Ordinances of the Privy Council of England, 1386–1542&quot; (London, 1834–1837), and (with the help of Nelson&#x27;s daughter Horatia) &quot;Dispatches and Letters of Lord Nelson&quot; (London, 1844–1846); wrote lives of Geoffrey Chaucer, Robert Burns, William Cowper, William Collins, Henry Kirke White and others for Pickering&#x27;s Aldine Press edition of the poets; lives of Izaak Walton and Charles Cotton for an edition of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; illustrated by James Inskipp; and several elaborate works on genealogical and kindred subjects printed for private circulation only.

<text>Charles Cotton (28 April 1630 – 16 February 1687) was an English poet and writer, best known for translating the work of Michel de Montaigne from French, for his contributions to &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, and for the influential &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; attributed to him.

==Early life==
He was born in Alstonefield, Staffordshire, at Beresford Hall, near the Derbyshire Peak District. His father, Charles Cotton the Elder, was a friend of Ben Jonson, John Selden, Sir Henry Wotton and Izaak Walton. The son was apparently not sent to university, but was tutored by Ralph Rawson, one of the fellows ejected from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1648. Cotton travelled in France and perhaps in Italy, and at the age of twenty-eight he succeeded to an estate greatly encumbered by lawsuits during his father&#x27;s lifetime. Like many Royalist gentlemen after the English Civil War the rest of his life was spent chiefly in quiet country pursuits, in Cotton&#x27;s case in the Peak District and North Staffordshire. His &quot;Voyage to Ireland in Burlesque&quot; (1670) states that he held a Captain&#x27;s commission and served in Ireland.

==Fishing==
His friendship with Izaak Walton began about 1655, and contradicts any assumptions about Cotton&#x27;s character based on his coarse burlesques of Virgil and Lucian. Walton&#x27;s initials, made into a cipher with Cotton&#x27;s own, were placed over the door of Cotton&#x27;s fishing cottage on the Dove near Hartington. Cotton contributed a second section &quot;Instructions how to angle for a trout or grayling in a clear stream&quot;, to Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;; the additions consisted of twelve chapters on fishing in clear water, which he understood largely but not exclusively to be fly fishing. Another addition to the volume was Cotton&#x27;s well-known poem &quot;The Retirement&quot;, which appeared from the 5th edition onwards.

==Marriages==
In 1656, he married his cousin Isabella Hutchinson, the daughter of Thomas Hutchinson, M.P. for Nottingham. She was a half-sister of Col. John Hutchinson; They had one child, Catherine Cotton, who married Sir Berkeley Lucy, 3rd Baronet. Isebella (Hutchinson) Cotton, died in 1670. At the request of his wife&#x27;s sister, Miss Stanhope Hutchinson, he undertook the translation of Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Horace&quot; in 1671. In 1675, he married Mary Cromwell, the dowager Countess of Ardglass; she had a jointure of £1500 a year, but he did not have the power to spend it.
==Writings==
The 1674 first edition of &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; is attributed to Cotton by publishers of later editions, to which additional, post-Cotton material was added in 1709 and 1725, along with some updates to the rules Cotton had described earlier. The book was considered the &quot;standard&quot; English-language reference work on the playing of games – especially gambling games, and including billiards, card games, dice, horse racing and cock fighting, among others – until the publication of Edmond Hoyle&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Hoyle&#x27;s Games Complete&quot; in 1750, which outsold Cotton&#x27;s then-obsolete work.

At Cotton&#x27;s death in 1687 he was insolvent and left his estates to his creditors. He was buried in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, on 16 February 1687.

Cotton&#x27;s reputation as a burlesque writer may account for the neglect with which the rest of his poems have been treated. Their excellence was not, however, overlooked by good critics. Coleridge praises the purity and unaffectedness of his style in &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, and Wordsworth (&quot;Preface&quot;, 1815) gave a copious quotation from the &quot;Ode to Winter&quot;. The &quot;Retirement&quot; is printed by Walton in the second part of the &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;.

He was a Derbyshire man who loved the Peak District and wrote a long topographic poem describing it: his father had moved there from the south of England, to live on his wife&#x27;s estates. In Cotton&#x27;s day, in the decades after the Civil War, the inaccessibility of good fishing spots was physical as well as legal. The opening chapters of his section of the &quot;Compleat Angler&quot; draw Cotton and his friend across a savage and mountainous landscape. The friend, who will be taught fly-fishing, expresses doubt as to whether they are still in Christendom:

:&quot;What do I think? Why, I think it is the steepest place that ever sure men and horses went down; and that, if there be any safety at all, the safest way is to alight...&quot; says the pupil. After he picked his way down, they reach a bridge. &quot;Do you ... travel with wheelbarrows in this country&quot; he asks. &quot;Because this bridge certainly was made for nothing else; why, a mouse can hardly go over it: it is not two fingers broad.&quot;

They come at length to the sheltered valley in which stands Cotton&#x27;s house and fishing hut. It is the first description of paradise in fishing history. &quot;It stands in a kind of peninsula, with a delicate clear river about it.&quot; There Cotton and his friend breakfast on ale and a pipe of tobacco to give them the strength to wield their rods. For a trout river, he says, a rod of five or six yards should be long enough. In fact, &quot;longer, though never so neatly and artificially made, it ought not to be, if you intend to fish at ease&quot;.

Though he used a light line of carefully tapered horse-hair, Cotton&#x27;s rod, of solid wood, was heavy. His description of the sport differs from modern fly-casting, which began with the arrival of heavy dressed-silk lines 200 years later. On windy days, he advises his guest to fish the pools because in the rapids, where the gorge of the Dove is narrower, the wind will be too strong for fishing.

Some of Cotton&#x27;s advice is still useful, as when he tells his guest to fish &quot;fine and far off&quot;; and he argues for small and neat flies, carefully dressed, over the bushy productions of London tackle-dealers. The flies which catch fish will always look wrong to the untrained eye, because they look too small and too delicate.

Cotton&#x27;s dressings are made with bear hair and camel&#x27;s under fur, the soft bristles from inside a black hog&#x27;s ear, and from dog&#x27;s tails. &quot;What a heap of trumpery is here!&quot; cries his visitor, when Cotton&#x27;s dubbing bag is opened. &quot;Certainly never an angler in Europe has his shop half so well-finished as you have.&quot;

Cotton replies with the touchiness of a true obsessive: &quot;Let me tell you, here are some colours, contemptible as they seem here, that are very hard to be got; and scarce any one of them, which, if it should be lost, I should not miss and be concerned about the loss of it too, once in the year.&quot;

Cotton devotes a whole chapter to collection of flies for every month of the year. Few have modern analogues, but they are based on accurate observation, as with his stonefly:

:His body is long and pretty thick, and as broad at the tail, almost, as at the middle; his colour is a very fine brown, ribbed with yellow and much yellower on the belly than on the back: he has two or three little whisks also at the tag of his tail, and two little horns upon his head: his wings, when full grown, are double, and flat down upon his back, of the same colour but rather darker than his body and longer than it...

:On a calm day you shall see the still-deeps continually all over circles by the fishes rising, who will gorge themselves with these flies, will they purge again out of their gills.

In Montana, the fish still rise to stoneflies until the water is &quot;continually all over circles&quot;, but in the UK it is an anachronism. Cotton&#x27;s Derbyshire is more remote from modern England, and closer to the wilderness than Montana or Alaska are now. He is quite unashamed of bait fishing, whether with flies or with grubs. He kills fish until weary. &quot;I have in this very river that runs by us, in three or four hours taken thirty, five and thirty, and forty of the best trouts in the river.&quot; And he concludes his advice with a note of earthy practicality not to be found as the sport becomes more refined: a recipe for fresh trout boiled with beer and horseradish.

Cotton loved nothing more than that his friends should share his delight. In the gorge of the Dove he had a private garden &quot;with a delicate clear river about it&quot; where the world was reduced to its simplest and best essentials.

His masterpiece in translation, the &quot;Essays of M. de Montaigne&quot; (1685–1686, 1693, 1700, etc.), has often been reprinted, and still maintains its reputation; his other works include &quot;The Scarronides&quot;, or &quot;Virgil Travestie&quot; (1664–1670), a gross burlesque of the first and fourth books of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which ran through fifteen editions; &quot;Burlesque upon Burlesque, ... being some of Lucian&#x27;s Dialogues newly put into English fustian&quot; (1675); &quot;The Moral Philosophy of the Stoicks&quot; (1667), from the French of Guillaume du Vair; &quot;The History of the Life of the Duke d&#x27;Espernon&quot; (1670), from the French of G Girard; the &quot;Commentaries&quot; (1674) of Blaise de Montluc; the &quot;Planter&#x27;s Manual&quot; (1675), a practical book on arboriculture, in which he was an expert; &quot;The Wonders of the Peake&quot; (1681); the &quot;Compleat Gamester&quot; and &quot;The Fair one of Tunis&quot;, both dated 1674, are also assigned to Cotton.

Here is Cotton&#x27;s epitaph for &quot;M.H.&quot;, a prostitute &quot;(spacing, spelling and capitalisation as originally printed)&quot;:
Epitaph upon M.H

In  this cold Monument  lies one,
That I know who has lain upon,
The happier He : her Sight would charm,
And Touch have kept King David  warm.
Lovely, as is the dawning East ,
Was this Marble&#x27;s frozen Guest;
As soft, and Snowy, as that Down
Adorns the Blow-balls  frizled Crown;
As straight and slender as the Crest,
Or Antlet  of the one beam&#x27;d Beast;
Pleasant as th&#x27; odorous Month  of May :
As glorious, and as light as Day .

Whom I admir&#x27;d, as soon as knew,
And now her Memory pursue
With such a superstitious Lust,
That I could fumble with her Dust.

She all Perfections had, and more,
Tempting, as if design&#x27;d a Whore ,
For so she was; and since there are
Such, I could wish them all as fair.

Pretty she was, and young, and wise,
And in her Calling so precise,
That Industry had made her prove
The sucking School-Mistress  of Love :
And Death, ambitious to become
Her Pupil, left his Ghastly home,
And, seeing how we us&#x27;d her here,
The raw-bon&#x27;d Rascal  ravisht her.

Who, pretty Soul, resign&#x27;d her Breath,
To seek new Letchery in Death.
==Legacy==
William Oldys contributed a life of Cotton to Hawkins&#x27;s edition (1760) of the &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;. His &quot;Lyrical Poems&quot; were edited by J. R. Tutin in 1903, from an original edition of 1689. Cotton&#x27;s translation of Montaigne was edited in 1892, and in a more elaborate form in 1902, by W. C. Hazlitt, who omitted or relegated to the notes the passages in which Cotton interpolates his own matter, and supplied Cotton&#x27;s omissions.

Benjamin Britten set Cotton&#x27;s &quot;The Evening Quatrains&quot; to music in his &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; in 1943.

Andrew Millar, the prominent 18th century London bookseller, purchased a copyright share from John Osborne in a new, fifth, edition of Cotton&#x27;s &quot;The Genuine Poetical Works&quot;. Thus, Cotton&#x27;s poetry remained popular and profitable well into the eighteenth century, partly due to his clever &quot;burlesques&quot; of famous works from classical literature.

Charles Cotton was buried in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. A memorial to him is also found within the church.

<text>Color grading is a post-production process common to filmmaking and video editing of altering the appearance of an image for presentation in different environments on different devices. Various attributes of an image such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white balance may be enhanced whether for motion pictures, videos, or still images. Color grading and color correction are often used synonymously as terms for this process and can include the generation of artistic color effects through creative blending and compositing of different layer masks of the source image. Color grading is generally now performed in a digital process either in a controlled environment such as a color suite, and is usually done in a dim or dark environment.

The earlier photochemical film process, referred to as color timing, was performed at a film lab during printing by varying the intensity and color of light used to expose the rephotographed image. Since, with this process alone, the user was unable to immediately view the outcome of their changes, the use of a Hazeltine color analyzer was common for viewing these modifications in real time. In the 2000s, with the increase of digital technology, color grading in Hollywood films became more common.

== Color timing ==
Color timing is used in reproducing film elements. &quot;Color grading&quot; was originally a lab term for the process of changing color appearance in film reproduction when going to the answer print or release print in the film reproduction chain. By the late 2010s, this film grading technique had become known as &quot;color timing&quot; and still involved changing the duration of exposure through different filters during the film development process. Color timing is specified in printer points which represent presets in a lab contact printer where 7 to 12 printer points represent one stop of light. The number of points per stop varied based upon negative or print stock and different presets at film labs.

In a film production, the creative team would meet with the “lab timer” who would watch a running film and make notes dependent upon the team&#x27;s directions. After the session, the timer would return to the lab and put the film negative on a device (the Hazeltine) which had preview filters with a controlled backlight, picking exact settings of each printer point for each scene. These settings were then punched onto a paper tape and fed to the high-speed printer where the negative was exposed through a backlight to a print stock. Filter settings were changed on the fly to match the printer lights that were on the paper tape. For complex work such as visual effects shots, &quot;wedges” running through combinations of filters were sometimes processed to aid the choice of the correct grading.

This process is used wherever film materials are being reproduced.

== Telecine ==

With the advent of television, broadcasters quickly realised the limitations of live television broadcasts and they turned to broadcasting feature films from release prints directly from a telecine. This was before 1956 when Ampex introduced the first Quadruplex videotape recorder (VTR) VRX-1000. Live television shows could also be recorded to film and aired at different times in different time zones by filming a video monitor. The heart of this system was the &quot;kinescope&quot;, a device for recording a television broadcast to film.

The early telecine hardware was the &quot;film chain&quot; for broadcasting from film and utilized a film projector connected to a video camera. As explained by Jay Holben in &quot;American Cinematographer Magazine&quot;, &quot;The telecine didn&#x27;t truly become a viable post-production tool until it was given the ability to perform colour correction on a video signal.&quot;

=== How telecine coloring works ===
In a cathode-ray tube (CRT) system, an electron beam is projected at a phosphor-coated envelope, producing a small spot of light. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the &quot;vertical&quot; frame information. Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT&#x27;s beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of dichroic mirrors which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) where the photons are converted into an electronic signal to be recorded to tape.

In a charge-coupled device (CCD) telecine, a white light is shone through the exposed film image onto a prism, which separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into an electronic signal, and the telecine electronics modulate these into a video signal that can then be color graded.

Early color correction on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT telecine systems was accomplished by varying the primary gain voltages on each of the three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color-processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 color space. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space.

Color correction control systems started with the Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978. In 1984 Da Vinci Systems introduced their first color corrector, a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including Da Vinci Systems and Pandora International.

Some telecines are still in operation in 2018.

== Color correction/enhancement ==
Some of the main artistic functions of color correction (digital color grading) include:

*Reproducing accurately what was shot
*Compensating for variations in the material (i.e., film errors, white balance, varying lighting conditions)
*Compensating for the intended viewing environment (dark, dim, bright surrounds)
*Optimizing base appearance for inclusion of special visual effects
*Establishing a desired artistic &#x27;look&#x27;
*Enhancing and/or altering the mood of a scene — the visual equivalent to the musical accompaniment of a film; compare also film tinting

Note that some of these functions must be prioritized over others; for example, color grading may be done to ensure that the recorded colors match those of the original scene, whereas other times, the goal may instead be to establish a very artificial stylized look. Color grading is one of the most labour intensive parts of video editing.

Traditionally, color grading was done towards practical goals. For example, in the film &quot;Marianne&quot;, grading was used so that night scenes could be filmed more cheaply in daylight. Secondary color grading was originally used to establish color continuity; however, the trend today is increasingly moving towards creative goals such as improving the aesthetics of an image, establishing stylized looks, and setting the mood of a scene through color. Due to this trend, some colorists suggest the phrase &quot;color enhancement&quot; over &quot;color correction&quot;.

=== Primary and secondary color grading ===
Primary color grading affects the whole image by providing control over the color density curves of red, green, blue color channels, across the entire frame. Secondary grading can isolate a range of hue, saturation and brightness values to bring about alterations in hue, saturation and luminance only in that range, allowing the grading of secondary colors, while having a minimal or usually no effect on the remainder of the color spectrum. Using digital grading, objects and color ranges within a scene can be isolated with precision and adjusted. Color tints can be manipulated and visual treatments pushed to extremes not physically possible with laboratory processing. With these advancements, the color grading process has become increasingly similar to well-established digital painting techniques, ushering forth a new era of digital cinematography.

=== Masks, mattes, power windows ===
The evolution of digital color grading tools has advanced to the point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as Adobe Photoshop) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent color grading tools (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust.

Inside and outside of area-based isolations, digital filtration can be applied to soften, sharpen or mimic the effects of traditional glass photographic filters.

=== Motion tracking ===
When trying to isolate a color adjustment on a moving subject, the colorist traditionally would manually move a mask to follow the subject. In its most simple form, motion tracking software automates this time-consuming process using algorithms to evaluate the motion of a group of pixels. These techniques are generally derived from match moving techniques used in special effects and compositing work.

=== Orange and teal ===
In the 2000s, with the increase of digital technology, color grading in Hollywood films became more common. From 2010, many films, such as &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; and &quot;Iron Man 2,&quot; began using the complementary colors orange and teal.

== Digital intermediate ==

The evolution of the telecine device into film scanning allowed the digital information scanned from a film negative to be of sufficient resolution to transfer back to film. In the early 1990s, Kodak developed the Cineon Film System to capture, manipulate, and record back to film and they called this the “Digital Intermediate”. This term stuck. The first full digital intermediate of any form was the Cinesite restoration of “&quot;Snow White and The Seven Dwarves&quot;” in 1993 (previously, in 1990, for &quot;Rescuers Down Under&quot;, the Disney CAPS system had been used to scan artwork, color and composite it, and then record it to film, but this was also intermixed with a traditional lab development process over a length of time).

In the late 1990s, the films &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; advanced the technology to the point that the creation of a digital intermediate was practical, which greatly expanded the capabilities of the digital telecine colorist to the traditionally-oriented world of feature films. Since 2010, almost all feature films have gone through the DI process, while manipulation through photochemical processing is rare or used on archival films.

In Hollywood, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; was the first film to be wholly digitally graded. The negative was scanned with a Spirit DataCine at 2K resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a Virtual DataCine. The process took several weeks, and the resulting digital master was output to film again with a Kodak laser recorder to create a master internegative.

Modern motion picture processing typically uses both digital cameras and digital projectors. Calibrated devices are most commonly used to maintain a consistent appearance within the workflow.

=== Hardware-based versus software-based systems ===

In early use, hardware-based systems (da Vinci 2K, Pandora International MegaDEF, etc.) have historically offered better performance but a smaller feature set than software-based systems. Their real time performance was optimized to particular resolution and bit depths, as opposed to software platforms using standard computer industry hardware that often trade speed for resolution independence, e.g. Apple&#x27;s Color (previously Silicon Color Final Touch), ASSIMILATE SCRATCH, Adobe SpeedGrade and SGO Mistika. While hardware-based systems always offer real-time performance, some software-based systems need to pre-render as the complexity of the color grading increases. On the other hand, software-based systems tend to have more features such as spline-based windows/masks and advanced motion tracking.

The line between hardware and software no longer exists as many software-based color correctors (e.g. Pablo, Mistika, SCRATCH, Autodesk Lustre, Nucoda Film Master and FilmLight&#x27;s Baselight) use multi processor workstations and a GPU (graphics processing unit) as a means of hardware acceleration. As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Design&#x27;s DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture&#x27;s Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems. High-speed RAID arrays are an essential part of the process for all systems.

=== Hardware ===
Hardware systems are no longer common because of the price/performance of software systems. The control panels are placed in a color suite for the colorist to operate the telecine remotely.

*Many telecines were controlled by a Da Vinci Systems color corrector 2k or 2k Plus. 
*Other hardware systems are controlled by Pandora Int.&#x27;s Pogle, often with either a MegaDEF, Pixi, or Revolution color grading system.
*For some real-time systems used in &quot;linear&quot; editing, color grading systems required an edit controller. The edit controller controls the telecine and a VTR(s) or other recording/playback devices to ensure frame accurate film frame editing. There are a number of systems which can be used for edit control. Some color grading products such as Pandora Int.&#x27;s Pogle have a built-in edit controller. Otherwise, a separate device such as Da Vinci Systems&#x27; TLC edit controller would be used.
*Older systems are: Renaissance, Classic analog, Da Vinci Systems&#x27;s: The Whiz (1982) and 888; The Corporate Communications&#x27;s System 60XL (1982–1989) and Copernicus-Sunburst; Bosch Fernseh&#x27;s FRP-60 (1983–1989); Dubner (1978–1985?), Cintel&#x27;s TOPSY (1978), Amigo (1983), and ARCAS (1992) systems. All of these older systems work only with standard-definition 525 and 625 video signals, and are considered near obsolete today.

<text>William Read Miller (November 23, 1823November 29, 1887) was the 12th Governor of Arkansas. Born in Batesville, Arkansaw Territory; Miller was Arkansas&#x27;s first native born governor. Serving two terms in the turbulent period after Reconstruction, Miller&#x27;s four-year administration marked the beginnings of New Departure Democrats in Arkansas. Running on a platform of economic growth via reconciliation between whites and freedmen, Miller often was opposed by members of his own party during the infancy of the Lost Cause ideology. His plans to pay back a large state debt including the Holford Bonds, valued at $14 million ($ million today), were often interrupted by racial violence, and his support for public schools and universities was often combated by those in his own party.

Miller desired an unprecedented third gubernatorial term in 1881, but the Democrats instead nominated Thomas Churchill, a Democratic hard-liner and former major general in the Confederate States Army. Following his defeat, Miller served on boards of several railroads and as a trustee of the University of Arkansas. He also served as Arkansas State Auditor for 12 of the 30 years between 1857 and his death in 1887, making him the third-longest tenured Auditor in Arkansas history.

==Early life==
Miller was born on November 23, 1823, on a farm near Batesville, Arkansaw Territory, to John and Clara Moore Miller. Miller&#x27;s father was a farmer and register of the United States General Land Office active in Democratic politics, including serving as a presidential elector twice. At the age of thirteen, Miller is said to have publicly challenged notable local and fervent Whig Fent Noland regarding Martin Van Buren&#x27;s credentials. He also saw the Arkansas Territory achieve statehood on June 15, 1836. Miller was educated in local schools when the workload on the family farm allowed, and he showed an early interest in law. Although discouraged from pursuing the legal profession by his father, Miller moved from the family farm to Batesville to read law after turning twenty-one in 1844.

==Political career==
Miller&#x27;s political career blossomed upon moving to Batesville, which was the fourth-largest city and one of the most politically prominent cities in Arkansas at the time. He was elected Independence County Clerk in 1848, and married Susan Elizabeth Bevens, the daughter of Third District Judge William Bevins, the following year. 

Governor Elias Conway of the prominent Conway Family appointed Miller to become State Auditor when C.C. Danley resigned the post in 1854. Miller resigned as Independence County Clerk and accepted the statewide office. Conway himself had served as State Auditor from 1835 to 1849, and the post raised Miller&#x27;s political profile significantly. Miller was reelected to that position in 1858, 1860, 1862, and again in 1874 after the Reconstruction period ended. 

He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1868. He was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1876, and was reelected in 1878. He was the first native born Arkansas governor. The Miller administration focused on public education and the state&#x27;s financial problems. He signed legislation that funded the State Blind Asylum and the Arkansas Industrial University. After leaving office he served as the Deputy Treasurer of Arkansas in 1881 and 1882. In 1886, Miller was again elected to the position of State Auditor.

==Death==
Miller is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

<doc id="305300" wikidata="Q714843" url="?curid=305300" title="National Revolutionary Army">
<text>The National Revolutionary Army (NRA; ), sometimes shortened to Revolutionary Army () before 1928, and as National Army () after 1928, was the military arm of the Kuomintang (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) from 1925 until 1947 in China during the Republican era. It also became the regular army during the KMT&#x27;s period of party rule beginning in 1928. It was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces after the 1947 Constitution, which instituted civilian control of the military.

Originally organized with Soviet aid as a means for the KMT to unify China during the Warlord Era, the National Revolutionary Army fought major engagements in the Northern Expedition against the Chinese Beiyang Army warlords, in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) against the Imperial Japanese Army and in the Chinese Civil War against the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the armed forces of the Chinese Communist Party were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army (while retaining separate commands), but broke away to form the People&#x27;s Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war. With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947 and the formal end of the KMT party-state, the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces, with the bulk of its forces forming the Republic of China Army, which retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949.

==History==
The NRA was founded by the KMT in 1925 as the military force destined to unite China in the Northern Expedition. Organized with the help of the Comintern and guided under the doctrine of the Three Principles of the People, the distinction among party, state and army was often blurred. A large number of the Army&#x27;s officers passed through the Whampoa Military Academy, and the first commandant, Chiang Kai-shek, became commander-in-chief of the Army in 1925 before launching the successful Northern Expedition. Other prominent commanders included Du Yuming and Chen Cheng. The end of the Northern Expedition in 1928 is often taken as the date when China&#x27;s Warlord era ended, though smaller-scale warlord activity continued for years afterwards.
In 1927, after the dissolution of the First United Front between the Nationalists and the Communists, the ruling KMT purged its leftist members and largely eliminated Soviet influence from its ranks. Chiang Kai-shek then turned to Germany, historically a great military power, for the reorganization and modernization of the National Revolutionary Army. The Weimar Republic sent advisers to China, but because of the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles they could not serve in military capacities. Chiang initially requested famous generals such as Ludendorff and von Mackensen as advisers; the Weimar Republic government turned him down, however, fearing that they were too famous, would invite the ire of the Allies and that it would result in the loss of national prestige for such renowned figures to work, essentially, as mercenaries.

=== Nanjing decade ===
Immediately following the Northern Expedition, the National Revolutionary Army was bloated and required downsizing and demobilisation: Chiang himself stating that soldiers are like water, capable of both carrying the state, and sinking it. This was reflected in the enormous troop figures with 1,502,000 men under arms, of which only 224,000 came under Chiang&#x27;s direct control; these, however, were the official figures as Chiang stated later he possessed over 500,000 and Feng Yuxiang who officially possessed 269,000 in reality had 600,000 thus the true figure would likely reach 2,000,000.

During the Northern expedition the KMT formed also formed branch political councils: in theory, subordinate political organs that were under the Central Political councils in Nanjing; in reality these were autonomous political bodies with their own military forces. Feng Yuxiang controlled the Kaifeng council; Yan Xishan the Taiyuan council; whilst the Guangxi clique controlled two: the Wuhan and Beiping; under Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, respectively. Li Jishen, who was related to the Guangxi clique, loosely controlled the Guangzhou council; and a sixth council in Shenyang was under Zhang Xueliang. Chiang was faced with two options one was to immediately centralise the other to gradually do so, in the spirit of the expedition itself which was to eradicate warlordism and regionalism Chiang chose to immediately centralise the branch councils under the guise of demobilisation systematically reducing the regional troop strength whilst centralising them and building up his own strength. This was done in July 1928 with financial conferences calling for demobilisation and military commanders and political officials echoing the call for demobilisation. Chiang called for the reduction of the army to 65 divisions and gathered political support to begin actively reducing troops counts and centralising the army as well as abolishing the branch councils, this threatened the regional leaders and Li Zongren noted that it was intentionally designed to force the regional leaders into action so Chiang could eliminate them.

=== Central Plains war ===

==== Phase 1 ====
The Guangxi clique rebelled in February 1929 when it fired Lu Diping the governor of Hunan who switched sides and joined Chiang, the Guangxi forces invaded Hunan, however Chiang bribed elements of the army in Wuhan to defect and within 2 months the Guangxi clique was routed, in March the party expelled Bai Chongxi, Li Jishen and Li Zongren and promoted their juniors who sided with Chiang in order to sow dissent within the clique, they later re-grouped and attempted to retake Hunan and Guangdong but were repelled in both provinces.

Also in May Feng Yuxiang entered the war he was too expelled from the party, once again Chiang bribed his enemy&#x27;s allies and subordinates Han Fuju and Shi Yousan. Feng&#x27;s armies were defeated and he fled to Shanxi and announced his retirement from politics, by July Chiang&#x27;s forces had occupied Luoyang. Having defeated two of his largest enemies Chiang pushed further for demobilisation and announced it would be done by March 1930. This move spurred Feng, Yan and the Guangxi clique to ally to face Chiang as Chiang had taken revenue sources from Yan.

==== Phase 2 ====
The anti-Chiang coalition had forces totalling 700,000 against Chiang&#x27;s 300,000. Their plan was to seize Shandong and contain Chiang south of the Long-hai railway and the Beijing-wuhan railway then they would advance along the railway lines seizing Xuzhou and Wuhan whilst southern forces did the same to force a link-up.

The war involved over 1,000,000 of which 300,000 became casualties. Chiang&#x27;s forces proved themselves capable even when outnumbered routing the southern forces by July, however in the north Chiang&#x27;s forces were defeated and he himself narrowly avoided capture in June only when the northern forces stopped due to the defeat of the southern forces did the north stabilise. Chiang began negotiations for peace with Zhang as an intermediary however Feng and Yan believing themselves to be on the verge of victory refused. Chiang had utilised the lull in action to gather strength and begin counteroffensives along the railways north aided by the closure of fighting in Bengbu by September Chiang was again closing in on Luoyang and this along with bribes spurred Zhang Xueliang to side with Chiang ending the war.

When Adolf Hitler became Germany&#x27;s chancellor in 1933 and disavowed the Treaty, the anti-communist Nazi Party and the anti-communist KMT were soon engaged in close cooperation. With Germany training Chinese troops and expanding Chinese infrastructure, while China opened its markets and natural resources to Germany. Max Bauer was the first adviser to China.
In 1934, Gen. Hans von Seeckt, acting as adviser to Chiang, proposed an &quot;80 Division Plan&quot; for reforming the entire Chinese army into 80 divisions of highly trained, well-equipped troops organised along German lines. The plan was never fully realised, as the eternally bickering warlords could not agree upon which divisions were to be merged and disbanded. Furthermore, since embezzlement and fraud were commonplace, especially in understrength divisions (the state of most of the divisions), reforming the military structure would threaten divisional commanders&#x27; &quot;take&quot;. Therefore, by July 1937 only eight infantry divisions had completed reorganization and training. These were the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 14th, 36th, 87th, 88th, and the Training Division.

Another German general, Alexander von Falkenhausen, came to China in 1934 to help reform the army. However, because of Nazi Germany&#x27;s later cooperation with the Empire of Japan, he was later recalled in 1937.

=== Second Sino-Japanese war ===

For a time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Communist forces fought as a nominal part of the National Revolutionary Army, forming the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army units, but this co-operation later fell apart. Women were also part of the army&#x27;s corps during the war. In 1937 Soong Mei-ling encouraged women to support the Second Sino-Japanese War effort, by forming battalions, such as the Guangxi Women&#x27;s Battalion.

Troops in India and Burma during World War II included the Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma), the Chinese Army in India called X Force, and Chinese Expeditionary Force in Yunnan, called Y Force.

The US government repeatedly threatened to cut off aid to China during World War 2 unless they handed over total command of all Chinese military forces to the US. After considerable stalling, the arrangement only fell through due to a particularly insulting letter from the Americans to Chiang. By the end of the war, US influence over the political, economic, and military affairs of China were greater than any foreign power in the last century, with American personnel appointed in every field, such as the Chief of Staff of the Chinese military, management of the Chinese War Production Board and Board of Transport, trainers of the secret police, and Chiang&#x27;s personal advisor. Sir George Sansom, British envoy to the US, reported that many US military officers saw US monopoly on Far Eastern trade as a rightful reward for fighting the Pacific war, a sentiment echoed by US elected officials.

After the drafting and implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947, the National Revolutionary Army was transformed into the ground service branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces – the Republic of China Army (ROCA).

==Structure==

The NRA throughout its lifespan recruited approximately 4,300,000 regulars, in 370 Standard Divisions (正式師), 46 New Divisions (新編師), 12 Cavalry Divisions (騎兵師), eight New Cavalry Divisions (新編騎兵師), 66 Temporary Divisions (暫編師), and 13 Reserve Divisions (預備師), for a grand total of 515 divisions. However, many divisions were formed from two or more other divisions, and were not active at the same time.

At the apex of the NRA was the National Military Council, also translated as Military Affairs Commission. Chaired by Chiang Kai-Shek, it directed the staffs and commands. It included from 1937 the Chief of the General Staff, General He Yingqin, the General Staff, the War Ministry, the military regions, air and naval forces, air defence and garrison commanders, and support services Around 14 Million were conscripted from 1937 to 1945.

Also, New Divisions were created to replace Standard Divisions lost early in the war and were issued the old division&#x27;s number. Therefore, the number of divisions in active service at any given time is much smaller than this. The average NRA division had 5,000–6,000 troops; an average army division had 10,000–15,000 troops, the equivalent of a Japanese division. Not even the German-trained divisions were on par in terms of manpower with a German or Japanese division, having only 10,000 men.

The United States Army&#x27;s campaign brochure on the China Defensive campaign of 1942–45 said:

The NRA only had small number of armoured vehicles and mechanised troops. At the beginning of the war in 1937 the armour were organized in three Armoured Battalions, equipped with tanks and armoured cars from various countries. After these battalions were mostly destroyed in the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing. The newly provided tanks, armoured cars, and trucks from the Soviet Union and Italy made it possible to create the only mechanized division in the army, the 200th Division. This Division eventually ceased to be a mechanized unit after the June 1938 reorganization of Divisions. The armoured and artillery Regiments were placed under direct command of 5th Corps and the 200th Division became a motorized Infantry Division within the same Corps. This Corps fought battles in Guangxi in 1939–1940 and in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road in 1942 reducing the armoured units due to losses and mechanical breakdown of the vehicles. On paper China had 3.8 million men under arms in 1941. They were organized into 246 &quot;front-line&quot; divisions, with another 70 divisions assigned to rear areas. Perhaps as many as forty Chinese divisions had been equipped with European-manufactured weapons and trained by foreign, particularly German and Soviet, advisers. The rest of the units were under strength and generally untrained. Overall, the Nationalist Army impressed most Western military observers as more reminiscent of a 19th- than a 20th-century army.

Late in the Burma Campaign the NRA Army there had an armoured battalion equipped with Sherman tanks.

Despite the poor reviews given by European observers to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by Westerners) and led by Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were in awe of the appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damaged the superior Russian force.

The Muslim divisions of the army controlled by Muslim Gen. Ma Hongkui were reported by Western observers to be tough and disciplined. Despite having diabetes Ma Hongkui personally drilled with his troops and engaged in sword fencing during training.

When the leaders of many of the warlord and provincial armies joined with the KMT and were appointed as officers and generals, their troops joined the NRA. These armies were renamed as NRA divisions. The entire Ma Clique armies were absorbed into the NRA. When the Muslim Ma Clique General Ma Qi joined the KMT, the Ninghai Army was renamed the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division.

===Unit organization===

The unit organisation of the NRA is as follows: (Note that a unit is not necessarily subordinate to one immediately above it; several army regiments can be found under an army group, for example.) The commander-in-chief of the NRA from 1925 to 1947 was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.

Military Affairs Commission
*Military Region ×12 (戰區)
**Army Corps ×4(兵團) – the Army Corps, 兵團, was one of the largest military formations in the NRA during the Second Sino-Japanese War. These Army Corps were composed of a number of Group Armies, Army, Corps, Divisions, Brigades and Regiments. In numbers of divisions, they were larger than Western Army groups. Only four were ever formed to command the large forces defending the Chinese capital during the Battle of Wuhan in 1938. (See Order of battle of Battle of Wuhan).
***Army Group ×40 (集團軍 )
****Route Army (路軍)
****Field army ×30 (軍)
*****Corps ×133 (軍團 ) – usually exercised command over two to three NRA Divisions and often a number of Independent Brigades or Regiments and supporting units. The Chinese Republic had 133 Corps during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After losses in the early part of the war, under the 1938 reforms, the remaining scarce artillery and the other support formations were withdrawn from the Division and was held at Corps, or Army level or higher. The Corps became the basic tactical unit of the NRA having strength nearly equivalent to an allied Division.

********Regiment (團)
*********Battalion (營)
**********Company (連)

************Squad (班)

=== Divisional Organisation ===
The NRA used multiple divisional organisations as different threats emerged as well as other factors necessitated a new organisation. The Years below relate to the Minguo calendar which starts in 1911. Therefore, the 22nd year division is the 1933 division.

==== 22nd Year Anti-communist division ====

* Divisional HQ 79 officers 147 enlisted
* Signal company 6 officers 168 enlisted (subdivided into 3 platoons with 3 squads per platoon) 
* Reconnaissance Company 5 officers 144 enlisted 
* 3 infantry regiments each containing:
** Regimental HQ 22 officers 68 enlisted 
** Signal Platoon 1 officer 48 enlisted
** 3 infantry battalions each containing:
*** Battalion HQ 4 officers 13 enlisted
*** 3 rifle companies 6 officers 145 enlisted (divided into 3 platoons with each platoon having 3 14 man squads)
*** Machine gun company 5 officers 121 enlisted (divided into 3 platoons each with 2 16 man squads with Maxim MGs)
** Mortar Company 6 officers 138 enlisted (divided into 3 platoons each with 2 19 man squads with 82mm mortars)
** Special Service Company 6 officers 145 enlisted (identical to rifle company)
** Transport platoon 1 officer 42 enlisted (3 14 man squads)
** Stretcher-bearer Platoon 1 officer 43 enlisted (3 13 man squads)
* Artillery Battalion
** Battalion HQ 12 officers 98 enlisted
** Three batteries each containing 5 officers 203 enlisted (2 platoons each with 2 75mm guns)
* Engineer Battalion
** Battalion HQ 11 officers 41 enlisted
** Three engineer companies each 6 officers 179 enlisted (3 platoons each with 3 17 man squads)
* Special service Battalion 27 officers 569 enlisted (identical to infantry battalion)
* Transport Battalion
** Battalion HQ 13 officers 31 enlisted
** Two Transport Companies each 6 officers 148 enlisted (3 platoons each with 3 14 man squads)

The above template was only applied to divisions serving in Guangxi during the 5th encirclement campaign.

=== 60 Division Plan ===
A new Plan was devised in 1935 to raise 60 new divisions in 6 month batches with divisions to be raised from divisional districts tied to them, in an aim to enhance cohesion and communication as well as simplifying recruitment, officers however were to be recruited nationally and placed into these divisions to disrupt regional affiliations. The 24th Year New Type division was almost the equivalent of western style divisions with the notable difference being the absence of radios in the Chinese division. Planning began in December 1934 and in January 1935 a classified meeting of over 80 of the highest NRA officers was called with a timetable published:

* 6-10 divisions were to be organised in 1935
* 16-20 divisions in 1936
* 20-30 divisions in 1937
* The remainder in 1938.

This new army being significantly better armed and trained than the warlord armies would give Chiang a large advantage over his domestic opponents as well as being personally answerable to the Generalissimo.

However, Chinese industry was incapable of producing the artillery or infantry guns in large quantities needed for the 60 division plan and German imports were not forthcoming. Mortars were introduced as substitutes for the infantry guns and later as a substitute for artillery. Horses were also lacking as the new division required many of them and Chinese divisions often used mules oxen or even buffalos as substitutes for the many horses.

10 divisions were organised in 1935 on the new model but equipment was lacking. A further 20 were reorganised by the Marco Polo Bridge Incident but equipment was again lacking meaning these divisions were not to be the modern equivalent of Western style or Japanese divisions.

==== 24th Year New Type Division ====

* Division HQ 138 men 33 horses
* Cavalry Squadron 237 men 239 horses
* Signal Battalion (372 men and 129 horses) 
** Battalion HQ 36 horses 129 horses
** Two Signal companies each with 131 men
** Trains 74 men
* Two Infantry Brigades Each (6,114 men and 1,216 horses)

===== Wartime adjustments =====

However, as the war progressed and masses of equipment was lost the 60 division plan was abandoned as were larger divisions in general as the Military Affairs Commission switched to a smaller more mobile division suited to the reality of the situation. This was after an initial reorganisation in 1937 which incorporated the type 89 grenade launcher which impressed the Chinese. However, even though this 1937 reorganisation maintained division strength at slightly under 11,000 men, less than 4,000 (the frontline personnel) were issued small arms such as rifles. In 1938 a further reform was brought about by He Yingqin at the behest of Chiang Kai-shek. He&#x27;s report called for an integrated numbering and designation of units from the regimental level up and a standardised financial and supply system and the appointment of loyal commanders. A new division table was also organised: the 27th Year (1938) division, which created the field army as a fixed unit, abolished divisional artillery (often a paper force due to the chronic shortage of field artillery) and coordinated artillery support at the army level; although the division remained at roughly 11,000 men strong this template was not followed with few divisions being re-organised on this pattern due to the constant campaigning of the Central Army and the refusal of the warlords to adopt the new organisation. Nonetheless, the division still proved too large and they were reformed into triangular divisions (a division with a divisional HQ and 3 infantry regiments rather than the previous square division with 2 brigades each with 2 regiments); this 1938 organisation remained the most common formation until the end of the war although it was modified with 16 divisions receiving Anti-tank companies and 20 receiving anti-aircraft companies. Artillery remained in a chronic shortage only partially remedied by the production of 82mm mortars, but these mortars were far from universal even by the end of the war. Further changes were made in the 1942 re-organisation with the 1938 division losing all of its non-combat formations. These formations were moved to the field army level, and with the universal adoption of the triangular division formation the 1942 division had a strength of 6,794 officers and enlisted 60% of the strength of the 1938 division.

====== 1942 division ======

* Divisional HQ 71 men
* Signal Company 223 men
* Reconnaissance Company 189 men 
* Engineer Company 172 men
* Special Service Company 235 men
* 3 Infantry Regiments (Each 2,532 men):
** Regimental HQ 44 men
** Signal Platoon 76 men
** 3 Infantry Battalions (Each 804 men)
*** Battalion HQ 20 men
*** 3 Rifle Companies Total of 465 men
*** Machine Gun Company 87 men
*** Mortar Company 132 men

This gave a total of 8,251 men per division it is important to note the complete absence of any Anti-air, Anti-tank or artillery at a divisional level a sign of the dire state of equipment shortage in China.

===Dare to Die Corps===
During the Xinhai Revolution and the Warlord Era of the Republic of China, &quot;Dare to Die Corps&quot; () were frequently used by Chinese armies. China deployed these suicide units against the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

&quot;Dare to Die&quot; troops were used by warlords in their armies to conduct suicide attacks. &quot;Dare to Die&quot; corps continued to be used in the Chinese military. The Kuomintang used one to put down an insurrection in Canton. Many women joined them in addition to men to achieve martyrdom against China&#x27;s opponents.

A &quot;dare to die corps&quot; was effectively used against Japanese units at the Battle of Taierzhuang. They used swords.
Suicide bombing was also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese soldiers at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. In one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.

===Penal Battalions===
During the Chinese Civil War the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) was known to have used penal battalions from 1945 to 1949. A unit made up of deserters and those accused of cowardice, the penal battalion was giving such tasks as scouting ahead of the main forces to check for ambushes, crossing rivers and torrents to see whether they were fordable, and walking across unmapped minefields.

===Conscription===

The military was formed through bloody and inhumane conscription campaigns. These are described by Rudolph Rummel as:
This was a deadly affair in which men were kidnapped for the army, rounded up indiscriminately by press-gangs or army units among those on the roads or in the towns and villages, or otherwise gathered together. Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps like Buchenwald.

==Ranks==
===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
== American-sponsored divisions ==

=== Y-Force ===
T.V. Soong at the behest of Chiang negotiated US sponsorship of 30 Chinese divisions which were to be designated assault divisions due to the fall of Burma. This plan was adopted concurrently with Y-Force which was the Chinese army in Burma. The divisions of Y-Force were similar to the 1942 divisions’ organisation. With the addition of extra staff especially in communications as well as an anti-tank rifle squad with 2 anti-tank rifles, radios were issued as were bren guns with the number of mortars raised form 36 to 54 to accommodate the lack of heavy artillery. The demands of the Chinese Military Affairs Commission to add additional support staff and divisional artillery were all rejected by the Americans and the idea of a centralised Y-force with the 30 divisions being grouped together was never realised. General Chen Cheng commanded the largest contingent of 15 divisions, Long Yun commanded 5 and 9 under Chiang himself. Prior to the Salween offensive each division was allotted 36 bazookas though actual numbers ran below requirements and rockets were in short supply.
The Chinese army due to sustained combat was grossly under-strength and whilst Chiang promised over 110,000 additional reinforcements. Further reinforcements after this were not forthcoming due to ongoing combat. Nonetheless, Y-Force grew to over 300,000 men with rifles, mortars and machine guns in abundance.

A Y-force division contained 10,790 officers and men with 4,174 rifles, 270 submachine guns, 270 light machine guns, 54 medium machine guns. 27 AT rifles, 36 bazookas, 81 60mm mortars and 30 82mm mortars this was a large improvement over the 1942 division especially in terms of equipment with some divisions additionally receiving Anti-tank companies with guns ranging from 20-47mm. The army troops of a Y-force army contained over 3,000 horses and mules and 16 trucks with 8,404 officers and men with 21 additional machine guns and an artillery battalion with 12 guns and an anti-tank battalion with 4 guns though due to supply limitations over The Hump artillery and anti-tank weaponry did not arrive in large quantities until late 1943 and early 1944.
=== 30 Division Force ===
General Stilwell envisioned a 90 division strong regular army the first 30 divisions being the aforementioned Y-Force which would re-open the Burma road which would allow for the formation of the next 30 divisions via direct supply delivery. The remaining 30 divisions would be garrison divisions with a reduced force the remainder of the Chinese army would be gradually demobilised or used to fill out the new forces and act as replacements to save resources and supplies. In July 1943 the US War Department agreed to equip the first 30 divisions and 10% of the second batch to facilitate its training which was to be named Z-Force. Stilwell wished to consolidate the existing forces in east China into 30 divisions per the plan but was rebuffed by the Chinese who wanted the lend lease to be used by existing forces. Stilwell persisted and proposed again his 90 division plan with an additional 1-2 armoured divisions with all forces to be ready assuming the opening of the Burma road by January 1945. However, after the Cairo conference the British and Americans did not agree to an amphibious landing in Burma to support an offensive by Y-Force so the plan was dropped as the Burma road would not be opened anytime soon as long as the Japanese remained there.
== Strength and distribution in early 1937 ==
(Former Northeastern army troops are included in the Central Government Column given the arrest of Zhang Xueliang following the Xi&#x27;an incident)

The above categorisations are not the sole indicator of loyalty it is how they were categorised at the time.

An alternative figure and breakdown is given by Field a US analyst in July 1937 (brackets indicate numbers given by Bin Shih):

*not all formations are assigned a loyalty therefore this list does not constitute an exhaustive list of NRA formations.

== Arsenals of the NRA ==
These arsenals listed below are those established before the beginning of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War.

=== Gongxian Arsenal ===
Established in 1915 in Henan, the Central Government took over the arsenal in 1930 and full production resumed in 1931. Employing 2,400 workers it was producing 1,800 rifles, 12 Maxim guns and 20,000 grenades each month. In 1934 production of rifles had risen to 3,200 per month.

=== Jiangnan Arsenal ===
Established in 1865 in Shanghai, the arsenal was captured by the Central Government in 1927. Its production in 1931 was 8 75mm mountain guns, 31 Type Triple-Ten machine guns, three million cartridges and 600lbs of smokeless powder each month. However, following the demilitarization of Shanghai following the 1932 battle, the arsenal became dormant with its light machinery moved to other arsenals whilst the heavy machinery remained until 1937.

=== Hanyang Arsenal ===
First began production in 1895 in Hubei, it was captured by the Central government in 1926. Between 1895 and 1938 the arsenal produced 876,316 Type 88 rifles. In 1934 the arsenal also produced 240 Type Triple-Ten machine guns and 4 75mm field guns.

=== Taiyuan Arsenal ===
Established in 1898 in Shanxi, the arsenal was expanded by Yan Xishan. Production in 1930 was 500 pistols, 1,500 rifles, 50 machine guns, 300 mortars a month as well as a theoretical 30 mountain guns a month though none were in actual production. The arsenal however deteriorated and by 1937, the Central Government took the machinery and used it for other arsenals.

=== Jinling Arsenal ===
Established in 1865 in Nanjing, the Central Government captured the arsenal in 1927. In 1936 after investment from the government, the arsenal was producing 610 machine guns, 3,600,000 cartridges, 480 mortars, 204,000 mortar shells and 34,000 gas masks annually.

=== Guangdong Arsenal ===
Established in 1874, in 1917 production was 600 rifles, 500,000 cartridges and 6 machine guns. However the production quality of the arsenal deteriorated and following a 1935 inspection only 10% of the cartridges were found to have passed inspection. The arsenal came under the control of the Central Government following the defection of Yu Hanmou to Nanjing during the Liangguang incident.

=== Sichuan Arsenal/Chongqing Arms Depot ===
Established in 1878, the arsenal&#x27;s production in 1913 was 15,000 rifles, 7,500,000 cartridges and 45,000lbs of smokeless powder annually. However, due to warfare in Sichuan the arsenal was closed, then finally moved to Chongqing in 1932. In 1933 it produced 6,000 KE7 machine guns.

=== Jinan Arsenal ===
Located in Shandong, by the mid-1930s this arsenal was producing 3,000,000 cartridges and 60,000 grenades every month.

== Equipment ==


For regular provincial Chinese divisions the standard rifles were the Hanyang 88 (copy of Gewehr 88). Central army divisions were typically equipped with the Chiang Kai-shek rifle and other Mauser type rifles from Germany, Belgium and Czechoslovakia. The standard light machine gun were imported or domestically produced of the Czech Brno ZB vz. 26 in the standard 7.92 mm. There were machine guns from other sources, such as Belgian, French and from the Soviet Aid Programme. In general, there were 6-9 LMG&#x27;s in an infantry company, with the monthly ammunition supply being around 5,000 rounds (for 5 days consumption). Heavy machine guns were mainly locally-made Type 24 water-cooled Maxim guns (which were based on the commercial version of the German MG08), and Type Triple-Ten M1917 Browning machine guns chambered for the standard 8mm Mauser round. On average, every Central Army battalion contained a machine gun company with 5-6 heavy machine guns. They were allotted a monthly supply of 20,000 rounds. The most common sidearm for NCOs and officers was the 7.63 mm Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol. Submachine guns were not part of any TO&amp;E, but many were inherited from former warlord armies or locally produced. They were generally carried by the guards of divisional or corps commanders or special service platoon/companies. Some elite units, such as the X Force in Burma used Lend-Lease US equipment.
Generally speaking, the regular provincial army divisions did not possess any artillery. However, some Central Army divisions were equipped with 37 mm PaK 35/36 anti-tank guns, and/or anti-air guns from Oerlikon, Madsen, and Solothurn. Each of these infantry divisions ideally had 6 French Brandt 81 mm mortars and 6 Solothurn 20 mm autocannons. Some independent brigades and artillery regiments were equipped with Krupp 75 mm L/29 field guns, Krupp 75 mm L/14, or Bofors 75 mm L/20 mountain guns. There were also 24 Rheinmetall 150 mm L/32 sFH 18 howitzers (bought in 1934) and 24 Krupp 150 mm L/30 sFH 18 howitzers (bought in 1936). At the start of the war, the NRA and the Tax Police Regiment had three tank battalions armed with German Panzer I light tanks and CV-35 tankettes. After defeat in the Battle of Shanghai the remaining tanks, together with several hundred T-26 and BT-5 tanks acquired from the Soviet Union were reorganised into the 200th Division.

Infantry uniforms were basically redesigned Zhongshan suits. Puttees were standard for soldiers and officers alike, since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn field caps. The helmets were the most distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German M35 Stahlhelms rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, usually seen with the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both the German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets included the French Adrian helmet, the British Brodie helmet and later the American M1 helmet. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition for his weapon, along with ammunition pouches or harness, a water flask, bayonet, food bag, and a gas mask.

<text>James Herbert Wacker (April 28, 1937 – August 26, 2003) was an American football coach and college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Texas Lutheran University (1971–1975), North Dakota State University (1976–1978), Southwest Texas State University—now Texas State University (1979–1982), Texas Christian University (1983–1991), and the University of Minnesota (1992–1996), compiling a career college football record of 159–131–3. Wacker won two NAIA Division II National Championships with Texas Lutheran in 1974 and 1975, and two NCAA Division II Football Championships with Southwest Texas State, in 1981 and 1982.

==Early life and education==
The son of a Lutheran minister, Wacker was born and raised in Detroit. He graduated from Lutheran-affiliated Valparaiso University in 1960 and went on to further studies at Wayne State University.

==Coaching career==
In the early phase of his coaching career, Wacker coached at Texas Lutheran University (1971–1975), North Dakota State University (1976–1978), and Southwest Texas State University (1979–1982). He won four national championships, two at Texas Lutheran and two at Southwest Texas State.
===TCU===
Wacker became head football coach of Texas Christian University after the 1982 season. He had early success at TCU. In 1984, his team was ranked as high as #12, the TCU Frogs&#x27; highest ranking since 1960, and was invited to the Bluebonnet Bowl after an 8–3 record in the regular season, their first bowl appearance in 20 years. The #12-ranked Frogs lost a showdown for the Southwest Conference title with the #10-ranked Texas Longhorns on November 10 in what remains the third best-attended game in the history of Amon G. Carter Stadium. TCU finished in a three-way tie for third in the 1984 SWC standings with Arkansas and Texas one game behind co-champions SMU and Houston. After the season, Wacker was named as National Coach of the Year by ESPN, the UPI, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He was awarded the 1984 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.

There was much hype surrounding the Frogs going into the 1985 season, and Wacker appeared on the cover of &quot;Dave Campbell&#x27;s Texas Football&quot; alongside his All-American running back, Kenneth Davis, a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in 1984 and a leading candidate for the award in 1985. After the first game of the season, Wacker discovered that several players, including Davis, had been benefiting from a payment plan in violation of NCAA rules. Wacker promptly kicked the players off the team and self-reported the infractions to the NCAA, cementing his reputation as a man of integrity. For all intents and purposes, this ended the Frogs&#x27; season; they finished 3-8, including a winless SWC slate.

In 1986, the NCAA slapped TCU with three years&#x27; probation and a ban on postseason play in the 1986 season. The most severe penalty in the long run, however, was a reduction to only 25 scholarships in 1987 and 1988. To this day, Horned Frog fans remain bitter that the NCAA imposed such a severe penalty given that the violations were voluntarily reported. As heavy-handed as this penalty was, the NCAA seriously considered banning the Horned Frogs from bowl games and live television for three years and no new scholarships in 1987 or 1988. However, it praised Wacker for taking swift corrective action once the violations came to light, including kicking the players off the team when he was well aware that it would cripple the team for the upcoming season. As it turned out, TCU would need the rest of the decade and much of the next to recover; they would have only two more winning records until 1997.

Wacker brought the team back to success in 1990, when the 5–1 Frogs returned to the top 25 for the first time since 1984, before slumping after a season-ending injury to their starting quarterback. In 1991, TCU finished 7–4 for their first winning season since 1984. However, blowout losses to Texas and Texas A&amp;M kept the Horned Frogs out of a bowl. This was one of only three winning seasons TCU had from 1985 to 1997.

===Minnesota===
Wacker served as head coach at the University of Minnesota from 1992 to 1996. Although he had a disappointing won-lost record (16–39) at Minnesota, for three years his teams led the conference with academic all-conference honors.

==Later life, death, and honors==
Wacker was an announcer on CBS Radio for two years and then returned to Southwest Texas State University in 1998 to serve as athletic director until 2001. He died after a long battle with cancer in San Marcos, Texas on August 26, 2003. In November 2003, Southwest Texas State named its football field at Bobcat Stadium &quot;Jim Wacker Field&quot; in his honor.

<text>In mathematics, a multiset (or bag, or mset) is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its elements. The number of instances given for each element is called the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of that element in the multiset. As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist that contain only elements and , but vary in the multiplicities of their elements:
* The set contains only elements and , each having multiplicity 1 when is seen as a multiset.
* In the multiset , the element has multiplicity 2, and has multiplicity 1.
* In the multiset , and both have multiplicity 3.

These objects are all different when viewed as multisets, although they are the same set, since they all consist of the same elements. As with sets, and in contrast to &quot;tuples&quot;, the order in which elements are listed does not matter in discriminating multisets, so and denote the same multiset. To distinguish between sets and multisets, a notation that incorporates square brackets is sometimes used: the multiset can be denoted by .

The cardinality or &quot;size&quot; of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of all its elements. For example, in the multiset the multiplicities of the members , , and are respectively 2, 3, and 1, and therefore the cardinality of this multiset is 6.

Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn coined the word &quot;multiset&quot; in the 1970s, according to Donald Knuth. However, the concept of multisets predates the coinage of the word &quot;multiset&quot; by many centuries. Knuth himself attributes the first study of multisets to the Indian mathematician Bhāskarāchārya, who described permutations of multisets around 1150. Other names have been proposed or used for this concept, including &quot;list&quot;, &quot;bunch&quot;, &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;heap&quot;, &quot;sample&quot;, &quot;weighted set&quot;, &quot;collection&quot;, and &quot;suite&quot;.

==History==
Wayne Blizard traced multisets back to the very origin of numbers, arguing that &quot;in ancient times, the number &quot;n&quot; was often represented by a collection of &quot;n&quot; strokes, tally marks, or units.&quot; These and similar collections of objects can be regarded as multisets, because strokes, tally marks, or units are considered indistinguishable. This shows that people implicitly used multisets even before mathematics emerged.

Practical needs for this structure have caused multisets to be rediscovered several times, appearing in literature under different names. For instance, they were important in early AI languages, such as QA4, where they were referred to as &quot;bags,&quot; a term attributed to Peter Deutsch. A multiset has been also called an aggregate, heap, bunch, sample, weighted set, occurrence set, and fireset (finitely repeated element set).

Although multisets were used implicitly from ancient times, their explicit exploration happened much later. The first known study of multisets is attributed to the Indian mathematician Bhāskarāchārya circa 1150, who described permutations of multisets. The work of Marius Nizolius (1498–1576) contains another early reference to the concept of multisets. Athanasius Kircher found the number of multiset permutations when one element can be repeated. Jean Prestet published a general rule for multiset permutations in 1675. John Wallis explained this rule in more detail in 1685.

Multisets appeared explicitly in the work of Richard Dedekind.

Other mathematicians formalized multisets and began to study them as precise mathematical structures in the 20th century. For example, Hassler Whitney (1933) described &quot;generalized sets&quot; (&quot;sets&quot; whose characteristic functions may take any integer value: positive, negative or zero). Monro (1987) investigated the category Mul of multisets and their morphisms, defining a &quot;multiset&quot; as a set with an equivalence relation between elements &quot;of the same &quot;sort&quot;&quot;, and a &quot;morphism&quot; between multisets as a function that respects &quot;sorts&quot;. He also introduced a &quot;multinumber&quot;&amp;hairsp;: a function &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) from a multiset to the natural numbers, giving the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of element &quot;x&quot; in the multiset. Monro argued that the concepts of multiset and multinumber are often mixed indiscriminately, though both are useful.

==Examples==
One of the simplest and most natural examples is the multiset of prime factors of a natural number . Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime factors of . For example, the number 120 has the prime factorization
formula_1
which gives the multiset .

A related example is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation. A quadratic equation, for example, has two solutions. However, in some cases they are both the same number. Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be , or it could be . In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2. More generally, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex solutions of a polynomial equation of degree always form a multiset of cardinality .

A special case of the above are the eigenvalues of a matrix, whose multiplicity is usually defined as their multiplicity as roots of the characteristic polynomial. However two other multiplicities are naturally defined for eigenvalues, their multiplicities as roots of the minimal polynomial, and the geometric multiplicity, which is defined as the dimension of the kernel of (where is an eigenvalue of the matrix ). These three multiplicities define three multisets of eigenvalues, which may be all different: Let be a matrix in Jordan normal form that has a single eigenvalue. Its multiplicity is , its multiplicity as a root of the minimal polynomial is the size of the largest Jordan block, and its geometric multiplicity is the number of Jordan blocks.

==Definition==
A multiset may be formally defined as an ordered pair where is a set called a &quot;universe&quot; or the &quot;underlying set&quot;, and formula_2 is a function from to the nonnegative integers. The value for an element is called the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of in the multiset and intepreted as the number of occurences of in the multiset.

The &quot;support&quot; of a multiset is the subset of formed by the elements such that . A &quot;finite multiset&quot; is a multiset with a finite support. Most authors define &quot;multisets&quot; as finite multisets. This is the case in this article, where, unless otherwise stated, all multisets are finite multisets. 

Some authors define multisets with the additional constraint that for every , or, equivalently, the support equals the underlying set.
Multisets with infinite multiplicities have also been studied; they are not considered in this article.
Some authors define a multiset in terms of a finite index set and a function where the multiplicity of an element is , the number of elements of that get mapped to by .

Multisets may be represented as sets, with some elements repeated. For example, the multiset with support and multiplicity function such that can be represented as . A more compact notation, in case of high multiplicities is for the same multiset.

If formula_3 a multset with support included in is often represented as 
formula_4
to which the computation rules of indeterminates can be applied; that is, exponents 1 and factors with exponent 0 can be removed, and the multiset does not depend of the ordetr of the factors. This allows extending the notation to infinite underlying sets as
formula_5 
An advantage of notation is that it allows using the notation without knowing the exact support. For example, the prime factors of a natural number form a multiset such that
formula_6 

The finite subsets of a set are exactly the multisets with underlying set , such that for every .

==Basic properties and operations==
Elements of a multiset are generally taken in a fixed set , sometimes called a &quot;universe&quot;, which is often the set of natural numbers. An element of that does not belong to a given multiset is said to have a multiplicity 0 in this multiset. This extends the multiplicity function of the multiset to a function from to the set formula_7 of non-negative integers. This defines a one-to-one correspondence between these functions and the multisets that have their elements in .

This extended multiplicity function is commonly called simply the multiplicity function, and suffices for defining multisets when the universe containing the elements has been fixed. This multiplicity function is a generalization of the indicator function of a subset, and shares some properties with it.

The support of a multiset formula_8 in a universe is the underlying set of the multiset. Using the multiplicity function formula_9, it is characterized as 
formula_10

A multiset is &quot;finite&quot; if its support is finite, or, equivalently, if its cardinality
formula_11
is finite. The &quot;empty multiset&quot; is the unique multiset with an empty support (underlying set), and thus a cardinality 0.

The usual operations of sets may be extended to multisets by using the multiplicity function, in a similar way to using the indicator function for subsets. In the following, and are multisets in a given universe , with multiplicity functions formula_12 and formula_13

* Inclusion: is &quot;included&quot; in , denoted , if formula_14
* Union: the &quot;union&quot; (called, in some contexts, the &quot;maximum&quot; or &quot;lowest common multiple&quot;) of and is the multiset with multiplicity function formula_15
* Intersection: the &quot;intersection&quot; (called, in some contexts, the &quot;infimum&quot; or &quot;greatest common divisor&quot;) of and is the multiset with multiplicity function formula_16
* Sum: the &quot;sum&quot; of and is the multiset with multiplicity function formula_17 It may be viewed as a generalization of the disjoint union of sets. It defines a commutative monoid structure on the finite multisets in a given universe. This monoid is a free commutative monoid, with the universe as a basis.
* Difference: the &quot;difference&quot; of and is the multiset with multiplicity function formula_18

Two multisets are &quot;disjoint&quot; if their supports are disjoint sets. This is equivalent to saying that their intersection is the empty multiset or that their sum equals their union.

There is an inclusion–exclusion principle for finite multisets (similar to the one for sets), stating that a finite union of finite multisets is the difference of two sums of multisets: in the first sum we consider all possible intersections of an odd number of the given multisets, while in the second sum we consider all possible intersections of an even number of the given multisets.

== Counting multisets ==
The number of multisets of cardinality , with elements taken from a finite set of cardinality , is sometimes called the multiset coefficient or multiset number. This number is written by some authors as formula_19, a notation that is meant to resemble that of binomial coefficients; it is used for instance in (Stanley, 1997), and could be pronounced &quot; multichoose &quot; to resemble &quot; choose &quot; for formula_20 Like the binomial distribution that involves binomial coefficients, there is a negative binomial distribution in which the multiset coefficients occur. Multiset coefficients should not be confused with the unrelated multinomial coefficients that occur in the multinomial theorem.

The value of multiset coefficients can be given explicitly as
formula_21
where the second expression is as a binomial coefficient; many authors in fact avoid separate notation and just write binomial coefficients. So, the number of such multisets is the same as the number of subsets of cardinality of a set of cardinality . The analogy with binomial coefficients can be stressed by writing the numerator in the above expression as a rising factorial power
formula_22
to match the expression of binomial coefficients using a falling factorial power:
formula_23

For example, there are 4 multisets of cardinality 3 with elements taken from the set of cardinality 2 (, ), namely , , , . There are also 4 &quot;subsets&quot; of cardinality 3 in the set of cardinality 4 (), namely , , , .

One simple way to prove the equality of multiset coefficients and binomial coefficients given above involves representing multisets in the following way. First, consider the notation for multisets that would represent (6 s, 2 s, 3 s, 7 s) in this form:

This is a multiset of cardinality made of elements of a set of cardinality . The number of characters including both dots and vertical lines used in this notation is . The number of vertical lines is 4 − 1. The number of multisets of cardinality 18 is then the number of ways to arrange the vertical lines among the 18 + 4 − 1 characters, and is thus the number of subsets of cardinality 4 − 1 of a set of cardinality . Equivalently, it is the number of ways to arrange the 18 dots among the characters, which is the number of subsets of cardinality 18 of a set of cardinality . This is
formula_24
thus is the value of the multiset coefficient and its equivalencies:
formula_25

From the relation between binomial coefficients and multiset coefficients, it follows that the number of multisets of cardinality in a set of cardinality can be written
formula_26
Additionally,
formula_27

=== Recurrence relation ===
A recurrence relation for multiset coefficients may be given as
formula_28
with
formula_29

The above recurrence may be interpreted as follows.
Let formula_30 be the source set. There is always exactly one (empty) multiset of size 0, and if there are no larger multisets, which gives the initial conditions.

Now, consider the case in which . A multiset of cardinality with elements from might or might not contain any instance of the final element . If it does appear, then by removing once, one is left with a multiset of cardinality of elements from , and every such multiset can arise, which gives a total of
formula_31 possibilities.

If does not appear, then our original multiset is equal to a multiset of cardinality with elements from , of which there are
formula_32

Thus,
formula_33

===Generating series===
The generating function of the multiset coefficients is very simple, being
formula_34
As multisets are in one-to-one correspondence with monomials, formula_35 is also the number of monomials of degree in indeterminates. Thus, the above series is also the Hilbert series of the polynomial ring formula_36

As formula_35 is a polynomial in , it and the generating function are well defined for any complex value of .

=== Generalization and connection to the negative binomial series ===
The multiplicative formula allows the definition of multiset coefficients to be extended by replacing by an arbitrary number (negative, real, or complex):
formula_38

With this definition one has a generalization of the negative binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies calling the formula_39 negative binomial coefficients:
formula_40

This Taylor series formula is valid for all complex numbers &quot;α&quot; and &quot;X&quot; with . It can also be interpreted as an identity of formal power series in &quot;X&quot;, where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to 1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for exponentiation, notably

formula_41
and formulas such as these can be used to prove identities for the multiset coefficients.

If is a nonpositive integer , then all terms with are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum. However, for other values of , including positive integers and rational numbers, the series is infinite.

==Applications==
Multisets have various applications. They are becoming fundamental in combinatorics. Multisets have become an important tool in the theory of relational databases, which often uses the synonym &quot;bag&quot;. For instance, multisets are often used to implement relations in database systems. In particular, a table (without a primary key) works as a multiset, because it can have multiple identical records. Similarly, SQL operates on multisets and returns identical records. For instance, consider &quot;SELECT name from Student&quot;. In the case that there are multiple records with name &quot;Sara&quot; in the student table, all of them are shown. That means the result of an SQL query is a multiset; if the result were instead a set, the repetitive records in the result set would have been eliminated. Another application of multisets is in modeling multigraphs. In multigraphs there can be multiple edges between any two given vertices. As such, the entity that specifies the edges is a multiset, and not a set.

There are also other applications. For instance, Richard Rado used multisets as a device to investigate the properties of families of sets. He wrote, &quot;The notion of a set takes no account of multiple occurrence of any one of its members, and yet it is just this kind of information that is frequently of importance. We need only think of the set of roots of a polynomial &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) or the spectrum of a linear operator.&quot;

==Generalizations==
Different generalizations of multisets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems.
* Real-valued multisets (in which multiplicity of an element can be any real number)
* Fuzzy multisets
* Rough multisets
* Hybrid sets
* Multisets whose multiplicity is any real-valued step function
* Soft multisets
* Soft fuzzy multisets
* Named sets (unification of all generalizations of sets)

<text>The Massachusetts Marauders were a professional arena football team that was based in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were a member of the Arena Football League (AFL) from 1988 to 1994. The team was established in Detroit in 1988, as the Detroit Drive and was a member of the AFL in and in all subsequent years through . The club then moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, in and played in that city through the end of the 1994 season.

The franchise has four AFL championships, all while it was based in Detroit. The first three occurred in back-to-back-to-back fashion from 1988 to 1990, and the final one occurred in 1992.

==History==

===Detroit Drive (1988–1993)===

====Expansion (1988)====
In 1987, Mike Ilitch began negotiations with the Arena Football League (AFL), to join for the 1988 season. The Drive began play in as a member of the AFL. Under head coach Tim Marcum, the Drive finished the regular season 9–3 after starting the season 2–3. Two of the Drive&#x27;s losses came at the hands of the Chicago Bruisers, who finished the season with one loss. The Drive would get a chance at revenge when they advanced to ArenaBowl II against the Bruisers, and they were able to defeat the Bruisers 24–13.

====Back-to-back (1989)====
With the AFL suspending operations prior to the 1989 season, the league was revived and decided to play a short season, but that forced the Drive to begin the 1989 season by replacing quarterback Rich Ingold, who didn&#x27;t want to take the pay cut of the short season. The Drive won ArenaBowl III 39–26 over the Pittsburgh Gladiators.

====3-peat (1990)====
Head Coach Tim Marcum stepped away from the Drive in 1990 to join the University of Florida&#x27;s football staff, and was replaced by Perry Moss. The Drive bolstered their offense by signing quarterback Art Schlichter (Who would become the AFL&#x27;s MVP in 1990). Moss lead the Drive to a 6–2 regular season record and they remained a dominant force, leading the going to ArenaBowl IV, where they defeated the Dallas Texans 51–27.

====The return of Marcum (1991)====

Marcum returned to coach the Drive in 1991. The Drive didn&#x27;t miss a beat, finishing with the best record in the league for the fourth season in a row. However, despite hosting ArenaBowl &#x27;91, they were defeated by the Tampa Bay Storm, ending their three-year reign as league champions.

====A fourth title (1992)====

The Drive traded Schlichter to the expansion Cincinnati Rockers, partly because the league believed that since he&#x27;d grown up in the area and starred at Ohio State, he&#x27;d lend the new franchise needed credibility. However, another factor was the compulsive gambling that had derailed his NFL career almost a decade earlier. Despite Ilitch&#x27;s efforts to keep Schlichter on the straight and narrow, by the end of 1991 it was no longer safe for Schlichter to stay in Detroit. 

In 1992, the Drive played in the Northern Division. The Drive won ArenaBowl VI, claiming their fourth title in five seasons.

====Final season in Detroit (1993)====

Following the 1992 season, Ilitch purchased the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball and Vitto was transferred to the Tigers front office. Marcum assumed GM duties for 1993 and led the team to its final Arena Bowl. Ilitch sold the Drive so that they would not compete with the Tigers for attendance. Ilitch still claims that he only kept the Drive because they were constant contenders.

The Drive had, arguably, the best management team in the league. Owner Mike Ilitch, General Manager Gary Vitto, and Head Coach Tim Marcum are all in the AFL Hall of Fame. 

===Massachusetts Marauders (1994)===
The new owners moved the team to Worcester, Massachusetts as the Massachusetts Marauders, playing their home games at the Worcester Centrum, but folded after going 8–4 and making the semifinals in their first and only season. Whereas the Drive averaged over 14,000 fans a game during their six seasons in Detroit, the Marauders averaged less than 7,400 a game.
Nearly three years after the Marauders folded, Dan DeVos won their assets in bankruptcy court and used them to launch the Grand Rapids Rampage, who played until 2008.

===Later AFL in Detroit===
Detroit later received a second Arena Football team, the Detroit Fury. The Fury played from 2001 to 2004 in The Palace of Auburn Hills and were co-owned by William Davidson, owner of the Detroit Pistons and William Clay Ford, Jr., son of the owner of the Detroit Lions. The Fury were never as successful as the Drive, compiling a 22–41 record and averaging 8,152 fans per game before they folded in 2004.

While the Drive&#x27;s history was relatively brief, they had an inarguable importance in the history of Arena Football, with ArenaBowl trips every year of their existence, and creating the first dynasty in the Arena Football League.

<doc id="305306" wikidata="Q467330" url="?curid=305306" title="American Wrestling Association">
<text>The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 until 1991. It was founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The promotion was born out of the Minneapolis Boxing &amp; Wrestling Club, originally founded in 1933, which served as the Minnesota-based territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from 1948 onward, before breaking away from the NWA and becoming an independent territory in 1960.

==History==

===Pre-AWA years (1933–1960)===

Anton Stecher, brother and manager of former World Heavyweight Champion Joe Stecher, was a founding member of the NWA in 1948 and had promoted wrestling in Minneapolis since 1933 through his Minneapolis Boxing and Wrestling Club. In 1952, he sold a one-third interest in the promotion to his son Dennis and Wally Karbo. Stecher died on October 9, 1954, and control of the promotion passed to Karbo and Dennis. Verne Gagne, an amateur wrestling champion, had become a well-known and popular wrestler nationally in the 1950s as a result of his appearances on the DuMont Network. He aspired to become NWA World Champion, but political sentiment within the NWA prevented it. In 1959, Dennis sold his majority stake in the Minneapolis Boxing and Wrestling Club to Karbo and Gagne. They then became co-owners of the promotion.

===Breaking from the NWA (1960)===
In 1960, after unsuccessfully lobbying the NWA for a title match between Gagne and the NWA World Champion Pat O&#x27;Connor, Gagne and Karbo led certain territories out of the NWA forming the AWA. The AWA unilaterally recognized NWA World Champion Pat O&#x27;Connor as AWA World Champion and gave him 90 days to defend the AWA title against Gagne. The NWA ignored the challenge. O&#x27;Connor was stripped of the AWA title and it was awarded to Gagne on August 16, 1960. While O&#x27;Connor was considered the first AWA Champion, he didn&#x27;t wrestle in the AWA until later in the 1960s (when he teamed with Wilbur Snyder to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship).

Gagne was an amateur wrestling champion who had earned a spot on the U.S. team at the 1948 Summer Olympics; he ran the AWA with a conservative sensibility, firmly believing that sound technical wrestling should be the basis of a pro-wrestling company. Starting in the 1970s, Gagne trained his newcomer wrestlers from his farm in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

===Expanding the territory (1960s–1980s)===

Under Gagne and Karbo, the AWA became one of the most successful and expansive single territories in North America, promoting shows in such major cities as Minneapolis, St. Paul, Milwaukee, Chicago, Omaha, Winnipeg, Denver, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Phoenix and throughout the Midwest region. Relationships were also developed with existing promotions in Houston, Memphis and San Antonio. Gagne&#x27;s westward expansion into traditional NWA territories was made possible due to relationships and business partnerships he had forged for decades—more the result of other promoters struggling to survive rather than by purchase or hostile takeover by Gagne. The AWA would also benefit from, among other things, the profits which was made from matches that occurred in 1973 and 1974 between Superstar Billy Graham and Wahoo McDaniel.

The promotion was briefly affiliated with International Championship Wrestling (ICW), which had broken away from NWA Tri-State in 1977, and recognized then AWA World Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel as the &quot;real&quot; world champion. Bockwinkel, accompanied by then manager Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, traveled to Mississippi several times to defend his title.

===Nick Bockwinkel vs. Hulk Hogan (1982–1983)===

After Gagne&#x27;s retirement in 1981, he focused the promotion on Nick Bockwinkel, a loyal employee of several years who was a mat-wrestling technician like Gagne had been. Bockwinkel faced numerous challengers for the title during the early 1980s including eventual champions Rick Martel and Otto Wanz, champion Mad Dog Vachon, and perennial contenders Wahoo McDaniel, and Brad Rheingans, but perhaps his most famous opponent would be Hulk Hogan. Starting in 1982 and accelerated by a role in the hit film &quot;Rocky III&quot;, Hogan rapidly caught on as a babyface with AWA fans, and became the AWA&#x27;s top draw. But even as his popularity grew to unprecedented levels, Gagne refused to make him the AWA World Heavyweight Champion, as Hogan was a powerhouse wrestler. He recognized Hogan&#x27;s showmanship and charisma and was well aware of his potential drawing power, but still believed a wrestling company should be built around one of its best technical wrestlers (e.g., himself and Bockwinkel). On the &quot;Spectacular Legacy of the AWA&quot; DVD, Gagne denied bias against Hogan and defended his actions by reasoning that he believed that Hogan&#x27;s pursuit of the title was the draw for the audience and that &quot;we really didn&#x27;t need him to be champion&quot;.

On two occasions, Gagne went so far as to tease AWA title wins for Hogan, only to return the title to Bockwinkel via technicalities. The first was on April 18, 1982. Hogan defeated Bockwinkel with the help of a foreign object that Bockwinkel&#x27;s manager Bobby &quot;the Brain&quot; Heenan had interjected into the match. After the three count, the belt was awarded to Hogan and he was announced as the new champion. Heenan informed the referee of the object and the referee questioned Hogan about this, but the blood on Hogan&#x27;s face was evidence that the object had also been used on him. The ref stood by his decision and Hogan left the arena as the new AWA World champion. Six days later on AWA television, AWA President Stanley Blackburn stripped Hogan of the title and returned it to Bockwinkel.

The second such occasion was on a &quot;Super Sunday&quot; card in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1983. Hogan again pinned Bockwinkel, was awarded the belt and announced as the new champion. This time, Blackburn came to the ring moments after the match and tried to have Hogan retroactively disqualified for throwing the champion over the top rope a few minutes before the pinfall occurred. However, this match had been booked as a no disqualification match, which prevented this, so Blackburn simply stripped Hogan of the title and once again handed it back to Bockwinkel. The crowd (which had exploded in cheers when Hogan appeared to have won) almost rioted when learning that Hogan was once again cheated out of the title, and Bockwinkel later had to do damage control with the rabid crowd, telling the audience to calm down afterwards as well. Hogan attacked Bockwinkel and his manager Heenan. On the DVD &quot;The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA&quot;, it was revealed that Gagne planned to have Hogan win the belt that night, but only if he would give Gagne the bulk of the revenues that Hogan was earning from merchandise and his periodic main-event performances in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Outraged at being strongarmed, Hogan refused, but nonetheless offered a 50/50 split instead. Gagne refused, and kept the belt from him. However, Hogan did admit in his autobiography &quot;My Life Outside the Ring&quot; that he still intended to stay with AWA and that Gagne had planned to book him in steel cage matches with Bockwinkel in an effort to expand the AWA to the New York market, but he decided to leave when Vincent K. McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) offered him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.

As McMahon and his Connecticut-based WWF attempted to end pro wrestling&#x27;s regional era in the mid-1980s (by establishing the WWF as a national promotion), Gagne made several decisions that caused his AWA to lose momentum in the emerging wrestling promotion war, including overemphasizing his son Greg Gagne in AWA storylines (which led to charges of nepotism within the company) and failing to make Hogan the top star of his company when he had the chance.

Frustrated by Gagne&#x27;s business decisions, Hogan accepted an offer from rival promoter McMahon to wrestle for the WWF, in December 1983. One month later, Hogan became the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. He and the WWF soon became a mainstream media phenomenon and virtually synonymous with professional wrestling in much of the national consciousness, vaulting past the AWA and NWA as the premier promotion in wrestling. Hogan wasn&#x27;t alone in leaving the AWA. Some of the AWA&#x27;s other top talent, including announcer &quot;Mean Gene&quot; Okerlund, manager Heenan, and wrestlers Adrian Adonis, Ken Patera, Tito Santana, Jim Brunzell, David Schultz, Wendi Richter and Jesse Ventura also jumped to the WWF. As the AWA required talent to place a six-week notice upon leaving the company for booking and syndication-based reasons, most of the talent reportedly told Gagne that McMahon offered them more money to &quot;not&quot; work out their notices and previously-scheduled appearance dates, which has been disputed by McMahon. Of the talent to leave AWA for the WWF in this time, only Heenan worked out his notice in good faith to the Gagne family.

The sting of the WWF expansion was not shouldered by the AWA alone. The Mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Florida territories of the NWA also lost top stars such as &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper, Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine, Jack Brisco, Jerry Brisco, Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton, Barry Windham, and Mike Rotunda to the WWF during that same time.

===Pro Wrestling USA (1984–1986)===

Despite this talent raid, the AWA went on to have another successful year in 1984, mainly because of the arrival of The Road Warriors and an angle uniting longtime heel Jerry Blackwell with Greg and feuding with former manager Sheik Adnan El-Kaissey. Although aging, most of the AWA&#x27;s longtime core talent still remained. Stars like Bockwinkel, Ray &quot;The Crippler&quot; Stevens, The Crusher, Dick the Bruiser, Baron von Raschke, Mad Dog Vachon, and Larry Hennig were all still active at this time despite all being in their 40s or 50s.

In response to McMahon&#x27;s expansion, the AWA forged an alliance with several NWA promoters, including Jim Crockett Promotions, Mid-South Wrestling, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling, and the Continental Wrestling Association. This new promotion was known as Pro Wrestling USA and came about in an attempt to establish a national presence to compete against the WWF. The AWA was also able to sign top wrestlers like Sgt. Slaughter and Bob Backlund. By 1985, however, the AWA began to lose audiences, as the WWF was gaining wrestling superiority due to the success of WrestleMania I. Later in the year, as this struggle against the WWF progressed, Karbo also sold all his stock to Gagne as well. In September 1985, Pro Wrestling USA would respond to McMahon&#x27;s rising success by promoting the first &quot;SuperClash&quot;. Despite this success, the Pro Wrestling USA collaboration did not last, as Gagne accused David Crockett of trying to sign away AWA talent over to the NWA backstage at numerous Pro Wrestling USA shows.

The AWA released an AWA Remco Action Figure line with the toy company Remco and a series of 30 minute videos entitled &quot;Wrestling Classics&quot;, primarily featuring wrestlers such as Sgt. Slaughter, the Road Warriors, Jimmy Garvin and Steve Regal, and World Champion Martel.

===Decline and closure (1986–1991)===
Despite falling behind the WWF and NWA as a major promotion throughout 1986 and 1987, Gagne still managed to find and/or develop legitimate young talent like Scott Hall (later known as Razor Ramon), The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), &quot;Bull Power&quot; Leon White (later known as Big Van Vader), The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), and Madusa Miceli during that timeframe.

With the retirement of Bockwinkel, Gagne tapped Curt Hennig (later known as Mr. Perfect) as his next champion and future of the company. Hennig, a talented and popular second generation wrestler, defeated Bockwinkel at Super Clash 2. The overall card was relatively weak, but the title match was a critical success, although the title change was not without controversy, involving Larry Zbyszko and a roll of dimes. After further review by on-air AWA President Blackburn, and following weeks of speculation by AWA fans, the decision was upheld and Hennig was the new champion. Gagne pushed Hennig and The Midnight Rockers throughout 1987 and into 1988, but the WWF came calling and all three of his top stars would soon be gone.

During 1987, in an attempt to remain relevant and survive, Gagne renewed a relationship with Memphis-based promoter Jerry Jarrett and the CWA and even allowed Mid-Southern territory legend Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler to win the AWA World Title from Hennig in May 1988. This was after the AWA flirted for months with the idea of giving Greg the belt, even awarding the belt to Gagne at a couple of house shows, only to return it to Hennig on a technicality. It was widely speculated that the idea of the younger Gagne as heavyweight champion did not play well with AWA fans, who seemed more interested in the involvement of Verne and Larry Hennig in the feud than they did with Greg actually winning the title, so Verne decided to go with Lawler instead. Michaels and Jannetty would drop the titles to Badd Company around that same time.

Facing financial trouble of their own, WCCW then allied themselves with the AWA and CWA, and Lawler would challenge WCCW Heavyweight champion Kerry Von Erich to a title unification match at SuperClash III in December. Super Clash III was the AWA&#x27;s first venture into the Pay-Per-View market and wrestling&#x27;s first collaborative PPV between several promotions. However, after months of hype, the end results were somewhat contentious and relatively unsuccessful. Following the event, the collaborative effort was over and Lawler was stripped of the title in January 1989. Lawler kept the AWA Title belt and continued promoting himself in Tennessee, Texas, and on the independent circuit as the unified World Heavyweight Champion. Lawler did this in an attempt to leverage PPV revenue from Gagne that was allegedly owed to him, but Gagne never paid him and eventually commissioned a new title belt of similar design.

In February 1989, Larry Zbyszko, a one-time employee and Verne&#x27;s son-in-law, returned to the AWA and won the vacated World Title in an 18-man Battle Royal, eliminating Tom Zenk to end the match. It was also during this time that Joe Blanchard replaced Blackburn as AWA President. Zbyszko&#x27;s first title reign would last for a little over one year. During this time, he would defend the title against Zenk, Greg, Wahoo McDaniel, Ken Patera, Nikita Koloff, Brad Rheingans, The Trooper Del Wilkes, and Masa Saito. Zbyszko would eventually lose the title to Saito in February 1990 in front of 65,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome at the NJPW/AJPW Supershow. Zbyszko would regain the title in April 1990 at &quot;SuperClash IV&quot;. During 1989 and 1990, the AWA also pushed Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom as the top tag team. In early 1989, Eric Bischoff, who was performing office work for the AWA at the time, mostly in sales and syndication, was placed in front of the camera to replace Larry Nelson as interviewer and occasional commentator. The AWA was Bischoff&#x27;s first exposure to the world of pro wrestling. He would later become a dominant force in the industry, leading World Championship Wrestling to prominence in the 1990s.

The AWA would become inactive in the fall of 1990 (the last television taping occurred on August 11). As a result, Zbyszko signed with WCW. As his last official act, Gagne stripped the already-departed Zbyszko of the AWA World Title in December 1990. In 1991, Gagne and his inactive promotion officially filed for bankruptcy. Gagne did promote two cards in Minnesota in May 1991, featuring the return of Greg Gagne and Wahoo McDaniel and other stars such as Baron von Raschke, Buck Zumhofe, and The Destruction Crew (Mike Enos &amp; Wayne Bloom), but he was unable to revive the promotion. Despite this, the AWA continued re-running matches in their weekly ESPN time slot, and on their syndicated &quot;All-Star Wrestling&quot; show. The company also managed to release a commercial tape (&quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Highlights&quot;) during 1991.

On the &quot;Spectacular Legacy of the AWA&quot; DVD, Bischoff revealed that one of the main reasons the AWA shut down was that Gagne was leveraging money against a valuable property he owned along Lake Minnetonka. Local officials wanted to turn the property into a park. Gagne fought the decision for several years, but eventually lost the eminent domain case, leading to the creation of Lake Minnetonka Regional Park. As a result, he lost the financial resource he was using to keep the AWA up and running and had no choice but to shut down the promotion. In an interview during the late 1990s with Minneapolis television station KARE, Gagne spoke of the devoted fan base in Minnesota and joked about how he may promote again some day, but nothing ever materialized.

===Revival (1994–1995)===
After a four year absence, Gagne returned to promoting the American Wrestling Association on January 22, 1994 in Red Wing, Minnesota. The card, which drew 700 attendees saw AWA regulars such as Baron Von Raschke, Jim Brunzell, and Larry Zbyszko. Gagne promoted three more events in Red Wing that year, and a final event on January 22, 1995 that saw Zbyszko defeat Wahoo McDaniel. 

===Purchase by World Wrestling Entertainment (2003)===
In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment purchased the assets of the AWA from the Gagnes. All footage of the AWA is owned by WWE. WWE released &quot;The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA&quot; on November 21, 2006. The DVD includes a documentary on the amateur and professional career of Verne Gagne, the rise and fall of the AWA over its 30-year history, along with numerous interviews and features with Gagne, Hulk Hogan, Jim Brunzell, Michael Hayes, Baron von Raschke, Greg Gagne, Eric Bischoff, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund and Nick Bockwinkel.

==International working agreements==
Abroad, the AWA had working agreements with Japanese promotions International Wrestling Enterprise (1969 to 1980), then All Japan Pro Wrestling (1980 to 1988, although the relationship was strained in 1986 by the AWA Title debacle surrounding Stan Hansen), and, near the end, New Japan Pro-Wrestling.

On June 29, 1986, in Denver, Colorado, Hansen refused to lose the AWA World Title to Bockwinkel prior to a tour of Japan and left with the championship belt. Hansen argued that he was booked as AWA Champion in Japan and was therefore fulfilling his commitment. Gagne disagreed and awarded the AWA Championship to Bockwinkel, using one of the tag team title belts on a temporary basis. Gagne threatened legal action if Hansen continued to keep the belt and it was returned to the AWA as a result (although according to Bockwinkel on &quot;The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA&quot;, Hansen had run over the belt with his truck before returning it).

The AWA also had a brief relationship with the European promotion Catch Wrestling Association, through which its promoter, wrestler Otto Wanz, was given a brief AWA World Title reign in 1982.

==Events==
===Television===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, AWA television production was headquartered at Minneapolis independent station WTCN-TV, then owned by Metromedia. The ring announcer was longtime Minneapolis - Saint Paul sports broadcaster Marty O&#x27;Neill, who also conducted the post-match interviews. O&#x27;Neill announced the matches for the local WTCN audience. But fans watching the syndicated version of the show heard commentary provided by Rodger Kent. In the mid-1970s, during a prolonged illness, O&#x27;Neill was occasionally replaced as ring announcer by program producer Al DeRusha and interviews were conducted by both Kent and Gene Okerlund. By 1979, Okerlund had permanently replaced O&#x27;Neill, who died a couple of years later, and production was transferred to Minneapolis station KMSP-TV. During the AWA&#x27;s existence, it produced or had a hand in production of several TV programs:
* &quot;AWA All-Star Wrestling&quot;, the promotion&#x27;s syndicated program, which aired from 1960 until 1991.
* &quot;AWA Championship Wrestling&quot;, which aired on cable sports network ESPN from 1985 to 1990; it was a continuation of the earlier ESPN program &quot;Pro Wrestling USA&quot;, the co-operative venture between the AWA and several NWA affiliates (most notably Jim Crockett Promotions).
* &quot;AWA Major League Wrestling&quot;, a Canadian program produced in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for that city&#x27;s station, CKND, and syndicated across Canada during the 1980s.

In 1985, Gagne began airing weekly programming on ESPN, hoping to help the promotion compete with the national exposure already enjoyed by the WWF on USA Network and the NWA member Jim Crockett Promotions on TBS. However, weekly AWA shows were not treated with any priority by the cable network, sometimes being delayed, preempted by live programming, or suffering from occasional changes in time slot, making it difficult for fans to tune in on a regular basis.

On February 26, 2008, ESPN Classic began reairing &quot;AWA Championship Wrestling&quot; episodes, circa 1986–1990.

===Pay-per-view===
The AWA ran only one pay-per-view card, SuperClash III, during its 30-year run. However, From 1999 to 2002, a series of AWA-related pay-per-views were produced. Titled &quot;AWA Classic Wrestling&quot;, they featured compilations of old AWA footage, hosted by Greg Gagne and Todd Okerlund (son of Gene Okerlund), with occasional appearances by Verne Gagne. The pay-per-views ceased following the acquisition of the AWA tape library by World Wrestling Entertainment.

==Tournaments==
===AWA World Tag Championship Tournament (1962)===
The AWA World Tag Team Tournament was a one-night single elimination tag team tournament held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on January 15, 1962, for the vacant AWA World Tag Team Championship.

===AWA World Tag Championship Tournament (1989)===
The AWA World Tag Team Tournament was a one-night single elimination tag team tournament held in Rochester, Minnesota, on October 1, 1989, for the vacant AWA World Tag Team Championship.

===Team Challenge Series===
The AWA held a &quot;Team Challenge Series&quot; from October 1, 1989, through August 11, 1990. All of the available wrestlers were divided into three teams: &quot;Larry&#x27;s Legends&quot;, headed by Larry Zbyszko, &quot;Sarge&#x27;s Snipers&quot;, originally headed by Sgt. Slaughter, and &quot;Baron&#x27;s Blitzers&quot;, headed by Baron von Raschke. Slaughter left the AWA to return to the World Wrestling Federation shortly after WrestleMania VI, and Colonel DeBeers took over as the team captain for the Snipers (the team name was changed to &quot;DeBeers&#x27; Diamondcutters&quot; and Slaughter was said on air to have &quot;gone AWOL&quot; to explain his departure).

Babyfaces and heels alike were assigned to teams, forcing bitter rivals to work together, and due to main talent losses many of the participants were jobbers, such as Jake Milliman, Tom Stone, etc. The winners of Team Challenge matches would earn points for their team; at some unspecified point the highest scoring team would share one million dollars, within the story line. Some of the earlier TCS matches took place in a TV studio without an audience; the announcers claimed it was part of an effort to stop wrestlers from interfering, but it was actually due to poor ticket sales for arena shows. The remainder of the matches took place at the Rochester Civic Center, where the AWA taped live matches for its television program from 1989-1990.

The final match in the TCS was a Royal Rumble-style battle royal featuring Brad Rheingans, The Destruction Crew, Colonel DeBeers, the Texas Hangmen, the Trooper Del Wilkes, and several others. Jake Milliman again came away with the win by eliminating DeBeers at the end, winning the series and the supposed one-million-dollar check for Larry&#x27;s Legends.

An unsold pilot for a weekly syndicated &quot;Team Challenge Series&quot; television show was taped in 1989 with hosts Ralph Strangis and Greg Gagne at &quot;Satellite Base&quot; calling matches recorded in an empty TV studio with no ring announcer. All wrestler entrances were done in front of a green screen with footage of fans at sports bars who were supposedly watching the matches live inserted on the screen using Chroma-Key. The pilot can be viewed in the &quot;WWE Hidden Gems&quot; section of the &quot;Vault&quot; menu on WWE Network.

==Former personnel==
==Unauthorized successor promotion and lawsuit==
In 1996, Dale Gagner, a former AWA employee but no relation to Verne despite the similar surname, removed the &quot;r&quot; from his name and formed an organization in Minnesota known as AWA Superstars of Wrestling. In April 2007, WWE filed a lawsuit against Gagner, citing trademark infringement, as WWE owned all AWA properties due to their purchase after the AWA&#x27;s closure. In a move to sidestep WWE, former AWA wrestler Jonnie Stewart trademarked the name &quot;American Wrestling Alliance&quot; but the United States Patent and Trademark Office later indicated that the request was abandoned in February 2008.

In October 2008, the lawsuit against Gagner was settled. The court ruling prohibits Dale Gagner and his associates from certain uses of the AWA name or any other derivatives. As a result, the organization was renamed to &quot;Wrestling Superstars Live&quot;.

<doc id="305307" wikidata="Q930237" url="?curid=305307" title="Saga of Erik the Red">
<text>The Saga of Erik the Red, in  (), is an Icelandic saga on the Norse exploration of North America. The original saga is thought to have been written in the 13th century. It is preserved in somewhat different versions in two manuscripts: &quot;Hauksbók&quot; (14th century) and &quot;Skálholtsbók&quot; (15th century).

Despite its title, the saga mainly chronicles the life and expedition of Thorfinn Karlsefni and his wife Gudrid, also recounted in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;. For this reason it was formerly also called ; Árni Magnússon wrote that title in the blank space at the top of the saga in . It also details the events that led to the banishment of Erik the Red to Greenland and the preaching of Christianity by his son Leif Erikson as well as his discovery of Vinland after his longship was blown off course.

==Synopsis==
===Chapter 1===
The Viking conqueror of Dublin, Olaf the White was married to Aud the Deep-Minded, who became a Christian. Following Olaf&#x27;s death in battle, she and their son Thorstein the Red left Ireland for the Hebrides, where Thorstein became a great warrior king. Upon his death, she sailed to Orkney, where she married off Thorstein&#x27;s daughter, Groa, and then to Iceland, where she had relatives and gave extensive land grants to those in her party.

===Chapter 2===
Erik the Red&#x27;s thralls start a landslide that destroys a farm, leading to a feud that results in Erik&#x27;s banishment first from the district and then from Iceland; he sails in search of land that had been reported to lie to the north, and explores and names Greenland, choosing an attractive name to encourage colonists. Where he settles becomes known as Eiriksfjord.

===Chapter 3===
Thorbjorn, a son of a well-born thrall who had accompanied Aud the Deep-Minded and been given land by her, has a daughter named Gudrid. One autumn, he proudly rejects a marriage proposal for her from Einar, a wealthy merchant who is also the son of a freedman. However, he is in financial difficulties; the following spring he announces he will leave Iceland and go to Greenland. The ship carrying his family and friends encounters bad weather and they reach Greenland only in autumn, after half have died of disease.

===Chapter 4===
Famine is raging in Greenland that winter; Thorkel, the prominent farmer with whom Thorbjorn&#x27;s group is staying, asks a wandering seidworker called Thorbjorg the &quot;little völva&quot; to come to the winter feast and prophesy so that the people of the locality will know when conditions will improve. She asks for someone to sing (warding songs); Gudrid, although reluctant because she is Christian (her father has left while the heathen practice is going on), learned them from her foster mother and does so beautifully. Thorbjorg prophesies that the famine will soon end and that Gudrid will make two good marriages, one in Greenland and a second in Iceland, from which will come a great family. In the spring Thorbjorn sails to Brattahlid, where Erik the Red welcomes him and gives him land.

===Chapter 5===
This chapter introduces Erik the Red&#x27;s sons, Leif and Thorstein. Leif sails to Norway but is blown off course to the Hebrides, where he conceives a son, Thorgils, by a well-born woman whom he declines to marry; when Thorgils is grown, his mother sends him to Greenland, where Leif recognizes him. In Norway,
Leif becomes part of the court of King Olaf Tryggvason, who charges him with preaching Christianity when he returns to Greenland. On the return voyage, storms take him to an unknown land where he discovers wild wheat, vines, maple trees (and in one version of the saga, very large trees). Leif also rescues shipwrecked sailors, whom he looks after and converts to Christianity. Back in Greenland, he converts many people, including his mother, who builds a church, but not his father Erik, as a result of which Erik&#x27;s wife leaves him. His brother Thorstein then organizes an expedition to explore the new country. In addition to both brothers, the group is to include their father, but Erik falls from his horse and is injured riding to the ship. (One of the two versions suggests he nonetheless goes.) The expedition is unsuccessful; after being blown in different directions by storms all summer, they return to Eiriksfjord in the fall.

===Chapter 6===
Thorstein marries Gudrid, but soon after dies in an epidemic at the farm where they are living with the joint owner, another Thorstein, and his wife Sigrid. Shortly before his death, Sigrid, who has died, rises as a draugr and tries to climb into bed with him. After his death, he himself reanimates and asks to speak to Gudrid; he tells her to end the Greenland Christian practise of burying people in unconsecrated ground and to bury him at the church, blames recent hauntings on the farm overseer, Gardi, whose body he says should be burned, and predicts a great future for her but warns her not to marry another Greenlander and asks her to give their money to the church. He then died soon after in his old cottage house made of human remains. 

===Chapter 7===
Thorfinn Karlsefni, a wealthy Icelandic merchant, visits Greenland as part of a trading party in two ships. They spend the winter at Brattahlid and assist Erik the Red in providing a magnificent Yule feast; Karlsefni then asks to marry Gudrid, and the feast is extended as a wedding feast.

===Chapter 8===
A group of 160 people in two ships, including Karlsefni and other Icelanders but mostly Greenlanders, set out to find the land to the west, now dubbed Vinland. The wind carries them to a place they call Helluland, where there are large slabs of stone and many foxes, then south to a wooded area they call Markland and a promontory they call Kjalarness. They put in at a bay and have two fast-running Scottish thralls, gifts from King Olaf to Leif Erikson, scout the land and they bring back grapes and wheat. They overwinter inland from a fjord that they call Straumfjord, in mountainous country with tall grass; an island at the mouth of the fjord is full of nesting birds. Despite having brought grazing animals, they are unprepared for the harshness of winter there, and run short of food. Thorhall the Hunter, a pagan friend and servant of Erik&#x27;s, then disappears and they find him after three days lying on a cliff-top, mumbling and pinching himself. Soon a strange kind of whale washes up on-shore; the meat sickens them all, and then Thorhall claims credit for it as an answer to his making a poem for Thor, whom he calls his (patron deity). So they throw the rest over the cliff and pray to God; the weather then clears and they have good fishing and enough food.

===Chapter 9===
In spring, most of the expedition decide to go south in search of Vinland. Thorhall wants to go north and is joined on one ship by nine others, but the wind drives the ship east across the Atlantic to Ireland, where they are beaten and made slaves and Thorhall dies.

===Chapter 10===
The larger expedition, led by Karlsefni, discovers a place they call Hop (&quot;tidal river&quot;), where a river flows through a lake to the sea; the country is rich in wildlife, fishing is excellent, wheat and grapes grow plentifully, and it does not snow that winter. They have a first encounter with natives they call Skrælings, who use boats covered in animal skins and wave sticks in the air that make a threshing sound; the Norsemen display a white shield as a sign of peace.

===Chapter 11===
The Skrælings return in a larger group and the Norse trade red cloth for animal pelts (refusing to also trade swords and spears) until the Skrælings take fright and leave at the sight of a bull that has got loose. Three weeks later they return in still larger numbers, whirling the sticks counterclockwise rather than clockwise and howling. Battle is joined, and the Skrælings use something like a ballista to hurl a large, heavy sphere over the Norsemen&#x27;s heads, causing them to retreat. Freydis, an illegitimate daughter of Erik the Red, then emerges from her hut, heavily pregnant, and pursues them, berating them as cowards; when the Skrælings surround her, she pulls a sword from a dead man&#x27;s hand, bares one breast, and slaps the sword against it, which frightens the Skrælings into leaving. The group realize that some of the attacking force were an illusion. Having lost two of their number, they decide the place is not safe and sail back north to Straumfjord, on the way encountering five sleeping men with containers of deer marrow and blood, whom they kill on the assumption they are outlaws. Karlsefni then takes one ship north in search of Thorhall, finding a desolate forested area where they lay up on the bank of a river that flows westward to the sea.

===Chapter 12===
Thorvald, traveling with Karlsefni, is killed by a uniped that shoots him in the groin with a bow and arrow. Karlsefni buries him in Vinland, in the area of what is present day Nova Scotia, Canada. The ship returns to Straumfjord, but amid increasing dissension they decide to return home. Karlsefni&#x27;s son Snorri, born in the new land, is three years old when they leave. In Markland, they encounter five Skrælings; the three adults sink into the ground and escape, but they capture the two boys and baptize them; they learn from them that the Skrælings are cave-dwellers ruled by two kings named Avaldamon and Avaldidida, and that a nearby country is inhabited by people who go about in white, carrying poles with cloth attached, and shouting; the saga writer says that this was thought to be the legendary &quot;Hvítramannaland&quot;, and one version adds that that was also called Great Ireland. They sail back to Greenland and overwinter with Erik the Red.

===Chapter 13===
The ship with the rest of the expedition, under another Icelander, Bjarni Grimolfsson, is blown off-course into either the Greenland Sea or the sea west of Ireland, depending on the saga version, where it is attacked by marine worms and starts to sink. The ship&#x27;s boat is resistant, having been treated with tar made of seal blubber, but can carry only half those aboard. At Bjarni&#x27;s suggestion, they draw lots, but on request he gives up his seat in the boat to a young Icelander. Bjarni and the rest left on the ship drown; those in the boat reach land.

===Chapter 14===
After a year and a half in Greenland, Karlsefni and Gudrid return to Iceland, where they have a second son; their grandchildren become the parents of three bishops.

== Analysis ==
The two versions of the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, in the 14th-century (and 17th-century paper copies) and the 15th-century , appear to derive from a common original written in the 13th century but vary considerably in details. Haukr Erlendsson and his assistants are thought to have revised the text, making it less colloquial and more stylish, while the version appears to be a faithful but somewhat careless copy of the original. Although classified as one of the Sagas of Icelanders, it is closer in subject matter to medieval travel narratives than to either the sagas about families and regions of Iceland or those that are biographies of one person, and also unusual in its focus on a woman, Gudrid.

The saga has numerous parallels to the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, including recurring characters and accounts of the same expeditions and events, but differs in describing two base camps, at Straumfjord and Hop, whereas in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; Thorfinn Karlsefni and those with him settle in a place that is referred to simply as Vinland. Conversely, the &quot;Saga of Eric the Red&quot; describes only one expedition, led by Karlsefni, and has combined into it those Erik&#x27;s son Thorvald and daughter Freydis, which are recounted in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;. It also has a very different account of the original discovery of Vinland; in the &quot;Saga of Eric the Red&quot;, Leif Erikson discovers it accidentally when he is blown off course on the way back to Greenland from Norway, while in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, Bjarni Herjolfsson had accidentally sighted land to the west approximately fifteen years before Leif organized an exploratory voyage. This last is thought to stem from the saga having been written to incorporate a story that Leif evangelized in Greenland on behalf of Olaf Tryggvason, which appears to have been invented by the monk Gunnlaug Leifsson in his now lost Latin life of King Olaf (c. 1200), in order to add another country to the list of those converted to Christianity by the king; as a result of incorporating this episode, the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; often associates the same events, such as Erik&#x27;s fall from his horse, with different voyages than the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, which apparently predates Gunnlaug&#x27;s work.

The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; contains an unusual amount of pagan practise, sorcery, and ghost stories. It has been used as a source on Old Norse religion and belief, in particular on the practice of prophecy as described in the scene with Thorbjorg, but is often described as unreliable. One scholar has described it as &quot;a polemical attack on the pagan practices still supposedly prevalent around the year 1000 in Greenland&quot;.

<doc id="305311" wikidata="Q770543" url="?curid=305311" title="Tampa Bay Storm">
<text>The Tampa Bay Storm were a professional arena football team based in Tampa, Florida, US. It played in the Arena Football League (AFL). Originally the team was located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and operated as the Pittsburgh Gladiators. The franchise was one of the original four that launched the Arena Football League for its inaugural season in 1987. The club was relocated to the Tampa Bay area for the 1991 season, being the last of the original teams to either fold or leave its market. After 26 years in the Tampa market, the team ceased operations in December 2017.

The team actually played outside Tampa in nearby St. Petersburg from 1991 to 1996, then in Tampa until 2008, after which point the AFL suspended operations and did not return until the 2010 season following the league&#x27;s restructuring. It had been in the same city for longer than any other AFL team. During its tenure the franchise won five ArenaBowl championships. With 241 wins, the Storm had won far more games than any other team in AFL history. After the team dissolved in 2017, indoor football in the Tampa Bay area was succeeded by the Tampa Bay Tornadoes who began to play in 2021 in the American Arena League. 

The club was last owned by Jeffrey Vinik, also the owner of the NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning. Home games were played at Amalie Arena in Tampa.

==History==
The Storm holds the Arena Football League record for the longest tenure by a franchise in a single market area. It was also the last of the original four franchises (the Chicago Bruisers, Denver Dynamite and Washington Commandos were the other three) to have operated in continuous existence from the formation of the league in 1987 until the present decade before ceasing operations.

===Pittsburgh Gladiators (1987–1990)===

When arena football was first announced in 1986, Jim Foster targeted Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for an inaugural franchise due to the great football tradition of the area. The franchise was originally known as the Pittsburgh Gladiators, and was one of the original four AFL teams formed in 1987. The team was named by Robert Ninehouser whose entry for the team name was selected in 1987. They originally played their home games at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh. On June 19, 1987, the Gladiators defeated the Washington Commandos 48–46 in the first ever AFL regular season game. The Gladiators participated in ArenaBowls I and III, losing both.

===Moving to St. Petersburg (1991–1994)===
The team moved to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1991, with the team taking on the &quot;Storm&quot; moniker. A Cleveland Arena Football League franchise later bore the Gladiators name; however, other than the coincidental names the two organizations shared no link in histories.

The Storm won the ArenaBowl in its first season in Tampa Bay (V) and has won four subsequent championships (VII, IX, X, and XVII). Up to the 2006 season, the Storm had qualified for the playoffs in every season but one during their time in Tampa Bay.
The team played in the former ThunderDome in St. Petersburg (now called Tropicana Field) from 1991–1996, becoming its first regular team sports tenant. Since 1997, the team played its home games in the Amalie Arena in Tampa and previously known as the Ice Palace, St. Pete Times Forum, and Tampa Bay Times Forum.

===Tim Marcum era (1995–2010)===
After the 1994 season, Greis sold the team to Peter &quot;Woody&quot; Kern for $850,000. Kern&#x27;s first move as the Storm owner was the hiring of coach Tim Marcum, who is widely regarded as the greatest coach in arena football history.

On March 14, 2002, Kern had the opportunity to sell the Storm, receiving an offer from Michigan mortgage broker Thom Hopper for what was then a record price of $12 million. Hopper submitted two payments totaling $1.6 million before Kern regained possession of the team. Later in 2006, Hopper pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges that authorities say resulted from his attempt to buy the Storm. He was sentenced in January to nearly three years in prison and ordered to pay at least $1.8 million in restitution to a title insurance company, according to media reports.

On December 23, 2004, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that the AFL&#x27;s players&#x27; union filed a grievance against the Storm. The reason was that seven of the Storm&#x27;s players claimed that some of the diamonds in their 2003 AFL championship rings were fake. Six of the seven players had left the team after the 2003 season. The Storm acknowledged that some of the rings did, in fact, include cubic zirconia instead of diamonds, and that different players received greater amounts of diamonds in their rings based on their contributions that season.

The Storm ended the 2006 season with a 7–9 record (4th in their division), ending a 19-year streak of playoff appearances, dating back to their days as the Gladiators and the start of the Arena Football League.

In December 2007, Kern sold 51% of his stake in the Storm to Robert Nucci for just over $9.6 million, while still maintaining control of the other 49%. The Storm followed a 9–7 season and first-round playoff exit in 2007 with an 8–8 finish in 2008. The team salvaged the .500 record by defeating the Los Angeles Avengers 72–47 in Tampa. There was no 2009 Arena Football League season due to the league&#x27;s ongoing financial difficulties, which resulted in its filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, later converted to Chapter 11, leaving it uncertain if the Storm, arguably the most successful team in the history of any form of indoor football, would ever play another game.

===New AFL (2010–2017)===

A new arena football league, originally called Arena Football 1, formed in 2009. The Storm was not one of the initial 16 teams announced. However, Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings owner Dan Newman mentioned that the Storm were one of at least two former AFL franchises that were being negotiated with, the other being the San Jose SaberCats. The new organization bought the rights to the intellectual property, including the team names, logos, histories, and patented rules of the old AFL in a bankruptcy auction, which allowed it to function essentially as a full successor; after this action, the name Arena Football 1 was dropped and the group resumed operating as the Arena Football League. The Storm resumed full operations for the new league&#x27;s 2010 season, with some players from the former roster, and once again coached by Tim Marcum and this time owned by Tampa Bay Storm Partners LLC, a group led by Todd Boren, a previous partner with the Orlando Predators and the Arizona Rattlers. The AFL released the schedule for the season on December 31, 2009. The Storm returned during the opening weekend of the season on April 3, 2010. On February 17, 2010, it was formally announced that the AF1 had adopted the former Arena Football League name.

In the 2010 season the Storm went 11–5, finishing second in the South Division. In the playoffs, they earned a trip to ArenaBowl XXIII, but lost to the Spokane Shock 57–69.

On February 17, 2011, Marcum would resign as head coach of the Storm less than a month before the 2011 season was to begin, after having the position for 15 years. He left as the AFL&#x27;s all-time winningest head coach with 211 wins. Dave Ewart was named as the team&#x27;s new head coach the next day. His resignation was sparked by an admission in a deposition related to a lawsuit he had filed against the Storm&#x27;s previous owner, Robert Nucci. In that deposition, Marcum admitted to forwarding emails that were pornographic and racially tinged to other members of the Storm organization, using his work email address. In April 2011, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks became a part owner and the team president for the Storm. After a 7–4 start to the 2013 season, the Storm lost the final seven games of the season, but still qualified for the postseason. The Storm played well in their playoff game, but came up just short against the Jacksonville Sharks. The team&#x27;s collapse lead to the firing of Ewart. One month later, the team announced they had promoted offensive coordinator, and Storm legend Lawrence Samuels to the team&#x27;s head coach. Samuels and the Storm mutually agreed to part ways in August 2016. On October 25, 2016, Ron James was named the head coach. In 2017, the Storm finished the regular season with a 10–4 record and later advanced to ArenaBowl XXX, where they lost to the Philadelphia Soul by a score of 44–40.

In December 2017, the Storm announced it was ceasing operations due to increasing operating costs combined with decreasing team revenue. Ownership did not rule out future participation in a &quot;stronger, reinvented AFL.&quot; The Storm was the last of the original four AFL teams to cease operations.

==Storm highlights==
* In a 1996 playoff game against the Arizona Rattlers the Storm had the lead late in the game, but the Rattlers came down the field and scored a touchdown with little time left on the clock. Rather than try to tie the game with an extra point, Rattlers coach Danny White elected to go for the win with the two-point conversion. Quarterback Sherdrick Bonner was stopped short and the Storm won the game. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights this is ranked at number 10.
* During a 1991 regular season game, the Storm found themselves down 17 points against the Albany Firebirds. However, they rallied late in the game to take a 57–53 lead. But it wasn&#x27;t over yet as the Firebirds had five seconds left to come up with the touchdown from midfield. The Storm won the game with an interception off the nets. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked #8.
* ArenaBowl V found the Detroit Drive hosting the Tampa Bay Storm. With seconds left in the game, quarterback Jay Gruden threw deep to Stevie Thomas in the endzone. It was complete, and the Storm won the ArenaBowl. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked number 5.
* Stevie Thomas saves the Storm: During a 1995 semifinal game between Albany and Tampa Bay, Albany took a late one-point lead with seconds left on the clock. On the ensuing kickoff the Storm couldn&#x27;t field the ball off the nets and Stevie Thomas found himself in the very back of the endzone. Thomas broke five tackles at once coming out of the endzone and went all the way for a touchdown to give the Storm the win 56–49. They later went on to capture their 3rd ArenaBowl in 5 years. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is at #2.
* On March 16, 2012, the Storm became the first AFL team to win 200 games in league history with a 50–47 victory over the Georgia Force.
*The Storm had a heated rivalry with the Orlando Predators known as the War on I-4. Both teams found success and faced each other in the ArenaBowl and playoffs numerous times.

<text>Viscacha or vizcacha (, ) are rodents of two genera (&quot;Lagidium&quot; and &quot;Lagostomus&quot;) in the family Chinchillidae. They are native to South America and convergently resemble rabbits.

The five extant species of viscacha are:
*The Plains viscacha (&quot;Lagostomus maximus&quot;), a resident of the Pampas of Argentina, is easily differentiated from other viscachas by black and gray mustache-like facial markings. This species lives colonially in warrens of 10 to over 100. It is very vocal and emits alarm calls. The plains viscacha can strip grassland used to graze livestock; this has caused ranchers to consider the rodent a pest species.
*&quot;Lagidium ahuacaense&quot; is a newly described species of mountain viscacha from the Ecuadorian Andes.
*The northern viscacha (&quot;Lagidium peruanum&quot;) is native to the Peruvian Andes at elevations between the tree line and the snow line. It is dorsally gray or brown in color, with a bushy tail and long, furry ears. This species lives in large colonies separated into individual family units, like an apartment complex. It eats a wide range of plant matter, settling for almost anything it can find growing in the harsh, rocky environment.
*The southern viscacha (&quot;Lagidium viscacia&quot;), also called mountain viscacha, is similar to the northern viscacha, but its pelage is more red in color. It lives in similar habitat in the Andes.
*Wolffsohn&#x27;s viscacha (&quot;Lagidium wolffsohni&quot;) is rarer than the other four species.

<text>Beauté-sur-Marne was a royal castle near Vincennes, situated on the territory of the current commune of Nogent-sur-Marne.

&quot;Of all the pleasant and agreeable places one can find in this world, built in a suitable way, gay and pretty, to live and reside, that which is at the end of the forest of Vincennes, which was built by King Charles -- god grant him peace, joy, and health -- his eldest son, the Daupin of Viennois, gives the name of &quot;Beauty&quot;.&quot; -- Ballad of Eustache Deschamps (1346-1406)

Charles V, who sought the calm at a distance of the official court of Vincennes restored &quot;Beauty&quot; in 1473. Beyond the drawbridge and the castle wall was a garden with a fountain. The manor was a large tower in which each floor is &quot;of a piece&quot;. On the first floor was the bedroom of Evangelists where the king slept. Elsewhere there was a library. On the second floor was another bedroom with an altar for saying Mass. The whole was highly decorated, with some 62 tiles found during the construction of the railroad and which are now at the Carnavalet Museum in Paris.

It is remarkable that nothing is provided here to welcome the Queen, for whom Charles V bought the manor of Pleasure (&quot;Plaisance&quot;) in 1375. This manor, which gives its name to the commune of Neuilly-Plaisance, was held by his brother Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. Louis I of Anjou, another brother of the King, constructed another manor near Beauty, of which no trace remains.

In 1378, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, came to Beauty for a diplomatic visit to his nephew Charles V to discuss the hostilities of the English, and the co-existence of two popes. He was concerned mainly with strengthening the alliance between the two monarchies, already ancient, the House of Luxembourg being of French descent.

A manuscript at the National Library of France shows Charles V, King of France, welcoming Charles IV and his son King Wenceslas IV of Bohemia.

The Emperor resided at the manor of Beauty from 12 to 16 January while Charles V remained at Vincennes, visiting Beauty each day: 

&quot;At Beauty the Emperor remained several days and the King would visit each day and in secret parley at length&quot; writes Christine of Pisan. 

The two men exchanged rings and luxurious presents, and on 16 January, Charles V accompanied his uncle to the manor of Pleasure.

Charles V died at Beauty 16 September 1380, and the manor fell into ruin.

It is not spoken of again until Charles VII made it a present to his mistress Agnès Sorel, Lady of Beauty.

&quot;And the beauty which held the title of &quot;the most beautiful of the world&quot; should be called &quot;Demoiselle of Beauty&quot;: Thus the king had given her for her lifetime the house of &quot;Beaulté lez Paris&quot;.&quot; (Enguerrand of Monstrelet 1390-1453)

Agnès Sorel (1422-1450), daughter of a Picardy gentleman, Jean Soreau, entered the life of Charles VII in 1443. She was of the household of Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine, wife of King René of Naples. When Charles saw her for the first time, he fell madly in love, and had no rest until he brought her to his court to make her his mistress.

In 1444, she became the first official &quot;favorite&quot; of a king of France. Showered with presents from Charles, she was also interested in affairs of state. She soon had a house train of the greatest celebrities of the kingdom, which provoked a real scandal at the court.

She had the most beautiful headboards, best tapestry, best linen and covers, best dishes, ring goods and jewels, best cooks and best everything. -- writes Chastelain (1405-1475).

A contemporary painting shows her dressed in a richly embroidered dress trimmed with fur, with a low-cut neckline, a decolletage demonstrating that she was extremely beautiful.

One can easily imagine, to the breadth of whole this luxury, the castle of Beauty-sur-Marne that the king gave her in 1448, making her thus the Lady of Beauty.

It is most beautiful and pretty and better situated of all in the Île de France.

It is in this atmosphere that Charles VII asserted his authority. He called together John Bureau, Jacques Coeur and Etienne Chevalier, all confidants of the beautiful Agnès, and all interfering in public affairs, and spoke these words, attributed to Francis I as a reminder:

&quot;Sweet Agnès, more honor you deserve / the cause being to recover France / than what can be rendered inside a cloister of nuns or to a devoted hermit.&quot;

She died at the manor of Mesnil, in Normandy, while she had left to rejoin the King, in February 1450, three days after her delivery, most likely of complications of childbirth. However, it is also claimed that the Dauphin, the future Louis XI, whose advances she repelled, poisoned her. She is buried at Loches, in Tourraine. Her tomb, initially situated in the church of Notre-Dame was desecrated during the revolution and her statue destroyed. Later, it has been transferred in the old home of the castle.

A painting of 1610 shows again the tower of the castle, that Richelieu razed in 1626.

<text>Narsarsuaq (lit. &quot;Great Plain&quot;; old spelling: &quot;Narssarssuaq&quot;) is a settlement in the Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland. It had 123 inhabitants in 2020. There is a thriving tourism industry in and around Narsarsuaq, whose attractions include a great diversity of wildlife, gemstones, tours to glaciers, and an airfield museum.

==History==

Narsarsuaq is located within the Eastern Settlement of the Greenlandic Norse; the Brattahlíð farm of Erik the Red established in 985 was located on the opposite bank of Tunulliarfik Fjord, where the modern settlement of Qassiarsuk is situated.

In 1941 the United States built an air base at Narsarsuaq code-named Bluie West One (BW1). (&quot;Bluie&quot; was the Allied military code name for Greenland.) Thousands of planes used BW1 as a stepping stone on their way from the aircraft factories in North America to the battlegrounds of Europe. A 600-bed hospital was built in order to deal with casualties from the Normandy landings. After the end of the war, BW1 continued to be developed, and was a major hospital site during the Korean War, with the military hospital expanded to 1,000 beds. However, it was rendered surplus by the advent of mid-air refueling and the construction of the larger Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. In 1951, it was agreed that Denmark and the United States would jointly oversee the airbase. Although it closed in 1958, it was reopened the following year by the Danish government after the loss of the vessel &quot;Hans Hedtoft&quot; and all crew south off Cape Farewell. The hospital was destroyed by a fire in 1972, although the ruins remain.

== Transport ==
Narsarsuaq Airport serves as the principal airfield in southwestern Greenland, with seasonal international flights from Iceland operated by Icelandair. It has also commuter helicopter flights from communities of southern Greenland operated by Air Greenland. Small planes crossing the Atlantic sometimes replicate the North Atlantic Ferry Route, stopping at Narsarsuaq Airport and other World War II airfields, including Goose Bay, Newfoundland in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland.

Narsarsuaq has a sea port where passenger boats and cruise ships can moor. It is located south of the terminal building, so bus transfers are arranged.

A gravel road is maintained between Qassiarsuk and Narsarsuaq around the fjord. It has two river crossings without bridges but off-road vehicles ford them, although a direct boat across the fjord is also used. There is also a regular boat service to Qaqortoq, , which takes almost 4 hours.

== Population ==
The population of the settlement is strictly tied to the traffic dynamics at the local airport.

==Climate==
Narsarsuaq experiences boundary subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), which with a 1.1 °C (1.98 °F) margin escapes being classified as polar climate that is typical for the rest of Greenland. Despite its rather chilly temperatures, Narsarsuaq is one of the few places in Greenland with abundant naturally growing trees. This is due to several factors. Its geographical position is extremely sheltered from harsh subpolar winds by multiple layers of tall mountains to the west, and there is a heavy oceanic influence that results in a rather stable and steady amount of precipitation year-round. The oceanic influence can be observed in the occasional Atlantic storms that often pound the region (resulting in a fairly wet climate) and a moderate amount of precipitation per year (which could also be considered quite high by Greenlandic standards). 
Due to the fair climatic conditions, Narsarsuaq is the site of Greenland&#x27;s only botanical garden, the &quot;Greenlandic Arboretum&quot;.

== Greenlandic Arboretum ==

On the lower slopes of the Mellemlandet ridge, close to Narsarsuaq Airport, there is a unique &#x27;botanical garden of the Arctic&#x27;, called the Greenlandic Arboretum. The goal is to establish a live collection of trees and bushes native to both the arctic and the alpine tree-lines of the entire Northern Hemisphere.

Founded in 1988, it encompasses 15 hectares and it shelters 110 plant species, mostly varieties of boreal taiga trees, such as Siberian larch, lodgepole pine, white spruce, Sitka spruce, and various bushes. Many individual trees are tagged or otherwise marked. The plantation currently has more than 50,000 trees of various provenances.

<text>The Shatapatha Brahmana (, , abbreviated to &#x27;SB&#x27;) is a commentary on the Śukla Yajurveda. It is attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya. Described as the most complete, systematic, and important of the Brahmanas (commentaries on the Vedas), it contains detailed explanations of Vedic sacrificial rituals, symbolism, and mythology.

Particularly in its description of sacrificial rituals (including construction of complex fire-altars), the Shatapatha Brahmana (SB) provides scientific knowledge of geometry (e.g. calculations of pi and the root of the Pythagorean theorem) and observational astronomy (e.g. planetary distances and the assertion that the Earth is circular) from the Vedic period.

The Shatapatha Brahmana is also considered significant in the development of Vaishnavism as the origin of several Puranic legends and avatars of Vishnu. Notably, all of them (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, and Vamana) are listed as the first five avatars in the Dashavatara (the ten principal avatars of Vishnu).

There are two versions (recensions) available of this text. They are the Madhyandina recension and the Kanva recension. This article focuses exclusively on the Madhyandina version of the Shatapatha Brahmana.

== Nomenclature ==
The &#x27;Shatapatha Brahmana&#x27; (Sanskrit शतपथब्राह्मण) can be loosely translated as &#x27;Brahmana of one hundred paths&#x27;:

*&#x27;Brahmana&#x27; (Sanskrit ब्राह्मण) means &#x27;explanations of sacred knowledge or doctrine&#x27;.
*&#x27;Shatapatha&#x27; (Sanskrit शतपथ) means &#x27;having a hundred paths&#x27; or &#x27;proceeding in a hundred ways&#x27;.

=== Kanda and Adhyâya ===

* &#x27;Kanda&#x27; (or &#x27;Khanda&#x27;, Sanskrit खंड), means &#x27;chapter&#x27;, &#x27;division of a book&#x27;, or more loosely &#x27;book&#x27;. It also means &#x27;praise&#x27; and &#x27;water&#x27;.
* &#x27;Adhyâya&#x27; (Sanskrit अध्याय), means &#x27;chapter&#x27; (of a book), &#x27;lesson&#x27;, &#x27;reading&#x27; and &#x27;lecture&#x27;.

In relation to the Shatapatha Brahmana, a reference such as &#x27;14.1.2&#x27; means &#x27;Kanda 14, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 2&#x27;, or in English, &#x27;Book 14, Chapter 1, Explanation 2&#x27;. The addition of a fourth digit at the end (e.g. 17.7.3.11) refers to the verse number.

== Date ==
Arthur Berriedale Keith states that linguistically, the Shatapatha Brahmana belongs to the later part of the Brāhmaṇa period of Vedic Sanskrit (8th-6th century BCE). M. Witzel dates this text to the 7th–6th century BCE. Jan N. Bremmer dates it to around 700 BCE. J. Eggeling (translator of the Vājasaneyi mādhyandina recension into English), dates the final written version of the text to 300 BCE, although he states that some elements are &#x27;far older, transmitted orally from unknown antiquity&#x27;.

There are claims of dating the text much further back than the said ranges, and scholars have extensively rejected such claims; Witzel criticizes it for &quot;faulty reasoning&quot; and taking &quot;a rather dubious datum and us[ing] it to reinterpret Vedic linguistic, textual, ritual history while neglect[ing] all the other contradictory data.&quot; According to Witzel, the Shatapatha Brahmana does not contain precise contemporary astronomical records, but rather only approximate naked-eye observations for ritual concerns which likely reflect oral remembrances of older time periods; furthermore, the same general observations are recorded in the Babylonian MUL.APIN tablets of c. 1000 BCE. The Shatapatha Brahmana contains clear references to the use of iron, so it cannot be dated earlier than c. 1200–1000 BCE, while it reflects cultural, philosophical, and socio-political developments that are later than other Iron Age texts (such as the Atharvaveda) and only slightly earlier than the time of the Buddha (c. 5th century BCE)

== Content and Recensions ==
According to the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), the Shatapatha Brahmana survives in two recensions:

The 14 books of the Madhyandina recension can be divided into two major parts. The first 9 books have close textual commentaries, often line by line, of the first 18 books of the corresponding samhita of the Śukla (white) Yajurveda. The remaining 5 books of the Shatapatha cover supplementary and ritualistically newer material; the content of the 14th and last book constitutes the Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad. The IGNCA also provides further structural comparison between the recensions, noting that the &#x27;names of the Kandas also vary between the two (versions) and the sequence in which they appear&#x27;:

The IGNCA adds that &#x27;the division of Kandika is more rational in the Kanva text than in the other... The name &#x27;Shatapatha&#x27;, as Eggeling has suggested, might have been based on the number of Adhyayas in the Madhyandina which is exactly one hundred. But the Kanva recension, which has one hundred and four Adhyayas is also known by the same name. In Indian tradition words like &#x27;sata&#x27; and &#x27;sahasra&#x27;, indicating numbers, do not always stand for exact numbers&#x27;.

=== Brihadaranayaka Upanishad ===

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad forms the concluding part of the last Kanda, known as &#x27;Aranyaka&#x27; of both recensions of the Shatapatha Brahmana. Swami Madhavananda states that this Upanishad is &#x27;the greatest of the Upanishads... not only in extent; but it is also the greatest in respect of its substance and theme. It is the greatest Upanishad in the sense that the illimitable, all-embracing, absolute, self-luminous, blissful reality – the Brhat or Brahman, identical with Atman, constitutes its theme&#x27;.

== Significance in science ==

=== Astronomy ===
In relation to sacrifice and astronomical phenomena detailed in texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana (e.g. sacrifices performed during the waxing and waning of the moon), N. Aiyangar states the fact that &#x27;the Vedic people had a celestial [i.e. astronomical] counterpart of their sacrificial ground is clear&#x27;, and cites an example of the &quot;YajnaVaraha&quot; sacrifice in relation to the constellation of Orion. Roy elaborates further on this example, stating that when &#x27;the sun became united with Orion at the vernal equinox...[this] commenced the yearly [&quot;YajnaVaraha&quot;] sacrifice&#x27;. The vernal (March) equinox marks the onset of spring, and is celebrated in Indian culture as the Holi festival (the spring festival of colours).

A.A. Macdonell adds that the Shatapatha in particular is notable as – unlike the Samhitas – in it the Earth was &#x27;expressly called circular (&quot;parimandala&quot;)&#x27;.

=== Mathematics ===

P. N. Sinha states that the number 1,000 represents &#x27;the thousand Maha yugas of every Kalpa&#x27; (about 4.32 billion years), illustrated by the 1,000 hoods of the Naga Vasuki/Ananta on which the Earth is supported. According to F. Staal, layering, size, and configuration of bricks to construct sacrificial altars – real and symbolic – as detailed in texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana had numerous rules, with Staal adding - in relation to similarities with ancient Greek, Babylonian, and Chinese geometry:

== Significance in Vaishnavism ==
A.A. Macdonell, A.B. Keith, J. Roy, J. Dowson, W.J. Wilkins, S. Ghose, M.L. Varadpande, N Aiyangar, and D.A. Soifer all state that several avatars and associated Puranic legends of Vishnu either originate (e.g. Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, and Narasimha) or at least were significantly developed (e.g. Vamana) in the Shatapatha Brahmana (SB). Notably, all constitute the first five avatars listed in the Dashavatara, the ten principal avatars of Vishnu.

=== Vishnu ===
Sofia states &quot;developments that occur in the general character of Visnu in the Brahmana literature have far-reaching influence on the growth and moulding of avataric Visnu... Probably the single most important development, which is first found in the Brahmanas and exerts the most influence over all other factors, is the identification of Vishnu with the sacrifice&#x27;. Vishnu is explicitly stated to be sacrifice repeatedly throughout the Shatapatha Brahmana (e.g. SB 1.7.4.20, 1.1.4.9, 3.2.1.38, 3.6.3.3, 5.2.3.6, 5.4.5.1, 5.4.5.18, 11.4.1.4, 12.5.4.11, 14.1.1.13, and 11.4.1.4).

==== Kanda 14, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 1 ====
in SB 14.1.1 (&#x27;The Pravargya&#x27;), the story given is that &#x27;the gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vishnu, and the [Visvedevas], except the two Asvins, performed a sacrificial session&#x27;, which was first attained by Vishnu, hence &#x27;he became the most excellent of the gods&#x27;. &quot;Upadika&quot; ants then agreed with the other gods to gnaw at the bowstring of Vishnu while He rested his head on the Bow, in exchange for the boon to &#x27;find water even in the desert&#x27; (as &#x27;all food is water&#x27;). The &quot;Gharma&quot; (hot beverage offered as an oblation) is named after the sound of Vishnu&#x27;s head hitting the ground (which &#x27;on falling became yonder sun&#x27;), and &#x27;inasmuch as he [Vishnu] stretched out (&quot;pra-vrig&quot;) on the ground, therefrom the &quot;Pravargya&quot; (took its name)&#x27;. The body of Vishnu is encompassed by Indra, who possessed by His glory &#x27;became &quot;Makhavat&quot; (possessed of makha)&#x27;. Vishnu is then divided into three parts, with Agni receiving the first (morning) portion, Indra the second (midday) portion, and the remaining Visvedevas the third portion.

=== Kurma ===
Kurma, the tortoise avatar of Vishnu, is inextricably linked in the Puranas with the legend of the churning of the Ocean of Milk, referred to as the Samudra manthan. The tortoise avatar is also synonymous with Akupara, the &#x27;world-turtle&#x27; supporting the Earth, as well as the Saptarishi sage, Kasyapa. Accounts from the Shatapatha Brahmana are stated by Varadpande to be the seed of Kurma.

Eggeling adds that the &#x27;kapalas [cups used in ritual sacrifices] are usually arranged in such a manner as to produce a fancied resemblance to the (upper) shell of the tortoise, which is a symbol of the sky, as the tortoise itself represents the universe... In the same way the term kapala, in the singular, is occasionally applied to the skull, as well as to the upper and the lower case of the tortoise, e.g. Sat Br. VII, 5, 1, 2 [7.5.1.2].&#x27;

==== Kanda 1, Adhyaya 6, Brahmana 2 ====
Macdonell also notes another instance in the Taittiriya Samhita (2.6.3; relating to the Krishna (Black) YajurVeda), where Prajapati assigns sacrifices for the gods and places the oblation within himself, before Risis arrive at the sacrifice and &#x27;the sacrificial cake (purodasa) is said to become a tortoise&#x27;.

==== Kanda 6, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 1 ====
&quot;Vak&quot; (speech) is female (e.g. SB 1.2.5.15, 1.3.3.8, 3.2.1.19, 3.2.1.22). Used in ritual sacrifices, so is the sacrificial altar (&quot;Vedi&quot;; SB 3.5.1.33, 3.5.1.35), the spade (&quot;abhri;&quot; SB 3.5.4.4, 3.6.1.4, 3.7.1.1, 6.3.1.39; see section on Varaha, below), and the firepan (&quot;ukha&quot;; SB 6.6.2.5). The (generative) principle of gender (i.e. male and female coupling to produce something) is pervasive throughout (as reflected by the Sanskrit language itself).

==== Kanda 7, Adhyaya 5, Brahmana 1 ====
Originally a form of Prajapati, the creator-god, the tortoise is thus clearly and directly linked with Vedic ritual sacrifice, the sun, and with Kasyapa as a creator (or progenitor). The tortoise is also stated to represent the three worlds (i.e. the &quot;triloka&quot;). SB 5.1.3.9–10 states &#x27;Pragapati (the lord of generation) represents productiveness... the male means productiveness&#x27;. SB 14.1.1, which relates the story of Vishnu becoming the greatest of the gods at a sacrifice of the gods before being decapitated by His bow, states the head of Vishnu became the sun when it fell.

=== Matsya ===
Matsya, the fish avatar of Vishnu, appears to Manu to warn him of an impending deluge. After being reared by and growing to an enormous size, Matsya then guides Manu&#x27;s ship to safety at the peak of a mountain, where Manu re-establishes life through the performance of Vedic sacrificial rites (yajna). In Puranic accounts, Matsya also rescues the Vedas taken under the water, after they were stolen from Brahma by the Asura called Hayagriva (not to be confused with Hayagriva, the horse-headed avatar of Vishnu). From the Shatapatha Brahmana:

Aiyangar explains that, in relation to the RigVeda, &#x27;Sacrifice is metaphorically called [a] Ship and as Manu means man, the thinker, [so] the story seems to be a parable of the Ship of Sacrifice being the means for man&#x27;s crossing the seas of his duritas, [meaning his] sins, and troubles&#x27;. SB 13.4.3.12 also mentions King Matsya Sammada, whose &#x27;people are the water-dwellers... both fish and fishermen... it is these he instructs; – &#x27;the Itihasa is the Veda&#x27;.&#x27;

=== Narasimha ===

Narasimha destroyed the Asura-King Hiranyakashipu, who after undertaking severe penances, was granted a boon by Brahma that he could not be killed inside or outside any residence, on the ground or in the sky, or by any god, human, animal, or weapon. The man-lion avatar of Vishnu thus put the demon on His lap and killed him with claws. This concept is similar to that found in the Shatapatha brahmana (Sanskrit transliteration for Kanda XII is not available):
D.A. Soifer states that &#x27;Brahmana literature yields what must be considered as the prototype of that [Narasimha] myth, the Indra-Namuchi [or Namuki] myth&#x27;, adding that other academics such as Devasthali concur that although elements of the Namuchi legend are &#x27;scattered throughout Brahmana literature (cf. VS Vajaseneyi Samhita] 10.34; PB [Pancavimsa Brahmana] 12.6.8, MS [Maitrayani Samhita] IV.34; TB [Taittiriya Brahmana] 1.7.1.6)&#x27;, the fullest version is in the Shatapatha Brahmana. Indra defeating Namuchi itself originates from the RigVeda (e.g. 10.73):

=== Vamana ===

Vamana, the dwarf avatar of Vishnu, took back the three worlds from the Asura king Bali (grandson of Prahlada, saved from his father, Hiranyakashipu, by the Narasimha avatar) in three steps.

==== Kanda I, Adhyaya 2, Brahmana 5 ====
Eggeling notes that in the Shatapatha Brahmana, &#x27;we have here the germ [i.e. origin] of the Dwarf incarnation of Vishnu&#x27;. The difference in this account – aside from no mention of Bali – is that instead of gaining the earth by footsteps, it is gained by as much as Vamana can lie upon as a sacrifice. That this legend developed into Vamana taking three steps, as noted by Aiyangar, originates from the three strides of Vishnu covering the three words in the RigVeda (1.22 and 1.154). Notably, the three steps of Vishnu are mentioned throughout the Shatapatha Brahmana as part of the sacrificial rituals described (e.g. SB 1.9.3.12, 5.4.2.6, and 6.7.4.8).

==== Kanda 6, Adhyaya 7, Brahmana 4 ====
SB 6.7.4.8 also explains why the strides of Vishnu are performed in rituals:

=== Varaha ===

Varaha – also referred to as Yajna-Varaha (&#x27;sacrificial boar&#x27;) – is in Puranic literature explicitly stated to be the symbolic embodiment of sacrifice (including the ritual equipment, offerings, oblations, and altars used). Stated in the Nirukta to be synonymous with clouds and rain (sacrifice produces rain, rain feeds crops, and crops feed living beings), Varaha is most commonly associated with the legend of lifting the Earth out of the Cosmic Waters, and in various accounts also battles and defeats the Asura Hiranyaksa to do so.

==== Kanda 14, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 2 ====
The context of this verse is in relation to a Pravargya ritual, where clay/earth is dug up, fashioned or &#x27;spread out&#x27; into &quot;Mahâvîra&quot; pots (symbolising the head of Vishnu), and baked in a fire altar (an explanation of Vishnu&#x27;s decapitation relating to this ritual is given in SB 14.1.1). S. Ghose states that the &#x27;first direct idea of the boar as an incarnation of Vishnu performing the specific task of rescuing the earth is mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana... the nucleus of the story of the god rescuing the earth in the boar-shape is found here&#x27;. A.B. Keith states that the boar &#x27;is called Emusa [or &#x27;Emûsha&#x27; in the SB] from its epithet emusa, [meaning] fierce, in the RigVeda&#x27;. However, as this name occurs only once in the RigVeda, the ascribed meaning cannot be verified:


==== Kanda 5, Adhyaya 4, Brahmana 3 ====
The form of a boar was produced from a sacrificial oblation of the gods, and boars share the essence of cattle (which symbolise prosperity and sacrifice in SB 3.1.4.14, and productiveness in 5.2.5.8). Eggeling notes that in this ceremony, the King wears boar-boots to engage in a mock-battle with a &quot;Raganya&quot; (a Kshatriya noble or royal), stated to be &#x27;Varuna&#x27;s consecration; and the Earth is afraid of him&#x27;. This ritual therefore seems to be significant as the mock-battle between the King (symbolising the boar) and the Raganya (symbolising Varuna, RigVedic deity of water) parallels the battle between Varaha with the Asura Hiranyaksa in various Puranic accounts of the Earth being saved and lifted out of the waters.

<text>The Toyota Matrix, officially named Toyota Corolla Matrix, is a compact hatchback manufactured by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge, Ontario and derived from the Corolla. Introduced in 2002 as a 2003 model, the Matrix was the result of a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors, with the GM version being the Pontiac Vibe, which was assembled by New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) in Fremont, California, United States.

The Matrix was positioned as a sporty hatchback counterpart of the North American Corolla and was counted as a variant of it in Toyota&#x27;s sales figures.

Although identical mechanically, and nearly as much internally, the Matrix and Vibe had different sheetmetal and exterior trim designed by their respective brands. Both vehicles are narrow, tall station wagons styled in a quasi-SUV fashion (called a crossover utility vehicle or &quot;CUV&quot; by Toyota) and marketed to a fairly youthful market segment. This type of car is also commonly referred to as a sport wagon.

First sold in February 2002, the Matrix saw a minor facelift for the 2005 model year, and was redesigned completely in 2008 for the 2009 model year, following the tenth generation Corolla. Sales of the Matrix were discontinued in the United States in 2013 and in Canada in 2014.


==First generation (E130; 2002)==

The Matrix was first introduced in the 2003 model year and based on the Toyota Corolla platform. Relatively unchanged in 2004, a facelift for 2005 brought minor revisions to the exterior – mainly revised styling to the front fascia due to complaints of rubbing the ground on the previous incarnation and replacing the red lenses on the taillamps with clear ones. Also, the center instrument panel was slightly redesigned and featured a Toyota head unit in place of the previous GM-sourced radio.

Two 1.8 L four-cylinder engines were offered in the Matrix: the 1ZZ-FE used in the Corolla, which originally made in 2003 through 2005 models, but was reduced to in 2006, and the performance-oriented 2ZZ-GE taken from the Toyota Celica GT-S, which produced (previously in 2003, in 2004, and in 2005). The 2006 drop in power was due to new testing standards, and not a change in the engine&#x27;s actual performance.

In late 2006, Toyota discontinued use of the 2ZZ-GE engine and dropped the XRS from the Matrix lineup to be temporarily replaced by the M-Theory edition. Like each year of the XRS model, the M-Theory was a limited production run of 2500 cars. All wheel drive was also available from 2003 to 2006 when coupled to the 1ZZ engine and automatic transmission, but was dropped at the same time as the XRS.

===Models===
====Standard (2003–2008)====
Starting out at in 2003, the no-frills base model came with few options. While it did have standard air conditioning, it left out features like color-keyed mirrors and door handles, blacked out window frames and power mirrors. One option the base model could be had with was AWD for an additional $1,465 (although the actual increase was $2,445, since AWD only came with an automatic transmission). Adding AWD brought the car&#x27;s curb weight of up to and decreased power by and . In 2004, the price of a base model remained unchanged, but by the last year of production, 2008, it had risen to $15,510.

====XR (2003–2008)====
The Matrix&#x27;s XR mid-grade trim level added features like color-matched mirrors and door handles, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a panic button on the key fob. Options available with the XR trim included a sunroof, body kit, and alloy wheels. A 2003 XR started at and , but when equipped with AWD cost at least $18,445 (only $305 less than an XRS) and weighed in at . Like the base model, the XR&#x27;s AWD engine was detuned. Again, the car&#x27;s price for its second year stayed the same, but in the four years after that, it rose to $16,990.

====XRS (2003–2006)====
For , the top-of-the-line model came standard with four-wheel disc brakes and six speakers. Also included on all XRS models were anti-lock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution, 16-inch alloy wheels, and cruise control. In 2003, 17-inch wheels could be had, but only on cars without a sunroof. An option combining wheels and a sunroof became available the second year of production. In 2005, an XRS started out at $18,850, and for its last year, it sold for at least $19,250.

The XRS trim included an engine upgrade to Toyota&#x27;s higher-performance 2ZZ-GE engine. Displacing , it produced and – a then-rare 100 horsepower-per-liter. While its 11.5:1 compression ratio was a large factor in its performance, the engine could change to a second cam profile at higher RPM through Toyota&#x27;s VVTL-i and was designed for operation up to 8500 RPM. The engine&#x27;s high compression necessitates &quot;premium&quot; gasoline (91 octane or above in the (R+M)/2 scale). With the exception of an available automatic in 2003, a six-speed manual transmission was the only gearbox offered in the XRS. A Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TLEV) its first year of production, the 2ZZ was retrofitted in 2004 with a smog pump and reclassified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV).

The Matrix was able to come to a full stop from in only . Due to being front wheel drive, the XRS has a weight distribution of 59/41 (front/rear), which may result in understeer when driven hard. It weighs in at a relatively light .

====M-Theory (2007)====
Not a trim level, the M-Theory edition was a 2007-only appearance package with an exclusive &quot;Speedway Blue&quot; color. For , a customer got 17-inch Caldina wheels, a chrome exhaust tip, a numbered plaque (1 of 2500), four wheel disc brakes, and a spoiler. To improve handling, a &quot;sport tuned suspension&quot; and strut tower brace were included.

===Interior===
One of the Matrix&#x27;s unique design features is its interior, particularly the rear 60/40 seats and cargo area. Made with rigid plastic backs, the rear seats fold flat, creating a cargo area. In a practicality test, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; was able to haul more cargo in the Matrix than in a Subaru WRX wagon with of space. In addition to the eight tie-downs in the back for attaching the included cargo nets and tonneau cover, the seats and rear floor have integrated rails for installing extra tie-downs.

Up front, the passenger seat also folds flat, accommodating long items like surf boards or allowing drivers to use the tray in its back to hold items like a laptop computer. An electronic device can be charged with the 115 volt/100 watt power inverter (US models only). The first year of production (2003), the instrument cluster was completely red. However, the next year, Toyota made the numbers white while keeping the rest of the gauges red. When the car was updated in 2005, a digital clock was added to the radio bezel.

===Crash testing===
NHTSA crash test ratings (2003):

*Rollover Rating: 

===Recalls===
In May 2008, Toyota issued a recall for 2003 and 2004 model year Corollas and Matrixes. The recall notice cites two bolts in each of the front doors as potentially causing the window to come off the track and break. This recall only applies to models equipped with power windows. General Motors issued a recall for the same problem on 2003 and 2004 Pontiac Vibes with power windows at the same time.

On August 26, 2010, Toyota issued a recall for 2005 to 2008 model year Corollas and Matrixes, equipped with the 1ZZ-FE engine and two-wheel drive. The recall notices states that an improperly manufactured Engine Control Module (ECM) can develop a crack in its circuitry, potentially causing the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light to illuminate, harsh shifting, and stalling and/or failure of the engine to start.

On November 20, 2019, along with 2003-2008 Corollas and 2004 and 2005 Yarises, the Matrix of the model years from 2003 to 2008 was recalled in Mexico due to these cars containing Takata frontal passenger airbags which might degrade due to weather exposure and variation of high temperatures, which usually occurs on cities with extreme weather, which might cause serious injuries on passengers. Toyota has advised all owners of the following cars to replace these faulty frontal passenger airbags or all airbags, depending on the version. Toyota of Mexico has notified PROFECO that in the Mexican market exists 618 vehicles in addition to these three recalled vehicles. The replacing campaign will go due November 22.
==Second generation (E140; 2008)==
Initially rumored by Toyota and auto news media as a Matrix replacement named the Blade, the second generation Matrix was unveiled on October 31, 2007, at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show in Las Vegas, and was first available at dealerships in February 2008, as a 2009 model. The sibling of the Matrix, the Vibe, was also upgraded, but production of that model ended after 2009 when the entire Pontiac brand was retired.

In the United States, three trim levels (&quot;Standard&quot; [base], &quot;S&quot; and &quot;XRS&quot;) are offered, as well as two inline fours: a 2ZR-FE for the base model (chassis code ZRE142) and a 2AZ-FE for the S and XRS trims. The former is offered with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the larger engine is equipped with either a manual or automatic five-speed transmission. In addition, the S trim can be equipped with a four-speed automatic and all-wheel drive.

Canadian buyers are offered in four trim levels: a 1.8 L-powered base model, and the &quot;XR&quot;, &quot;XRS&quot; and &quot;AWD&quot; models with a 2.4-liter engine.

This generation marks the first time the Matrix was sold in Mexico. The Matrix comes only in two trim levels to Mexico: Base and XR.

For the 2011 model year, the Matrix received redesigned exterior and interior elements, including front and rear fascias, wheels and seat fabrics. The radio was also changed to allow for Bluetooth capability.

===Models===
In 2008, Toyota began offering different trim levels in the United States and Canada. The XR trim became exclusive for Canada, and the S trim was released only in the U.S., while AWD remained available in both markets after 2009. All vehicles have an independent front suspension with MacPherson struts, but only XRS trim and cars equipped with all-wheel drive and 158 horsepower, feature an independent rear suspension using double wishbones instead of a semi-independent torsion beam. The 2009 models have less interior space than the preceding years, with a total of compared to the original .

The XRS trim was dropped from the U.S. lineup for the 2011 model year.

===Safety===
All models come standard with side torso airbags, side curtain airbags, anti-lock braking and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard.

Toyota&#x27;s Smart Stop Technology was added to the Matrix for the 2011 model year.

The Matrix is rated &quot;Good&quot; in both frontal and side Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests.

NHTSA crash test ratings (2009):
*Frontal Crash Test – Driver: 
*Frontal Crash Test – Passenger: 
*Side Impact Rating – Driver: 
*Side Impact Rating – Passenger: 
*Rollover Rating: 

===Recalls===
The 2009 to 2010 model year Matrix (and its Vibe relative) are subject to the 2009–2011 Toyota vehicle recalls regarding floor mat and accelerator pedal replacement.

On October 10, 2012, Toyota issued a recall for 2009 model year Corolla and Matrix, along with 10 other models. The recall notices states that improperly lubricated driver&#x27;s side power window master switch may develop a &quot;notchy&quot; or sticky feel, and that improper aftermarket lubrication may present a fire hazard. The repair involves lubricating the switch assembly with a special fluorine grease.

===Discontinuation===
On August 5, 2013, Toyota announced an end to production of the Matrix for the US market after the 2013 model year due to declining sales, and that there were no plans to replace it with another vehicle. The Canadian market continued for the 2014 model year, with those assembled in Cambridge, Ontario by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. The Matrix was then discontinued in Canada and was not offered for the 2015 model year. Toyota continued to sell a range of compact hatchbacks in North America through its Scion brand. On September 1, 2016, &quot;the Scion brand transitioned to Toyota.&quot; For the 2017 model year, the Corolla iM would be the successor of the Matrix. For the 2019 model year, the newest iteration has been released as the Corolla hatchback.

<text>In mathematics, a quadratic irrational number (also known as a quadratic irrational or quadratic surd) is an irrational number that is the solution to some quadratic equation with rational coefficients which is irreducible over the rational numbers. Since fractions in the coefficients of a quadratic equation can be cleared by multiplying both sides by their least common denominator, a quadratic irrational is an irrational root of some quadratic equation with integer coefficients. The quadratic irrational numbers, a subset of the complex numbers, are algebraic numbers of degree 2, and can therefore be expressed as

:formula_1

for integers ; with , and non-zero, and with square-free. When is positive, we get real quadratic irrational numbers, while a negative gives complex quadratic irrational numbers which are not real numbers. This defines an injection from the quadratic irrationals to quadruples of integers, so their cardinality is at most countable; since on the other hand every square root of a prime number is a distinct quadratic irrational, and there are countably many prime numbers, they are at least countable; hence the quadratic irrationals are a countable set. Abu Kamil was the first mathematician to introduce irrational numbers as valid solutions to quadratic equations.

Quadratic irrationals are used in field theory to construct field extensions of the field of rational numbers . Given the square-free integer , the augmentation of by quadratic irrationals using produces a quadratic field ). For example, the inverses of elements of ) are of the same form as the above algebraic numbers:

:formula_2

Quadratic irrationals have useful properties, especially in relation to continued fractions, where we have the result that &quot;all&quot; real quadratic irrationals, and &quot;only&quot; real quadratic irrationals, have periodic continued fraction forms. For example

:formula_3

The periodic continued fractions can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the rational numbers. The correspondence is explicitly provided by Minkowski&#x27;s question mark function, and an explicit construction is given in that article. It is entirely analogous to the correspondence between rational numbers and strings of binary digits that have an eventually-repeating tail, which is also provided by the question mark function. Such repeating sequences correspond to periodic orbits of the dyadic transformation (for the binary digits) and the Gauss map formula_4 for continued fractions.

==Real quadratic irrational numbers and indefinite binary quadratic forms==
We may rewrite a quadratic irrationality as follows:

:formula_5

It follows that every quadratic irrational number can be written in the form

:formula_6

This expression is not unique.

Fix a non-square, positive integer formula_7 congruent to formula_8 or formula_9 modulo formula_10, and define a set formula_11 as

: formula_12

Every quadratic irrationality is in some set formula_11, since the congruence conditions can be met by scaling the numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor.

A matrix

:formula_14

with integer entries and formula_15 can be used to transform a number formula_16 in formula_11. The transformed number is

:formula_18

If formula_16 is in formula_11, then formula_21 is too.

The relation between formula_16 and formula_21 above is an equivalence relation. (This follows, for instance, because the above transformation gives a group action of the group of integer matrices with determinant 1 on the set formula_11.) Thus, formula_11 partitions into equivalence classes. Each equivalence class comprises a collection of quadratic irrationalities with each pair equivalent through the action of some matrix. Serret&#x27;s theorem implies that the regular continued fraction expansions of equivalent quadratic irrationalities are eventually the same, that is, their sequences of partial quotients have the same tail. Thus, all numbers in an equivalence class have continued fraction expansions that are eventually periodic with the same tail.

There are finitely many equivalence classes of quadratic irrationalities in formula_11. The standard proof of this involves considering the map formula_27 from binary quadratic forms of discriminant formula_7 to formula_11 given by

:formula_30

A computation shows that formula_27 is a bijection that respects the matrix action on each set. The equivalence classes of quadratic irrationalities are then in bijection with the equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms, and Lagrange showed that there are finitely many equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms of given discriminant.

Through the bijection formula_27, expanding a number in formula_11 in a continued fraction corresponds to reducing the quadratic form. The eventually periodic nature of the continued fraction is then reflected in the eventually periodic nature of the orbit of a quadratic form under reduction, with reduced quadratic irrationalities (those with a purely periodic continued fraction) corresponding to reduced quadratic forms.

==Square root of non-square is irrational==
The definition of quadratic irrationals requires them to satisfy two conditions: they must satisfy a quadratic equation and they must be irrational. The solutions to the quadratic equation &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; = 0 are

:formula_34

Thus quadratic irrationals are precisely those real numbers in this form that are not rational. Since &quot;b&quot; and 2&quot;a&quot; are both integers, asking when the above quantity is irrational is the same as asking when the square root of an integer is irrational. The answer to this is that the square root of any natural number that is not a square number is irrational.

The square root of 2 was the first such number to be proved irrational. Theodorus of Cyrene proved the irrationality of the square roots of non-square natural numbers up to 17, but stopped there, probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of numbers greater than 17. Euclid&#x27;s Elements Book 10 is dedicated to classification of irrational magnitudes. The original proof of the irrationality of the non-square natural numbers depends on Euclid&#x27;s lemma.

Many proofs of the irrationality of the square roots of non-square natural numbers implicitly assume the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which was first proven by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;. This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes. For any rational non-integer in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator which does not divide into the numerator. When the numerator is squared that prime will still not divide into it because of the unique factorization. Therefore, the square of a rational non-integer is always a non-integer; by contrapositive, the square root of an integer is always either another integer, or irrational.

Euclid used a restricted version of the fundamental theorem and some careful argument to prove the theorem. His proof is in Euclid&#x27;s Elements Book X Proposition 9.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is not actually required to prove the result, however. There are self-contained proofs by Richard Dedekind, among others. The following proof was adapted by Colin Richard Hughes from a proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2 found by Theodor Estermann in 1975.

If &quot;D&quot; is a non-square natural number, then there is a natural number &quot;n&quot; such that:

:&quot;n&quot;2 &lt; &quot;D&quot; &lt; (&quot;n&quot; + 1)2,

so in particular

:0 &lt; − &quot;n&quot; &lt; 1.

If the square root of &quot;D&quot; is rational, then it can be written as the irreducible fraction &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;, so that &quot;q&quot; is the smallest possible denominator, and hence the smallest number for which &quot;q&quot; is also an integer. Then:

:( − &quot;n&quot;)&quot;q&quot; = &quot;qD&quot; − &quot;nq&quot;

which is thus also an integer. But 0 &lt; ( − &quot;n&quot;) &lt; 1 so ( − &quot;n&quot;)&quot;q&quot; &lt; &quot;q&quot;. Hence ( − &quot;n&quot;)&quot;q&quot; is an integer smaller than &quot;q&quot; which multiplied by makes an integer. This is a contradiction, because &quot;q&quot; was defined to be the smallest such number. Therefore, cannot be rational.

<doc id="305336" wikidata="Q770454" url="?curid=305336" title="Augustus H. Garland">
<text>Augustus Hill Garland (June 11, 1832  – January 26, 1899) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Arkansas, who initially opposed Arkansas&#x27; secession from the United States, but later served in both houses of the Congress of the Confederate States and the United States Senate, as well as becoming the 11th governor of Arkansas (1874–1877) and the 38th attorney general of the United States (1885–1889).

==Early life==
Garland was born in Covington, Tennessee on June 11, 1832, to Rufus and Barbara () Garland. In 1830 his father owned 13 slaves, and owned a store. Following a drunken fight in which Rufus stabbed a man, the family moved to Lost Prairie in Lafayette County, Arkansas along the Red River when Augustus was one. Later that year, Rufus died, forcing Barbara and Augustus to relocate to Spring Hill, Arkansas, where she met Thomas Hubbard. In 1836, Barbara married Hubbard, a local lawyer, judge, and political candidate who owned five slaves in the 1850 census.

Garland attended Spring Hill Male Academy from 1838 to 1843. Hubbard moved the family to Washington, Arkansas, the Hempstead county seat, in 1844. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s College in Lebanon, Kentucky, and graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1849. After school, Garland returned to Arkansas and initially taught at Brownstown School in Mine Creek, Sevier County, but returned to Washington to study law with Hempstead County clerk Simon Sanders. He married Sarah Virginia Sanders on June 14, 1853; they would have nine children, four of whom survived to adulthood.

==Early legal career==

Admitted to the bar in 1853, Garland started his law practice with his stepfather. Garland moved to Little Rock in June 1856, and became a law partner to Ebenezer Cummins, a former associate of Albert Pike. When Cummins died, Garland took over his extensive practice at age 25 and took on slightly younger attorney William Randolph by 1860, who lived with Garland&#x27;s young family.

Garland owned three enslaved females in the 1860 census (two 27 years old and an 11-year-old girl), and his elder brother Rufus Garland Jr. owned 9 slaves in Hempstead County, Arkansas. Nonetheless, Augustus Garland represented the slave Abby Guy in two appeals to the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1857 and 1861, ultimately winning her freedom.

Garland became one of Arkansas&#x27;s most prominent attorneys and was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1860 with the assistance of Reverdy Johnson.

==Entry into politics==
Garland supported the Whig and American &quot;Know Nothing&quot; parties during the 1850s. Local Whigs sought Garland to run for county treasurer prior to starting his legal career, but he declined. However, Garland remained active in politics. He gave speeches for Democrat Edward A. Warren during the 1856 election for the Arkansas 2nd.

In the election of 1860, Garland was a presidential elector in the Arkansas Electoral College for the Constitutional Union Party voting for the party&#x27;s nominees of John Bell and Edward Everett.

==American Civil War==
The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States led to the secession of the Deep South states from the Union. Garland consistently opposed secession and advocated Arkansas&#x27;s continued allegiance to the United States. His elder brother Rufus raised a Confederate infantry company (the &quot;Hempstead Hornets&quot;) and accepted a captain&#x27;s commission. Augustus Garland was selected to represent Pulaski County at the 1861 secession convention in Little Rock, where he voiced his opposition. After Lincoln called for 75,000 troops from Arkansas to help suppress the Confederate States, Garland gave his support to secession.

===Confederate States Congress===
Four days after approving the secession ordinance, the convention delegates appointed Garland to the Provisional Confederate Congress, where he was the youngest member of the body. Garland was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives over Jilson P. Johnson in the 1st Confederate States Congress in 1861, where he was a member of the Committees on Public Lands, Commerce and Financial Independence, and the Judiciary. In 1862, Garland was narrowly defeated by Robert W. Johnson, who had been the incumbent in the United States Senate, for a seat in the Confederate States Senate, with the twelfth ballot going 46-42.

He was reelected to the Confederate House of Representatives in 1863, where he was now serving alongside his brother Rufus. In 1864 was appointed to the Confederate States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Charles B. Mitchel in a close vote against Albert Pike. As a Congressman, he made efforts to establish a Supreme Court of the Confederate States and supported President Jefferson Davis, with the exception of Davis&#x27; aside suspending the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for the duration of the war (as had Lincoln in the North). He returned to Arkansas in February 1865, when it was clear the Confederacy was about to lose so that he could help facilitate the transition of power from exiled Confederate governor Harris Flanagin to Isaac Murphy with General Joseph J. Reynolds, and the return of his state to the Union.

==Postwar==

===&quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;===
Not long after the Civil War ended, President Andrew Johnson pardoned Garland on July 15, 1865. He was nonetheless forbidden to resume his legal practice without taking the Ironclad Oath, which the United States Congress had required of all Confederate government or military officials, per a law passed on January 24, 1865. In &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;, Garland argued that the law was unconstitutional and &quot;ex post facto&quot;. On January 14, 1867, by a vote of five to four, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed. The ruling caused considerable uproar in the north, but former Confederates hoped that the judicial system could be used to prevent the implementation of Congressional Reconstruction.

===Political career===

Arkansas legislators elected him to the United States Senate for a term beginning in 1867 but was not allowed to take the seat because Arkansas had not yet been readmitted to the Union. Garland knew the election was &quot;a doubtful, if not an empty offer&quot;. While in Washington DC attempting to be seated in the Senate, Garland worked behind the scenes to push the Supreme Court to hear the case of &quot;Mississippi v. Johnson&quot; which challenged the constitutionality of the Reconstruction Acts; however, the Court refused.

Garland had established himself as a key player in Arkansas politics, a strong conservative capable of working with the federal government, and widely recognized as a sharp legal mind. However, Garland was most noted by contemporaries for strong advantages he held in the political sphere: pragmatic, plain-spoken, and informal, yet brilliant and well-networked with national political figures from around the country. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, Garland recognized the changing political winds and withdrew from public participation in politics during early Reconstruction. Between 1868 and 1872, as he resumed his legal practice, Garland observed politics from a distance and used his influence behind the scenes, only rising to speak against the 1868 Arkansas Constitution. Following ratification of the new constitution in April 1868, Democrats were faced with the choice to take a &quot;voter&#x27;s oath&quot; or be ineligible for state office. Garland and others worked within the Democratic Party of Arkansas to make the choice to take the oath and fight the Republicans at the ballot box in November 1868. Garland in 1869 helped found the Southern Historical Society and gathered papers of Arkansas Confederate veterans. He worked to repay debts incurred from &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;, which cost him $1,760 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) and $750 from time in Washington ($ in today&#x27;s dollars), all while fielding questions about his inactivity in the public sphere. During this time, he partnered in his law practice for several years with Sterling R. Cockrill, who would later become Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

In 1872, with the Republican Party split into three factions, Arkansas Democrats sought Garland to help elect Democrats into the state legislature and had been considered for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. While he was willing to help fight Congressional Reconstruction and Republican rule in Arkansas, Garland sought to avoid engaging in &quot;fruitless&quot; political efforts while his personal finances recovered. He declined seeking the 1872 gubernatorial nomination given the low annual salary ($2500, or $ in today&#x27;s dollars) and that the position was viewed to be below his political stature.
During the conflict known as the Brooks-Baxter War, Garland became a primary strategist for Governor Elisha Baxter and served as deputy secretary of state. Though Baxter and Joseph Brooks were both Republicans, Baxter was more sympathetic to the Redeemers, unreconstructed Democrats and Confederate veterans seeking to repudiate the Radical Republicans. After Baxter was evicted from the Old State House on April 15, 1874, Baxter went with U. M. Rose, Henry C. Caldwell, Freeman W. Compton, and others to visit Garland at his home at 1404 Scott Street around midnight to strategize a return to power. The following day, Baxter declared martial law in Pulaski County and gave an address to the people urging a rally at the capitol. Garland organized, as president of the Little Rock Bar, a resolution of many prominent attorneys condemning Judge Whytock&#x27;s order that elevated Brooks to the governor&#x27;s mansion. Garland took up residence at Anthony House for the next three weeks to help manage the Baxter effort. Garland&#x27;s plan to engage President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant to call for a special meeting of the newly-Democratic Arkansas General Assembly to resolve the matter led to a win for Baxter, who recommended a state constitutional convention in 1874. Garland read the proclamation from Grant endorsing the General Assembly&#x27;s restoration of Baxter to a throng in front of the Anthony House to applause. Baxter began re-appointing officeholders from pre-Civil War and the Confederate government; a political realignment had taken place, ending Reconstruction in Arkansas and returning the state to Democratic control.

Following the drafting of a new constitution, an election was held for voters to ratify the new constitution and elect a slate of officers to serve under it, if approved. At the three-day Democratic state convention beginning September 8, 1874, Baxter was twice nominated as gubernatorial candidate but refused to accept both times. Garland was nominated by a unanimous vote over various favorite son nominees, which were withdrawn. Republicans did not nominate candidates in protest, believing the election was illegal and appealing to the United States Congress to declare the 1868 constitution the law of the land. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Garland received almost unanimous support to become Arkansas&#x27;s 11th governor.

===Governor of Arkansas===
Garland was faced with a number of problems after taking office as Governor including turmoil in the state over threatening groups like the Ku Klux Klan, an ongoing congressional investigation over the Brooks-Baxter conflict and the state debt of $17,000,000. With help from the finance board, the debt was significantly lowered in two years time. Garland was a strong supporter of better education. He urged the legislature to establish schools for the blind and deaf, successfully advocated in appointing a new president for the Arkansas Industrial University, today the University of Arkansas, and helped found the Branch Normal College, today the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, which made education more accessible for African-Americans. Under his administration, he also oversaw the creation of the Arkansas Bureau of Statistics and the Arkansas Bureau of Agriculture, Mining and Manufacturing.

===United States Senate===
Garland ran successfully for the United States Senate in 1876, thus succeeded Republican Powell Clayton. Voters re-elected him in 1883. In the Senate, he served as a member of the Committees on Public Lands, the Territories and the Judiciary, serving as chairman of the Territories Committee in the 46th Congress. As a Senator, he made efforts to bring about tariff reform, internal improvements, as well as the regulation of interstate commerce and a federal prison system, federal aid to education and civil service reform.

===Attorney General of the United States===
Garland resigned from the Senate in 1885 after accepting the appointment of Attorney General of the United States by newly elected President Grover Cleveland, becoming the first Arkansan to receive a cabinet post.

Not long after taking office, Garland became embroiled in a political scandal. While serving in the Senate, Garland became a shareholder in and attorney for the Pan-Electric Telephone Company which was organized to form regional telephone companies using equipment developed by J. Harris Rogers. The Bell Telephone Company brought suit against Pan-Electric for patent infringement after it was discovered that their equipment was similar to that of Bell&#x27;s. Garland was ordered to bring a suit in the name of the United States to invalidate the Bell patent, breaking their monopoly of telephone technology, but refused to do so. However, while Garland was on vacation in the summer, Solicitor General John Goode authorized the suit.

A year-long congressional investigation and constant public attention affected his work as Attorney General, however, despite having to serve under a cloud of suspicion, he was supported by President Cleveland. Garland was also the first, and to date only, United States cabinet secretary to be censured by Congress when, in 1886, Garland failed to provide documents about the firing of a United States Attorney.

==Later life and death==
President Cleveland lost reelection to Benjamin Harrison in the 1888 election and Garland left office at the end of Cleveland&#x27;s term in 1889. He resumed practicing law in Washington, D.C., and published a number of books, including &quot;The Constitution As It Is&quot; (1880), &quot;Experience in the Supreme Court of the United States, with Some Reflections and Suggestions as to that Tribunal&quot; (1883), &quot;Third-Term Presidential&quot; (1896), &quot;Experience in the Supreme Court of the United States&quot; (1898) and &quot; Treatise on the Constitution and Jurisdiction of the United States Courts&quot; (1898). On January 26, 1899, while arguing a case before the Supreme Court, Garland suffered a stroke and died a few hours later in the Capitol. He was interred at Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

<doc id="305339" wikidata="Q197430" url="?curid=305339" title="Zhao (state)">
<text>Zhao () was one of the seven major states during the Warring States period of ancient China. It emerged from the tripartite division of Jin, along with Han and Wei, in the 5th century BC. Zhao gained considerable strength from the military reforms initiated during the reign of King Wuling, but suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Qin at the Battle of Changping. Its territory included areas in the modern provinces of Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi and Shaanxi. It bordered the states of Qin, Wei, and Yan, as well as various nomadic peoples including the Hu and Xiongnu. Its capital was Handan, in modern Hebei province.

Zhao was home to the administrative philosopher Shen Dao, Confucian Xun Kuang, and Gongsun Long, who is affiliated to the school of names.

== Origins and ascendancy ==
The Zhao clan within Jin had been accumulating power for centuries, including annexing the Baidi state of Dai in the mid-5th 

At the end of the Spring and Autumn period, Jin was divided between three powerful ministers, one of whom was Zhao Xiangzi, patriarch of the Zhao family. In 403 BC, the Zhou king formally recognised the existence of the Zhao state along with two other states, Han and Wei. Some historians, beginning with Sima Guang, take this recognition to mark the beginning of the Warring States period.

At the beginning of the Warring States period, Zhao was one of the weaker states. Despite its extensive territory, its northern border was frequently harassed by the Eastern Hu, Forest Hu, Loufan, Xiongnu, and other northern nomadic peoples. Zhao lacked the military might of Wei or the wealth of Qi, and became a pawn in the struggle between them. This struggle came to a head in 354 BC when Wei invaded Zhao, forcing Zhao to seek help from Qi. The resulting Battle of Guiling was a major victory for Qi, reducing the threat to Zhao&#x27;s southern border.

Zhao remained relatively weak until the military reforms of King Wuling of Zhao (325–299 BC). Zhao soldiers were ordered to dress like their Hu neighbours and to replace war chariots with cavalry archers (). This reform proved to be a brilliant and pragmatic strategy. With the advanced technology of the Chinese states and tactics of the steppe nomads, Zhao&#x27;s cavalry became a powerful force. As a result, the newly empowered Zhao were more evenly matched with their greatest threat, Qi.

Zhao demonstrated its increased military prowess by conquering the state of Zhongshan in 295 BC after a protracted war and annexing territory from the neighbouring states of Wei, Yan, and Qin. During this time, Zhao cavalry also occasionally intruded into Qi during latter campaigns against Chu.

Several brilliant military commanders of the period served Zhao contemporaneously, including Lian Po, Zhao She, and Li Mu. Lian Po was instrumental in defending Zhao against Qin. Zhao She was most active in the east, leading the invasion of Yan. Li Mu defended Zhao against the Xiongnu in the Zhao–Xiongnu War and later against Qin.

==Fall of Zhao==

By the end of the Warring States period, Zhao was the only state strong enough to oppose the mighty Qin. An alliance with Wei against Qin began in 287 BC, but ended in defeat at Huayang in 273 BC. The struggle then culminated in the bloodiest battle of the entire period, the Battle of Changping in 260 BC. Zhao&#x27;s forces were utterly defeated by Qin. Although the forces of Wei and Chu saved Handan from a subsequent siege by the victorious Qin, Zhao would never recover from the enormous loss of troops in the battle.

In 229 BC, invasions led by the Qin general Wang Jian were resisted by Li Mu and his subordinate officer Sima Shang () until 228 BC. Li Mu was one of the finest generals of the Warring States period, and although he was unable to defeat Wang Jian (also one of the best generals of the period), Wang Jian was unable to make any headway. The invasion ended in a stalemate. The Qin emperor, Qin Shihuang, realised that he needed to get rid of Li Mu in order to conquer Zhao, and tried to sow discord among the Zhao leadership. The Zhao king Youmiu fell for the plot: on the false advice of disloyal court officials and Qin infiltrators, he ordered Li Mu&#x27;s execution and relieved Sima Shang of his duties. Li Mu&#x27;s replacement, Zhao Cong, was promptly defeated by Wang Jian. Qin captured King Youmiu and defeated Zhao in 228 BC. Prince Jia, half-brother of King Qian, was proclaimed King Jia at Dai and led the last Zhao forces against the Qin. This regime lasted until 222 BC, when the Qin army captured him and defeated his forces at Dai.

A rebel named Wu Chen, following the example of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in Chu, proclaimed himself King of Zhao. Wu was later killed by his subordinate Li Liang (), Zhang Er () and Chen Yu (), former officials of Zhao, created the Zhao royal Zhao Xie () as King of Zhao. In 206 BC, the rebel lord Xiang Yu of Chu defeated the Qin dynasty and made himself and seventeen other lords kings, appointing Zhao Xie the king of Dai. Chen Yu helped Zhao Xie reclaim the land of Zhao from Zhang Er, so Zhao Xie created Chen Yu as Prince of Dai. In 205 BC, Chen Yu&#x27;s subordinate in Dai, Xia Yue (), was defeated by Liu Bang&#x27;s generals Han Xin and Zhang Er. Chen Yu was defeated by Han Xin in 204 BC, and later Zhao Xie was killed by Han forces. Liu Bang gave the state of Zhao to Zhang Er.

In 154 BC, an unrelated Zhao, led by Prince of Zhao Liu Sui (), participated in the unsuccessful Rebellion of the Seven States () against the newly installed sixth emperor of the Han dynasty.

==Culture and society==
Before Qin Shi Huang unified China in 221 BC, each region had its own customs and culture, although elite culture was identical throughout. In the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; (Tribute of Yu) chapter of the Book of Documents – probably written in the 4th century BC – China is described as divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive peoples and products. The central theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state through the travels of the eponymous sage, Yu the Great, and the sending of each region&#x27;s unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional differences in culture and physical environment.

One such text was &quot;Wuzi&quot; (The Book of Master Wu), a military treatise of the Warring States, written in response to a request from Marquis Wu of Wei for advice on how to deal with the other states. Wu Qi, to whom work is attributed, explained that the government and nature of the people are linked to the physical environment and territory in which they live.

Of Zhao, he said:

<doc id="305342" wikidata="Q467672" url="?curid=305342" title="William Langland">
<text>William Langland (; ; ) is the presumed author of a work of Middle English alliterative verse generally known as &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, an allegory with a complex variety of religious themes. The poem translated the language and concepts of the cloister into symbols and images that could be understood by a layman.

== Life ==
Little is known of Langland himself. It seems that he was born in the West Midlands of England around 1330, according to internal evidence in &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. The narrator in &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; receives his first vision while sleeping in the Malvern Hills (between Herefordshire and Worcestershire), which suggests some connection to the area. The dialect of the poem is also consistent with this part of the country. &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; was written &quot;c.&quot; 1377, as the character&#x27;s imagination says he has followed him for &quot;five and forty winters.&quot;

A fifteenth-century note in the Dublin manuscript of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; says that Langland was the son of Stacy de Rokayle.

Langland is believed to have been born in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, although Ledbury, Herefordshire, and Great Malvern, Worcestershire also have strong claims to being his birthplace. There is a plaque to that effect in the porch of Cleobury Mortimer&#x27;s parish church, which also contains a memorial window, placed in 1875, depicting the &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; vision. Langland is thought to have been a novice of Woodhouse Friary located nearby.

There are strong indications that Langland died in 1385 or 1386. A note written by &quot;Iohan but&quot; (John But) in a fourteenth-century manuscript of the poem (Rawlinson 137) makes direct reference to the death of its author: &quot;whan this werke was wrouyt, ere Wille myte aspie/ Deth delt him a dent and drof him to the erthe/ And is closed vnder clom&quot; (&quot;once this work was made, before Will was aware/ Death struck him a blow and knocked him to the ground/ And now he is buried under the soil&quot;). According to Edith Rickert, John But himself seems to have died in 1387, indicating that Langland died shortly before this date. Nonetheless some scholars believe Langland was the author of a 1399 work, Richard the Redeless.

Most of what is believed about Langland has been reconstructed from &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. The C text of the poem contains a passage in which the narrator describes himself as a &quot;loller&quot; or &quot;idler&quot; living in the Cornhill area of London, and refers to his wife and child, who are respectively named Katherine and Nicolette. It also suggests that he was well above average height and made a living reciting prayers for the dead in chantries at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. However, the distinction between allegory and reality in &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; is blurred, and the entire passage, as Wendy Scase observes, is reminiscent of the false confession tradition in medieval literature (also seen in the &quot;Confessio Goliae&quot; and in Jean de Meun&#x27;s &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;).

A similar passage in the final Passus of the B and C texts provides further ambiguous details on the poet&#x27;s wife and his torments by Elde (Old Age), including baldness, gout, and impotence. This may indicate that the poet had reached middle age by the 1370s, but the accuracy of the passage is called into question by the conventional nature of the description (see, for instance, Walter Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Aige&quot; and &quot;The Parliament of the Three Ages&quot;) and the fact that it occurs near the end of the poem, when Will&#x27;s personal development is reaching its logical conclusion.

The detailed and highly sophisticated religious knowledge displayed in the poem indicates that Langland had some connection to the clergy, but the nature of this relationship is uncertain. The poem shows no obvious bias towards any particular group or order of churchmen, but is even-handed in its anticlericalism. This makes it difficult to align Langland with any specific order. He is probably best regarded, John Bowers writes, as a member of &quot;that sizable group of unbeneficed clerks who formed the radical fringe of contemporary society ... the poorly shod Will is portrayed &#x27;y-robed in russet&#x27; traveling about the countryside, a crazed dissident showing no respect to his superiors&quot;. Malcolm Godden has proposed that he lived as an itinerant hermit, attaching himself to a patron temporarily and exchanging writing services for shelter and food.

Robert Crowley&#x27;s 1550 edition of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; promoted the idea that Langland was a follower of John Wycliffe. However, this conclusion is challenged by early Lollard appropriation of the Plowman figure (see, for instance, &quot;Pierce the Ploughman&#x27;s Crede&quot; and &quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot;). It is true that Langland and Wycliffe shared many concerns: Both questioned the value of indulgences and pilgrimages, promoted the use of the vernacular in preaching, attacked clerical corruption, and even advocated disendowment. However, these topics were widely discussed throughout the late 14th century and were not specifically associated with Wycliffe until after the presumed time of Langland&#x27;s death. Also, as Pamela Gradon observes, at no point does Langland echo Wycliffe&#x27;s characteristic teachings on the sacraments.

== Attribution ==
The attribution of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; to Langland rests principally on the evidence of a manuscript held at Trinity College, Dublin (MS 212). This manuscript ascribes &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; to Willielmi de Langland, son of Stacy de Rokayle, &quot;who died in Shipton-under-Wychwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire&quot;. Other manuscripts name the author as Robert or William Langland, or Wilhelms W. (most likely shorthand for William of Wychwood).

The poem itself also seems to point to Langland&#x27;s authorship. At one point, the narrator remarks: &quot;I have lived in londe [...] my name is longe wille&quot; (B XV.152). This can be taken as a coded reference to the poet&#x27;s name, in the style of much late-medieval literature (see, for instance, Villon&#x27;s acrostics in &quot;Le Testament&quot;). However, it has also been suggested that medieval scribes and readers may have understood this line as referring to a &quot;William Longwille&quot;, the pseudonym used by a Norfolk rebel in 1381.

Although there is little other evidence, Langland&#x27;s authorship has been widely accepted since the 1920s. It is not, however, entirely beyond dispute, as 21st. century work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated.

<text>Bowen Island (; ), British Columbia, is an island municipality that is part of Metro Vancouver, and within the jurisdiction of the Islands Trust. Located in Howe Sound, it is approximately wide by long, and at its closest point is about west of the mainland. There is regular ferry service from Horseshoe Bay provided by BC Ferries, and semi-regular water taxi services. The population of 4,256 is supplemented in the summer by about 1,500 visitors. It has a land area of .

== History ==

===Indigenous peoples===
The name for Bowen Island is in the Squamish language of the Squamish people. The Squamish peoples used and occupied the area around Howe Sound including Bowen Island. Areas such as Snug Cove and a few other parts of the island were used as campsites for hunting and gathering trips.

Historically they would use the warmer spring and summer months to travel to resource gathering sites and move from their permanent winter villages. Bowen Island has a traditional name in the Squamish language, Xwlíl’xhwm, translating to &quot;Fast Drumming Ground&quot;, although some authors attribute the name to the sound made by the ocean as it passes through the tiny pass between the island&#x27;s northern point and Finisterre Island. The tide rushing in and out is reminiscent of the sound of drums beating quickly. The name &quot;Kwém̓shem&quot; is used for Hood Point. Bowen is still used by people from Squamish and Musqueam for deer hunting.

Into the 20th century Bowen Island was actively used by Squamish people for deer and duck hunting, fishing and, later, wage jobs. In conversations with Vancouver archivist Major Matthews in the 1950s, August Jack Khatsahlano recalled knowing several Squamish who worked for whalers on the island at the turn of the 20th century. In a conversation with City of Vancouver archivist JA Matthews, Khatsahlano recalled deer hunting on Bowen, saying that at one time he took the biggest deer in British Columbia from the island, weighing in at .

===Post-colonization===
When Spanish explorers arrived on the west coast of Canada, they named many of the features of what is now the Strait of Georgia. Bowen Island was called Isla de Apodaca (after the Mexican town of Apodaca, in northeast Nuevo León state, which was itself named after a benevolent bishop, Salvador de Apodaca y Loreto) by the Spanish Captain José María Narváez in July, 1791. In 1860 Cpt. George Henry Richards renamed the island after Rear Admiral James Bowen, master of HMS &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;. In 1871, homesteaders began to build houses and started a brickworks, which supplied bricks to the expanding city of Vancouver. Over the years, local industry has included an explosives factory, logging, mining, and milling, but there is no heavy industry on the island at present.

===20th century===
In the first half of the 20th century, life on Bowen was dominated by a resort operated by the Terminal Steamship Company (1900-1920) and the Union Steamship Company (1920 - 1962). These companies provided steamer service to Vancouver, and the Horseshoe Bay - Bowen Island Ferry began in 1921. When the Union Steamship resort closed in the 1960s the island returned to a quiet period of slow growth. In the 1940s and 1950s, the artists&#x27; colony called Lieben was a retreat for many famous Canadian authors, artists, and intellectuals including Earle Birney, Alice Munro, Dorothy Livesay, Margaret Laurence, A.J.M. Smith, Jack Shadbolt, Eric Nicol and Malcolm Lowry, who finished his last book, October Ferry to Gabriola, there. In the 1980s, real estate pressures in Vancouver accelerated growth on Bowen and currently the local economy is largely dependent on commuters who work on the mainland in Greater Vancouver. Prior to becoming a municipality, Bowen Island was part of the Sunshine Coast Regional District, made up of small communities and municipalities.

==Commerce==

Bowen Island is served by a number of small businesses including marinas, cafes, gift shops, grocery stores, a post office, pharmacy, restaurants, electric bike rentals, kayak rentals, garden and flower shops, and a building supply yard. Bowen Island is served by First Credit Union, and by an Exchange Network ATM operated by North Shore Credit Union. Bowen Island&#x27;s commercial sector is primarily located within Snug Cove and Artisan Square. It is also served by a weekly newspaper, the Bowen Island Undercurrent.

==Transportation==

===Marine===
Bowen Island is served by three scheduled water-transportation operators:
* BC Ferries, a de facto provincial Crown corporation, offers a ferry service using the &quot;Queen of Capilano&quot; car ferry, which travels between Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Snug Cove on Bowen Island.
* English Bay Launch runs a passenger-only water taxi weekday commuter service between Snug Cove and Vancouver&#x27;s Coal Harbour, and on summer weekends runs a tourist service between Snug Cove and Vancouver&#x27;s Granville Island. This taxi service was shut down in 2018 due to the dock they used by the Parks Board on the Vancouver side being deemed unsafe.
* Cormorant Marine runs a passenger-only water taxi service providing late-night sailings between the government docks in Horseshoe Bay and in Snug Cove. In addition, weekday commuter sailings are made between Snug Cove and Horseshoe Bay, to connect with the Bowen Express Bus from downtown Vancouver.

===Land===
Public roads are maintained by the Bowen Island Municipality. There are roadside walking trails in only a few places and the terrain is hilly and winding. Private vehicles are the primary form of transportation and hitchhiking is commonplace.

Bowen Island has limited bus service on these TransLink bus routes, which are timed to meet some ferry sailings:
* Route 280 Bluewater/Snug Cove
* Route 281 Eagle Cliff/Snug Cove
* Route 282 Mount Gardner/Snug Cove (weekends and holidays only)

==Education==

The island is in the West Vancouver School District and has one public elementary school named Bowen Island Community School. High school students living in Bowen Island (grades 8 to 12) travel to West Vancouver to attend West Vancouver Secondary School, Sentinel Secondary School, or Rockridge. There is also the Island Pacific School, an International Baccalaureate middle school for grades 6 through 9. Some students also travel to West Vancouver to attend French Immersion at École Pauline Johnson. There is a public-supported home learning program, The Learning Centre, and a growing number of families also unschool. Bowen Island houses a public library in the heritage Old General Store that is also part of British Columbia&#x27;s InterLink co-operative of public libraries.

==Places of worship==
There are a number of churches on the Island. St Gerard&#x27;s Catholic Church is located on Miller Road. The United Church is situated in a timber building erected in 1932 a little further along on the same road. Also on Miller Road, nearer to Snug Cove, and meeting in Bowen Court, is Bowen Island Community Church, an affiliate of the Congregational Christian Churches in Canada. Lastly, Cates Hill Chapel is a Christian Brethren church founded in 1991. Its present building on Carter Road was opened in 1999. There are also regular meetings held by Unitarians and Quakers. Bowen Island is home to the Canadian branch of L&#x27;Abri, a communal Christian retreat centre where visitors come for self-directed study. Finally, Camp Bow-Isle is a summer camp for Christian Scientists.

There are regular Buddhist meditation sittings in both the Zen and Vipassana traditions.

<text>The M26 Pershing is a heavy tank, later designated as a medium tank, formerly used by the United States Army. It was used in the last months of World War II during the Invasion of Germany and extensively during the Korean War. The tank was named after General of the Armies John J. Pershing, who led the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War I.

The M26 was intended as a replacement of the M4 Sherman, but a prolonged development period meant that only a small number saw combat in Europe. Based on the criteria of firepower, mobility, and protection, US historian R. P. Hunnicutt ranked the Pershing behind the German Tiger II heavy tank, but ahead of the Tiger I heavy and Panther medium tanks. It was withdrawn in 1951 in favor of its improved derivative, the M46 Patton, which had a more powerful and reliable engine and advanced suspension. The lineage of the M26 continued with the M47 Patton, and was reflected in the new designs of the later M48 Patton and M60 tank.

== Production history ==

=== Development ===

The M26 was the culmination of a series of medium tank prototypes that began with the T20 in 1942, and it was a significant design departure from the previous line of U.S. Army tanks that had ended with the M4 Sherman. Several design features were tested in the prototypes. Some of these were experimental dead-ends, but many became permanent characteristics of subsequent U.S. Army tanks. This series of prototype vehicles began as medium tank project that was similar to, but more modern than the recently introduced M4 Sherman, and ended several years later as the U.S. Army&#x27;s first operational heavy tank.

==== Improving on the M4 ====

The U.S. Army&#x27;s first lineage of tanks evolved from the M1 Combat Car and progressed to the M2 Light Tank, M2 Medium Tank, M3 Lee, and finally the M4 Sherman. These tanks all had rear-mounted Continental air-cooled radial aircraft engines and a front sprocket drive. This layout required a driveshaft to pass under the turret, which increased the overall height of the tank, a characteristic shared with German tanks of World War II that also used this layout. The large diameter of the radial engines in M4 tanks added to the hull height. These features accounted for the high silhouette and large side sponsons that were characteristic of the M4 lineage.

In the spring of 1942, as the M4 Sherman was entering production, U.S. Army Ordnance began work on a follow-up tank. The T20 tank reached a mock-up stage in May 1942, and was intended as an improved medium tank to follow the M4. An earlier heavy tank, the M6, had been standardized in February 1942, but proved to be a failure. The U.S. Army had no doctrinal use for a heavy tank at the time.

==== T20 ====

The T20 was designed to have a more compact hull than the M4. The Ford GAN V-8, a lower silhouette version of the GAA engine used in later variants of the M4, had become available. The engine had originally been an effort by Ford to produce a V-12 liquid-cooled aircraft engine patterned after the Rolls-Royce Merlin, but failed to earn any aircraft orders and so was adapted as a V-8 for use in tanks; use of this lower profile engine together with the choice of a rear transmission and rear sprocket drive layout made it possible to lower the hull silhouette and eliminate the side sponsons.

The T20 was fitted with the new 76 mm M1A1 gun, the 3-inch M7 was considered too heavy at about . New stronger steels were used to create a weapon weighing about 1,200 lb (540 kg). The 3 inch front hull armor was thicker than the front armor of the M4. The glacis plate slope was similar at 46°. The T20&#x27;s overall weight was approximately the same as the M4.

The T20 used an early version of the horizontal volute spring suspension (HVSS), another improvement compared to the less robust vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) of the early versions of the M4. Later prototypes of the M26 tested a torsion bar suspension, which became the standard for future U.S. tank suspension systems.

==== T22 and T23 ====

The T22 series reverted to the M4 transmission because of problems with the early Torqmatic used in the T20. The T22E1 tested an autoloader for the main gun and eliminated the loader&#x27;s position with a small two-man turret.
Through much of 1943, there was little perceived need within the U.S. Army for a better tank than the 75 mm M4 Sherman, and so, lacking any insights from the rest of the Army as to what was needed, the Ordnance Department then took a developmental detour into electrical transmissions with the T23 series.

The electrical transmission was built by General Electric and had the engine driving a generator that powered two traction motors. The concept was similar to the drive system of the German &quot;Porsche Tiger&quot;. It had performance advantages in rough or hilly terrain, where the system could better handle the rapid changes in torque requirements.

The electrical transmission T23 was championed by the Ordnance Department during this phase of development. After the initial prototypes were built in early 1943, an additional 250 T23 tanks were produced from January to December 1944. These were the first tanks in the U.S. Army with the 76 mm M1A1 gun to go into production. However, the T23 would have required that the army adopt an entirely separate line of training, repair, and maintenance, and so was rejected for combat operations.

The primary legacy of the T23 would thus be its production cast turret, which was designed from the outset to be interchangeable with the turret ring of the M4 Sherman. The T23 turret was used on all production versions of the 76 mm M4 Sherman as the original M4 75 mm turret was found to be too small to easily mount the 76 mm M1A1 gun. The first production 76 mm M4 with the T23 turret, the M4E6, was built in the summer of 1943.

==== T25 and T26 ====
The T25 and T26 lines of tanks came into being in the midst of a heated internal debate within the U.S. Army from mid-1943 to early 1944 over the need for tanks with greater firepower and armor. A 90 mm gun mounted in a massive new turret was installed in both series. The T26 series were given additional frontal hull armor, with the glacis plate increased to . This increased the weight of the T26 series to over and decreased their mobility and durability as the engine and powertrain were not improved to compensate for the weight gain.

The T26E3 was the production version of the T26E1 with a number of minor modifications made as the result of field testing. In February 1945, the T26 was fielded in the European Theater, where its performance received early praise from Army Ordnance officials. The Army named the tank after Army General John J. Pershing when it was redesignated the M26 in March.

==== After the war ====

After World War II, some 800 M26 tanks were upgraded with improved engines, transmissions, and the improved 90mm gun M3A1. These were designated as the M26E2 and later redesignated as M46 Patton.

=== Delayed production ===
The M26 was introduced late into World War II and saw only a limited amount of combat. Tank historians, such as R. P. Hunnicutt, George Forty and Steven Zaloga, have generally agreed that the main cause of the delay in production of the M26 was opposition to the tank from the Army Ground Forces, headed by General Lesley McNair. Zaloga in particular has identified several specific factors that led both to the delay of the M26 program and limited improvements in the firepower of the M4:

; 1. 
: McNair, who was an artillery officer, had promulgated the &quot;tank destroyer doctrine&quot; in the U.S. Army. In this doctrine, tanks were primarily for infantry support and exploitation of breakthroughs. Those tactics dictated that enemy tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyer forces, which were composed of lightly armored but relatively fast vehicles carrying more powerful anti-tank guns, as well as towed versions of these anti-tank guns. Under the tank destroyer doctrine, emphasis was placed only on improving the firepower of the tank destroyers, as there was a strong bias against developing a heavy tank to take on enemy tanks. This also limited improvements in the firepower of the M4 Sherman. The US Army Ground Forces that supported this doctrine got the approval of new TD projects, one of them using the same 90 mm gun, while at the same time they were blocking tank projects.
; 2. 
: McNair established &quot;battle need&quot; criteria for acquisition of weapons in order to make best use of America&#x27;s supply line to Europe by preventing the introduction of weapons that would prove unnecessary, extravagant or unreliable on the battlefield. In his view, the introduction of a new heavy tank had problems in terms of transportation, supply, service, and reliability, and was not necessary in 1943 or early 1944. Tank development took time, and so the sudden appearance of a new tank threat could not be met quickly enough under such criteria.
; 3. 
: A sense of complacency fell upon those in charge of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was considered by the Americans to be superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75 mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to a growing awareness that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient intelligence data processing and forward thinking to understand that an arms race in tanks was in progress and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance from the rest of the army, concentrated its efforts in tank development mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. In contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British began development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank reached service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, the tank arms race was emphatically underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.
From mid-1943 to mid-1944, development of the 90 mm up-armored T26 prototype continued to proceed slowly due to disagreements within the U.S. Army about its future tank needs. The accounts of what exactly happened during this time vary by historian, but all agree that Army Ground Forces was the main source of resistance that delayed production of the T26.

In September–October 1943, a series of discussions occurred over the issue of beginning production of the T26E1, which was advocated by the head of the Armored Force, General Jacob Devers. Ordnance favored the 76 mm gun, electrical transmission T23. Theater commanders generally favored a 76 mm gun medium tank such as the T23 and were against a heavy 90 mm gun tank. However, testing of the T23 at Fort Knox had demonstrated reliability problems in the electrical transmission of which most army commanders were unaware. The new 76 mm M1A1 gun approved for the M4 Sherman seemed to address concerns about firepower against the German tanks. Although it could reliably penetrate the frontal armor of a Tiger 1 at standard ranges, all participants in the debate were, however, unaware of the inadequacy of the 76 mm gun against the frontal armor of the Panther tank, specifically its upper glacis (although its turret could still be penetrated at standard ranges), as they had not researched the effectiveness of this gun against the new German tanks, which had already been encountered in combat.
Gen. Lesley J. McNair had agreed to the production of the 76 mm M4 Sherman, and he strongly opposed the additional production of the T26E1. In the fall of 1943, he wrote this letter to Devers, responding to the latter&#x27;s advocacy of the T26E1:

General Devers pressed on with his advocacy for the T26, going over McNair&#x27;s head to General George Marshall, and, on 16 December 1943, Marshall overruled McNair and authorized the production of 250 T26E1 tanks. Then, in late December 1943, Devers was transferred to the Mediterranean, where he eventually led the invasion of Southern France with the 6th Army Group. In his absence, further attempts were made to derail the T26 program, but continued support from Generals Marshall and Eisenhower kept the production order alive. Testing and production of the T26E1 proceeded slowly, however, and the T26E1 did not begin full production until November 1944. These production models were designated as the T26E3.

A single prototype of a T26 turret mounted on an M4(105) chassis was built by Chrysler in the summer of 1944, but did not progress into production.

Hunnicutt, researching Ordnance Department documents, asserts that Ordnance requested production of 500 each of the T23, T25E1, and T26E1 in October 1943. The AGF objected to the 90 mm gun of the tanks, whereas the Armored Force wanted the 90 mm gun mounted in a Sherman tank chassis. General Devers cabled from London a request for production of the T26E1. In January 1944, 250 T26E1s were authorized. General Barnes of Ordnance continued to press for production of 1,000 tanks.

According to Forty, Ordnance recommended that 1,500 of the T26E1 be built. The Armored Force recommended only 500. The AGF rejected the 90 mm version of the tank and wanted it to be built with the 76 mm gun instead. Somehow, Ordnance managed to get production of the T26E1 started in November 1944. Forty primarily quoted from a post-war report from the Ordnance Dept.

=== Production ===

Production finally began in November 1944. Ten T26E3 tanks were produced that month at the Fisher Tank Arsenal, 30 in December, 70 in January 1945, and 132 in February. The Detroit Tank Arsenal also started production in March 1945, and the combined output was 194 tanks for that month. Production continued through the end of the war, and over 2,000 were produced by the end of 1945.

=== Super Pershing ===
The 90 mm M3 gun of the Pershing was similar to the German 88 mm KwK 36 used on the Tiger I. In an effort to match the firepower of the King Tiger&#x27;s more powerful 88 mm KwK 43, the T15E1 90 mm gun was developed and mounted in a T26E1 in January 1945. This tank was designated T26E1-1. The T15E1 gun was 73 calibers in length and had a much longer high-capacity chamber giving it a muzzle velocity of with the T30E16 APCR shot. This allowed it to penetrate up to 330mm of armor and could penetrate the Tiger&#x27;s frontal armor beyond . The model shown used single-piece ammunition and was the only Super Pershing sent to Europe. Firing trials with the T15E1 revealed that the length and weight of the single-piece ammunition made it difficult to stow inside the tank and load into the gun.

A second pilot tank was converted from a T26E3 and used a modified T15E2 gun that had two-piece ammunition. Twenty-five production models of the tank, designated T26E4, were built. An improved mounting removed the need for stabilizer springs.

Post-war, two M26 tanks had the T54 gun installed, which had the same long gun barrel, but the ammunition cartridge was designed to be shorter and fatter, while still retaining the propellant force of the original round. The tanks were designated as the M26E1 tank, but lack of funds cut off further production.

=== Post-World War II development ===

In May 1946, due to changing conceptions of the U.S. Army&#x27;s tank needs, the M26 was reclassified as a medium tank. Designed as a heavy tank, the Pershing was a significant upgrade from the M4 Sherman in terms of firepower, protection, and mobility. On the other hand, it was unsatisfactory for a medium tank (because it used the same engine that powered the M4A3, which was some ten tons lighter) and its transmission was somewhat unreliable. In 1948, the M26E2 version was developed with a new powerplant. Eventually, the new version was redesignated the M46 Patton and 1,160 M26s were rebuilt to this new standard. Thus, the M26 became a base of the Patton tank series, which replaced it in early 1950s. The M47 Patton was an M46 Patton with a modified hull front and new turret. The later M48 Patton and M60, which the former saw service later in the Vietnam War and both saw combat in various conflicts in the Middle East and still serve in active duty in many nations today, were evolutionary redesigns of the original layout set down by the Pershing.

== Combat history ==

=== World War II in Europe ===

Development of the M26 during World War II was prolonged by a number of factors, the most important being opposition to the tank from Army Ground Forces. However, the tank losses experienced in the Battle of the Bulge against a concentrated German tank force composed of some 400 Panther tanks, as well as Tiger II tanks and other German armored fighting vehicles, revealed the deficiencies in the 75 mm-gunned M4 Shermans and tank destroyers in the American units. This deficiency motivated the military to ship the tanks to Europe, and on 22 December 1944, the T26E3 tanks were ordered to be deployed to Europe.



Due to the repeated design and production delays, only 20 Pershing tanks were introduced into the European theater of operations before the Battle of the Bulge. This first shipment of Pershings arrived in Antwerp in January 1945. They were given to the 1st Army, which split them between the 3rd and 9th Armored Divisions. A total of 310 T26E3 tanks were eventually sent to Europe before VE Day, with 200 being issued to the troops. The actual number that engaged in combat is unknown.

In February 1945, Major General Gladeon M. Barnes, chief of the Research and Development Section of Army Ordnance, personally led a special team to the European Theater, called the Zebra Mission. Its purpose was to support the T26E3 tanks, which still had teething problems, as well as to test other new weapons. In March, the T26E3 tanks were redesignated as the M26.

The 3rd Armored first used the M26 to engage the enemy on 25 February near the Roer River. On 26 February, a T26E3 named &quot;Fireball&quot; was knocked out in an ambush at Elsdorf while overwatching a roadblock. Silhouetted by a nearby fire, the Pershing was in a disadvantageous position. A concealed Tiger tank fired three shots from about . The first penetrated the turret through the machine gun port in the mantlet, killing both the gunner and the loader. The second shot hit the gun barrel, causing the round that was in the chamber to fire with the effect of distorting the barrel. The last shot glanced off the turret side, taking off the upper cupola hatch. While backing up to escape, the Tiger became entangled in debris and was abandoned by the crew. &quot;Fireball&quot; was quickly repaired and returned to service on 7 March.

Shortly afterwards, also at Elsdorf, another T26E3 knocked out a Tiger I and two Panzer IVs. The Tiger was knocked out at with the 90-mm HVAP T30E16 ammunition. Photographs of this knocked out Tiger I in Hunnicutt&#x27;s book showed a penetration through the lower gun shield.

On 6 March, just after the 3rd Armored Division had entered the city of Cologne, a famous tank duel took place. A Panther tank on the street in the front of Cologne Cathedral was lying in wait for enemy tanks. Two M4 Shermans were supporting infantry and came up on the same street as the Panther. They ended up stopping just before the Cathedral because of rubble in the street and did not see the enemy Panther. The lead Sherman was knocked out, killing three of the five crew. A T26E3, nicknamed &quot;Eagle 7&quot;, was in the next street over and was called over to engage the Panther. What happened next was described by the T26E3 gunner Cpl. Clarence Smoyer:

Four of the Panther&#x27;s crew were able to successfully bail out of the stricken tank before it was destroyed. The action was recorded by a Signal Corps cameraman T/Sgt. Jim Bates.

On the same day, another T26E3 was knocked out in the town of Niehl near Cologne, by a rarely-seen &quot;Nashorn&quot; 88 mm tank destroyer, at a range of under . There were two other tank engagements involving the T26E3, with one Tiger I knocked out during the fighting around Cologne, and one Panzer IV knocked out at Mannheim.

The T26E3s with the 9th Armored Division saw action in fighting around the Roer River with one Pershing disabled by two hits from a German 150 mm field gun.

A platoon of five M26s, less one that was being serviced, played a key role in helping Combat Command B of the 9th Armored capture the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on 7–8 March 1945, providing fire support to the infantry in order to take the bridgehead before the Germans could blow it up. In encounters with Tigers and Panthers, the M26 performed well. Some of the division&#x27;s other tanks were able to cross the bridge, but the T26E3s were too large and heavy to cross the damaged bridge and had to wait five days before getting across the river by barge. Europe&#x27;s bridges were in general not designed for heavy loads, which had been one of the original objections to sending a heavy tank to Europe.

==== Super Pershing in Europe ====
A single Super Pershing was shipped to Europe and given additional armor to the gun mantlet and front hull by the maintenance unit before being assigned to one of the tank crews of the 3rd Armored Division. The new gun on the Super Pershing could pierce of armor at . The front hull was given two 38 mm steel boiler plates, bringing the front up to 38+38+102 mm of armor. The plates were applied at a greater slope than the underlying original hull plate. The turret had 80 mm thick rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) from a Panther upper glacis welded to the mantlet, covering the front. This added about five tonnes to the tank weight, requiring extra armor added to the turret for balance.

An account of the combat actions of this tank appeared in the war memoir &quot;Another River, Another Town&quot;, by John P. Irwin, who was the tank gunner. Zaloga described three actions in his book. On 4 April, between Weser and Nordheim, the Super Pershing engaged and destroyed a German tank, or something resembling a tank, at a range of . According to Zaloga, it is possible this vehicle was a Jagdpanther from the 507th Heavy Panzer Battalion. On 12 April, the Super Pershing claimed a German tank of unknown type. On 21 April, the Super Pershing was involved in a short-range tank duel with a German tank, which it knocked out with a shot to the belly. Irwin described this German tank as a Tiger, but Zaloga was skeptical of this claim. The tank was likely a Panzer IV. After the war, the single Super Pershing in Europe was last photographed in a vehicle dump in Kassel, Germany, and was most likely scrapped.

=== Use in Okinawa ===
In May 1945, as fierce fighting continued on the island of Okinawa, and M4 tank losses mounted, plans were made to ship the M26 Pershing tanks to that battle. On 31 May 1945, a shipment of 12 M26 Pershing tanks were dispatched to the Pacific for use in the Battle of Okinawa. Due to a variety of delays, the tanks were not completely offloaded on the beach at Naha, Okinawa until 4 August. By then, fighting on Okinawa had come to an end, and VJ Day followed on 2 September 1945.

=== Use in the Korean War ===



At the outbreak of the Korean War, only four tank companies equipped with the M24 Chaffee were operational under the U.S. Far East Command. In July 1950, when the M24 was revealed ineffective against North Korean tanks such as the T-34-85, the U.S. military hurriedly began to mobilize medium-sized tanks to deal with them. The Far East Command urgently maintained three M26 tanks, which were left unattended at the Tokyo ordnance depot, and organized into a provisional tank platoon, commanded by Lieutenant Samuel Fowler, and deployed them to the Korean Peninsula. However, while defending Jinju on 31 July, all of these tanks experienced engine overheating and became immobilized due to insufficient maintenance on belts and cooling fans, and eventually all of them were self-destructed.

Around the same time, various tank battalions of the Army and a tank company from the 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, which were all fully organized armored training units, were dispatched to the Korean Peninsula along with the M26 Pershing tank. The 70th Tank Battalion at Fort Knox Kentucky had pulled World War II memorial M26s off of pedestals and reconditioned them for use, but had to fill out two companies with M4A3s. The 72nd Tank Battalion at Fort Lewis Washington and the 73rd Tank Battalion at Fort Benning Georgia were fully equipped with M26s. The 89th Medium Tank Battalion was constituted in Japan with three companies of reconditioned M4A3s and one of M26s from various bases in the Pacific; due to the shortage of M26s, most regimental tank companies had M4A3 Shermans instead. Two battalions detached from the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood Texas, the 6th Medium and 64th Heavy Tank Battalions, were fully equipped with M46 Patton tanks. The 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton California had all M4A3 howitzer tanks, which were replaced with M26s just days before boarding ships for Korea.

On 17 August, one M26 of the U.S. Marine Tank Company destroyed three T-34-85s of the 109th Tank Regiment of the North Korean army in a few minutes during their first contact at Obong-ri, Changnyeong. Then, during the Battle of the Bowling Alley, M26s of the 73rd Tank Battalion, which supported the ROK 1st Infantry Division during the Battle of Tabu-dong, destroyed 13 T-34-85 tanks and five SU-76M self-propelled guns. A total of 309 M26 tanks were fielded on the Korean Peninsula by the end of 1950, and 29 North Korean tanks were defeated by them during the same period. Although it had better anti-tank capability than the M4A3E8 thanks to its 90 mm gun, its underpowered engine which wasn&#x27;t well suited to Korea&#x27;s mountainous terrain, and its tendency to overheat quickly made it less liked among crews, and most were thus temporarily withdrawn in favor of the more reliable &quot;Easy Eight&quot; Sherman. The M26 tank was then gradually replaced by or upgraded in standards to the new M46 tank in 1951 due to its chronic lack of mobility as the war evolved into battles between mountains.

A 1954 survey concluded that there were in all 119, mostly small scale, tank vs. tank actions involving U.S. Army and Marine units during the Korean War, with 97 T-34-85 tanks knocked out and another 18 probables. The M4A3E8 was involved in 50% of the tank actions, the M26 in 32%, and the M46 in 10%. The M26/M46 proved to be an overmatch for the T-34-85 as its 90 mm HVAP round could – at point blank range – punch all the way through the T-34 from the front glacis armor to the back, whereas the T-34-85 had difficulty penetrating the armor of the M26 or M46. The M4A3E8, firing 76 mm HVAP rounds that were widely available during the Korean War (unlike World War II), was a closer match to the T-34-85 as both tanks could destroy each other at normal combat ranges.

After November 1950, North Korean armor was rarely encountered. China entered the conflict in February 1951 with four regiments of tanks (a mix of mostly T-34-85 tanks, with a few IS-2 tanks, and some other AFVs). However, because these Chinese tanks were dispersed with the infantry, tank to tank battles with UN forces were uncommon.

With the marked decrease in tank-to-tank actions, the automotive deficiencies of the M26 in the mountainous Korean terrain became more of a liability, so some M26s were withdrawn from Korea during 1951 and replaced with M4A3 Shermans and M46 Pattons. The M45 howitzer tank variant was only used by the assault gun platoon of the 6th Medium Tank Battalion, and these six vehicles were withdrawn by January 1951.

== Europe ==

After the end of World War II, U.S. Army units on occupation duty in Germany were converted into constabulary units, a quasi-police force designed to control the flow of refugees and black marketing; combat units were converted to light motorized units and spread throughout the U.S. occupation zone. By the summer of 1947, the army required a combat reserve to back up the thinly spread constabulary; in the following year, the 1st Infantry Division was reconstituted and consolidated, containing three regimental tank companies and a divisional tank battalion. The 1948 tables of organization and equipment for an infantry division included 123 M26 Pershing tanks and 12 M45 howitzer tanks. In the summer of 1951, three more infantry divisions and the 2nd Armored Division were sent to West Germany as a part of the NATO Augmentation Program. While M26 Pershings disappeared from Korea during 1951, tank units deploying to West Germany were equipped with them, until replaced with M47 Pattons during 1952–53. The 1952–53 tables of organization and equipment for an infantry division included 135 M47 Patton tanks replacing M26s and M46s.

In 1952, the Belgian Army received 423 M26 and M26A1 Pershings, leased free of charge as part of a Mutual Defense Assistance Program, then the official designation of U.S. military aid to its allies. The tanks were mostly used to equip mobilizable reserve units of battalion strength: 2nd, 3rd and 4th &quot;Régiments de Guides&quot;/&quot;Regiment Gidsen&quot; (Belgian units have official names in both French and Dutch); 7th, 9th and 10th &quot;Régiments de Lanciers&quot;/&quot;Regiment Lansiers&quot; and finally the 2nd, 3rd and 5th &quot;Bataillon de Tanks Lourds&quot;/&quot;Bataljon Zware Tanks&quot;. However, in the spring of 1953, M26s for three months equipped the 1st Heavy Tank Battalion of the 1st Infantry Division, an active unit, before they were replaced by M47s.

In 1961, the number of reserve units was reduced, and the reserve system reorganized, with the M26s equipping the 1st and 3rd &quot;Escadron de Tanks&quot;/&quot;Tank Escadron&quot; as a general reserve of the infantry arm. In 1969, all M26s were phased out.

As the U.S. Army units in West Germany reequipped with M47s in 1952–1953, France and Italy also received M26 Pershings; while France quickly replaced them with M47 Pattons, Italy continued to use them operationally through 1963.

== Variants ==

* M26 (T26E3). M3 gun with double-baffle muzzle brake. Main production model.
* M26A1. M3A1 gun with bore evacuator and single-baffle muzzle brake.
* T26E4 (T26E4 Pilot Prototype Number 1). Often mistakenly called the &quot;T26E1-1&quot; due to having been based on that vehicle. The T26E1-1 was the first pilot of the T26E1. This single tank was later converted into the first pilot of the T26E4, a process which involved replacing the main gun with a T15E1 gun with single piece ammo and fitted with large exterior stabilizer springs. After arriving in Europe, it was attached with extra armor plates taken from destroyed Panther tanks. (used in combat).
* T26E4. Experimental version armed with a long T15E2 gun with two-part ammunition; improved mounting removed the need for external springs.
* M26E1. longer T54 gun with single-part ammunition. (post war)
* M26E2. New engine and transmission and M3A1 gun. Reclassified as the M46 Patton. (post war)
* T26E2, eventually standardized for use as the Medium Tank M45—a close support vehicle with a 105 mm howitzer (74 rounds).
* T26E5. Prototype with thicker armor—a maximum of 279 mm— based on the experience of the heavily armored assault tank M4A3E2.

== Operators ==
* 
* : A number of M26s were transferred from withdrawing U.S. troops after the Korean War.
* : Received one through the Lend-Lease program; this was allegedly a T26 model
* : Received twelve through the Lend-Lease program, presumably six T26 and six T26E3

<doc id="305352" wikidata="Q2299060" url="?curid=305352" title="Vocalese">
<text>Vocalese is a style of jazz singing in which words are added to an instrumental soloist&#x27;s improvisation.

==Definition==
Vocalese uses recognizable lyrics that are sung to pre-existing instrumental solos, as opposed to scat singing, which uses nonsense words such as &quot;bap ba dee dot bwee dee&quot; in solos. In the &quot;first wave&quot; of vocalese creation, that sometimes took the form of a tribute to the original instrumentalist. The word &quot;vocalese&quot; is a play on the musical term &quot;vocalise&quot;; the suffix &quot;-ese&quot; is meant to indicate a sort of language. The term was attributed by Jon Hendricks to the jazz critic Leonard Feather to describe the first Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross album, &quot;Sing a Song of Basie&quot;. 

Most vocalese lyrics are entirely syllabic, as opposed to melismatic. That may lead to the use of many words sung quickly in a given phrase, especially in the case of bebop.

==Notable vocalese performers==
King Pleasure recorded several pioneering examples of vocalese beginning in 1949. Vocalese&#x27;s best-known practitioners and popularisers are Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, consisting of Jon Hendricks, Dave Lambert and Annie Ross. Other performers known for vocalese include Bob Dorough, Eddie Jefferson, Giacomo Gates, Kurt Elling, Al Jarreau, Mark Murphy, Roger Miller, New York Voices, The Royal Bopsters and The Manhattan Transfer, whose Grammy-winning version of Weather Report&#x27;s &quot;Birdland&quot; featured lyrics by Jon Hendricks. In 1990, Hendricks released &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot;, a vocalese rendition of the Miles Davis song, which featured Jarreau, George Benson, and Bobby McFerrin. 

Joni Mitchell recorded lyrics to Charles Mingus&#x27;s tunes, with &quot;The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot; on her album, &quot;Mingus&quot;, in 1979.

Vocalese singers around the world include Les Double Six, popular in the 1960s, and in Canada, Emilie-Claire Barlow.

Some performers, notably Slim Gaillard, Harry Gibson, Cab Calloway, and Leo Watson, combine vocalese improvisations with scat singing.

<doc id="305365" wikidata="Q1778315" url="?curid=305365" title="Koenraad Elst">
<text>Koenraad Elst (; born 7 August 1959) is a Flemish author, known primarily for his adherence to the Hindutva ideology and support of the Out of India theory, which is regarded as pseudo-historical by mainstream scholarship. Scholars accuse him of harboring Islamophobia.

==Early life and education==
Elst was born into a Flemish Catholic family.

He graduated in Indology, Sinology and philosophy from the Catholic University of Leuven. During his student days, he was involved with Flemish nationalism. Between 1988 and 1992, Elst was at the Banaras Hindu University. In 1999, he received a PhD in Asian Studies from Leuven on Hindu revivalism; his doctoral dissertation was published as &quot;Decolonizing the Hindu Mind&quot;. Prema Kurien notes Elst to be unique among Hindutva-leaning scholars in that he had a relevant academic degree.

==Works==
===Indigenous Aryan theories===
In two books, &quot;Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate&quot; (1999) and &quot;Asterisk in Bhāropīyasthān&quot; (2007), Elst argues against the academically accepted view that the Indo-European languages originated in the Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes and that the migrations to Indian subcontinent in the second millennium BCE brought a proto-Indo-European language with them. He instead proposes that the language originated in India and it spread to Middle East and Europe when the Aryans, (who were indigenous) migrated out. According to Elst, the linguistic data are a soft type of evidence and are compatible with a variety of scenarios. The dominant linguistic theories may be compatible with an out-of-India scenario for Indo-European expansion.

One of the few authors to use paleolinguistics, he is deemed as one of the leading proponents of the Indigenous Aryans (Out of India fringe theory). The theory has been rejected by the scholarly community and is not deemed as a serious competitor to the Kurgan hypothesis, except by some authors in India. He has also written against the Aryan Invasion Theory defending the Out of India fringe theory in a blog piece for Indian diaspora think tank, Bridge India.

===Hindutva and Islamophobia===
Elst was an editor of the New Right Flemish nationalist journal &quot;Teksten, Kommentaren en Studies&quot; from 1992 to 1995, focusing on criticism of Islam and had associations with Vlaams Blok, a Flemish nationalist far-right political party. He has also been a regular contributor to &quot;The Brussels Journal&quot;, a controversial conservative blog. 

In &quot;Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid&quot;, Elst makes the case for the birthplace of Rama, the Hindu god/king to correspond with the site of Babri Masjid and concurrently portrays Islam as a fanatic bigoted faith. The book was published by Voice of India, a publication house that is self-describedly devoted to furthering the Hindu nationalist cause and had attracted immense criticism for publishing anti-Muslim literature in abundance. It was though praised by L. K. Advani, former deputy Prime Minister of India, who commanded an important role in the demolition of the said masjid. In &quot;Ayodhya and After&quot; (1991), Elst was even more explicit in the support of the demolition and termed it an exercise in national integration which provided &quot;an invitation to the Muslim Indians to reintegrate themselves into the society and culture from which their ancestors were cut off by fanatical rulers and their thought police, the theologians&quot;. In another interview, Elst went on to claim that it was a justified act of revenge which enforced fears of Hindu repercussion, thus curtailing Muslim violence. He though has retrospectively rejected the use of violent force in the demolition of the temple and has urged the Muslims to contend with the construction of a peace monument.

An intellectual heir of the school of thought championed by Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel— the founders of the Voice of India, who were themselves highly critical of both Christianity and Islam—Elst is a prominent author of the house and adopts their hard-line stance against the two religions in his book. Elst argues that there existed an &quot;universal spirituality&quot; among all the races and faiths, prior to the introduction of &quot;Semitic&quot; faiths which corrupted it. In &quot;Decolonizing the Hindu Mind&quot;, he contends that the &quot;need for &#x27;reviving&#x27; Hinduism spring from the fact that the said hostile ideologies (mostly Islam) have managed to eliminate Hinduism physically in certain geographical parts and social segments of India, and also (mostly the Western ideologies) to neutralize the Hindu spirit among many nominal Hindus.&quot;

He is a vocal proponent of Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist movement which is typically associated with the Indian far-right and supports the Bharatiya Janata Party. Elst perceives Hindutva as a tool to decolonize the mental and cultural state of Indians and return to the past days of (supposed) Hindu glory. He has written in support of the view that the Vedic science was highly advanced and may be only understood by a Hindu mystic. &quot;The Saffron Swastika&quot; is widely regarded to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, which argues against the idea that the brand of Hindutva practiced by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) / Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are fascist in ideology. Advani had high regards for the work, terming Elst as a &#x27;great historian&#x27; and even carried a &quot;heavily marked&quot; copy of the book from which he freely quoted the passages that discussed him.

In other essays and conferences, Elst has supported for outright attacks on the &quot;enemy&quot; ideology of Islam which, in his opinion, is supposedly inseparable with terrorism and hence, must be destructed. He calls for an Indian-ization of Muslims and Christians by forcing them to accept the supremacy of Hindu culture and terms it as the &quot;Final Solution for the Muslim Problem&quot;. In his 1992 book, &quot;Negationism in India: Concealing the Record of Islam&quot;, Elst attempts to demonstrate that there exists a prohibition of criticism of Islam in India and accuses &quot;secular historians&quot; (including the likes of Romila Thapar, Bipan Chandra, Ram Sharan Sharma et al.) of suffering from Hindu Cowardice wherein they ignore Muslim crimes against Hindu communities, in order to fulfill their Marxist agenda.

==Reception==
Anthropologist Thomas Blom Hansen describes Elst as a &quot;Belgian Catholic of a radical anti-Muslim persuasion who tries to make himself useful as a &#x27;fellow traveller&#x27; of the Hindu nationalist movement&quot;. Historian Sarvepalli Gopal deemed Elst to be &quot;a Catholic practitioner of polemics&quot; who was fairly oblivious of modern historiography methods. Meera Nanda deems him to be a far-right Hindu cum Flemish nationalist. Elst has engaged in historical revisionism and has been described variedly as a Hindu fundamentalist, pro-Hindutva right-wing ideologue, Hindutva apologist and Hindutva propagandist.&quot;&quot;

Meera Nanda has accused Elst of exploiting the writings of his intellectual forefathers over Voice of India, to &quot;peddle the worst kind of Islamophobia imaginable&quot;. Sanjay Subrahmanyam similarly deems Islamophobia as the common ground between Elst and the traditional Indian far right.

==Influences==
Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian far-right terrorist, responsible for the 2011 Norway attacks extensively borrowed from his works, in writing his manifesto. The manifesto, among other things sought to deport all Muslims from Europe and quoted Elst in asserting the existence of a massive movement that was aimed to &quot;deny the large-scale and long-term crimes against humanity committed by Islam&quot;.

<doc id="305367" wikidata="Q549808" url="?curid=305367" title="Yoshihiro Tajiri">
<text>is a Japanese professional wrestler and promoter primarily known under the ring name Tajiri (sometimes stylized as &quot;TAJIRI&quot;), he has also competed under his real name as well as under the names Aquarius and Kikkoman and briefly worked as the masked character Tigre Blanco.

He rose to international attention through his work for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1998 to 2001 and World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment from 2001 to 2008 and a return in 2016–2017. Early in his career, he worked for several Mexican promotions such as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). After leaving WWE in 2005 he has worked for a number of Japanese promotions including New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Hustle, Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah) and Wrestle-1 (W-1). He was also the promoter and featured wrestler for the Smash promotion as well as its successor Wrestling New Classic (WNC). He is currently under a full-time contract with Kyushu Pro-Wrestling.

Over the years Tajiri has trained various wrestlers including Kushida, Minoru Fujita, Ray and Syuri. In ECW he won the ECW World Television Championship and formed a regular tag team with Mikey Whipwreck that won the ECW World Tag Team Championship on one occasion. In CZW, he was a one time CZW World Heavyweight Champion. During his years with WWE, he won the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship once, WCW United States Championship once, their Cruiserweight Championship on multiple occasions, the WWE Tag Team Championship with Eddie Guerrero and the World Tag Team Championship with William Regal. In AJPW, he has won their Gaora TV Championship, World Junior Heavyweight Championship two times and the 2018 Jr. Tag Battle of Glory tournament with Koji Iwamoto. In MLW, he was MLW Middleweight Champion.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1994–1998)===
Tajiri originally wanted to become a kickboxer and began training in the sport. However, after watching countless wrestling matches from Mexico, he entered the Animal Hamaguchi Wrestling gym and won its test match tournament. Tajiri debuted professionally in 1994 for International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan) with a loss to Takashi Okano. In 1996, Tajiri left CMLL to join the hardcore wrestling promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) in Tokyo, Japan. He debuted for BJW under the name Aquarius. On July 19, 1996, he defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. to win the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship but lost it to him on July 27. The championship changes were not approved by CMLL but done by Dr. Wagner Jr. and Aquarius as part of the tour. Since CMLL did not approve the championship reign they do not officially recognize Aquarius&#x27; championship reign, listing Dr. Wagner as one continuous reign during the time he toured Japan. On July 23, 1997, Tajiri teamed up with Ryuji Yamakawa to win the vacant BJW Tag Team Championship. They lost it to Gedo and Jado on December 22. The team would regain the titles eleven days later, before losing it to Shadow Winger and Shadow WX. Tajiri then beat Gedo to become the first BJW Junior Heavyweight Champion. He would later be stripped of the title when he left the company. That same year, Tajiri competed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), participating in the promotion&#x27;s Best of the Super Juniors IV tournament as a guest from BJW. He won three matches but also lost three and did not advance from the first-round.

===World Wrestling Federation (1996-1997)===
In 1996 and 1997, Tajiri made several appearances for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the name Yoshihiro Tajiri as enhancement talent. On an episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in July 1997, he lost to Taka Michinoku, whom the WWF was pushing as its rising star in the Light Heavyweight division at the time. Tajiri&#x27;s final appearance was a tag match with Brian Christopher, losing to Scott Taylor and Michinoku. He would briefly work for CMLL in 1997 and 1998, before leaving in 1999 to work for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) full-time.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998–2001)===
====Beginnings and World Television Champion (1998–2000)====

After working in Mexico, Tajiri was hired by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He made his television debut in ECW on the December 24, 1998, episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, clad in traditional blue and white trunks with an insignia of Japan&#x27;s rising sun, and picked up a victory over Antifaz Del Norte. He began a notable storyline rivalry with Super Crazy. The duo traded wins throughout 1999. His other notable single feuds included Little Guido and Jerry Lynn.

In early 1999, Tajiri began to emulate The Great Muta, who was one of Tajiri&#x27;s wrestling heroes growing up. His wrestling trunks were replaced with baggy Karate gi pants, and he began spraying green mist into the face of his opponents. He aligned himself with Steve Corino, who promised to teach him the American way and help him to integrate himself into United States culture. With Tajiri&#x27;s notoriety increasing, he received an ECW World Heavyweight Championship title shot against Taz at Heat Wave, and on an episode on &quot;ECW on TNN&quot; but failed to capture the title on both occasions. In 2000, he earned another shot at the championship against Justin Credible but lost once again.

In early 2000 Tajiri was recruited by Cyrus to join The Network group along with Steve Corino. During this time, Tajiri went up against Super Crazy for the ECW World Television Championship in a Japanese death match, a match with no disqualification and all weapons are legal. He lost but gained the title back in a three-way dance involving Super Crazy and Little Guido. Shortly after becoming champion, Tajiri was asked by Cyrus to relinquish the belt to The Network so they could award the title to Rhino. Tajiri refused to turn the belt over and turned his back on the Network, becoming a babyface in the process. His first defense of the title ended in a no contest with Tommy Dreamer. Tajiri lost the title to Rhino on April 22. His rematch came on May 6, but he was unable to regain the title.

====Unholy Alliance (2000–2001)====
Tajiri would then form a tag team with Mikey Whipwreck, known as The Unholy Alliance, who were managed by The Sinister Minister. They entered the World Tag Team tournament and won the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship in August 2000 at Midtown Massacre. The team then started feuding with The Full Blooded Italians and lost the World Tag Team Championship to them only a day after they first won them. They failed to recapture them at Anarchy Rulz and again at November to Remember.

Shortly after his alliance with Whipwreck, Tajiri&#x27;s amusing antics in the ring, stiff contact with opponents, and comedic backstage vignettes made him one of the most popular wrestlers in ECW. Tajiri remained loyal to the company until it folded in April 2001. He participated in ECW&#x27;s final two shows: on January 12, where he picked up a victory over Super Crazy, and January 13, 2001, when he lost to Super Crazy.

===Independent circuit (2000–2001)===
With ECW&#x27;s television deal being canceled in October 2000, the company had to make massive cuts. This resulted in Tajiri wrestling for the company for lower wages and led to him wrestling more frequently on the American and Mexican independent circuit. In IWA Puerto Rico, Tajiri teamed with Super Crazy as they unsuccessfully wrestled Andy Anderson and Vyzago for the World Tag Team Championship. He would also enter the Hardcore Championship invitational match but lost.

During this period, Tajiri had multiple CZW World Heavyweight Championship matches in the Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) promotion. His first would be against Justice Pain. Tajiri lost to Pain twice but would later go on to beat Nick Berk to become CZW World Heavyweight Champion on February 28, 2001; however, Tajiri lost the title that same night to Zandig.

===Return to WWF/E (2001–2006, 2008)===
====Championship reigns (2001–2004)====
Soon after the closure of ECW, Tajiri was hired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Tajiri debuted on the May 24, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a face. He was given the gimmick of WWF Commissioner William Regal&#x27;s comedic assistant. With the help of Regal, Tajiri made his in-ring debut defeating Crash in a King of the Ring 2001 qualifying match. He was later eliminated by Rhyno. Tajiri would win his first championship in WWF by defeating X-Pac for the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. X-Pac would quickly capture the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, and at SummerSlam, Tajiri would lose a championship unification match, therefore retiring the Light Heavyweight Championship. Tajiri would quickly bounce back as he began an on-screen relationship with Torrie Wilson and defeated Chris Kanyon for the WCW United States Championship. However, Tajiri would lose the belt to Rhyno soon afterward at Unforgiven in September. After Regal turned heel by joining The Alliance, Tajiri feuded with him throughout late 2001.
Tajiri won his first WCW Cruiserweight Championship on October 22, 2001, on &quot;Raw&quot;. The title became the WWF Cruiserweight Championship and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship when the WWF defeated The Alliance at Survivor Series on November 18. The WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, and the roster was divided into two &quot;brands&quot;: Raw and SmackDown!. Tajiri, along with Torrie Wilson, was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, therefore making the Cruiserweight Championship a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; exclusive title. Tajiri went on to lose the title to Billy Kidman on the April 4 episode on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He would go on to beat Kidman at Backlash once again and won the Cruiserweight Championship again only 17 days after losing it.

He turned heel by forcing Wilson to dress like a geisha against her will. Tajiri would go on to lose the Cruiserweight Championship to The Hurricane on the May 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a triple threat match that also included Billy Kidman. Wilson eventually abandoned him during a Cruiserweight Championship match against The Hurricane; she did so by stripping on top of a table during the match that caused Tajiri to be counted out and later joined forces with Tajiri&#x27;s rival, Maven. Tajiri became a face in WWE once more after Jamie Noble attacked him for touching Noble&#x27;s girlfriend Nidia. This led to several Cruiserweight Championship matches between the two including matches at No Mercy and Rebellion. He also participated in his first Royal Rumble match in January 2003.

Tajiri would leave the Cruiserweight division and moved to the tag team division where he formed various tag teams, many of which were somewhat comical. These included Rey Mysterio, Funaki, and Rikishi. Five days prior to the 2003 Judgment Day show, Chavo Guerrero tore his biceps, forcing Eddie Guerrero to look for another partner. He chose Tajiri. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship, at Judgment Day by defeating Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a ladder match. The following week, Guerrero and Tajiri managed to retain their title by cheating. In addition, they also defeated Roddy Piper and his protégé Sean O&#x27;Haire at Madison Square Garden. After Guerrero and Tajiri lost the titles to The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (formerly Team Angle) on the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero turned on Tajiri, slamming him through the windshield of his lowrider truck. On the next &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero explained that this was because, during the match, Tajiri had accidentally hit his lowrider. At SummerSlam, Tajiri competed in a Fatal four-way match for the WWE United States Championship but failed to win the title.

Tajiri would mark his return to the cruiserweight division by taking on the champion Rey Mysterio and after losing he spat green mist in Mysterio&#x27;s eye, turning him heel once again. On the September 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Tajiri would beat Rey Mysterio for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship which would be his third and last reign. Tajiri would successfully defend the championship in Mysterio&#x27;s rematch at No Mercy after Akio and Sakoda, later known as &quot;Kyo Dai&quot;, interfered in the match. Tajiri would, however, lose the championship after 93 days to Mysterio on the January 1, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Tajiri kept his heel persona going by spitting black mist in Nidia&#x27;s eyes and &quot;blinding&quot; her (Nidia and Noble were both faces by this time.) Noble and Tajiri started a new feud, which quickly ended after Noble betrayed his blind girlfriend and turned heel again. Kyo Dai would quickly be separated from Tajiri and eventually split up after Tajiri refused the WWE writers proposal of Kyo Dai portraying Japanese gangsters. Tajiri feared that it might anger the real Japanese yakuza if they saw the gimmick as an insult. At WrestleMania XX, Tajiri took part in a cruiserweight open for the Cruiserweight Championship which was won by the reigning champion Chavo Guerrero.

==== Various storylines (2004–2008) ====
In 2004, Tajiri had two chances to earn a shot at the WWE Championship. The first chance was in the 2004 Royal Rumble, where the winner would get a championship match at WrestleMania XX, but he was eliminated by Rhyno. His second chance was in a battle royal on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, in which the winner would face then-champion Brock Lesnar at No Way Out. However, he lost once again when he was eliminated by the Big Show.

Following WrestleMania XX, Tajiri was drafted to &quot;Raw&quot;, where he turned face once again and feuded with the group of Eric Bischoff, Jonathan Coachman, and Garrison Cade. He would later feud with the Evolution stable for a good portion of 2004. Also that year, Tajiri formed a tag team with Rhyno. This team dissolved quietly after a failed attempt at winning the World Tag Team Championship from La Résistance at Unforgiven. On February 4, 2005, in Saitama Super Arena, Tajiri reunited with William Regal to defeat La Résistance for the World Tag Team Championship on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; emanating from Japan. After several defenses against La Résistance, among others, their reign ended on May 1 at Backlash, when they were eliminated from a tag team turmoil match by La Résistance.

Tajiri lost a 3-Way Dance (that also featured Little Guido) to Super Crazy at ECW One Night Stand 2005 on June 12. Later that year, he formed a short-lived team with Eugene. In December 2005, Tajiri left WWE, stating that he wanted to try to become a journalist and spend more time with his wife and family in Japan. His final televised WWE match was a loss to Gregory Helms on &quot;Heat&quot;. After the match, he received a standing ovation as a farewell. 

Tajiri returned for a one-night appearance at WWE&#x27;s ECW One Night Stand 2006 pay-per-view, teaming with Super Crazy to lose to The Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I.). 

On February 12, 2008, Tajiri made an appearance at a WWE house show in Tokyo, where he accompanied William Regal to the ring for a match against Ric Flair, which Regal lost.

===Hustle (2006–2010)===

Tajiri&#x27;s return to Japan came at Hustle on March 5, 2006, defeating Kohei Sato, The Monster PTA and Yoji Anjo with Razor Ramon Hard Gay and Shinjiro Otani. In the Hustle promotion, he was originally aligned with the babyface Hustle Army, a group which defends the sport of professional wrestling against the Monster Army (led by Monster General and Monster K, who aim to destroy the sport). However, he was hypnotized by Yinling into joining the Monster Army. In 2006, Tajiri took Yujiro Kushida under his wing and trained him while at Hustle. They participated in multiple tag team matches and tag team tournaments, and they also had several matches against one another. He also participated in Hustle GP, Hustle&#x27;s only tournament, but was knocked out of the tournaments in the first round by Wataru Sakata. In his last appearance at Hustle, Tajiri defeated Muscle Sakai in a two out of three falls match which Tajiri won two to one.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2006–2007, 2011)===
Tajiri made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling, losing to The Great Muta; Tajiri and Muta would team up for a few matches, the most notable of which was against Kaz Hayashi and Satoshi Kojima when the pair used double Asian mist to achieve victory.

Tajiri was a title contender in All Japan Pro Wrestling throughout 2007, including a feud with Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Minoru Suzuki. This feud started on March 30, 2007, at the final Champion Carnival 2007 event, following Tajiri&#x27;s victory over Suzuki via count-out when Tajiri tied Suzuki&#x27;s foot to the guardrail and went on to steal the Triple Crown championship belts following the match. Because of Tajiri&#x27;s refusal to return the titles, Suzuki created paper belts to temporarily represent his championship. Tajiri opposed Suzuki again on April 22, 2007, in a tag team match, in which Tajiri taunted Suzuki repeatedly. At the conclusion of the match, Suzuki (after losing the match because of the Tarantula) chased Tajiri around the Korakuen Hall, only for Tajiri to jump the guard rail and steal the paper belts. Days later, Tajiri returned the titles in exchange for a title match on April 30, 2007, where he was unsuccessful. Tajiri also teamed with The Great Muta to defeat Kohei Suwama and Scott Steiner.

Tajiri returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2011 to team up with Great Muta and Kenso in a loss to Partisan Forces (Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki) and KAI. Tajiri would then bring Smash&#x27;s biggest stars to AJPW for a one-night event where he and his partners Akira and StarBuck defeated Bushi, Keiji Muto, and Shuji Kondo.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2009–2011)===
During the summer of 2009, Tajiri invaded NJPW, where he started a feud with the International Wrestling Gran Prix (IWGP) Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi, by attacking and green misting him after his title defense against Takashi Sugiura. Tajiri participated in G1 Climax 2009 and won his first match of the tournament and his first match of his return.

On August 13, Tajiri pinned the IWGP Heavyweight Champion in a non-title match during the G1 Climax tournament, after using the green mist. Tajiri ended the tournament with only four points, finishing bottom of block A. Hustle folded in October 2009, after which Tajiri began wrestling for NJPW full-time. He would score two more pinfall victories over the now former IWGP Heavyweight Champion in multiple man tag team matches, but in the end lost the feud, when Tanahashi pinned him cleanly in a one-on-one match on December 5. Afterwards, Tajiri set his sights on Seigigun, led by Yuji Nagata. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome Tajiri teamed up with fellow ECW alumnus Masato Tanaka and together they defeated the Seigigun team of Nagata and Akebono when Tajiri pinned Nagata after the green mist and a Buzzsaw kick. On February 14 Nagata defeated Tajiri in a one-on-one match in under five minutes to seemingly end the feud and Tajiri&#x27;s run with the company.

On June 19 at Dominion 6.19, Tajiri returned to New Japan, turning face and saving former rival Hiroshi Tanahashi from Toru Yano and Takashi Iizuka. He then helped Tanahashi shave Yano&#x27;s head following their Hair vs. Hair match. On June 28 Tajiri, Tanahashi, and Kushida entered the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament, where they made it all the way to the finals on June 30, before being defeated by Prince Devitt, Ryusuke Taguchi, and Hirooki Goto. In October and November 2010, Tajiri teamed with Tanahashi in New Japan&#x27;s 2010 G1 Tag League. After a strong start in the tournament, Tajiri and Tanahashi were defeated by the IWGP Tag Team Champions Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) on November 6, the last day of group stages, and slipped to third place in their block, narrowly missing the semifinals of the tournament.

===Smash (2010–2012)===
In 2010, Tajiri was placed in charge of Smash, a new promotion taking the place of Hustle. The promotion held its first show on March 26 which saw Tajiri wrestle two matches in one night. The first was a hardcore match against Tommy Dreamer. Tajiri lost to Dreamer but then beat Mentallo in his second contest. Later that same night, Tajiri and Dreamer saved Kushida from Leatherface. To end the show, Dreamer paid tribute to Tajiri which led him to break into tears.

During 2010, Tajiri, along with other Smash talent made crossover appearances in Finnish promotion Fight Club Finland (FCF). At Smash.3 on May 29, 2010, Tajiri defeated Valentine to win the FCF Finnish Heavyweight Championship for the first time. He would drop the title to StarBuck on July 24 at Smash.6, before regaining it from him on November 22, 2010, at Smash.10. On February 25, 2011, Tajiri gave Kushida his blessing to leave Smash and become a full-time member of the New Japan roster on April 1. At Smash.12 Tajiri would successfully defend his title against Super Crazy but would lose the title later on in the night to Michael Kovac at Smash.13, at Smash.13. On September 8 at Smash.21, Tajiri defeated Akira in the semifinals of the Smash Championship tournament. On October 28, Tajiri was defeated in the finals of the tournament by StarBuck.

On February 10, 2012, Smash announced that the promotion would be folding after its March 14 event, following a disagreement between Tajiri and financial backer Masakazu Sakai. On February 19 at &quot;Smash.25&quot;, Tajiri unsuccessfully challenged Dave Finlay for the Smash Championship. On March 14, Tajiri wrestled in Smash&#x27;s final match, where he and AKIRA defeated Hajime Ohara and StarBuck. Following the match, Tajiri announced his intention of starting a new promotion.

===Wrestling New Classic (2012–2014)===

On April 5, 2012, Tajiri announced the follow-up promotion to Smash, Wrestling New Classic (WNC), which would hold its first event on April 26. On April 26, Tajiri was defeated by Akira in the main event of WNC&#x27;s first event. For WNC&#x27;s second event on May 24, Tajiri reunited with former ECW tag team partner, Mikey Whipwreck, to defeat Gedo and Jado in a hardcore tag team match. Two days later, Tajiri and Whipwreck defeated Yo-Hey and Yusuke Kodama in another hardcore tag team match. On June 22, Tajiri&#x27;s longtime partner Akira turned on him and, the following month formed a new alliance with StarBuck and Syuri.

Tajiri, Hajime Ohara, and Kana, the former partners of the three formed an alliance of their own to battle the three, but were on August 2 defeated in the first match between the two groups. Following the match, Ohara also turned on Tajiri and WNC, forming a new partnership with debuting female wrestler Nagisa Nozaki. On August 30, Tajiri teamed with Kana and the returning Mikey Whipwreck in a Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch, where they were defeated by Akira, StarBuck and Syuri. In a September 1 match, Whipwreck pinned StarBuck for the win, ending the villainous trio&#x27;s win streak in the process. On September 20, Tajiri defeated Syuri in an intergender match at Korakuen Hall.

On October 26, Tajiri entered the WNC Championship tournament, defeating Carlito in his first-round match. On November 28, Tajiri defeated Hajime Ohara to advance to the finals of the tournament. On December 27, Tajiri was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Akira. On August 8, 2013, Tajiri defeated Osamu Nishimura in his home prefecture of Kumamoto to become the third WNC Champion. After five successful title defenses, Tajiri lost the title to StarBuck on February 27, 2014.

On June 18, 2014, Tajiri announced that WNC would be going inactive following June 26. Effective July 1, six former WNC wrestlers, Tajiri included, transferred over to the Wrestle-1 promotion.

===Wrestle-1 (2014–2016)===
Tajiri wrestled his first match under a Wrestle-1 contract on July 6, 2014, teaming with Yusuke Kodama in a tag team match, where they defeated the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) team of Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud. On September 22, Tajiri entered the Wrestle-1 Championship tournament but was defeated in his first-round match by Masakatsu Funaki. Tajiri then entered a storyline, where he began helping Funaki train for his semifinal match in the tournament. However, on October 8, Tajiri turned on Funaki, costing him his semifinal match against Masayuki Kono. Post-match, Tajiri was announced as the newest member of Kono&#x27;s villainous Desperado stable.

In November, Tajiri and Masayuki Kono took part in the First Tag League Greatest tournament, set to determine the inaugural Wrestle-1 Tag Team Champions, where they won their block with a clean record of four wins and zero losses, advancing to the semifinals. On November 30, Tajiri and Kono were eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Akira and Manabu Soya.

On May 16, 2015, Tajiri defeated Minoru Tanaka at a Wrestle-1 event to capture the European Wrestling Promotion (EWP) Intercontinental Championship. A week later, Tajiri unsuccessfully challenged Tanaka for the Wrestle-1 Cruiser Division Championship. On May 30, Tajiri lost the EWP Intercontinental Championship back to Tanaka in a Title vs. Title match also contested for the Wrestle-1 Cruiser Division Championship. Following the match, Desperado turned on Tajiri and kicked him out of the stable. On June 19, Wrestle-1 announced a new contractual status for Tajiri, which would see him work only sporadic Wrestle-1 events from July onwards due to looking for a new career as an acupuncturist abroad. On January 31, 2016, Tajiri, Kaz Hayashi and Minoru Tanaka won the vacant UWA World Trios Championship.

On June 28, 2016, Tajiri announced he was leaving Wrestle-1 due to his contract with the company expiring. On July 29, Tajiri, Hayashi, and Tanaka lost the UWA World Trios Championship to Andy Wu, Daiki Inaba and Seiki Yoshioka in their fifth defense.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014)===
Tajiri debuted at the August &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; tapings in New York City, defeating Robbie E on August 5 (aired September 24), and working matches on the August tapings; Tajiri and Austin Aries lost to James Storm and Sanada and then on the September 24 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, he competed in the NYC Gold Rush Final fatal five-way match which also included Abyss, Mr. Anderson, MVP and Austin Aries with Anderson winning the match. His final appearance for the promotion was at the October 12, Bound for Glory pay-per-view event in Tokyo, teaming with The Great Muta in a tag team main event, where they defeated James Storm and The Great Sanada.

===Second return to WWE (2016–2017)===
On June 13, 2016, Tajiri was announced as a participant in WWE&#x27;s Cruiserweight Classic tournament. The tournament kicked off on June 23 with Tajiri defeating Damian Slater in his first-round match. On July 14, Tajiri was eliminated from the tournament by Gran Metalik.

On December 3, at the NXT special at Osaka, Japan, Tajiri teamed with Akira Tozawa, losing to NXT Tag Team Champions DIY (Tommaso Ciampa and Johnny Gargano). On December 4, 2016, Tajiri announced he signed a full-time contract with WWE, and that he would make his return in early 2017. On the December 13 episode of &quot;205 Live&quot;, vignettes for Tajiri&#x27;s return began airing. On January 3, 2017, Tajiri debuted on &quot;205 Live&quot; defeating Sean Maluta. Following the match, The Brian Kendrick tried to welcome him back to the WWE, only for Tajiri to spit green mist onto his face. In January, Tajiri suffered a knee injury at an &quot;NXT&quot; taping. After weeks of recovery, Tajiri returned at a 205 Live taping in February, following a match between Lince Dorado and Brian Kendrick. On April 22, Tajiri officially announced his departure from the WWE. According to him, he had been medically cleared to return and compete from a knee injury, but WWE decided not to use him due to his age.

===Return to AJPW (2017–2022)===
Following his departure from WWE, Tajiri returned to Japan, with All Japan announcing his first post-WWE booking for June 11. On July 30, Tajiri defeated Hikaru Sato to win the promotion&#x27;s World Junior Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Último Dragón on August 27, before regaining it on October 21. His reign as Junior Heavyweight Champion lasted until February 3, 2018, when Atsushi Aoki won the championship from Tajiri. Tajiri defeated Jun Akiyama on July 15, 2018, to win the Gaora TV Championship. AJPW further pushed Tajiri as he and tag team partner Koji Iwamoto were entered into the 2018 Jr. Tag Battle of Glory tournament. The duo won four of the six first-round matches, then defeated Atsushi Aoki and Hikaru Sato in the finals to win the tournament.

===Major League Wrestling (2021–2022)===
On October 2, 2021, Tajiri made his MLW debut at Fightland where he defeated Myron Reed, Arez, and Aramis to become the new MLW World Middleweight Champion. Tajiri will defend the MLW World Middleweight Championship in England at Cheltenham Town Hall February 19 when he will face Jody Fleisch on a card promoted by World Pro Wrestling. He would lose the title in January 2022 against Myron Reed.

===Kyushu Pro-Wrestling (2023–present)===
On January 3, 2023, Tajiri made his Kyushu Pro-Wrestling debut at Jokyo 2023 where he defeated Kodai Nozaki to win the Kyushu Pro-Wrestling Championship, then announced he had signed full-time with the promotion. He lost the title to Mentai☆Kid, on February 5, at the Kitakyushu Genki Festival event.

==Professional wrestling persona and style==

Originally Tajiri performed as a face, without much ring character as such on display, until joining ECW where he adopted his heel &quot;Japanese Buzzsaw&quot; ring character. As the &quot;Japanese Buzzsaw&quot; Tajiri began to display a more ruthless, deranged persona, focusing more on inflicting pain on his opponents than winning matches, which included creating the &quot;Tarantula&quot; submission hold. The &quot;Tarantula&quot; is a Rope-hung Boston crab, where Tajiri himself is hung upside down over the top rope as he applies the hold. Since the move involves the use of the ring ropes, it is technically an illegal hold, and must be broken before a referee&#x27;s count of 5 or risk disqualification. Since a submission from this position is not valid, it is a symbol of the &quot;Sadism&quot; that his &quot;Japanese Buzzsaw&quot; character displays. When Tajiri transitioned to the heel character in 1998 he began wearing baggy pants, using the heavy pants to hide just how much contact his foot actually has with an opponent&#x27;s chest when Tajiri performs a &quot;Buzzsaw Kick&quot; (a high-speed roundhouse kick to the head) on an opponent that often finishes his matches.
As part of the deranged Buzzsaw persona, Tajiri began using &quot;Asian mist&quot; during his matches, spraying a mist of water and green food coloring in the face of an opponent who sells the mist as being blinding. The mist was one of the signature moves of the Great Muta, Tajiri&#x27;s wrestling inspiration and adopted by Tajiri in the late 1990s and has been a trademark move ever since. When working as a heel the mist usually draws a strong negative reaction, but when he&#x27;s a face it draws a positive reaction from the crowd when he uses it as payback on a heel during a match. During his partnership with William Regal, the face Tajiri portrayed a more comedic version of the Buzzsaw character, often either disgusting or disturbing Regal with his antics.

==In other media==
In December 2003, Tajiri released his autobiography, &quot;Tajiri: The Japanese Buzzsaw&quot;, in Japan. The book chronicles his wrestling career, from the Mexican and Japanese circuits to ECW and WWF/WWE. Written entirely in Japanese, it was the first book published by WWE in a non-English language.

<text>British Columbia Ferry Services Inc., operating as BC Ferries (BCF), is a former provincial Crown corporation, now operating as an independently managed, publicly owned Canadian company. BC Ferries provides all major passenger and vehicle ferry services for coastal and island communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Set up in 1960 to provide a similar service to that provided by the Black Ball Line and the Canadian Pacific Railway, which were affected by job action at the time, BC Ferries has become the largest passenger ferry line in North America, operating a fleet of 41 vessels with a total passenger and crew capacity of over 27,000, serving 47 locations on the B.C. coast.

The federal and provincial governments subsidize BC Ferries to provide agreed service levels on essential links between the BC mainland, coastal islands, and parts of the mainland without road access. The inland ferries operating on British Columbia&#x27;s rivers and lakes are not run by BC Ferries. The responsibility for their provision rests with the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, which contracts operation to various private sector companies.

== Structure ==
At its inception, BC Ferries was a division of the British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority, a provincial Crown corporation. Through successive reorganizations, it evolved into the British Columbia Ferry Authority and then the British Columbia Ferry Corporation, both of which were also provincial Crown corporations. In 2003, the Government of British Columbia announced that BC Ferries, which had been in debt, would be reorganized into a private corporation, implemented through the passage of the &quot;Coastal Ferry Act&quot; (Bill 18–2003). The single voting share of BC Ferries Corporation is held by the provincial government&#x27;s BC Ferry Authority, which operates under the rules of the Act.

==History==
In the summer of 1958, a strike by employees of CP Steamships and the Black Ball Line caused the Social Credit government of W. A. C. Bennett to decide that the coastal ferry service in British Columbia needed to be government-owned, and so it set about creating BC Ferries. Minister of Highways Phil Gaglardi was tasked with overseeing the new Crown corporation and its rapid expansion.


BC Ferries&#x27; first route, commissioned in 1960, was between Swartz Bay, north of Sidney on Vancouver Island, and Tsawwassen, an area in Delta, using just two vessels. These ships were the now-retired MV &quot;Tsawwassen&quot; and the MV &quot;Sidney&quot;. The next few years saw a dramatic growth of the B.C. ferry system as it took over operations of the Black Ball Line and other major private companies providing vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. As the ferry system expanded and started to service other small coastal communities, BC Ferries had to build more vessels, many of them in the first five years of its operations, to keep up with the demand. Another method of satisfying increasing demand for service was BC Ferries&#x27; unique &quot;stretch and lift&quot; program, involving seven vessels being cut in half and extended, and five of those vessels later cut in half again and elevated, to increase their passenger and vehicle-carrying capacities. The vast majority of the vessels in the fleet were built in B.C. waters, with only two foreign purchases and one domestic purchase. In the mid-1980s, BC Ferries took over the operations of the saltwater branch of the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Highways, which ran ferry services to very small coastal communities. This action dramatically increased the size of BC Ferries&#x27; fleet and its geographical service area. The distinctive &quot;dogwood on green&quot; flag that BC Ferries used between 1960 and 2003 gave the service its popular nickname &quot;the Dogwood Fleet&quot;.

During the 1990s, the NDP government commissioned a series of three fast ferries to improve ferry service between the Mainland and Vancouver Island. The ships proved problematic when they suffered many technical issues and cost double what was expected. The fast ferries were eventually sold off for $19.4 million in 2003.

A controversy began in July 2004 when BC Ferries, under a new American CEO, announced that the company had disqualified all Canadian bids to build three new ships, and only the proposals from European shipyards were being considered. The contract was estimated at $542 million for the three ships, each designed to carry 370 vehicles and 1600 passengers.

The argument for domestic construction of the ferries was that it would employ numerous British Columbia workers, revitalize the sagging B.C. shipbuilding industry, and entitle the provincial government to a large portion of the cost in the form of taxes. BC Ferries CEO David Hahn claimed that building the ferries in Germany would &quot;save almost $80 million and could lead to lower fares.&quot;

On September 17, 2004, BC Ferries awarded the vessel construction contract to Germany&#x27;s Flensburger shipyard. The contract protected BC Ferries from any delays through a fixed price and fixed schedule contract. entered service in March 2008, while was delivered the same month and entered service in June that year. The third ship, , was delivered in June of the same year and entered service in November.

On August 18, 2006, BC Ferries commissioned Flensburger to build a new vessel for its Inside Passage route, with the contract having many of the same types of terms as that for the Coastal-class vessels. The new northern service vessel, , was delivered in March 2008, and entered service in May of the same year.

On August 26, 2012, BC Ferries announced that it would be cutting 98 round trips on its major routes starting in the fall and winter of 2012 as part of a four-year plan to save $1 million on these routes. Service cuts have included the elimination of supplementary sailings on the Swartz Bay–Tsawwassen route, 18 round trips on the Horseshoe Bay–Departure Bay route, and 48 round trips, the largest number of cuts, on the Duke Point–Tsawwassen route, with plans to look for savings on the smaller unprofitable routes in the future.

Free ferry trips for seniors were suspended from April 2014 to April 2018.

In the fall of 2014, BC Ferries announced the addition of three new Intermediate-class ferries to phase out &quot;Queen of Burnaby&quot; and &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot;. These three vessels were to be named the ; &quot;Salish Orca&quot;, &quot;Salish Eagle&quot; and &quot;Salish Raven&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Salish Heron&quot;, the fourth Salish-class vessel, entered service. All four ferries were designed and built by Remontowa Shipbuilding S.A. in Gdansk, Poland, and are dual-fuel, capable of operating on liquefied natural gas and marine diesel. These vessels are a part of BC Ferries standardized fleet plan, which will take the number of ship classes in the BC Ferries fleet from 17 to 5. The proposed replacement classes are Northern, Major, Salish, Shuttle and Island. Additionally, there will still be three unique (unclassed) vessels in the fleet after standardization is complete. BC Ferries has stated, however, that this total standardization of the fleet will not be achieved for another 40 years. As of March 2024, the fleet has so far been reduced to 11 classes of vessels, with 8 unique (unclassed) vessels remaining as well.

<text>The Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM), also known by its United States designation AIM-132, is an imaging infrared homing air-to-air missile, produced by MBDA UK, that is designed for close-range combat. It is in service in the Royal Air Force (RAF), replacing the AIM-9 Sidewinder. The ASRAAM is designed to allow the pilot to fire and then turn away before the opposing aircraft can close for a shot. It flies at over Mach 3 to ranges in excess of . It retains a 50 g maneuverability provided by body lift and tail control.

The project started as a British-German collaboration in the 1980s. It was part of a wider agreement in which the US would develop the AIM-120 AMRAAM for medium-range use, while the ASRAAM would replace the Sidewinder with a design that would cover the great range disparity between the Sidewinder and the AMRAAM. Germany left the programme in 1989. The British proceeded on their own and the missile was introduced into RAF service in 1998. It is being introduced to the Indian Air Force, the Qatar Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Oman, and formerly saw service in the Royal Australian Air Force.

The ASRAAM is also the base design for the Common Anti-Aircraft Modular Missile (CAMM) used by the British Army, Royal Navy and several allied forces in the surface-launched role. A surface-launched variant of the ASRAAM itself has been improvised for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

==History==
In the 1980s, NATO countries signed a Memorandum of Agreement that the United States would develop the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), while a primarily British and German team would develop a short-range air-to-air missile to replace the Sidewinder. The team included the UK (Hawker Siddeley, by this point known as BAe Dynamics) and Germany (Bodensee Gerätetechnik) sharing 42.5 per cent of the effort each, Canada at 10 per cent and Norway at 5 per cent. The US assigned this missile the name AIM-132 ASRAAM.

===New ASRAAM===
The rapid decline and eventual fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s led to considerably less interest in the ASRAAM. By February 1988 the US was already agitating for changes. In July 1989 the Germans exited the programme effectively ending the agreement. Various reasons are often cited including the ending of the Cold War and full realisation of the capabilities of the Russian R-73 missile, but many commentators think this was a smokescreen for financial and defence industrial share issues.

This left Britain in charge of the project and they began redefining it purely to RAF needs, sending out tenders for the new design in August 1989. This led to the selection of a new Hughes focal plane array imaging array seeker instead of the more conventional design previously used, dramatically improving performance and countermeasure resistance. A UK contest in 1990 examined the new ASRAAM, the French MICA and a new design from Bodensee Gerätetechnik, their version of the ASRAAM tuned for German needs. In 1992 the Ministry of Defence announced that ASRAAM had won the contest, and production began in March that year. The German design, by now part of Diehl BGT Defence, became the IRIS-T.

While ASRAAM was entering production, momentum behind US-led industrial and political lobbying grew significantly and, combined with the strengthening European economy, forced the US government to conclude testing in June 1996 and move away from the ASRAAM program.

UK development and manufacture went ahead and the first ASRAAM was delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF) in late 1998. It equips the RAF&#x27;s Typhoon. It was also used by the RAF&#x27;s Harrier GR7 and Tornado GR4 forces until their retirement. In February 1998 ASRAAM was selected by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for use on their F/A-18 Hornets following competitive evaluation of the improved ASRAAM, the Rafael Python 4 and the AIM-9X, and entered RAAF service in August 2004. In March 2009 the RAAF successfully carried out the first in-service &quot;Lock-on after launch&quot; firing of an ASRAAM at a target located behind the wing-line of the &quot;shooter&quot; aircraft.

== Characteristics ==
ASRAAM is a high speed, extremely manoeuvrable, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile. Built by MBDA UK, it is designed as a &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; missile. ASRAAM is intended to detect and launch against targets at much longer ranges, as far as early versions of the AMRAAM, in order to shoot down the enemy long before it closes enough to be able to fire its own weapons. In this respect the ASRAAM shares more in common with the AMRAAM than other IR missiles, although it retains high manoeuvrability. To provide the needed power, the ASRAAM is built on a 16.51 cm (6½ inch) diameter rocket motor compared with Sidewinder&#x27;s (AIM-9M and X) and IRIS-T&#x27;s 12.7 cm (5-inch) motors (which trace their history to the 1950s unguided Zuni rocket). This gives the ASRAAM significantly more thrust and therefore increased speed and range up to .

The main improvement is a new 128×128 resolution imaging infrared focal plane array (FPA) seeker manufactured by Hughes before they were acquired by Raytheon. This seeker has a long acquisition range, high countermeasures resistance, approximately 90-degree off-boresight lock-on capability, and the possibility to designate specific parts of the targeted aircraft (like cockpit, engines, etc.). The ASRAAM also has a LOAL (Lock-on after launch) ability which is a distinct advantage when the missile is carried in an internal bay such as in the F-35 Lightning II. However in 2012 the requirement for ASRAAM internal carriage on the F-35 was dropped, and the aircraft now uses external carriage only. The ASRAAM warhead is triggered either by laser proximity fuse or impact. A laser proximity fuse was selected because RF fuses are vulnerable to EW intervention from enemy jammers. The increased diameter of ASRAAM also provides space for increased computing power, and so improved counter counter-measure capabilities compared with other dogfighting missiles such as AIM-9X.

== Developments ==
On 8 July 2014, Indian Ministry of Defence signed a £250m ($428m) contract with MBDA to purchase 384 ASRAAM short range air-to-air missile to equip its SEPECAT/HAL Jaguar strike aircraft fleet and replace the ageing Matra Magic R550. MBDA&#x27;s offering overcame competition from competitors including Rafael&#x27;s Python-5 missile, emerging as the winner in 2012. This built on an existing 2012 order for 493 MICA missiles to replace Matra S-530D and Magic II missiles as part of an Indian Air Force Mirage 2000 upgrade.

In September 2015, the UK&#x27;s MoD signed a £300 million contract for a new and improved version of the ASRAAM that would leverage new technological developments, including those from the CAMM missile. This variant would replace the current one when it goes out of service in 2022. A further £184 million contract was awarded in August 2016 to provide additional stocks of the new ASRAAM for the UK&#x27;s F-35B. This new variant will be operationally ready on the Eurofighter Typhoon in 2018 and on the UK&#x27;s F-35Bs from 2022 onwards.

In February 2017, successful firing of ASRAAMs from F-35 Lightning IIs were conducted at Naval Air Station Patuxent River and Edwards Air Force Base in the USA. This represented the first time that a British-designed missile had been fired from an F-35 JSF and the first time any non-US missile had ever been fired from the aircraft.

As of 31 January 2019, the Indian Air Force is testing the compatibility of the ASRAAM weapons system with the Sukhoi Su-30MKI, and aims to make the ASRAAM its standardised short range missile across multiple aircraft types, including the Tejas. Final testing and operational clearance are to be achieved by the end of 2019. Bharat Dynamics Limited will produce the missile at its Bhanoor unit. The facility will also offer maintenance, repair and overhaul services.

== Variants ==

===ASRAAM P3I===
In 1995, Hughes and British Aerospace collaborated on the &quot;P3I ASRAAM&quot;, a version of ASRAAM as a candidate for the AIM-9X program. The ultimate winner was the Hughes submission using the same seeker but with the rocket motor, fuse and warhead of the AIM-9M. The latter was a US Air Force stipulation to ease the logistics burden and save money by reusing as much as possible of the existing AIM-9 Sidewinder, of which 20,000 remained in the US inventory.

=== ASRAAM Block 6 ===
ASRAAM Block 6 standard, developed under the ASRAAM Sustainment programme, entered service on the Typhoon in April 2022, and will enter F-35 service in 2024. The Block 6 introduces new and updated sub-systems, and replaces external cooling with a new internal cooler. The original Raytheon seeker has been replaced with a new UK-built seeker of higher resolution. There are no US-made components, meaning that it does not come under ITAR restrictions and can therefore be exported without US approval.

== Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) ==

At the DSEi conference in September 2007 it was announced that the UK MoD was funding a study by MBDA to investigate a replacement for the Sea Wolf and Rapier missiles for the Royal Navy and British Army respectively. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) would share components with ASRAAM, such as the very low signature rocket motor from Roxel and the warhead and proximity fuze from Thales but with updated electronics, an active RF seeker and data link so allowing for mid-course corrections from suitably-equipped land or even air platforms. CAMM began entering service in 2018 and has since be sold to nine other nations for both land and naval use. It has since become a family of weapons with a number of additional missile variants on order or in development.

==Operational history==
=== Royal Air Force ===
On 14 December 2021 a RAF Typhoon operating against Islamic State in southern Syria shot down a hostile drone with an ASRAAM missile. This was the first time the British military had shot down an enemy aircraft since the Falklands War.

=== Armed Forces of Ukraine (Surface-launched ASRAAM) ===
In August 2023 it emerged that Ukraine had been provided an unknown number of improvised ground-based launch platforms for ASRAAM. Developed in four months by a joint MBDA and MoD team, It has been used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to provide short range air defence (SHORAD) against Russian aerial threats such as helicopters, cruise missiles and drones such as the HESA Shahed 136. Images of the system appear to show a twin-launcher mounted on the back of a Supacat 6x6 vehicle, allowing it to remain mobile, whilst guidance can be provided by a Hawkeye electro-optical suite. The missile has a &quot;fire and forget&quot; capacity. Reportedly, the system has achieved a 90% success rate during operations. This system is not to be confused with the dedicated surface-launched development of ASRAAM, CAMM/Sky Sabre air defence system. On 7 May 2024 footage was published showing the first confirmed loss of a Ukrainian ASRAAM Supacat based launcher which was destroyed by a ZALA Lancet.

<text>Jasmine is a novel by Bharati Mukherjee set in the 1980s about a young Indian woman in the United States who, trying to adapt to the American way of life in order to be able to survive, changes identities several times. Mukherjee&#x27;s own experiences of dislocation and displacement in her life helps her in recording the immigrant experience of the protagonist in this novel.

==Plot summary==

&quot;Jasmine,&quot; which was based on an earlier short story in &quot;The Middleman and Other Stories,&quot; tells the story of a seventeen-year-old girl widowed after her husband&#x27;s murder in a bomb attack. She and her husband originally planned to move to Florida, but as a result of his death Jasmine continues with the trip on her own. In her path she faces many obstacles as she travels from Florida to New York City to Iowa.

The novel begins with Jasmine retelling a story from her childhood about an astrologer who predicts her future as a widower living in exile. She fast forwards to life in Baden, Iowa where Jasmine (known as Jane in Iowa) is 24 years old, pregnant and living with 53-year-old banker Bud Ripplemayer, and his adopted son Du. Bud insists on marrying Jane, who refuses for unknown reasons. Bud is also in a wheelchair because he was shot in the back two years ago. Jane and Bud have a neighbor named Darrel Lutz, a recent college grad who inherited his family&#x27;s farm. He is contemplating whether or not to sell his farm. Bud refuses to loan Darrel money to expand his herd and grow his crops because Bud doesn&#x27;t trust Darrel&#x27;s character as a farmer and a manager. Darrel also shows some romantic interest in Jane.

Jane walks us through her life with Du and Bud before flashing back to her life in Hasnapur, Jullundhar district, Punjab, India (page 39). Here in India, she is known as Jyoti. She has a teacher named Masterji, who teaches her English. Masterji urges Jyoti to continue with her education instead of getting married. Soon after Jyoti&#x27;s father passes away, she meets Prakash. They marry and move in together. He begins to call her Jasmine. Prakash works two jobs and studies for his diploma exams while Jasmine runs a Ladies&#x27; Group raffle and sells detergent to make money. Prakash receives a letter from Professor Vadhera who encourages Prakash to study in America. He makes plans to move the two of them to Florida, when while out shopping for saris, Prakash is killed by a bomb, set off by a man named Sukhwinder. He yells &quot;Prostitutes! Whores!&quot; at Jasmine before the bomb goes off.

As &quot;a matter of duty and honor,&quot; Jasmine continues with Prakash&#x27;s plans to move to Florida, travelling by plane, train, and ship. Half-Face, the captain of the ship drives Jasmine to a motel when they arrive to land. He then sexually assaults her. Jasmine contemplates killing herself but instead kills Half-Face. She burns Prakash&#x27;s suit that she carried with her and leaves the motel.

Jasmine meets Lillian Gordon, who takes her in. Mrs. Gordon is also housing three Kanjobal women. She calls Jasmine &quot;Jazzy,&quot; and helps Jazzy get to New York to meet with Professor Vadhera. Lillian also has a daughter named Kate Gordon-Feldstein who works as a photographer in the city. Lillian is later sent to jail for &quot;exploiting&quot; undocumenteds for free cooking, cleaning and yard work. For five months, Jasmine lives with Professor Vadhera, whom she calls Professorji. She becomes depressed because she fears to leave the house without a green card. Professorji agrees to get her a green card, for fifty thousand rupees, or three thousand dollars.

Jasmine begins working for Wylie and Taylor Hayes, friends of Kate Gordon-Feldstein. She moves in with them in Manhattan to take care of their adopted daughter, Duff. Taylor calls her &quot;Jase.&quot; Wylie falls out of love with Taylor and falls for Stuart. Wylie leaves Taylor, but Jase continues to take care of Duff. She falls in love with Taylor, but one day while the three of them are at the park, Jase spots Sukhwinder, the man that killed Prakash. She flees New York for Iowa. She chooses Iowa because Duff&#x27;s birth mother lives in Iowa.

Back in present-day Iowa, Jane recalls the night two years ago when Harlan Kroener shot Bud. They were walking to Harlan&#x27;s car when he shot Bud. He then proceeded to kill himself. Harlan was angry at Bud because of money issues with the bank. Before Bud met Jane, he was married to Karin. Karin initially hates Jane for taking her husband from her, but they maintain a platonic relationship.

Jane receives a letter from Taylor, letting her know he and Duff are on their way to find Jane. Du figures out Jane is in love with another man besides Bud. Jane goes to visit Darrel because he says he feels crazy, but she leaves soon when he starts insulting her and Bud&#x27;s relationship. She suspects he might shoot himself that night. When she returns home, Du announces that he is going to Los Angeles to live with his sister and he leaves with his friend John. Karin visits, and the two of them drive to see how Darrel is faring. He is fixing up his hog house.

Back at the house, Jane tells Bud that Du went to visit his sister but he will be back before school starts. Bud later approves of Darrel&#x27;s loan application, and the two of them drive over to let him know the news. But when they arrive, they discover him hanging from a rafter.

Bud begs for Jane to tell him she loves him, but she doesn&#x27;t respond. Du has decided to stay in California. While Jane is working in the kitchen, she sees a car pull up the driveway and Taylor and Duff get out of the car. Taylor tries to convince Jase to come with him to California. She is conflicted, thinking of Bud who will lose everything if she leaves. She calls Karin and tells her she&#x27;s &quot;going somewhere,&quot; to see Du. Jasmine stops thinking of herself as Jane and follows Taylor and Duff to the car, whispering &quot;Watch me re-position the stars,&quot; to the astrologer who foretold her widowhood and exile.

<text>The Zhan Guo Ce (W-G: Chan-kuo T&#x27;se), also known in English as the Strategies of the Warring States or Annals of the Warring States, is an ancient Chinese text that contains anecdotes of political manipulation and warfare during the Warring States period (5th to 3rd centuriesBC). It is an important text of the Warring States period as it describes the strategies and political views of the School of Diplomacy and reveals the historical and social characteristics of the period.

==History==

The author of &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; has not yet been verified: it is generally deemed, after Zhang Xincheng, that the book was not written by a single author at one time. It is thought to have been composed by Su Qin and his peers, before being obtained by Liu Xiang. Unlike many of the pre-Qin classics, the authenticity of &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, along with the &quot;Shijing&quot;, &quot;Mozi&quot;, &quot;Yulingzi&quot; and &quot;Gongsun Longzi&quot; had never been questioned since the Western Han period. The earliest to assert the texts were apocryphal scriptures was perhaps the compiler of the Annotated Bibliography of the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot;, but he provided no warrant for it. In 1931, Luo Genze put forward an argument that the book was composed by Kuai Tong () in his two papers based on six conclusions which he drew, a contemporary of Han Xin. This argument had been seconded by Jin Dejian (1932) and Zu Zhugeng (1937), but by 1939 it was refuted by Zhang Xincheng.

The six versions of written works from the School of Diplomacy were discovered by Liu Xiang during his editing and proofreading of the imperial literary collection. Those works of political views and diplomatic strategies from the School of Diplomacy were in poor condition, with confusing contents and missing words. Liu Xiang proofread and edited them into the new book under the title &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;; it was therefore not written by a single author at one time.

Significant contents of &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; were lost in subsequent centuries. Zeng Gong of the Northern Song dynasty reclaimed some lost chapters, proofread and edited the modern version. Some writings on cloth were excavated from the Han dynasty tomb at Mawangdui near the city of Changsha in 1973 and edited and published in Beijing in 1976 as &quot;Zhanguo Zonghengjia Shu&quot; (, &quot;Works from the School of Diplomacy During the Warring States Period)&quot;. The book contained 27 chapters, 11 of which were found to be similar to the contents in &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; and the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. That publication appeared in Taiwan in 1977 as the &quot;Boshu Zhanguoce&quot; (). The texts were written in between the style of Seal script and Clerical script. The transcript was probably composed around 195BC before its burial, as the text tend to avoid using the word &quot;bang&quot; (邦), the personal name of Emperor Gao of Han, to circumvent naming taboo. According to James Legge&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; it shares a story with the &quot;Lost Book of Zhou&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Rites&quot;.

==Content==
The &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; recounts the history of the Warring States from the conquest of the Fan clan by the Zhi clan in 490 BC up to the failed assassination of Qin Shi Huang by Gao Jianli in 221 BC.

The chapters take the form of anecdotes meant to illustrate various strategies and tricks employed by the Warring States. With the focus thus being more on providing general political insights than on presenting the whole history of the period, there is no stringent year-by-year dating such as that found in the preceding Spring and Autumn Annals. Stories are sorted chronologically by under which ruler they take place, but within the reign of a single king there is no way to tell if the time elapsed between two anecdotes is a day or a year.

The book comprises approximately 120,000 words, and is divided into 33 chapters and 497 sections. The twelve dynasties the strategies pertain to are:

==Literary criticism==
The intellectual aspects have been disputed due to its stress on fame and profit and its conflicts with Confucian ideology. The book appears to overemphasize the historical contributions from the School of Diplomacy, devaluing the book&#x27;s historical importance.

The book does not emphasize the historical facts or fiction, but appears to be an extensive collection of anecdotes with little bearing to the chronological order of chapter and narration. Since the 12th century, it has been widely debated whether the book should be considered a historical documentation from writer Chao Gongwu and Gao Sisun, and there have been attempts to categorize the book into a different genus. This lasted until 1936 where scholars like Zhong Fengnian demonstrated that the book was written as a handbook of diction from the School of Diplomacy, and not intended to be a compilation of historical facts.

<text>Siming District is an urban district of the city of Xiamen, Fujian province, China. It includes the territory of the old town of Xiamen and the government offices of the modern sub-provincial city.

==Geography==
Siming occupies the southern half of Xiamen Island. It also includes Gulangyu Island to its southwest. The sheltered Yundang Bay responsible for old Xiamen&#x27;s prized harbor was converted into a lake in the 20th century by the addition of landfill from construction.

==History==

The modern Siming District includes the territory of the old town of Xiamen, which had its harbor in the sheltered Yundang Bay. The town took the name &quot;Siming&quot; for a brief period in the early Qing when it was occupied by the Southern Ming loyalist Koxinga, who used it from 1650 as a base to launch attacks on the Manchu drive southwards. He abandoned the island in favor of Taiwan when he defeated the Dutch there. The Qing held the city from the early 1660s, restoring its former name. Gulangyu Island, now part of the district, developed as a foreign enclave after Xiamen became a treaty port at the end of the First Opium War in 1842. After the fall of the Qing in 1912, the Republic of China organized the area around Xiamen as Siming County. It was renamed the Central District in October 1945 after its reconquest from the Japanese. Following its capture by the Communists at the end of the Chinese Civil War, it was renamed Siming District in 1950. In April 1953, its &quot;district bureau&quot; () administration was upgraded to a &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; (). As part of the Cultural Revolution, it was renamed Xiangyang District from August 1966 to October 1979. Along with Huli District to its north, Siming District formed one of the first four special economic zones for foreign investment and trade established by Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Opening Up Policy in the early 1980s. Gulangyu Island and Kaiyuan District were merged into Siming in May 2003.

==Administration==
Before the merge, Siming originally had five local government street offices ():
* Binhai (滨海, &quot;Pin-hai&quot;)
* Siming (思明, &quot;Su-bing&quot;)
* Wen&#x27;an (文安, &quot;Bun-an&quot;)
* Xiagang (厦港, &quot;Ha-kang&quot;)
* Zhonghua (中华, &quot;Tiong-hua&quot;)

The above five were divided into 58 residential committees () and two villages, Zengcuo&#x27;an (曾厝垵, &quot;Tsan-tshu-uann&quot;) and Huangcuo (黄厝, &quot;Ng-tshu&quot;). Xiagang Street was originally a district in 1950.

Today, Siming has ten street offices ():
* Binhai (滨海, &quot;Pin-hai&quot;)
* Zhonghua (中华, &quot;Tiong-hua&quot;) 
* Xiagang (厦港, &quot;Ha-kang&quot;)
* Lianqian (莲前, &quot;Lian-tsian&quot;)
* Jialian (嘉莲, &quot;Ka-lian&quot;)
* Yundang (筼筜, &quot;Uan-tang&quot;)
* Wucun (梧村, &quot;Ngoh-tshng&quot;)
* Kaiyuan (开元, &quot;Khai-guan&quot;)
* Lujiang (鹭江, &quot;Loo-kang&quot;)
* Gulangyu (&quot;Kulangsu&quot;)

These street offices are divided into 95 residential committees ().

==Economy==
Xiamen Bluebird Cartoon Company (), which makes the &quot;XingXing Fox&quot; cartoon, is headquartered in the Amoy Software Park 2 () in Siming District.
