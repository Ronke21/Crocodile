<text>Playmobil () is a German line of toys produced by the Brandstätter Group (Geobra Brandstätter GmbH &amp; Co KG), headquartered in Zirndorf, Germany. The signature Playmobil toy is a tall (1:24 scale) human figure with a smiling face. A wide range of accessories, buildings and vehicles, as well as many sorts of animals, are also part of the Playmobil line.

Playmobil toys are produced in themed series of sets as well as individual special figures and playsets. New products and product lines developed by a 50-strong development team are introduced frequently, and older sets are discontinued. Promotional and one-off products are sometimes produced in very limited quantities. These practices have helped give rise to a sizeable community of collectors. Collector activities extend beyond collecting and free-form play and include customization, miniature wargaming, and the creation of photo stories and stop motion films, or simply as decoration.
==History==
Playmobil was invented by German inventor Hans Beck (1929–2009), considered the &quot;Father of Playmobil&quot;. Beck received training as a cabinetmaker and was also an avid hobbyist of model airplanes, a product he pitched to the company Geobra Brandstätter. Horst Brandstätter, the owner of the company, asked Beck to develop toy figures for children instead. (The company had originally been a producer of casket ornaments and handles.)

Beck spent three years from 1971 to 1974 developing what became Playmobil. Beck conducted research that allowed him to develop a toy that would not be too complex but would nevertheless be flexible. He felt that too much flexibility would get in the way of children&#x27;s imaginations, and too much rigidity would cause frustration. The toy he conceived would fit in a child&#x27;s hand and its facial design was based on children&#x27;s drawings: a large head, a big smile, and no nose. &quot;I would put the little figures in their hands without saying anything about what they were,&quot; Beck remarked. &quot;They accepted them right away ... They invented little scenarios for them. They never grew tired of playing with them.&quot;.

The 1973 oil crisis made it possible for Playmobil to be considered a viable product. The rising oil prices imposed on Geobra Brandstätter, for whom Beck worked as head of development, demanded that the company turn to products that required less solid plastic material than the hula hoops and other large plastic items the company had been producing as toys.

In 1974, the company put the first sets of knights, Native Americans, and construction workers on show in its display rooms. Initially, visitors were reluctant to accept the toy. Nevertheless, the toy was shown at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, which took place that same year. A Dutch firm agreed to buy a whole year&#x27;s production. By the end of the year, Geobra Brandstätter had achieved sales of 3 million Deutschmarks with Playmobil — one-sixth of the company&#x27;s total sales. Playmobil began to be sold worldwide in 1975, and by 2009, approximately 2.2 billion Playmobil figures had been sold. Playmobil’s revenue in 2008 was $589 million.

Playmobil has been a major competitor to Lego toys. Examples of directly competing toys in both their product lines are not hard to find. Within the limitations of the Playmobil toy world, the Playmobil toys are usually realistic, and present accurate representations of arms, armor, costumes, and tools from a recognizable time period. Especially notable for their fine attention to detail are the modern construction and city life toys (automobiles, cranes, fire engines, trains, boats, etc.).

== Products ==
Playmobil toys are specifically aimed at children from the ages of four to twelve. The company believes that older children tend not to play with these types of toys and so they have resisted creating toys from less well-known historical time periods. Many adults own or collect Playmobil and make movies with the toys.

The first Playmobil sets were themed around Native Americans, construction workers and knights.

Playmobil hands were designed to be capable of gripping and holding objects. Earlier figures had arms of one piece. Since 1982 all figures have hands that also rotate at the wrist. Almost all Playmobil figures are unnamed, thus allowing children to invent their own characters. Exceptions to this include the many characters from the three Playmobil-inspired computer video games produced by Ubi Soft Montreal between 1998 and 1999, such as Alex, and Laura, the protagonists from their respective games. The first figures used a chiseled out hairpiece with a button shape for adding headgear, until a later redesign gave the hairpiece a more natural rounded shape, also prompting a redesign of the headgear. The first female figures were distinguished by hairstyle and a wider chestpiece suggesting a skirt, until a redesign replaced the chestpiece with more displayed breasts, smaller waists and slightly thinner arms.

Most Playmobil sets require some assembly by the owner. Buildings especially come with detailed instructions for putting them together. Playmobil building parts were originally designed to fit together using a system of tabs and slots known as &quot;Steck-System&quot;. In recent years a new construction system has been introduced that dispenses with the tabs and instead uses small connector pieces and a special tool. This is known as &quot;System-X&quot; and is now the standard Playmobil construction system, Steck-System having been retired except for special reissues.
Over the years, some proposed sets have included Chinese Railroad Workers and a Grave Digger for the Western theme, as well as a Medieval Torture Room. Prototypes were made. However, these sets were considered insensitive and inappropriate for young children, and were never released. There are however sets including ghosts and a mummy containing a skeleton.

Playmobil pop-up books, in which buildings and settings corresponded to the height of actual Playmobil figures, were sold for a time, as well as a series of comic books, coloring books, and puzzles.

In early 2019, a prototype for a product named Playmobil Pro was posted on LinkedIn. The product line introduced the Playmobil figure into corporate settings, targeting adult professionals in place of children. The concept aimed to rival Lego Serious Play, by incorporating the Playmobil figure into a modelling kit used for corporate creative workshops. The Playmobil Pro figures differ from classic Playmobil figures by their white colouration and simple designs. Playmobil Pro was made available in the United States in January 2020.

=== Licensing ===
A number of different companies were licensed throughout Europe and Latin America to produce and distribute Playmobil figures:

In Spain, figures were produced by the leading dollmaker Famosa, and marketed as &quot;los clicks de Famobil&quot;. Spanish packages listed the quantity of male dolls (&quot;clicks&quot;) and females (&quot;clacks&quot;). Females were distinguished by hairstyle and a wider chestpiece suggesting a skirt.

Greek figures were produced during the 1970s by a company called Lyra.

In Argentina Playmobil is licensed by Antex, for distribution in all South American markets. Previously Playmobil was licensed through a number of different companies, including Brazil&#x27;s , Estrela and Industria de Brinquedos do Amazonas, and Peru&#x27;s BASA.

From 1976 to 1980, Playmobil was licensed by Louis Marx and Company in the United Kingdom and sold under the brand name Playpeople.

Playmobil was introduced to the United States by Mattel and Schaper. In 1982, Schaper arranged a promotion to distribute Playmobil toys nationwide as in McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meals. The five Playmobil toys that were to be included in the promotion were a Sheriff, an Indian, a Sheriff&#x27;s Horse, an Umbrella Girl and a Farmer. Approximately 10 million of the Sheriff and Indian Playmobil toys were distributed from October 22 through November 1, 1982. Before the other toys could be distributed McDonald&#x27;s ceased distribution and promotion of Playmobil at its restaurants after tests showed that the toy failed to comply with Consumer Product Safety Commission standards designed to prevent children under three from choking on dangerous items. (The Playmobil toys were not involved in any reported choking incidents.) McDonald&#x27;s customers with children under three who received these toys were advised to discontinue their use and return the toys to a McDonald&#x27;s in exchange for a dessert, a cone, or a refund.

In 2004, BMW licensed the familiar Playmobil look and feel to release an exclusive BMW Z4 done in Playmobil scale. It also came with two Playmobil passengers. Originally, the only way to get one of these Z4s (available in deep red or blue) was to take a test drive at a BMW dealership in Germany. Shortly thereafter, versions in a pale yellow or eggshell blue were available in European toy stores. Though not manufactured by Playmobil, they were officially licensed.This has subsequently been copied by Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Citroen, Porsche and Mini Cooper. This has been done in similar formats. Read more in the Current Themes Section.

=== Bootlegs and unauthorized figures ===
In 1978, , a German-Hungarian firm, began reproducing bootleg Playmobil figures. They had not received any authorization or license from geobra Brandstätter. Schenk produced exact copies of the original toy, though some sets were modified to create new types of sets, usually military, from Hungarian history. Thus, Schenk produced the Hussar (Huszár), from the period of the Hungarian War of Independence as well as the Hungarian hussar series (Magyar huszár sorozat). Other sets included the Austrian soldier (Osztrák), Turkish soldier (Török), William Tell (Tell Vilmos), and the Hunyadi series (Hunyadi sorozat).

Schenk figures, like the early Playmobil figures, do not have moveable hands, and unlike the Playmobil horses, the Schenk horses do not have moveable heads. Schenk figures also bear different colors from their Playmobil counterparts. They were also made with inferior plastic. Following the collapse of communism, a 1995 court ruling forbade the manufacture and distribution of the Schenk figures. The owner of Schenk, Károly Schenk, was allowed to sell off his remaining toy figures only in Hungary until March 1996. However, Schenk bootlegs may still be available in toy shops in Hungary.

Bootleg sets also have been manufactured in China. These sets are not marketed as Playmobil, though they are identical in terms of appearance (but not in regards to quality). Sets include a &quot;Noshery&quot; (fast food eatery), &quot;Pirate Island&quot;, and medieval figures.

=== European factories ===

There are currently three main factories in Europe: Germany, Malta, and Spain. Each location specializes in a particular area of manufacturing and parts that are needed to assemble a set are delivered to the destination where the items will be placed together and put in their final packaging before sale. Malta specializes in making the characters and a few accessories, Spain specializes in accessories, and Germany makes the bigger items such as ships and castles.

==Distribution==
New Playmobil sets are released over a two-year period, with the non-export markets getting new sets first, then the export markets receiving them a year later. This is done so that Playmobil will only have to make one very expensive mold for each new piece, and still be able to manufacture the initial stock of the new set. This first stock is what initially stocks store shelves; afterwards Playmobil makes smaller quantities to refill shelves in accordance with demand. In order to produce enough sets to release them to the entire world at the same time, Playmobil would need to buy two of each mold. Eventually, as production for the piece slowed down, the second mold would be useless.

==FunParks and FunStores==

There are a number of Playmobil amusement parks, called FunParks, that feature play areas and events themed around Playmobil toys. There are also FunStores within FunParks and, formerly, in other locations. FunStores are dedicated Playmobil shops that carry full lines of current Playmobil releases.

FunPark and FunStore locations include:
* FunPark Athens, Greece (mostly toys vs. outside play areas as in the Malta and Zirndorf parks)
* FunPark Ħal Far, Malta - part of the Playmobil Park manufacturing facility
* FunPark Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US (permanently closed, It was the first and only Playmobil Funpark outside Europe)

* FunPark Zirndorf, Germany - next to the Playmobil headquarters

==Films==
* &quot;The Secret of Pirate Island&quot; (2009): A 3D animated interactive DVD based on the Pirates theme.
* A live-action/animated feature film based on the characters, entitled &quot;&quot;, produced by French studios On Entertainment, Wild Bunch and Pathé (initially set to be distributed by Global Road Entertainment in the United States, prior to the company&#x27;s September 2018 bankruptcy filing; STX Entertainment picked up the US distribution rights), was released in December 2019. Animator Lino DiSalvo makes his directorial debut with the movie.

However, it proved to be a major box-office bomb. According to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Playmobil&quot; was released only weeks after &quot;Frozen II&quot; and used a variable pricing strategy where STX and many theater chains offered $5 tickets. Originally projected to gross $600,000–$800,000 on its opening day, &quot;Playmobil&quot; grossed just $167,000, making it the third-worst opening day of all time for a 2,000-plus theatre production, behind &quot;Delgo&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure&quot; (2012); fourth if counting the 2014 re-release of &quot;Saw&quot; (2004) and 24th if also including films with between 1,000 and 1,999 theaters. It went on to gross $660,000 in its opening weekend (an average of $287 per-venue), the fourth-worst of all-time.

Shortly after the weekend, Grayson responded that STX would use variable pricing in their future projects: &quot;we have already learned from this experiment. And we will continue to learn more and will tweak it for the future so it can be the benefit to the industry that we know it can be.&quot; While the film&#x27;s several worldwide distributors recouped TV sale money, they also financed it via pre-sales and thus face losses. Rebecca Rubin, a &quot;Variety&quot; writer, attributed the low box office to the Playmobil brand being far less popular than Lego.

==TV series==
* In 2014, a CGI animated TV series inspired by Playmobil figures titled &quot;Super 4&quot; was co-produced by Method Animation, PGS Entertainment and Morgen Studios. The series has been broadcast on Boomerang in Latin America, CITV in Britain and Cartoon Network in Italy and Netflix and KidsClick in the United States.
* On 4 November 2020, a CGI animated TV series titled &quot;Novelmore&quot; launched on the Playmobil YouTube channel and on YouTube Kids. Comprising 26 episodes, the series centres around the Knights of Novelmore and their battle for a magical armour.

* At the same time, the latest PLAYMOBIL series experience starts on October 8 on YouTube and YouTube Kids. The intrigue:When the enigmatic Bat Fairies suddenly appear and, led by Bat Fairy Noxana, begin to steal crystals from Ayuma&#x27;s magical energy source, the idyll in the fairy forest is in great danger. Will the young fairies manage to protect their world.
* DUCK ON CALL: a separate series in high-quality CGI animation on YouTube and YouTube Kids takes the little fans to Playmoville and tells about the experiences of the lovable rescuers with a lot of humor.

<text>Robert Shelton, born Robert Shapiro (June 28, 1926, Chicago, Illinois, United States – December 11, 1995, Brighton, England) was a music and film critic.

Shelton helped to launch the career of a then-unknown 20-year-old Bob Dylan. In 1961, Dylan was performing at Gerdes Folk City in the West Village, one of the best-known folk venues in New York, opening for the bluegrass act the Greenbriar Boys. Shelton&#x27;s positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; brought crucial publicity to Dylan and led to a Columbia recording contract. Shelton had previously noted Dylan in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; of WRVR&#x27;s live twelve-hour Hootenanny, July 29, 1961, at Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. &quot;Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner.&quot; This was Dylan&#x27;s first live radio performance.

==Biography==
Shelton was born in Chicago in 1926 under the name Robert Shapiro, the son of Joseph and Hannah Shapiro, Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, a research chemist, was born in Minsk and came to the US in 1905. Shelton was raised in Chicago, served in the US Army in France during 1944–45, and attended the School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He moved to New York in the 1950s, and soon joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1955, Shelton was one of 30 &quot;New York Times&quot; staffers subpoenaed by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, who were informed by &quot;Times&quot; counsel Louis M. Loeb that they would be fired if they took the Fifth Amendment. Shelton refused to answer questions from the committee about any affiliation with the Communist Party or about fellow &quot;Times&quot; staffer Matilda Landsman, and was indicted by a grand jury for contempt. Because he did not plead the Fifth he was allowed to continue working at the &quot;Times&quot; but was transferred away from the news department onto the less sensitive entertainment desk, where he became a music critic. Convicted and sentenced to six months in prison, he appealed his conviction and had it reversed on a technicality, only to be indicted, retried, convicted, and have the conviction overturned on a technicality again. After several years of appeals in which he was represented by noted civil liberties lawyer Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. the case was finally dropped in the mid-1960s.

For a decade (1958–1968), Shelton reviewed music, in particular folk music, but also pop and country music, becoming a friend of many of the artists and extending his influence beyond the pages of the &quot;Times&quot;. He reviewed the inaugural Newport Folk Festival (NFF) for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; and edited the program for the influential 1963 NFF under the pen name &#x27;Stacey Williams&#x27;. He wrote album notes for several artists, including Bob Dylan&#x27;s first album (credited to &#x27;Stacey Williams&#x27;). During the early 1960s, Shelton co-edited a magazine, &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, at the same time as his friend Linda Solomon edited a different magazine titled &quot;ABC-TV Hootenanny&quot;.

Shelton spent 20 years writing and rewriting his Dylan biography, &quot;No Direction Home, The Life and Music of Bob Dylan&quot; which was finally published in 1986, after years of arguments with publishers about the style and length of the work. Shelton&#x27;s intention from the outset was to write a serious cultural study, not a showbiz biography; as a result, he later said his life&#x27;s work had been &quot;abridged over troubled waters&quot;. The title is taken from the lyric of Dylan&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. The same title, &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, was used by Martin Scorsese for his 2005 documentary film about Dylan&#x27;s career from the beginning to his motorcycle crash in 1966. Other books by Shelton include &quot;Electric Muse: The Story Of Folk Into Rock&quot; and &quot;The Face of Folk Music&quot;. An updated edition of this book, &quot;The Electric Muse Revisited,&quot; with new material by Robin Denselow, one of the original quartet of contributors, is scheduled for publication by Omnibus Press in May 2021. The folk music charity Square Roots Productions was midwife to the project. 

In 1969, Shelton moved to the United Kingdom, living in Hampstead and Sydenham, and then (from 1982) in the South Coast town of Brighton where he edited the Arts page of the &quot;Brighton Evening Argus&quot; and then wrote, mostly about films, for a number of other publications up to his death. In 1996, Shelton&#x27;s papers, and his collection of books, records and research material were donated to the Institute of Popular Music at the University of Liverpool.

<doc id="306113" wikidata="Q1963952" url="?curid=306113" title="Nakamichi">
<text>is a Japanese consumer electronics brand founded in Japan which gained a name from the 1970s onwards for audio cassette decks. Nakamichi is a subsidiary of Chinese holding company Nimble Holdings.

Nakamichi manufactured electronic devices from its founding in 1948 but only began selling them under its name from 1972. It is credited with offering the world&#x27;s first three-head cassette deck. Since 1999, its product range has included home cinema audio systems, sound bars, speakers, headphones, mini hi-fi systems, automotive stereo products and video DVD products.

==Background==
Etsuro Nakamichi founded Nakamichi in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (中道研究所株式会社 &quot;Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha&quot;) in Tokyo, Japan. It specializes in manufacturing portable radios, tonearms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder&#x27;s younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering record players, high-end DAT recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.

In the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first open reel tape recorders in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.

Because of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including Harman Kardon, KLH, Advent, Fisher, ELAC, Sylvania, Concord, Ampex and Motorola.

From 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo cassette decks that benefited from the mass market&#x27;s move away from reel-to-reel tape recorders to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced wow and flutter, and Dolby-B noise reduction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable record head azimuth and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.

The Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three microphone inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.

In the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.

In the early 1980s, Nakamichi&#x27;s top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to digital recording media such as CD.

==Notable Nakamichi products and advances==

===Three-head cassette decks===
Nakamichi was the first to use a three-head recording technique in a cassette deck. Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head. The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the playback head.

The first Nakamichi three-head decks were the 1000 and 700 introduced around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and high bias (IEC TYPE II). Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi chose not to do so. The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of blank cassette tapes.

Around 1978, when metal bias (IEC TYPE IV) cassettes came into the market, Nakamichi produced some early metal tape capable decks such as the 580M. The tape settings on these decks were EX (normal bias), SX (high bias), and ZX (metal bias).

Around 1980, Nakamichi introduced the third generation of 1000 and 700 three-head decks. The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape. These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an &quot;Auto Cal&quot; button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette. Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks. Also offered was a third less costly deck the 700ZXE auto tuning cassette deck.

A more expensive 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, with the same specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold-plated face. Other high performance Nakamichi cassette decks are the CR-1 (2 head), CR-2 (2 head), CR-3 (3 head), CR-4 (3 head), CR-5 (3 head), LX-3 (2 head), LX-5 (3 head), Cassette Deck 1 and the Cassette Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the Cassette Deck 1 Limited is more expensive than the regular Cassette Deck 1.

===Flip-Auto Reverse===
Called &quot;UDAR&quot; for Unidirectional Auto Reverse. Used on the Nakamichi RX series of decks. With the advent of auto-reverse (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that the angle of the tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly—a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck. It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The &#x27;top of the range&#x27; RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.

===Tape pressure pad lifter===
A cassette tape contains a &quot;pressure pad&quot; of some type, usually made of felt (reference image). This pad is within the cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the cassette deck, providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played. Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad was a source of audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi&#x27;s dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette&#x27;s pressure pad is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual-capstan decks contain a &quot;cage&quot; around the record/playback heads that lifts the pressure pad out of the way so that the deck itself—specifically, the dual capstan mechanism—is able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback.

===The Dragon and special products===

In the CD era (post 1983), the top line Nakamichi products were termed the &quot;Dragon.&quot; The Dragon-CT turntable (&quot;Computing Turntable&quot;) automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records by moving the platter in two dimensions. The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD and holds multiple CDs. The Dragon cassette deck used a special circuit for azimuth adjustment called &quot;Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction&quot; (NAAC) to find the best sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the manual turnover of tape; in other words, eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and somewhat fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to actually use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.

Other products from Nakamichi did not acquire the &quot;Dragon&quot; name but were still notable. These include the Nakamichi 1000 series products with the 1000ZXL cassette deck being more advanced and expensive than the Dragon cassette deck. The Nakamichi 1000 digital audio tape transport and Nakamichi 1000p digital to audio converter system were Nakamichi&#x27;s reference digital audio tape components. These components were intended to establish Nakamichi&#x27;s dominance in the field of digital audio tape (DAT), but DAT was not widely adopted by audiophiles, as the format itself did not gain acceptance as an industry standard.

===Stasis Series amplifiers===
Nakamichi licensed &quot;Stasis&quot; technology from powerhouse amplifier manufacturer Threshold (a class-A amplifier circuit by Nelson Pass, then a designer at Threshold, now at Pass Labs). This circuit was used in a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers.

===Car stereo products===
In the early 1980s, Nakamichi introduced a line of car stereo products. In 1982, the flagship head unit was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C.

The TD-800 was introduced in 1984, a nearly identical cassette receiver, however, implementing a much simpler transport without manual tape reverse and known for extreme reliability, a highly sought after vintage car audio piece.

Other early products included the TD-500 and TD-700 cassette receivers with manual azimuth adjustment (similar to the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7). Several generations of power amplifier and speakers were introduced over time.

In the early 1990s, Nakamichi was one of the first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge.

Toyota would choose Nakamichi along with Pioneer to manufacture the audio systems for its range of Lexus automobiles. The Nakamichi unit was the flagship audio system offered to Lexus buyers, and this partnership lasted from 1989 to 2001.

Another follow-on flagship head unit was the TP-1200, which consisted of a head unit and a separate &#x27;black box&#x27; pre-amp section. The casing for both units was made from machined aluminum, and the internal circuitry for both units was suspended using a mechanical suspension system. The head unit contained a diversity tuner and display unit only. The pre-amp section performed input switching, volume and tone adjustment. The tone controls (bass-mid-treble) were motor driven analog controls while the volume, balance and fader were digital.

Other products of note were the 100pa amplifier and the limited-edition version the 1000pa. Both were identical in specifications (4x50wrms) and internal layout, the only difference being the case color. The 100pa was silver and the 1000pa black. 
The mobile TD-560 was a versatile pull-out-of-dash and remote-controlled cassette and FM tuner head unit, that performed at the level of excellence matched only by very best Nakamichi mobile decks of the late 1980s era. Revolutionary was Nakamichi&#x27;s mobile PA-350 four channel power amplifiers, with extraordinary discrete amplifiers and exemplary performance specifications.

In 1989 Nakamichi, along with Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. to produce a premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi introduced the music bank in its CD players which was based on a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differed from the rest of the industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi&#x27;s footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best with its Sansui sourced AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1991). Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with Nelson Pass for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high-end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA).

===Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment technology===
The time alignment of an amplified music signal and its distortion components has a profound effect on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.

In layman&#x27;s term, HTA masked distortion through the primary signal. While effective, total harmonic distortion for this technology was higher than Nakamichi&#x27;s receivers utilizing Stasis technology. Whether sound quality improved or dissipated with this technology is left to the listener&#x27;s ears.

==Decline of Nakamichi==
Nakamichi&#x27;s reputation for being the pioneer of audio cassettes no longer carried weight in the era of CDs. The lack of innovative digital technology meant Nakamichi was unable to successfully brand itself in the digital age. Further adding to its demise was a shrinking distribution channel as high-end audio boutiques were forced to close as they could not compete in a rapidly changing environment where shoppers gravitated towards electronic superstores. Ultimately, electronic consumers, who once were able to apply a significant portion of their outlay on audio-only components, needed to allocate more of their budget towards acquiring new video gear such as laser disc players, flat panel displays, DVD players, etc. In addition, a recession in the early 1990s caused many consumers to settle for mainstream electronics brands.

Toyota also stopped using Nakamichi systems in Lexus vehicles at this time, instead choosing Mark Levinson when Toyota made a deal with Harman International to provide premium audio systems in its vehicles in 2000. Bob Carter, General Manager for Lexus, also cited a lack of &quot;resonance&quot; with intended consumers as reasons for the switch.

By the end of 1990s, Nakamichi failed to transition properly. In 1998, it was acquired by Grande Holdings, a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. Grande Holdings included electronics companies Akai and Sansui. Niro Nakamichi left in 1998 to set up Mechanical Research Corporation.

== Nakamichi under Grande Holdings==
The company went into bankruptcy protection on February 19, 2002. In Nakamichi&#x27;s defense, many high-end audio manufacturers were also forced to merge or sell to larger holding companies during this time period partially influenced by the collapse of the Japanese &quot;bubble economy&quot;; such well-known companies include McIntosh and Mark Levinson.

The company emerged from bankruptcy and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of high-end &quot;lifestyle systems&quot; in the same manner as Bang &amp; Olufsen. They also manufacture CD changers for hi-fi, computer, and car audio units.

In June 2006, Nakamichi released its first portable DVD player with built-in LCD screen, the Lumos.

 From 2011, Nakamichi offered a complete line of mass market audio products, including earbuds, headphones, speakers, wireless speakers and sound bars. Also to target a younger demographic, they manufactured iPod docking systems and 3D LED TVs.

In 2014, Nakamichi moved back to its high-end roots and presented a 7.1 pre-/main Amplifier combination AV1/AVP1.

In 2016, its focus shifted to soundbars by introducing its Shockwave soundbar series. The first model, the Shockwave Pro 7.1 soundbar, was the first soundbar to have 7 discrete surround channels.

In 2018, Nakamichi added 4 more models into its Shockwave lineup, incorporating dual subwoofers, quad modular surround speaker technology and DTS:X compatibility. The flagship Shockwave Ultra 9.2 DTS:X, Shockwave Elite 7.2 DTS:X and Shockwave Plus 5.2 were the industry&#x27;s first soundbars designed with two subwoofers, while the Shockwave Pro 7.1 DTS:X featured a single down-firing subwoofer. The Shockwave Ultra 9.2 DTS:X pioneered Nakamichi&#x27;s quad modular surround speaker technology, of which its four surround speakers could be attached as pairs to become two sets of dipoles surround speakers, enabling the sound to reverberate off walls to create the same true surround sound environment as when the four surround speakers were placed individually. During the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas, a series of blind listening battles were conducted for the public, including 2 exclusive sessions for members of the San Francisco Audiophile Society and private sessions to the media. Out of 204 people who participated, 81% voted Nakamichi Shockwave Ultra 9.2 DTS:X Soundbar for best overall performance and 99% voted it for best overall value.

In 2019, Nakamichi released 3 new Shockwave soundbar models, the Shockwave Ultra 9.2.4 SSE, Shockwave Elite 7.2.4 SSE and Shockwave Pro 7.1.4 SSE. Besides retaining the features of the 2018 models, all of the 2019 versions are integrated with Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and proprietary Spatial Surround Elevation (SSE) processing technology. SSE consists of 3 processing engines - Spatial, Surround and Elevation engines - that combine to enhance the overall surround sound performance. The Spatial engine amplifies high frequencies from the input audio signal and engages the high-frequency tweeters on the soundbar and rear/surround speakers to enlarge the spaciousness of the sound. The Surround engine utilizes up mixing, volume and phase improvements to the input audio signal to optimize the clarity and balance of the surround sound. The Elevation engine stables the processing of 3D object-based content including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and interlaces a height effects sound layer into each of the 12-16 speaker drivers (12 for 7.1.4/7.2.4 SSE and 16 for 9.2.4 SSE) located around the user.

Nakamichi&#x27;s shockwave Ultra 9.2 SSE Soundbar System was named a CES 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree. In addition, it won a blind listening contest against the market&#x27;s flagship Dolby Atmos soundbars that was voted by the public and hosted by Brian Tong, an ex-CNET tech editor.

==Niro Nakamichi==
In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra-high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called &quot;engines.&quot; The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the &quot;engine&quot; products were no longer promoted, and a line of home theater products was introduced.

<doc id="306114" wikidata="Q252785" url="?curid=306114" title="Kōnosuke Matsushita">
<text>was a Japanese industrialist who founded Panasonic, the largest Japanese consumer electronics company. Matsushita is referred to as the &quot;God of Management&quot; in Japan.

==Childhood==
Kōnosuke Matsushita was born on 27 November 1894 in Wasamura, now part of Wakayama Prefecture. His father was an affluent landlord in the farming village of Wasa (part of present-day Wakayama city) and was one of the wealthiest men of his community.

==Teenage years==

Shortly after Matsushita left school, he was sent away to Osaka to become an apprentice for a hibachi store. Less than a year into his apprenticeship however, the business failed and Matsushita was left looking for other employment. He then applied for a job with the Osaka Electric Light Company, an electrical utility company. Over the next couple of years, he was promoted several times and his position rose with the company. During this time, Matsushita was introduced to one of his sister&#x27;s friends, Mumeno Iue, and after a short courtship married her. Matsushita, now head of a new family, was well aware of his new responsibilities.

At the age of 22, he was promoted to the position of electrical inspector. It was during this time that Matsushita attempted to introduce his boss to the invention of a new and improved light socket that he had perfected in his spare time. His boss, however, was not enthusiastic.

==Matsushita Electric Industrial Company==

In 1917, Matsushita left Osaka Electric Light Company to set up his own company. Without capital, a formal education, or experience in manufacturing, it would appear the company would fail before it even began. He set up his shop in the basement of his tenement. With his wife, his brother-in-law, and several assistants, he began creating several samples of his product. He attempted to peddle the samples to wholesalers but was unsuccessful because he did not offer more than one product.

Matsushita&#x27;s assistants left his company and he was left with only his wife and brother-in-law, Toshio Iue, who proved to be a capable salesman and manager. Matsushita would have eventually become bankrupt but he was &quot;saved by an unexpected order for a thousand insulator plates for electric fans.&quot; From there, Matsushita was able to continue producing his light sockets. They became popular as wholesalers realized the product was better in quality and less expensive than comparable products in the market. The early years of the company were difficult: he once had to pawn his wife&#x27;s kimono when he found himself short on money. Matsushita&#x27;s products were originally marketed under the name brand of &quot;National&quot; and later moved on to the more recognizable names of Panasonic, Quasar and Technics.

One of Matsushita&#x27;s best products was his invention of a more efficient battery-powered bicycle lamp. During the 1920s, bicycle lamps were candles or oil-burning lamps. They were highly inefficient as they usually only lasted for three hours. He created an oval lamp that used a battery for power and a lightbulb for illumination. He had to personally market his products to retail bicycle shops.

==Expansion==

Matsushita learned a very important lesson in terms of growing a company while he was trying to introduce his bicycle lamp to wholesalers. He realized that even if he had a product that was superior to anything out in the market it would not matter if he could not sell the product. As a result, Matsushita began devising ways to create sales channels for his products by concentrating less on manufacturing and more on building a sales force, which led to a retail store network and finally placed Matsushita&#x27;s company on the map in Japan&#x27;s electrical manufacturing and retail industry.

In 1929, he began setting up a new structure for his company. The company was structured as a parent company and branches of divisions that specialized in a particular product were created. There were three specific products that were being created in Matsushita&#x27;s company at this time: the bicycle lamp and battery division, the electrical socket division, and the radio division. For each of these products, a national sales department was formed with regional offices established in strategic locations. These regional offices were responsible for the coordination of sales and manufacturing. Products were manufactured based upon the demand for the products. As a result, manufacturing was dependent on sales.

==Post-war period==
During the US occupation of Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur decided to break up the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; business conglomerates of Japan. Matsushita was in danger of being removed as president but was saved by a favorable petition signed by 15,000 employees. In 1947, Kōnosuke lent his brother-in-law Toshio to an underused manufacturing plant to manufacture bicycle lamps, a business that eventually became Sanyo Electric.

From 1950 to 1973, Matsushita&#x27;s company became one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of electrical goods, sold under well-known trademarks including Panasonic and Technics. Matsushita stepped down as President of Panasonic in 1961 and was succeeded as president by his son-in-law, Masaharu Matsushita. Konosuke Matsushita&#x27;s two grandsons are Masayuki Matsushita, who is the current vice-chairman of Panasonic, and Hiro Matsushita, who is a former driver in the Champ Car series and owns Swift Engineering, an aerospace firm and race car constructing company which he bought in 1991. Hiro Matsushita is also the chairman of , which is located in Kobe, Japan.

Konosuke Matsushita remained active in Panasonic&#x27;s operations until his complete retirement in 1973. Since 1954, Matsushita also gained a significant shareholding in manufacturer JVC by forming an alliance. It still retains a 50% share today. In retirement, Matsushita focused on developing and explaining his social and commercial philosophies and wrote 44 published books. One of his books, entitled &quot;Developing A Road To Peace And Happiness Through Prosperity&quot;, sold over four million copies. In 1979, at the age of 84, he founded the to train the future politicians and businessmen of Japan.

In 1987, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers.

==Death==
Chronic lung problems led to his death from pneumonia on 27 April 1989, at the age of 94. He died with personal assets worth US$3 billion, and left a company with US$42 billion in revenue business.

<doc id="306117" wikidata="Q1351930" url="?curid=306117" title="Gerard Philips">
<text>Gerard Leonard Frederik Philips (9 October 1858 – 26 January 1942) was a Dutch industrialist and co-founder, with his father Frederik Philips, of Philips as a family business in 1891. In 1912, Gerard and his younger brother Anton Philips converted the business to a corporation by founding NV Philips&#x27; Gloeilampenfabrieken.

==Career and family==

Born to a Dutch family of Jewish heritage, his father Benjamin Frederik David Philips was a first cousin to Karl Marx (Gerard&#x27;s paternal grandmother Sophie Pressburg was a sister of Henriette Pressburg, the mother of Karl Marx). His mother was Maria Heyligers. His grandfather was tobacco merchant Lion Philips. 

Gerard Philips became interested in electronics and engineering. His father Frederik financed Gerard&#x27;s purchase of the old factory building in Eindhoven where he established the first factory in 1891. With his brother he came up with a plan: cost effective, reliable incandescent light bulbs. They initially operated the Philips Company as a family business, with Gerard&#x27;s younger brother Anton and Anton&#x27;s son Frits Philips and son-in-law Frans Otten later brought into the business. 

On 19 March 1896, Philips married Johanna van der Willigen (30 September 1862 – 1942). They had no children.

==Civic activities==
Gerard and his brother Anton supported education and social initiatives in Eindhoven, including the Philips Sport Vereniging (Philips Sports Association), which they founded. From it the professional football department developed into the independent Philips Sport Vereniging N.V.

<doc id="306125" wikidata="Q7695656" url="?curid=306125" title="Telautograph">
<text>The telautograph is an ancestor of the modern fax machine. It transmits electrical signals representing the position of a pen or tracer at the sending station to repeating mechanisms attached to a pen at the receiving station, thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing, writing, or signature made by the sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe had used a constantly moving strip of paper to make such transmissions and the pen could not be lifted between words. Surprisingly, at least from a modern perspective, some early telautographs used digital/pulse-based transmission while later more successful devices reverted to analog signaling.
==Invention==

The telautograph&#x27;s invention is attributed to the American engineer Elisha Gray, who patented it on July 31, 1888. Gray&#x27;s patent stated that the telautograph would allow &quot;one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit.&quot; It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars. The telautograph was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago.

Gray started experimenting in 1887 with analog transmission of the pen position signals using variable resistances as was done in previous devices, but was dissatisfied with the performance he achieved. He then turned to pulse-based or digital pen position transmission. 

Gray&#x27;s early patents show devices to accomplish the required functions over two line wire circuits with a common ground connection. Pulses were sent over each wire to signal small steps of pen movement. Momentary current interruptions of a baseline direct current signaled pen lifting/lowering and paper feed, and changing polarities were used to encode pen movement direction. 

While the patent schema&#x27;s geometry implies vertical and horizontal coordinates, Gray&#x27;s first practical system (discussed later) had a different coordinate scheme, based on transmitting two radial distances along approximately diagonal directions from two fixed points. Later systems used in the 20th century
transmitted the angle of two crank arm joints in a five bar linkage, comprising two pen motor cranks, two pen linkage bars, and the body of the instrument.

In an 1888 interview in &quot;The Manufacturer &amp; Builder&quot; (Vol. 24: No. 4: pages 85–86) Gray said:

By my invention you can sit down in your office in Chicago, take a pencil in your hand, write a message to me, and as your pencil moves, a pencil here in my laboratory moves simultaneously, and forms the same letters and words in the same way. What you write in Chicago is instantly reproduced here in fac-simile. You may write in any language, use a code or cipher, no matter, a fac-simile is produced here. If you want to draw a picture it is the same, the picture is reproduced here. The artist of your newspaper can, by this device, telegraph his pictures of a railway wreck or other occurrences just as a reporter telegraphs his description in words.

However these first devices were crude to the point of uselessness. Some of his subsequent refinements
changed the encoding scheme. They also mention use of four wires for increased speed and accuracy, but the additional wires were later abandoned. It&#x27;s clear from the commentary in these and other patents that Gray needed to increase the speed and accuracy of his pulse based system, and in fact he patented a large number of increasingly complicated and refined mechanisms to achieve this.

In 1893 Gray&#x27;s system using the mechanism seen in Pat. US491347 was good enough to exhibit at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair and at a Royal Society conversazione in London in 1894. An article in Manufacturer and Builder of this year describes the current and previous versions. Apparently at this stage Gray used 40 steps per inch. It&#x27;s clear how challenging the technical problem was; a later film of a similar device shows the rapidity with which an operator might move the pen. This type of use would produce perhaps 600-1000 pulses per second on a digital system, a challenge for any electromechanical system connected over earth return telephone/telegraph lines. A more elegant technology was around the corner, and an analog coup was being staged at the turn of the century. 

By the end of the 19th century the telautograph was modified by Foster Ritchie, a former Gray assistant. Calling it the telewriter, Ritchie&#x27;s version of the telautograph could be used for either copying or speaking over the same telephone connection.

Ritchie had returned to the analog principle and made it work well. He did this by adding an AC signal whenever the pen needed to be lowered, on top of the direct current position signal already on the line wires. The angle of the two pen crank bars was turned into the position signal by two rheostats, driving large D&#x27;Arsonval movements at the receiver that moved similar crank bars, in turn moving the receiver pen. Interruption of the direct current advanced the paper. 

The AC pen lowering signal was highly important. If Ritchie understood the significance of this technique, he strangely failed to reveal (or protect) this principle in his patents. George S. Tiffany on behalf of the Gray National Telautograph Company understood the significance of the AC signal quite well. In the patent he filed shortly after and presumably in response to Ritchie
he explains that the use of either an AC signal superimposed on the pen current signal or intentional mechanical vibrations added at the receiver can overcome static pen and actuator friction, and allow the pen to follow the transmitter quite perfectly. This principle is in common use today in the form of dither, as applied to proportional pneumatic and hydraulic control valves and regulators. A dither signal can overcome both magnetic hysteresis and static friction and was preferable to mechanical vibration, as later Telautograph designs
used it exclusively. 

Apparently this technique worked well, because even though Tiffany studiously avoided every constructional feature of Ritchie&#x27;s patent, he used the exact same fundamental technique, and the analog telautograph principle continued to be used for at least the next 35 years, such as in those installed in the Frick Art Reference Library around 1935, also see interior view. Tiffany patents after 1901 
refined the mechanism but not the principle.

Ritchie marketed his design as the Telewriter in the UK. The claim in this last reference that the phone and Ritchie&#x27;s telautograph could be used simultaneously over the same line is dubious given the interference to be expected between the AC pen control signal and a phone signal, and statements to the contrary in Ritchie&#x27;s patents. Contemporary accounts describe the operations separately and not together or even describe the telautograph being disconnected when the telephone was in use.

All available images and descriptions of commercial telautographs after 1901 depict the open loop analog devices that Ritchie pioneered. While Tiffany did eventually design a servomechanism controlled telautograph in 1916 it&#x27;s not clear if this was ever commercialized.

==Usage==
The telautograph became very popular for the transmission of signatures over a distance, and in banks and large hospitals to ensure that doctors&#x27; orders and patient information were transmitted quickly and accurately.

Teleautograph systems were installed in a number of major railroad stations to relay hand-written reports of train movements from the interlocking tower to various parts of the station. The teleautograph network in Grand Central Terminal included a public display in the main concourse into the 1960s; a similar setup in Chicago Union Station remained in operation into the 1970s.
A telautograph was used in 1911 to warn workers on the 10th floor about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that had broken out two floors below.

An example of a telautograph machine writing script can be seen in the 1956 movie &quot;Earth vs the Flying Saucers&quot; as the output device for the mechanical translator. The 1936 movie &quot;Sinner Take All&quot; shows it being used in an office setting to secretly message instructions to a secretary.

The Telautograph Corporation changed its name several times. In 1971, it was acquired by Arden/Mayfair. In 1993, Danka Industries purchased the company and renamed it &quot;Danka/Omnifax&quot;. In 1999, Xerox corporation purchased the company and called it the &quot;Omnifax division&quot;, which has since been absorbed by the corporation.

Machines like the telautograph are still in use today. The Allpoint Pen is currently in use and has been used to register tens of thousands of voters in the United States, and the LongPen, an invention conceived of by writer Margaret Atwood, is used by authors to sign their books at a distance.

<doc id="306127" wikidata="Q411186" url="?curid=306127" title="Aiwa">
<text>Aiwa (, stylised aiwa) is a Japanese consumer electronics brand of Aiwa Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Towada Audio holdings. The current company was established in 2017 and creates mainly audio products; the brand is also licensed to or owned by other companies in different regions of the world, producing various electronics.

The original Aiwa company was founded in 1951 and was one of the leading creators of audio products such as speakers, boomboxes and stereo systems. After stagnating in the latter half of the 1990s, Aiwa was merged into Sony in 2002 and then unsuccessfully relaunched as a low-cost brand until discontinuation by 2008. Aiwa was relaunched as an independent company in Japan in 2017 by Towada, two years after it was first revived by an American firm.

==Name and logo history==
In Japanese the Aiwa name is a combination of 愛 (ai) and 環 (wa), roughly meaning &quot;circle of love&quot;.
==Original Aiwa company (1951-2002)==

The company was founded on June 20, 1951, as AIKO Denki Sangyo Co., Ltd., manufacturing microphones, and changed its name to , on March 10, 1959. The founder Mitsuo Ikejiri served as president until 1969 when Sony purchased a majority share in Aiwa. By 1982, the electronics giant had a 54.6% stake in the company, effectively giving it a majority control. Aiwa was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from October 1961 until September 2002.

The company was a leading manufacturer of audio products, including headphone stereos, mini-component stereo systems, portable stereo systems, minidisc players, CD and cassette players, and car stereo systems throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Despite not having the brand recognition of Sony, Aiwa products were popular due to their more affordable cost, while still providing good quality.
Aiwa created the first Japanese cassette tape recorder in 1964. Aiwa marketed Japan&#x27;s first boombox, the TPR-101, in 1968, as well as the first cassette deck, TP-1009. In 1980, Aiwa created the world&#x27;s first personal stereo recorder, TP-S30 (marketed as &quot;CassetteBoy&quot; in Japan). Despite Sony being the major shareholder, healthy competition between the two brands was believed to be profitable. It had also released the first cassette deck with Dolby C in its home country. In 1990, Aiwa created the HP-J7 earbuds, designed to be vertically inserted into the ear. In 1993, the first CD+G-compatible portable CD player, the XP-80G, was made.

Aiwa home audio products incorporating BBE signal-processing technology were launched in about 1989, after the company signed a licensing deal with BBE Sound. Also around this time, some Aiwa products were briefly being sold in Japan under the Excelia and Strasser sub-brands.

With growing competition throughout the late 1990s from cheaper Asian manufacturers, and shrinking demand for its products, the company slid towards bankruptcy. In March 2001, the company&#x27;s president, Masayoshi Morimoto, announced a major restructuring, including the halving of its workforce, following a second consecutive loss–making year. It also announced the closure of all but one of its manufacturing plants, including all in its home country.

=== Other products ===

Apart from audio products, Aiwa also has been present in other industries. The company also made and sold video products such as VCRs, color televisions, DVD players, and digital satellite television tuners. Aiwa was also involved in the production of computer peripheral devices, such as modems, terminal adapters, and speakers, and what the company termed &quot;life amenity products,&quot; such as air cleaners and humidifiers. In 1995, it released a PHS mobile phone, called the PT-H50, which was made for the DDI Pocket network in Japan. That same year, an electric toothbrush, the HA-C10, was released.

===Sales and manufacturing===

Nearly 86 percent of company revenues were derived from such audio products. 12 percent came from products such as televisions and VCRs, and the remaining two percent from computer peripherals and other life products.

Aiwa manufactured more than 89 percent of its output outside Japan, with a heavy emphasis on the lower-cost southeast Asian nations of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The company was also heavily dependent on overseas sales, with more than 80 percent of total revenues being generated outside Japan, with 43 percent in North and South America, 25 percent in Europe, and 13 percent in areas of Asia outside Japan and in other regions.

===Acquisition by Sony===
Financially-troubled Aiwa was fully purchased by the Sony Corporation, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary effective as of December 1, 2002. On January 8, 2003, Sony announced the rebranding and relaunch of Aiwa as a &quot;youth focused, PC-centric&quot; electronics brand. A new logo was presented to the world&#x27;s media along with a statement of Sony&#x27;s intention to invest in and &quot;revitalize&quot; the Aiwa brand. The direction proposed was to capitalize on the growing trend among personal-computer-literate teenagers and young adults to use their PCs for all forms of entertainment (television, films, music, chat). It was also used to expand in markets where Sony is not as strong.
Aiwa introduced its first digital audio players at CES 2004, including both flash players and a 2GB hard disk player. They notably supported MP3 format while Sony&#x27;s own branded players only played ATRAC. Aiwa&#x27;s portable CD players were equipped with a so-called &quot;E.A.S.S. G.P.&quot; (&quot;Electronic Anti-Shock System&quot;) feature with the aim of allowing smooth, skip-free Audio CD playback despite damaged media and external shaking.

However the new direction of Aiwa under Sony did not meet consumer and sales expectations. On January 21, 2005, new product development ended, and by 2007, Aiwa products were discontinued and no longer sold in the market outside its home market. Sony announced the termination of the brand entirely on May 14, 2008 but continued to provide support for existing products.

==Revival of Aiwa==
Aiwa returned as a brand in 2015 and has since been used by various companies globally. It is mostly owned by Towada Audio since 2017.

===Aiwa Corp (Chicago) and Sakar International===
An American audio company known as Hale Devices, Inc. were granted the rights to the brand name from Sony in the US market and abroad. The Chicago based company, which was headed by Joe Born, also then renamed itself to Aiwa Corporation. In April 2015 it launched its first Aiwa product, the Exos-9 speaker. The company launched a number of Aiwa branded products in the following years, including the Prodigy and Arc-1 headphones.
In September 2020, Aiwa Corporation and Aiwa Co., Ltd. of Japan announced that their businesses had unified, with a vision to rebuild Aiwa as a single global brand. The two companies had previously fought court cases over Aiwa trademarks in Illinois as well as in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

It was reported in August 2021 that Aiwa Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Following bankruptcy proceedings, the assets were sold to a new company (Aiwa Acquisitions LLC) affiliated with Sakar International, Inc. in November 2021, with Sakar being a licensee to Infinity Lifestyle Brands, thus making Aiwa a sister brand of Altec Lansing in the North American market. This new Aiwa showcased a number of new products at the Consumer Electronics Show 2023.

=== Aiwa Co., Ltd. (2017–)===
On April 11, 2017, Towada Audio, a contract manufacturer of Sony radios, acquired the Aiwa brand rights from Sony (globally, except the Americas) and created a subsidiary called Aiwa Co. Ltd. like the original Aiwa, with its director Kazuomi Nakamura being someone who joined the original Aiwa in 1989. The news of the Aiwa brand&#x27;s revival was met highly positively in Japan, which showed its brand recognition.

The company launched the first Aiwa products at the end of the year, including radio cassette players, LCD televisions and record players. For global expansion, it established Aiwa Electronics International Co., Ltd., headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. From a public statement released by Aiwa Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan), &quot;Aiwa Corporation (Chicago, USA) are in not in any way related to us, Aiwa Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan) or Aiwa Japan since 1951 to date&quot;.

In 2020, Aiwa launched the HPB-SW40 (&quot;ButterflyAudio&quot;) through crowdsourcing in Japan, a wearable headphone with a unique design that sits on the shoulders. Also in 2020 it launched a record player style Bluetooth speaker and radio (SB-LFS30), a radio cassette recorder (TR-A30) and pocket analogue radio (AR-AP35).

Aiwa Vietnam was formed in 2020 and debuted with the release of smart TVs in the country. In 2021, Aiwa partnered with 5,000 retailers in India to relaunch in the country. Aiwa India launched a new series of smart TVs, the Magnifiq series, in July 2022. The regional headquarters of Aiwa in India, which serves the South Asia region, is currently headed by Ajay Mehta.

===Other Aiwa companies===
;Latin America
In Mexico and other countries in Latin America, the Aiwa rights are owned by Audio Mobile Americas, S.A. based in Panama which relaunched the brand in 2017. This company sells products such as smart TVs, headphones, speakers and others.

;Brazil
The Aiwa brand relaunched in Brazil in 2022 after being licensed by MK Group, owner of Mondial. It started with producing new televisions at a former Sony manufacturing plant in Manaus.

;Aiwa Digital
In June 2022, Aiwa Co., Ltd. announced that it granted the use of its trademark in the digital field to a Japanese contract manufacturer named JENESIS. JENESIS then announced its first smartphone, tablet and smartwatch products under its &quot;aiwa digital&quot; series. It also sells musical instruments. New subsidiary Aiwa Marketing Japan Co., Ltd. (joint venture with Aiwa Co., Ltd.) was established in 2023.

;Aiwa Home
Since 2023, the New Jersey, USA based company Xtreme Connected Home, a part of JEM Accessories, has licensed the Aiwa brand from its North American owner and released home and kitchen appliances domestically.

<text>Daewoo ( ; ; ; ; literally &quot;great universe&quot; and a portmanteau of &quot;dae&quot; meaning great, and the given name of founder and chairman Kim Woo-choong) also known as the Daewoo Group, was a major South Korean chaebol (type of conglomerate) and automobile manufacturer.

It was founded on 22 March 1967 as Daewoo Industrial and was declared bankrupt on 1 November 1999, with debts of about US$50 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Daewoo was the third largest conglomerate in South Korea, behind the Hyundai Group and Lucky-Goldstar (later became LG Corporation). There were about 20 divisions under the Daewoo Group, some of which survived as independent companies.

== History ==
=== Beginning and development ===
The Daewoo Group was founded by Kim Woo-choong in March 1967. He was the son of the Provincial Governor of Daegu. He graduated from the Kyonggi High School, then finished with an Economics Degree at Yonsei University in Seoul.

During the 1960s, after the end of the Syngman Rhee government, the new government of Park Chung Hee intervened to promote growth and development in the country. It increased access to resources, promoted exports, financed industrialization, and provided protection from competition to the chaebol in exchange for a company&#x27;s political support. In the beginning, the Korean government instigated a series of five-year plans under which the chaebol were required to achieve a number of basic objectives.

Daewoo did not become a major player until the second five-year plan. Daewoo benefited from government-sponsored cheap loans based on potential export profits. The company initially concentrated on labor-intensive clothing and textile industries that provided high profit margins because of South Korea&#x27;s large and relatively inexpensive workforce.

The third and fourth of the five-year plans occurred from 1973 to 1981. During this period, the country&#x27;s labor force was in high demand. Competition from other countries began eroding South Korea&#x27;s competitive edge. The government responded to this change by concentrating its efforts on mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding, petrochemicals, construction, and military initiatives. At the end of this period, the government forced Daewoo into shipbuilding. Kim was reluctant to enter this industry, but Daewoo soon earned a reputation for producing competitively priced ships and oil rigs.

During the next decade, the Korean government became more liberal in its economic policies. Small private companies were encouraged, protectionist import restrictions were loosened, and the government reduced positive discrimination (affirmative action), to encourage free market trade and to force the chaebol to be more aggressive abroad. Daewoo responded by establishing a number of joint ventures with U.S. and European companies. It expanded exports of machine tools, defense products (under the S&amp;T Daewoo company), aerospace interests, and semiconductor design and manufacturing. Eventually, it began to build civilian helicopters and airplanes, priced considerably cheaper than those produced by its U.S. counterparts. It also expanded efforts in the automotive industry and was ranked as the seventh largest car exporter and the sixth largest car manufacturer in the world. Throughout this period, Daewoo experienced great success at turning around faltering companies in South Korea.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Daewoo Group also produced consumer electronics, computers, telecommunications products, construction equipment, buildings, and musical instruments.

=== Crisis and collapse ===

Daewoo Group ran into deep financial trouble in 1998 due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, increasingly precarious relationships with the Korean government under President Kim Dae-jung, and its own poor financial management. With the Korean government in deficit, access to cheap and nearly unlimited credit was severely restricted.

In 1998, due to the impact of the foreign exchange crisis ln the end, after Daewoo group went bankrupt, dissolution subsidiaries, in a year where the group lost a total of on sales of . At the end of 1997, South Korea&#x27;s fourth-largest chaebol had a debt of nearly five times their equity. While Samsung and LG cut back in the midst of the economic crisis, Daewoo took on 40% more debt.

By 1999, Daewoo, the second largest conglomerate in South Korea with interests in about 100 countries, went bankrupt, with debts of about US$50 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ).

Soon after the demise, Kim Woo-choong fled to Vietnam, and former Daewoo factory workers put up wanted posters with his picture. Kim returned to Korea in June 2005 and was promptly arrested. He was charged with masterminding accounting fraud of 41 trillion won (US$43.4 billion), illegally borrowing 9.8 trillion won (US$10.3 billion), and smuggling US$3.2 billion out of the country, according to South Korea&#x27;s Yonhap News Agency. On 30 May 2006, Kim was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement. On the last day of the trial, Kim tearfully addressed the court, &quot;I cannot dodge my responsibility of wrongly buttoning up the final button of fate.&quot;

=== Breakup and present status ===
The group was reorganized into three separate parts: Daewoo Corporation, Daewoo Engineering &amp; Construction and Daewoo International Corporation. They are active in many markets, most significantly in steel processing, ship building and financial services. The corporate entity known as &quot;Daewoo Corporation&quot; is now known as &quot;Daewoo Electronics&quot; and is focused solely on manufacturing electronics.

Daewoo Electronics survives to this day, despite bankruptcy, with a new brand logo &quot;DE&quot;, but many of the other subsidiaries and divisions have become independent or simply perished. In North America, Target stores market Daewoo Electronics products under their &quot;Trutech&quot; brand on an ODM basis.

In 2004, General Motors pulled the Daewoo brand of vehicles out of Australia and New Zealand, citing irreparable brand damage. Later that same year, GM announced that Daewoo Motors in Europe would be rebadged as Chevrolet on 1 January 2005. In 2005, it was announced that Daewoo cars would have a Holden badge in Australia and New Zealand. In South Africa, Thailand, and the Middle East, Daewoo models were already branded Chevrolet. In South Korea, Daewoo was renamed GM Korea.

As part of the company reorganization, the content and the structure of its brand portfolio (its brand architecture) was reorganized. In 2011, GM discontinued the Daewoo brand name in South Korea and Vietnam and replaced it with the Chevrolet brand. The brand stayed used by GM in various CIS countries where it had a strong presence such as Belarus, Tajikistan, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan until the mid-2010s. It was progressively phased out and replaced by Chevrolet or Ravon.

The Daewoo commercial vehicle manufacturer was taken over by Tata Motors.

=== Involvement in Myanmar ===
Daewoo also moved into the oil and gas industry. While Western oil and gas companies were unwilling to conduct business in Myanmar, Daewoo is one of three oil companies, along with the French company TotalEnergies and the American company Unocal, operating in the country. During explorations in 2008, Daewoo found one of the largest gas fields in southeast Asia, the Shwe offshore field, in the Bay of Bengal, about 100 km off Sittwe. The field went into production in 2013.

== Corporations ==

Daewoo Group had under its umbrella several major corporations:
* Daewoo Electronics, a strong force both internationally and in South Korea (sub-branch Daewoo Electronic Components Co. Ltd, Daewoo Electric Motor Industries Ltd., Orion Electric Co. Ltd.)
* Daewoo Electronic Components manufactures and sells a variety of electronic parts and components, especially for automobile, televisions, monitors, VHS Players and other multimedia products.
* Daewoo Motors, the motor vehicles division (sub-branch Daewoo Automotive Components Co. Ltd., Daewoo Bus Co., Ltd., Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd.)

* Daewoo Precision Industries produced small calibre firearms, auto parts and pianos. It was spun off in February 2002 and relisted on the South Korean stock-market in March 2002. It was renamed S&amp;T Daewoo Co., Ltd in September 2006, and then S&amp;T Motiv Co., LTD in March 2012.
*Daewoo Textile Co. Ltd.
* Daewoo Heavy Industries (DHI), which created heavy duty machinery

* Daewoo International, a trading organization
* Daewoo Development Co. Ltd., managing Daewoo hotels around the world and had the Millennium Seoul Hilton franchise in South Korea
* IAE (Institute for Advanced Engineering): research and development integrated center

A further subsidiary was the Daewoo Development Company, funded by cash from the Group and set up to develop hotels. Seven were built in South Korea, China, Vietnam, and Africa. They were personally designed and furnished by Kim Woo-jung&#x27;s socialite wife Heeja, who was chairwoman of the company. The most lavish is the 5-star Hanoi Daewoo Hotel, which cost US$163 million to build in 1996 and was decorated by Heeja with fine art, porcelain, sculptures, and marble. She invited 3,000 guests to the opening, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim is believed to have spent time there while &quot;on the run&quot;.

===Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd.===
Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd. was founded when the Daewoo Group purchased Saehan Motor in 1978, but the Daewoo Motor name did not appear until 1983.

The Daewoo Motor brand appeared in the UK in 1995. At the time, it was the only manufacturer not using traditional dealerships – it owned and operated its own retail network. It was once considered to be among the top 10 motor companies in terms of production.

Due to financial trouble, Daewoo&#x27;s automotive arm, Daewoo Motors, was sold to General Motors (Korean) in 2001. The Daewoo nameplate continued in South Korea and Vietnam until 2011. The former Daewoo facilities are now producing General Motors vehicles for Asian markets.

Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Division was sold to Tata Motors.

== The Daewoo brand today ==
As of September 2022, companies that remain with the &quot;Daewoo&quot; brand name are:
* Daewoo E&amp;C – Specializing in construction
* Daewoo Express – Inter-city common carrier of passengers by bus serving over 60 destinations in Pakistan.
* Tata Daewoo – Specializing in commercial vehicles, wholly owned by Tata Motors of India
* Zyle Daewoo Bus – Specializing in buses

<doc id="306140" wikidata="Q1426408" url="?curid=306140" title="Honda Integra">
<text>The , sold in North America as the Acura Integra and later the Acura RSX, is an automobile produced by the Japanese company Honda from 1985 until 2006, and then since 2021. It succeeded the Quint as a more luxurious and sport-oriented derivative of the Civic. The Integra was one of the launch models for Acura in the US in 1986 alongside the Acura Legend. Throughout its production run, the Integra was highly regarded for its handling and performance. The 1995–2001 Integra Type R is widely regarded as one of the best front-wheel-drive cars of all time.

The Integra nameplate was revived in 2021 after a 16-year hiatus. The Honda Integra nameplate is used for a restyled Honda Civic sedan for the Chinese market, while the Acura Integra nameplate is used for a Civic-based liftback for North America, replacing the Acura ILX.


== First generation (1985) ==
This vehicle debuted in Japan in February 1985 as the Honda Quint Integra, available only at Honda&#x27;s Japanese dealership sales channel &quot;Honda Verno&quot; before going on sale a year later in North America as part of the then-new luxury Acura lineup. The three-door liftback was the only model available originally, with a five-door arriving in October 1985, and a four-door saloon bodystyle becoming available in Japan in the autumn of 1986. Only the liftback versions were sold in the U.S. A 1.6 L DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder engine powered most versions. The engine was the vehicle&#x27;s most publicized feature, as DOHC, multi-valve engines were not commonplace in entry-level models at the time. In most European countries, only the five-door liftback was offered, as a replacement for the Honda Quint. Typically for European Integras, only the 1.5-liter 4 Weber carburetors engine was available. The five-door liftback model was also sold in Australia rebadged as the Rover 416i. Except for in Britain, Honda did not offer the more powerful 1.6 DOHC fuel injection engine (in the UK known as the Integra EX16) in Europe. The ZC engine was also shared with the Honda Concerto, which was sold at newly established Japanese dealership sales channel called &quot;Honda Clio&quot;, which sold luxury oriented products like the Honda Legend.

In Japan, while the VX- and RX-trimmed four-door (DA2) used the 1.5 L EW5 engine, all other model and trim combinations offered only the DOHC ZC engine, with a carburetor on GS, ZS, and LS trim packages, and PGM-FI on the top level GSi three- and five-door, and the RSi three-door trim package. Vehicles installed with a carburetor earned in Japanese Government emissions tests and , and at consistent speeds above . Vehicles with PGM-FI earned in Japanese Government emissions tests with , and above . In Japan, the Integra took the entry level marketing position at &quot;Honda Verno&quot;, below the sporty Prelude and larger, luxury focused Vigor.

Compared to the US, the European Integra was aimed downmarket and generally lacked equipment, with neither trim level (LX or EX) offering painted bumpers, central locking, power windows, nor air conditioning, even though a small number of fully equipped, left-hand drive fuel-injected Integras were sold in the Netherlands. The Integra EX16 did offer a sunroof, painted bumpers, a rear spoiler and Hi-Fi stereo equipment, but neither electric windows, central locking nor air conditioning were available. This was considered as a drawback to its European competitors such as the Peugeot 309 1.6 injection and the Renault 11 Turbo, that all could be equipped with comprehensive, albeit expensive, equipment. The first Integra never became as popular in Europe as it did in the US, but was praised by most motor magazines for its styling and overall road performance. The styling reflected the popularity of Honda&#x27;s performance coupe, the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; sports coupe companion Honda Prelude, with the Integra offering a coupe for added cargo accommodation, and a slightly smaller appearance to the larger Honda Vigor. Largely unencumbered by emissions regulations, British market cars produce in the 1.5 and in the 1.6-liter EX16.

Being designed as the successor of the Honda Quint, the Integra is closely related to the Civic, although it featured a small list of key upgrades over its smaller stablemate to help merit a price increase over the CRX Si, which was otherwise the sportiest subcompact vehicle being offered by &quot;Honda Verno&quot;; enlarged 4-wheel disc brakes replaced the small front-disc/rear-drum setup used by the Civic and CRX, suspension calibration was re-worked, better tires were used and a 113-hp DOHC fuel-injected 16-valve engine was used in place of the SOHC unit from the CRX Si. Just like the Prelude and the Vigor of that period, the Integra featured sleek, sporty pop-up headlights, like its Japanese dealership &quot;Honda Verno&quot; stablemates, with the CRX adopting semi-concealed doors over the headlights. Nearly 228,000 units were sold during the four-year run of the first-generation model, most of them in the United States.

The first-generation Acura Integra came with 1.6-liter DOHC 16-valve 4-cylinder (D16A1) engine which received an update mid-cycle. The 86–87 engine is commonly called the &quot;Browntop&quot; while the 88–89 engines are referred to as the &quot;Blacktop&quot; due to the color of their valve covers. The improvements in the &quot;blacktop&quot; engine included lighter rods, domed pistons for slightly higher compression, and an electric advance distributor (the &quot;browntop&quot; came with a vacuum advance distributor). The overall gain in performance was about for .

The Integra received a minor facelift in 1987 for the 1988 model year which featured slightly reshaped indicator lights, an improved climate control system and an update of the instrument clocks. In Europe, the Integra five-door Liftback was discontinued in October 1989 following the launch of the Rover-based Honda Concerto.

This was the only generation to offer 3-, 4-, and 5-door models. Production of the 5-door liftback ceased in 1988.

== Second generation (1989) ==
An all new Integra was introduced in 1989. The second-generation Integra continued to be available as a hatchback coupe but also a new 4-door notchback is available instead of a 5-door hatchback. The Integra coupe has a wheelbase that is longer than the previous generation and weights approximately 190-235 lbs more depending on the model.

The second-generation Integra was introduced in April 1989, featuring the first VTEC engine ever manufactured by Honda (the B16A). For North America&#x27;s GS-R, the B17A1 engine is a 1.7-liter DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine with a specific power output of was available beginning with the 1992 model year. VTEC engagement is at 5,500 rpm on the B16A engine, redline for the XSi is 8,200 rpm. All Japanese models remained exclusive to Honda Japanese dealership network called &quot;Honda Verno&quot;.

There were two variants of the top DOHC VTEC model, the RSi, and the XSi. The RSi was the base model with a lighter weight thanks to wind-up windows, no rear spoiler and few options. Early RSi models also featured the S1 gearbox with slightly closer gear ratios than the Y1 gearbox fitted to the XSi. The XSi was the fully-optioned variant with climate control, optional sunroof, and anti-lock brakes. The XSi had a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 7.2 seconds and can complete a standing quarter mile in 15.1 seconds. This top-spec DOHC VTEC model was complemented by more docile models that used dual-carburetor or PGM-Fi versions of the versatile 1.6-litre DOHC (ZC) engine but in the more compact SOHC configuration. Similarly there were base and full options variants of these SOHC engine Integras coded RX/RXi and ZX/ZXi respectively. All vehicles sold in Japan had their width dimensions slightly reduced so as to be in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions so that the car would be officially recognized as a &quot;compact&quot; and not incur yearly taxes for being wider. In October 1991, the range received a mild facelift. At the same time, a 1.8-liter version of the 4-door hardtop was made available in Japan. Called the ESi, it offered at 6,300 rpm and was only available in conjunction with a 4-speed automatic transmission. At the same time, the VTEC was upgraded and now had .

This generation saw the discontinuation of the 5-door liftback, and the first availability of a 4-door sedan outside Japan. The new hardtop bodystyle reflected a popular trend in Japan of offering an entry-level sedan, such as the Civic-based platform the Integra used, in a reduced-height 4-door hardtop. The Integra sedan saw competition from the similarly sized Toyota Corolla Ceres, the Toyota Sprinter Marino, the Nissan Presea, and the Mazda Lantis. The sedan was only &quot;styled&quot; to look like a hardtop. The vehicle retained the B-pillar, while the doors were constructed without window frames. This styling carried over to the third-generation sedan, and shared visual similarities to the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; larger companion, the Honda Vigor.

The then-Emperor of Japan, Akihito, until he discontinued driving shortly after his 85th birthday, maintained a gray 1991 Integra sedan with the 1.6 L engine, and regularly drove within the boundaries of the Imperial Palace.

===North American market===
In North America, the Integra was sold under the Acura nameplate. Acura offered three trim levels (RS, LS and GS) for 1990 and 1991 model years and added a fourth trim level (GS-R) beginning in May 1992. Model choices consisted of a 3-door liftback and a new 4-door sedan. All trim levels were available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission except for the GS-R which was only offered in a 5-speed manual with shorter gearing than other trim levels.

The second-generation Integra coupe is longer overall and wider than the previous generation. A new 1.8-liter DOHC 4-cylinder engine producing 130 HP was standard equipment. Anti-lock brakes was standard on the GS model and motorized front shoulder belts were standard on all US-market models, while the Canadian-market models had the manual front shoulder belts.

====GS-R====
For the 1992 and 1993 model years, Acura offered a GS-R model. The GS-R liftback came only with a 5-speed manual transmission and 1.7-liter B17A1 DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine with . The GS-R model came with a rear spoiler and 195/60/VR14 tires and alloy wheels.

Less than 5,000 of the 1992–1993 model years Acura Integra GS-R were produced for North America; this is confirmed by the vehicle identification number sequence of these cars. Using this information, the production numbers of the GS-R via vehicle history reports are determined. The North American production breakdown was reported as follows:


== Third generation (1993) ==
Honda debuted the third-generation model in 1993 in Japan at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; locations. It had a new four headlight front end design which was dubbed &quot;spider eyes&quot; by some enthusiasts. Standard horsepower (in Japan) from the B18B engine increased to . In the U.S., the B18B1 produced slightly higher power due to higher-compression pistons being used. The top model was known in Japan as &quot;Si&quot;, and it was powered by a B18C engine that produced . 
The four headlight front end design, or &quot;spider eye&quot; headlights, proved controversial in Japan, so all JDM Integras were given a minor facelift in late 1994, with more conventional elongated flat headlights and a revised front bumper. The top model was rebadged as the Integra SiR. Shortly after that, in 1995, a Type R version of the Integra was released to the Japanese market. 

This generation Integra was generally not available in Europe, although some markets such as Greece did receive this model. Those cars were fitted with a version of the 1590 cc &quot;ZC&quot; engine. From 1998 onward, non-JDM Integras (including Type R models) received a facelift to the front bumper which moved the embossed &quot;INTEGRA&quot; label to below the left headlights, eliminated the horizontal strut across the radiator grille and reshaped the headlight housing, turn signal housing and lower bumper.

Dealer-installed options for the third-generation Integra included: security system, 15-inch alloy wheels, trunk mat, splash guards, fog lights, rear-wing spoiler, moonroof (liftback only), CD changer, leather seats, leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel.

===USDM trim levels===

RS: Rally Sport was available in both liftback and sedan. There was no sedan available in 1998. Model dropped in 1999. In 1994 for the 1995 model year, equipped with the 1.8-liter DOHC (B18B2) 4-cylinder engine producing and of torque. RS models were the predecessor to the Type R model that was released in 1997. In 1995, power ratings dropped to and of torque due to U.S. emissions regulations. Standard features were a cassette player, rear-window defroster, and tilt steering wheel. The cassette player was replaced with a CD player in 1997. The RS models as well as Type Rs did not come with moonroofs as an option, while the LS, SE, GS, and GS-R sub-models did.
LS: Luxury Sport, was available in both liftback and sedan a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.

SE: Special Edition, was available in both liftback and sedan starting from 1995. This trim package was only available in 1995 and 1996 model years until they were changed to be named the GS in 1997. From the LS, it added leather seats, alloy wheels on all years, and a rear-wing spoiler (optional).

GS: Grand Sport, was available in both liftback and sedan starting from 1997. Same standard features as the SE. Including a rear spoiler.

GS-R: Grand Sport Racing, was available in both liftback and sedan. Equipped with the 1.8-liter DOHC VTEC (B18C1) 4-cylinder engine producing and of torque. It came equipped with a rear spoiler, 6-speaker stereo, power moonroof, 195/55/VR15 tires and alloy wheels. The leather option package would add leather upholstery, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. An automatic transmission is an option in certain markets for this model.

Type R (1997-1998 and 2000-2001): was only available as a liftback. Equipped with the 1.8-liter DOHC VTEC (B18C5) 4-cylinder engine producing limited-slip differential, unique interior trim, front spoiler, high rear wing, Type R badging, lowered sport suspension, and unique 7-spoke 5-lug 15-inch alloy wheels. Deletes air conditioning, leather upholstery, tilt/height adjustable driver seat, visor mirrors, power moonroof, and cruise control. Air conditioning would be a dealer-installed option.

===Integra Type R===

In 1995, Honda introduced the Integra Type R to the Japanese domestic market. The Japanese specification Type R came standard with a factory-tuned variant of the B18C engine. Power figures varied slightly between markets, with USDM cars putting out and UK-spec cars making . Equipped with a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission and a helical-type limited-slip differential, the Integra Type R had significantly improved performance and handling relative to the GS-R/Si/SiR-G Integra.

These were the result of extensive changes, including a strengthened chassis with extra spot welds and thicker metal around the rear shock towers and lower subframe, weight reduction (reduced sound insulation, 10 percent thinner windscreen, lighter wheels), more power, rev limiter set at 8,600 rpm JDM (8,500 rpm USDM, 8,700 rpm UKDM), hand-built engine featuring hand-polished and ported intake ports, high-compression pistons, undercut valves and revised intake and exhaust systems, and suspension upgrades. The result was a capable sports liftback which was acclaimed by motoring journalists worldwide. The JDM version was significantly lighter than the SiR Integra (The 96–97 spec model could delete the air bags, air conditioning, rear wiper, radio, center console, clock, power steering and anti-lock brakes), However, there is only a 33 lb (15 kg) net weight difference between the USDM Integra Type R and the Integra GS-R because the extra metal and cross bracing in the Type R negate much of the 98 lb of weight reductions. The Type R was the only Type R ever sold in North America with the Acura badge. For the European, Australian and New Zealand market, the Integra was sold as a Honda with the four headlight front-end design.

The JDM Type R received significant upgrades in 1998 and is known as the &#x27;98 Spec R. Some of the main changes were a redesigned rear bumper, 16-inch wheels with 215/45R16 tires, 5-lug nut wheel hubs and bigger brakes. Gear ratios for the final drive were higher, making 1st to 3rd gears closer, while 4th and 5th were longer to maintain the &#x27;96 Spec cruising comfort. The engine power remained the same, but use of a new 4–1 long tube header brought torque lower down to 6,200 rpm.

A final revision of the JDM Type R known as the &#x27;00 Spec R included a revised intake camshaft, and more finely balanced drive shafts. A final trim version offered in mid-2000 onwards for the JDM market (known as the &quot;Type Rx&quot;) came factory fitted with motorized folding mirrors, dashboard clock, blue-hue carbon trim interiors, and an audio system as part of the standard package. 

====Type R performance and reviews====

* Edmund&#x27;s Insideline tested a 12-year-old stock Type R: 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.8 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.9 seconds at 95.2 mph.
*&quot;Motor Trend&quot; clocked the Type R at: 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.2 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.8 at 96.3 mph.
*&quot;Sport Compact Car&quot; clocked the Type R at: 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.1 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.5 at 96 mph.

In Japan, the Integra is revered as one of the best sports cars of the &#x27;90s. On Japanese car review show “Best Motoring” the Integra Type R punched well above its weight competing with the fastest 4WD turbocharged cars of the time, the Nissan Skyline GTR and the Subaru WRX STI.

It has been acclaimed by motoring journalists worldwide, including Evo magazine, which named the Type R &#x27;the greatest front-wheel-drive performance car ever&#x27;, and TheAutoChannel.com, which similarly called it &#x27;the best handling front-wheel drive car ever&#x27;.

===Four-wheel Drive Integra (DB9)===

The third generation also saw the production of a four-wheel drive option. Available only in the four-door sedan, the ZXi4WD (93–95) and Xi4WD (95-00) had 1.6L SOHC ZC engines coupled to a version of Honda&#x27;s Real Time 4WD.

=== Integra SJ (EK3) (1996)===


The &quot;Integra SJ&quot; (standing for &quot;Sedan Joyful&quot;) was a rebadged Civic Ferio (a &quot;Honda Primo&quot; product) with modified headlamps and grille similar to the Orthia&#x27;s and slightly larger rear lights that were also utilized on the Japanese market Civic LEV sedan. The Integra SJ was sold in Japan at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealerships. It originated from the Honda Domani, another derivative of this vehicle sold at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; locations. It was made from 1996 to 2001, and used the 1493 cc D15B engine. Honda&#x27;s press material of the time indicated that the SJ was intended to provide a &quot;formal sedan&quot; for the Integra range; another reason may have been to sell Ferios using a more sporting model name at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealerships in Japan, as was the case with the Nissan Laurel Spirit.

In Thailand, the Integra SJ was sold as the Isuzu Vertex, the last Isuzu passenger car ever for that market. It followed Isuzu&#x27;s practice of selling Honda models as Isuzus which started with the Gemini; with Honda also selling Isuzu&#x27;s sport utility vehicles in Japan and North America (some as Acuras in the latter market), and pickup trucks in Thailand.
===Theft in the United States===
According to a 2002 Highway Loss Data Institute study, the Integra &quot;accounts for 21.7 [theft] claims per 1,000 vehicles&quot;, compared to a contemporary Jeep Wrangler, the second most-stolen car model of that period, at just 8.5 claims per 1,000 vehicles.

In 2004, CCC Information Services named the 1999 Integra as the most stolen car in the United States, with the 1998 model year of the car listed as the third-most stolen model for that year. In 2014, LoJack named the Integra as the sixth most stolen car among vehicles equipped with their car tracking service.

==Fourth generation (2001)==


The fourth-generation Integra was introduced in Japan on April 13, 2001 and produced from July 2001 until August 2006. For North America (United States and Canada), it was introduced as the Acura RSX in accordance with Acura&#x27;s new alphabetical naming scheme. It also had an entirely new engine, the K-series. The Integra came in two models in the United States, the RSX and the RSX Type-S boasting the K20A2 engine from 2002 to 2004, while the 2005 and 2006 RSX-S came with a K20Z1. The RSX was sold as a Honda Integra in Japan and Australia, markets where Acura did not exist.

In June 2006, Honda discontinued the Integra after its final 300 cars were sold, due to the shrinkage of the coupe market. The reaction of the consumers towards the discontinuation, however, forced Honda to extend production until July 2006 and produce 150 more Integras. The Acura RSX was discontinued as well, as the RSX did not fit within the confines of Acura&#x27;s re-structured market strategy. This left the Acura TSX as Acura&#x27;s entry-level vehicle. Also, the introduction of the similarly powerful and less expensive 2006 model-year Honda Civic Si was there to fill in the gap left by the RSX.

The Type R (Japanese market only) came standard with a K20A 2.0 L DOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder engine. The &quot;i&quot; in i-VTEC stands for intelligent VTEC, which employs VTC (Variable Timing Control) to advance or retard the intake cam timing within a 50 degree range. The Integra Type R came equipped with Recaro seats, four-piston Brembo front brakes, a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, variable back-pressure exhaust system, and a stiffer suspension.

==Fifth generation (2022)==

===North America===

The was reintroduced in North America on June 2, 2022 for the 2023 model year as a 5-door liftback that replaced the ILX sedan. Built under the model codes DE4 and DE5, it is built on the same platform as the eleventh-generation Civic.

=== Use of the name in China ===

In China, the eleventh-generation Civic sedan produced by GAC Honda is sold as the () with some styling changes, as Dongfeng Honda produces the regular Civic in the country. The car was introduced in September 2021. Changes compared to the Civic include redesigned front and rear fasciae. A liftback version was introduced in February 2023 as the &quot;Integra Hatchback&quot;.

<text>Deià () is a municipality and small coastal village in the Serra de Tramuntana, which forms the northern ridge of the Spanish island of Mallorca. It is located about north of Valldemossa, and it is known for its literary and musical residents. Its idyllic landscape, orange and olive groves on steep cliffs overlooking the Mediterranean, served as a draw for German, English, and American expatriates after the First World War.
The English poet, novelist, and scholar Robert Graves was one of the first foreigners to settle in the village, where he collaborated with Laura Riding in setting up the Seizin Press. Graves returned after the war and remained in Deià until his death. He used the town as the setting for many of his stories, including the historical novel &quot;Hercules my Shipmate&quot;. His house is now a museum.

Anaïs Nin visited the village in the 1920s, and she wrote a short story set on the village&#x27;s beach. The Spanish writer, Carme Riera, recently wrote a short story about Nin&#x27;s. The town is also the unnamed setting of the Uruguayan novelist Cristina Peri Rossi&#x27;s &quot;The Ship of Fools&quot; (&quot;La nave de los locos&quot;). The Nicaraguan poet and novelist, Claribel Alegría, lived in Deià. Anja Rubik married fellow model Sasha Knezevic in this village in July 2011.

In recent decades, the stars of literature have been eclipsed by the stars of rock and roll. The Virgin Records mogul Richard Branson has a luxury residence in the town, and his label&#x27;s stars have often visited the village and sometimes jammed at the local bar, Sa Fonda. Deià was home to several Canterbury-scene musicians over the years, including Kevin Ayers, Robert Wyatt, and Daevid Allen. Mick Jagger, guitarist Mark Knopfler, and Mike Oldfield played there often in the late 1980s, as did Caroline Corr. Much of Fionn Regan&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;100 Acres of Sycamore&quot; was inspired by his time spent in Deià.

<text>Dahlia Travers (née Wooster) is a recurring fictional character in the Jeeves stories of English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being best known as Bertie Wooster&#x27;s bonhomous, red-faced Aunt Dahlia. She is much beloved by her nephew, in contrast with her sister, Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Agatha.

Proprietor of the weekly newspaper for women &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;, she is married to Tom Travers, mother of Angela Travers and Bonzo Travers, and employs the supremely gifted French chef Anatole at her country house, Brinkley Court.

Aside from Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, Aunt Dahlia appears in more Jeeves novels, and more Jeeves stories overall, than any other character. She makes an appearance in fourteen Jeeves stories, including seven novels and seven short stories. Only Aunt Agatha and Bingo Little appear in more Jeeves short stories (eight and ten, respectively).

==Inspiration==
Wodehouse spent much of his youth with his many aunts and uncles, as his parents were generally away in Hong Kong. The character of Aunt Dahlia was inspired by one of Wodehouse&#x27;s aunts, Louisa Deane. Louisa Deane was the sister of Wodehouse&#x27;s mother, Eleanor Deane, and Mary Bathurst Deane, who inspired the character of Aunt Agatha.

==Life and character==
Dahlia Travers lives at Brinkley Court outside Market Snodsbury in Worcestershire. She is married to Tom Travers, and has two children, Angela Travers and Bonzo Travers. She appears to have been married sometime once before, since Bertie says that she &quot;married old Tom Travers &quot;en secondes noces&quot;, as I believe the expression is, the year Bluebottle won the Cambridgeshire&quot;. Bertie enjoys her company, and says of her, &quot;There are few males or females whose society I enjoy more than that of this genial sister of my late father&quot;. She is &quot;a large, genial soul&quot;, and Bertie praises &quot;her humanity, sporting qualities, and general good-eggishness&quot;. Though typically friendly, she is capable, with effort, of going into an authoritative &quot;grande dame act&quot; if the situation calls for it, assuming a serious expression and cold, aristocratic tone. While she generally has reasonable objectives, she has no objection to resorting to methods such as burglary or blackmail in order to achieve those goals.

Described as being built along the lines of Mae West, Aunt Dahlia is short and solid, with a reddish complexion. According to Bertie, her face takes on a purple tinge in moments of strong emotion. She wears tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles for reading, and appears to style her hair carefully, as her hair is variously described as her &quot;carefully fixed coiffure&quot;, &quot;her Marcel-wave&quot;, and &quot;her perm&quot;.

Her most notable personal characteristic is her loud, carrying voice. Riding in her youth for years with such fox-hunting packs as the Quorn and the Pytchley, she tends to address Bertie, over the phone or indoors, as if &quot;shouting across ploughed fields in a high wind.&quot; She sometimes uses hunting cries in regular speech, including &quot;Yoicks!&quot;, &quot;Tally ho!&quot;, &quot;Gone away!&quot;, and &quot;Hark forrard!&quot;. She once put her carrying voice to use at a village concert, in which she sang &quot;Every Nice Girl Loves A Sailor&quot; while wearing a sailor suit. Her performance was well received. As she tells Bertie, &quot;I had them rolling in the aisles. Three encores, and so many bows that I got a crick in my back.&quot;

Dahlia employs the French chef Anatole, whose cooking is revered by many characters, especially her husband Tom and her nephew Bertie Wooster. Bertie is quick to accept an invitation to Brinkley Court for the chance to enjoy Anatole&#x27;s cooking, and she uses the promise of his cooking to get Bertie to do various tasks for her. Her butler is Seppings. Before Seppings, Aunt Dahlia employed a butler named Pomeroy, a noble fellow, and before him, Murgatroyd, who turned out to be a thief. Aunt Dahlia has a large, sleepy black cat called Augustus, or &quot;Gus&quot;.

In &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot;, Aunt Dahlia hires the incomparable chef Anatole. In &quot;Jeeves and the Song of Songs&quot;, she wants Tuppy Glossop, who has broken his engagement to Angela Travers for the opera singer Cora Bellinger, to go back to Angela. In &quot;The Spot of Art&quot;, she wants Bertie to accompany her on a cruise. In &quot;The Love That Purifies&quot;, her son Bonzo competes against her nephew Thomas (&quot;Thos&quot;), Aunt Agatha&#x27;s son, in a good conduct contest. In &quot;The Ordeal of Young Tuppy&quot;, she again wants Tuppy Glossop, who has fallen for the athletic Miss Dalgleish, to return to Angela.

As a Governor of Market Snodsbury Grammar School, she asks Bertie in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; to award prizes and give a speech at the school, though Bertie pushes this task onto Gussie Fink-Nottle, whom Aunt Dahlia always calls &quot;Spink-Bottle&quot;. In the same novel, Dahlia lost the money to pay her magazine&#x27;s printers at baccarat and has Bertie and Jeeves help her get more money from her husband. In &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, she asks Bertie to sneer at a silver cow-creamer, and after Sir Watkyn Bassett unfairly obtains the object, she tasks Bertie with stealing the cow-creamer from Sir Watkyn. In &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, she temporarily pawns her pearl necklace to buy a serial from Daphne Dolores Morehead to help sell the &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; to the newspaper magnate Mr. Trotter. In &quot;Jeeves Makes an Omelette&quot;, a story that takes place before the sale of her magazine, she asks Bertie to steal a painting so she can get a story for her magazine.

In &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot;, she hires Sir Roderick Glossop to pretend to be a butler at Brinkley Court so he can investigate the sanity of a man courting her goddaughter Phyllis Mills. In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, she tells Bertie about how Sir Watkyn Bassett bragged about obtaining a black amber statuette. In &quot;Jeeves and the Greasy Bird&quot;, a story that takes place before the sale of &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;, the writer Blair Eggleston writes for the magazine, and Aunt Dahlia and Jeeves save Bertie from the underhanded theatrical agent Jas Waterbury. In &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, she provides her house as a base of operations for the candidacy of Harold &quot;Ginger&quot; Winship, and she wants the businessman L. P. Runkle to pay Tuppy money that she feels Runkle owes him.

She last appears in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, in which she places a bet on a horse, and intends to ensure that her wager is successful with a plan that involves kidnapping a cat. Though Bertie thinks highly of his Aunt Dahlia, he decides that her moral code is not as strict as his. In any event, she wins her wager.

===Relationship with Bertie Wooster===
Bertie refers to Aunt Dahlia as his &quot;good and deserving aunt&quot;, in contrast to his unfriendly Aunt Agatha. Unlike Aunt Agatha, she seems to enjoy Bertie&#x27;s company. Dahlia dandled Bertie on her knee when he was very young, and once saved him from swallowing a rubber comforter. When Bertie had measles as a child, Aunt Dahlia played tiddlywinks with him for hours and let him win, though Bertie maintains that his victories were due to his own skill.

Bertie and Aunt Dahlia often call each other terms that others might find insulting in an endearing way, as when Bertie calls her &quot;aged relative&quot; and &quot;old ancestor&quot;, and she calls him &quot;young blot&quot; and &quot;abysmal chump&quot;. Dahlia&#x27;s telegram conversations with Bertie can display some rough love; for instance, in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, after Bertie dumped his prize-giving duty on an unsuspecting Gussie Fink-Nottle and sent him to Brinkley Court, she sent:
« Am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew counts as murder. If it doesn&#x27;t look out for yourself. Consider your conduct frozen limit. What do you mean by planting your loathsome friends on me like this? Do you think Brinkley Court is a leper colony or what is it? Who is this Spink-Bottle? Love. Travers. »
And a few telegrams later, she sent:
« Well, all right. Something in what you say, I suppose. Consider you treacherous worm and contemptible, spineless cowardly custard, but have booked Spink-Bottle. Stay where you are, then, and I hope you get run over by an omnibus. Love. Travers. »
Nevertheless, she genuinely cares for Bertie. Bertie acknowledges that her love for him is deep-rooted, and at the end of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, she is willing to give up her valuable chef Anatole in order to help Bertie, which profoundly moves him.

Aunt Dahlia is also on good terms with Bertie&#x27;s valet Jeeves. Though at first she doubts his abilities, she quickly learns to appreciate his skill for solving problems. She thinks that Jeeves has a great deal of influence over Bertie&#x27;s life, as she is certain that Jeeves will decide Bertie&#x27;s fate in a number of ways in &quot;The Spot of Art&quot;. Notably, she wants Jeeves to vet an article about men&#x27;s dress trousers for &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, she and Jeeves plan together how to extricate Bertie from trouble without discussing it with Bertie in &quot;Jeeves and the Greasy Bird&quot;, and Jeeves serves as substitute butler for her at Brinkley Court when Bertie is not there in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;.

==Appearances==
Aunt Dahlia is featured in many Jeeves stories, across much of Wodehouse&#x27;s writing career:

* &quot;Carry on, Jeeves&quot; (1925)
**&quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot; (1925)
*&quot;Very Good, Jeeves&quot; (1930)
** &quot;Jeeves and the Song of Songs&quot; (1929)
** &quot;The Spot of Art&quot; (1929)
** &quot;The Love That Purifies&quot; (1929)
** &quot;The Ordeal of Young Tuppy&quot; (1930)
* &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; (1934)
* &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; (1938)
* &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (1954)
*&quot;A Few Quick Ones&quot; (1959)
** &quot;Jeeves Makes an Omelette&quot; (1958)

* &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot; (1974)

Aunt Dahlia or her &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; are mentioned in several stories, including:
*&quot;Mr Mulliner Speaking&quot; (1929)
** &quot;The Awful Gladness of the Mater&quot; (1925) – Mr Mulliner story (mention of &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;)
* &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; (1946)

==&quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;==
Milady&#x27;s Boudoir is a fictional weekly newspaper for women, of which Aunt Dahlia is the proprietor. According to Bertie, each issue costs sixpence. &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; is probably based on &quot;The Lady&quot;, Britain&#x27;s oldest weekly women&#x27;s magazine. In the story &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot;, the office of &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; is described as being located in &quot;&quot;one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood&quot;, the same part of London as &quot;The Lady&quot;, which between 1885 and 2019 was headquartered in Bedford Street, Covent Garden.

&quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot; (and not &quot;Madame&#x27;s Nightshirt&quot;&quot;, as Dahlia&#x27;s husband Tom Travers insists on calling it) never sold well and only stayed in business because Tom Travers reluctantly paid the bills.
Aunt Dahlia ran the paper for three (according to Bertie) or four (according to Dahlia and Bertie) years before selling the magazine to Mr Trotter of Liverpool in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;. In the following novel &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot;, the magazine &quot;had recently been sold to a mug up Liverpool way&quot;, and Dahlia mentions that there was a short story in each issue, adding that &quot;in seventy per cent of those short stories the hero won the heroine&#x27;s heart by saving her dog or her cat or whatever foul animal she happened to possess.&quot;

<text>The Conscription Crisis of 1944 was a political and military crisis following the introduction of forced military service for men in Canada during World War II. It was similar to the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but not as politically damaging.

==Background==

Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had been haunted by the way the Conscription Crisis of 1917 had fractured the Liberal Party between its English-Canadian and French-Canadian members. King, who experienced the split first-hand, was determined to avoid another such split. In 1922, during the Chanak Crisis, when the United Kingdom almost went to war with Turkey, King had first asserted that Canada would not automatically go to war as part of the British Empire if the United Kingdom did, saying he would consult the Canadian Parliament first and presumably declare neutrality if the House of Commons were unwilling to go to war with Turkey. Though there were several reasons for King&#x27;s reluctance to go to war with Turkey, at least one was the memory of how badly the First World War had strained Canadian domestic unity.

During the 1930s, Mackenzie King had displayed what the Canadian historian Colonel John A. English called &quot;an abiding aversion to conscription&quot; and &quot;an apparently unshakable conviction in the efficacy of appeasement&quot;, regarding another world war as &quot;the ultimate catastrophe&quot; for which no price was too high to avoid. In 1935, King had been opposed to sanctions on Italy for invading Ethiopia; in 1936, he stated that Canada would not take part if Britain decided to take military action in response to the German remilitarization of the Rhineland; and in 1938, he had warmly supported the Munich Agreement as the necessary price for peace. King had laid down defence spending priorities in April 1939 that declared the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was to be the main service, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) the secondary service and the Canadian Militia the last on the list, as he wanted to avoid fighting another land war, which was likely to cause heavy losses.

Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, and sent one division to Europe, which did not have an opportunity to engage in combat before France was defeated by Germany. As a war leader, King sought to avoid repeating what he regarded as the mistakes of his Conservative predecessor Sir Robert Borden in the First World War, which meant avoiding conscription, and King initially attempted to limit Canada&#x27;s participation in the war solely to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). King had described the BCATP in a statement as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most effective contribution to the war effort&quot;, and privately complained that the British should not have asked for a division for Europe before approaching him with the BCATP, as he would never have sent the 1st Canadian Division to Britain if he could have settled only for the BCATP. As King saw it, &quot;a big RCAF could never lead to conscription&quot;.

King feared the civil and political unrest that had occurred during World War I, and also hoped to defeat nationalist Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis. Thus when Duplessis called a snap election in September 1939 to seek a mandate to oppose the war, King pledged that same month not to introduce overseas conscription for the duration of the war. Duplessis&#x27;s decision to dissolve the assembly on 25 September 1939 to seek a mandate to oppose the war created panic in Ottawa, with King calling Duplessis &quot;diabolic&quot; and a &quot;little Hitler&quot; in his diary, believing Duplessis&#x27;s aim was to provoke such a crisis between French Canada and English Canada that Quebec would leave the Confederation.

During the 1939 Quebec election campaign, the Dominion government made an unprecedented intervention in a provincial election to defeat the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; government and ensure the victory of the pro-war Quebec Liberals under Adélard Godbout; all the resources of the Dominion government were thrown behind the provincial Liberals. All of the Dominion cabinet ministers representing ridings in Quebec threatened to resign if Duplessis was re-elected, claiming that no one would be left to stand up for Quebec in the cabinet if conscription become an issue again. Duplessis was one of Quebec&#x27;s ablest politicians, a charismatic, colourful demagogue who preached a mixture of Catholic conservatism and Quebec nationalism. During the election campaign, the War Measures Act was used to stop Duplessis from speaking on the radio.

It soon became evident that Duplessis&#x27;s alcoholism was out of control. He ran an inept campaign, appearing visibly drunk at numerous campaign rallies as he delivered rambling speeches denouncing the war, which were most notable for his slurred words and lack of lucidity. By electing Godbout as Premier on 25 October 1939, there was an understanding in Quebec that the reward for voting Duplessis out would be no overseas conscription. Many Canadians supported Mackenzie King&#x27;s pledge, even as it became obvious the war would not end quickly.

As in the First World War, young French Canadians joined the few traditional French-speaking regiments of the Canadian army, such as the Regular Army Royal 22e Régiment, and several Militia regiments that were mobilized. In the infantry, barracks life and most training was in French and only the command and radio language was in English.

In the rest of the military, however, similar French-speaking units were not created. Among the justifications for this policy were the predominance of the radio, and the fact that technical instruction was only available in English. The 12th Armoured Regiment, originally mobilized by the Francophone Three Rivers Regiment (Tank) militia unit, was reorganized and fought as an English-speaking unit. Many French-speaking soldiers were sidetracked in the process. One of the most famous was Jean-Victor Allard, who demanded a transfer from the Three Rivers Regiment to the infantry; he went on to become a brigade commander in Northwest Europe and then in Korea, command a British division in NATO and subsequently become Chief of the Defence Staff of the Canadian Armed Forces, where he was pleased to create the first French-speaking brigade.

While units such as the Royal 22e Régiment, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, the Régiment de la Chaudière and the Régiment de Maisonneuve all had outstanding records during World War II, some feel that if they had been grouped in the same brigade (as French Canadians had requested, and as currently exists in the Canadian Armed Forces), it could have become a focus of pride for French Canada, encouraging the war effort and political support in Quebec. These units were, however, distributed among the various English-speaking divisions of the Canadian Army overseas. Historian J. L. Granatstein, in his book &quot;The Generals&quot;, suggests that a shortage of French-speaking staff trained officers meant that any attempt to create an entire Francophone brigade would have likely ended in failure.

From the beginning, acceptance of French-speaking units was greater in Canada during World War II than World War I. In 1914, the drive to create the 22nd Infantry Battalion (French-Canadian) had necessitated large rallies of French Canadians and political pressure to overcome Minister Sam Hughes&#x27; abhorrence of the idea. But during World War II, greater acceptance of French-Canadian units, as well as informal use of their language, lessened the ferocity of Quebec&#x27;s resistance to the war effort.

Opposition to conscription was not limited to Quebec. In British Columbia, where alarm over the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; was a major issue, many were opposed to conscription, fearful that conscripting of Chinese-Canadians and Japanese-Canadians would lead to Asian-Canadian demands for the right to vote, to which the white population of British Columbia was adamantly opposed. Meanwhile, many on the political left had profound misgivings about the injustice of the war, and the attitude of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) towards the war has been described as &quot;ambivalent&quot;.

==The Zombies==
In June 1940, the government adopted conscription for home service in &quot;The National Resources Mobilization Act&quot; (NRMA), which allowed the government to register men and women and move them into jobs considered necessary for wartime production. The act also allowed for conscription for the defence of Canada, but did not allow conscripts to be deployed for overseas service. French-Canadian nationalist mayor of Montreal Camillien Houde gave a speech urging all French-Canadian men not to register under the NRMA. The Dominion government used the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; under the War Measures Act to have the RCMP arrest Houde, who was held without charge until 1944. From 1940 onward, Defence Minister James Ralston and Navy minister Angus MacDonald were seen as the advocates of the armed forces in the cabinet, favouring winning the war even at the price of domestic disunity, in opposition to King, who argued victory could not come at the cost of domestic unity.

After adoption of the NRMA, men who refused to &quot;go active&quot; were derisively called &quot;Zombies&quot;, both in Canada and overseas. The term was used because soldiers who could not fight in the war were regarded by some as the reanimated corpses from Haitian mythology who were neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between. The Zombies were widely reviled by those who had volunteered for overseas service and referred to as cowards. The Canadian military was divided into two classes: &quot;A&quot; class servicemembers who volunteered to go overseas, and the &quot;R&quot; class servicemembers known as Zombies. At training camps, officers and NCOs constantly belittled, insulted and humiliated the Zombies to pressure them to &quot;go active&quot;, making for tense relationships at the best of times.

King&#x27;s efforts to keep the military out of action for as long as possible caused much dismay among more hawkish Canadians anxious to see Canada become more involved. The Royal Canadian Legion issued its manifesto, &quot;A Call for Total War&quot;, endorsed by some 500 civic groups across English Canada. Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn and Premier of New Brunswick John B. McNair both demanded overseas conscription in speeches attacking King. A Gallup poll in November 1941 showed 61% of Canadians satisfied with the war effort, but 60% who also wanted conscription for overseas service. On 13 November 1941, King&#x27;s old nemesis from the 1920s, former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, became leader of the Conservative Party. His predecessor, &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Manion, had supported King&#x27;s conscription policies, but Meighen&#x27;s call for &quot;total war&quot;, including sending the Zombies overseas, was the centerpiece of his criticism of King. Meighen and King&#x27;s rivalry was one of the most famous in Canadian political history; both men passionately hated one another, and Meighen travelled across the country accusing King of not doing everything within his power to win the war.

After the disaster of the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941 in which two Canadian battalions were lost, a political firestorm erupted in Canada. George A. Drew, leader of the Ontario Conservative Party, urged the Canadian people to &quot;face the shameful truth&quot;, that the two battalions of badly trained men sent to Hong Kong were a sign of the failure of King&#x27;s policies and of the need for conscription for overseas service. By the end of 1941, the armies of the United Kingdom, United States, Soviet Union and other allies were all fighting in various theatres of war, while the Canadian Army sat idle, guarding the UK against the unlikely threat of German invasion. By the end of December 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Force, which had started fighting in the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, had lost 1,199 men, and the Royal Canadian Navy had lost 439. In Hong Kong, the Canadian Army had lost 290 men, with 487 wounded and the rest held prisoner by the Japanese under horrific conditions, a majority dying in captivity.

==The Plebiscite of 1942==

By 1941, there were enough Canadian volunteers to form five overseas divisions. The Conservatives were pressuring King to advise the Governor General to introduce overseas conscription. The loss of the two battalions in Hong Kong had shocked the Canadian public, which demanded that Canada do more to win the war. Arthur Meighen&#x27;s attacks on King started to resonate, and in January 1942, Meighen resigned his Senate seat to enter the House of Commons via a by-election in the York South riding of Ontario, backed by anti-King Liberal Premier of Ontario Mitchell Hepburn and a &quot;Committee of 200&quot; representing 200 of Toronto&#x27;s most influential citizens. The Liberals did not run a candidate due to a convention that the Leader of the Opposition be permitted entry to the House, however, tacit support was given to CCF candidate Joseph W. Noseworthy. Historian Frank Underhill, who normally worked for the Liberals, wrote Noseworthy&#x27;s speeches. As the acerbic, sharp-tongued Meighen tended to get the better of King in debates, the Prime Minister feared his archenemy&#x27;s return to the Commons, and attempted to rob Meighen of his signature issue by announcing a referendum to release him from his September 1939 promise that there would be no overseas conscription. Arthur Meighen was ultimately defeated by Noseworthy in the February 9, 1942 by-election.

In an &quot;off-the-record&quot; interview with two journalists from the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; in February 1942, King said that the purpose of the Canadian expeditionary force then training in the United Kingdom was only to defend Britain in the event of a German invasion, and that he would not be sending the five expeditionary force divisions to the Middle East, as the British were requesting. King told Grant Dexter of &quot;The Winnipeg Free Press&quot; on 28 February 1942 that the purpose of the Canadian Army in Britain was &quot;to defend the heart of the Empire&quot;, and criticized Ralston for saying in the House of Commons that he wanted &quot;to build up a strong striking force in Britain because we would ultimately use Britain as the springboard for our thrust on the continent&quot;. King told Dexter that &quot;the trouble was with Ralston and the general staff. Ralston stood up for the generals, fought the cabinet on their behalf&quot;. King expressed the view that Ralston was too easily influenced by the generals and that &quot;Generals are almost invariably wrong&quot;. In the same interview, King stated his belief that Japanese would invade British Columbia &quot;just as soon as the Japs could muster the men and material&quot;.

In early 1942, Japanese successes in the Asia-Pacific theatre had led to widespread fears of their invading British Columbia. But while the Japanese did plan to annex the province once the war was won, in the spring of 1942 they were largely preoccupied with plans for the invasion of Australia and Hawaii, and the continuing war with China. Responding to racist hysteria that Japanese-Canadians were a fifth column loyal to Japan who would soon wage terrorist campaigns against whites, the King government interned all Japanese-Canadians. This was despite RCMP reports to the government that there was no need for internment, and that most Japanese-Canadians were loyal to Canada. The same fears of a Japanese invasion led King to create two divisions, the 6th and the 8th, largely composed of Zombies, to guard the Pacific coast. Another Zombie division, the 7th, was created to guard the Atlantic coast against a German invasion, just to show that the government was not indifferent to the Maritime provinces, through the military had advised the government there was little danger of a Japanese invasion and even less of a German one.
On 27 April 1942, a plebiscite was held on the question, &quot;Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?&quot; In Quebec, the &quot;Ligue pour la Défense du Canada&quot; was founded to campaign for the &quot;No&quot; side under the slogan , a reference to King&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, who had died of cancer in November 1941 and was fiercely opposed to sending the Zombies overseas. The &quot;Ligue pour la Défense du Canada&quot; united the entire spectrum of political opinion in Quebec; some of its most effective speakers were André Laurendeau, Henri Bourassa, Jean Drapeau and a young Pierre Trudeau. &quot;La Ligue pour la Défense du Canada&quot; professed to speak for all of Canada in opposing conscription, but its French-Canadian nationalist message had little appeal outside of French Canada. Reflecting the quasi-fascist mood of the nationalist intelligentsia of Quebec, speakers for the League often expressed approval of Vichy France, citing its Révolution nationale as a model for Quebec, and expressed a &quot;disturbing anti-Semitic tendency&quot;. One rally for the League in Montreal ended with speakers blaming Canada&#x27;s Jewish community for dragging the country into a war with Nazi Germany that did not concern French-Canadians. The event almost degenerated into a pogrom, with attendees beating up Jews on the streets of Montreal and smashing windows of Jewish shops; only the prompt intervention of the Montreal police put an end to the violence.

The plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada, which established Tim Buck &quot;Yes&quot; Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% voted in favour of conscription, including 83% of English Canadians. The proposal hardly received any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. In addition to Quebec, six largely French-Canadian ridings in New Brunswick and Ontario also voted &quot;No&quot;, as did several German-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking ridings, including Vegreville, Alberta, and Rosthern, Saskatchewan. King, who had expected all nine provinces to vote yes, was shocked by Quebec&#x27;s &quot;No&quot; vote, and explained that henceforward his policy would be &quot;Not necessarily conscription, but conscription if necessary&quot;. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. Bill 80 passed the House of Commons by 158 votes to 58. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, though these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots.

Following the plebiscite, Public Works Minister Pierre Joseph Arthur Cardin quit the King cabinet to protest the possibility that the &quot;Zombies&quot; might be sent overseas. A number of other Quebec Liberal MPs also left the party in 1942 over the conscription issue, many of whom joined the Bloc populaire canadien when it was formed that fall to campaign against the government. The Defence Minister, Colonel James Ralston, resigned in protest over King&#x27;s unwillingness to send the Zombies overseas, but King refused to accept his resignation.

==The Aleutians and Italian campaigns==
In his Christmas broadcast in 1942, former Conservative Prime Minister R.B. Bennett sarcastically noted that this was the fourth Christmas in a row that the Canadian Army was sitting in Britain doing nothing, and that the only land battles that Canada had fought to date were Hong Kong and Dieppe, both of which were defeats. During the Operation Spartan wargame in March 1943, General Andrew McNaughton, commanding the First Canadian Army, had been badly defeated and was judged unfit to command an army in the field. The wargame umpires criticized McNaughton for leaving his headquarters to supervise the building of a bridge while his supply lines were caught up in a huge traffic jam. After Operation Spartan, the British strongly pressured the Canadians to remove McNaughton before he could lead the First Canadian Army into a real defeat in a battle.

King had tried to keep the Canadian military out of action to avoid casualties that might require a difficult decision on overseas conscription, but in the spring of 1943, with the Allies clearly winning the war, he was seized with the fear that the war might end with Canada winning no battles on land, something certain to hurt the Liberals in post-war elections. Accordingly, King ordered that the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, which had been sent to Britain in 1939, be included in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. General McNaughton was not keen on having a division being taken from his command, but was promised that 1st Division would return to Britain after Sicily was taken.
The 13th brigade, from one of the three &quot;home defence&quot; divisions in Canada, was sent to the Aleutian Islands Campaign in 1943 (the islands were technically North American soil and thus deployment there was not considered &quot;overseas&quot;). By this time, there were 34,000 soldiers, mostly Zombies, guarding the coast of British Columbia against possible Japanese invasion, and to dispel criticism that such a huge force could be more profitably deployed to Europe, King wanted the Zombies to see action. Other than officers and NCOs, these divisions in British Columbia were made up largely of conscripts, and desertions were noted before embarkation. Canadian conscripts deployed in the Aleutian Islands Campaign were issued American helmets. When the 13th Brigade landed on Kiska on 15 August 1943, the Canadians discovered that the Japanese had already left, and the island was empty. The only struggle the 13th Brigade had to face during its six-month stay on Kiska was a fight with taxmen over the question of whether they were overseas or not, as the former meant exemption from paying taxes. Servicemembers used the fact that they were west of the International Date Line to argue that they were in fact in Asia, making them deployed overseas. The Revenue department won.

Believing in Winston Churchill&#x27;s repeated statements that Italy was the &quot;soft underbelly of Europe&quot; and that the Italian campaign would be easy, King decided in the fall of 1943 to keep the 1st Division, now operating as part of the British Eighth Army, in the Italian campaign and send it to mainland Italy. King also decided to send the 5th Canadian Armoured Division and 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade there, where they formed the I Canadian Corps of the Eighth Army. Despite Churchill&#x27;s promises and King&#x27;s hopes, Italy proved to be anything but a &quot;soft underbelly&quot;. The mountains in Italy favoured defensive operations, and the German military made expert use of them to mount a bitter defensive campaign that took a heavy toll on the Allies. McNaughton, for his part, had strongly protested against losing the I Canadian Corps to the Eighth Army, greatly preferring to keep the I and II Canadian corps together in the First Canadian Army, and made increasingly furious remarks on the issue. Defence Minister Ralston had McNaughton removed on the spurious grounds of ill health in December 1943; historian Desmond Morton noted that McNaughton appeared very healthy when he returned to Canada later that month.

==Introduction of conscription==
There was an ethnic dimension to volunteering for the war. Historian Jack Granatstein noted that in both world wars, the Canadians most likely to volunteer to fight overseas were those who identified most strongly with the British Empire. Granatstein noted that in the First World War, British immigrants were disproportionately over-represented in the ranks of the Canadian Expeditionary Force; two-thirds of those who volunteered in 1914 were British-born, and an &quot;extraordinary&quot; 228,170 of the 470,000 young male British immigrants in Canada volunteered for the war. Conscription was introduced in 1917, and it was not until the following year that the majority of the CEF became Canadian-born. The same pattern repeated itself in the Second World War, with the difference being that this time, the majority of the Anglo-Canadians volunteering to fight overseas were Canadian-born rather than British-born. In contrast, during both wars, it was Canadians who least identified with the British Empire that were least likely to volunteer to fight overseas.

Granatstein wrote about World War II enlistment:&quot;If French-speaking Canadians enlisted well below their share of the population, as they did, and if ten percent of the total Canadian population joined one of the armed services, then Anglo-Canadians must have enlisted in higher numbers than all or almost all ethnic or religious communities. In other words, Canadians of British origin made up the lion&#x27;s share of enlistments, exactly as in the Great War, though now most were Canadian-born.&quot;Brigadier W.H.S. Macklin, an officer tasked with &quot;converting&quot; Zombies into &quot;going active&quot;, wrote in May 1944 that he experienced almost total failure persuading French-Canadians to do so, adding: &quot;The great majority [of NRMA soldiers in other units] are of non-British origin—German, Italian, and Slavic nationalities predominating. Moreover, most of them come from farms. They are of deplorably low education, know almost nothing of Canadian or British history and in fact are typical European peasants...&quot; Granatstein wrote that the research supported Macklin&#x27;s conclusions, if not his commentary. However, the Army&#x27;s need for men to &quot;go active&quot; by volunteering for overseas duty led to the ending of the whites-only policy for officers. About 500 Chinese-Canadians enlisted in the military, and unlike in the First World War, some were able to obtain officers&#x27; commissions, though this was not easy.

After the Italian campaign in 1943 and Normandy invasion in 1944, the lack of volunteers meant that Canada faced troop shortages. The offensive against the Gustav Line in Italy (Battle of Ortona in December 1943), Gothic Line in Italy (Battle of Monte Cassino) and the Normandy campaign, especially the battles of Caen and the Falaise Gap, had decimated the Canadian infantry. However, General Kenneth Stuart, chief of the Canadian Military Headquarters in London, had downplayed Canadian losses in France and Italy throughout the summer of 1944, only starting to hint at the truth in late August. By late summer, numbers of new recruits were insufficient to replace war casualties in Europe, particularly among the infantry. On 22 November 1944, King&#x27;s Liberal government decided to send to Europe a single contingent of 16,000 home defence draftees trained as infantry men.

Further contributing to King&#x27;s difficulties was the return of Duplessis to power in the Quebec election of 8 August 1944. Duplessis won the election by appealing to antisemitic prejudices in Quebec. He claimed, in a violently antisemitic speech, that the Dominion government and the government of Premier Godbout had made a secret deal with the &quot;International Zionist Brotherhood&quot; to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war, in exchange for campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties. By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and that if he were elected premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. Though Duplessis&#x27;s story about plans to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely untrue, it was widely believed in Quebec and propelled him to victory. The return to power of Duplessis, a French-Canadian nationalist opposed to both the war and to sending the Zombies overseas, made King more reluctant to have the Zombies fight at the exact moment the Canadian Army in Europe was suffering from major manpower shortages.

The crisis began on 19 September 1944, when Major Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who had been invalided out of the Army following wounds received in France, issued a statement published on the front page in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He charged that infantry replacements in the First Canadian Army were &quot;green, inexperienced and poorly trained&quot;, as the Army was hastily sending cooks and clerks to replace killed and wounded soldiers. Due to their inexperience, the replacements were in turn usually swiftly killed or wounded themselves. Smythe said that the solution was to send the Zombies overseas, as they had been training for the last four years or so. Smythe&#x27;s ownership of one of the country&#x27;s only two NHL teams meant he was a celebrity in Canada, and his letter attracted considerable media attention. Conservative Ontario Premier George Drew, who was already looking forward to becoming Prime Minister, endorsed Smythe&#x27;s claims.

In response, Defence Minister James Ralston decided to personally investigate reports of major infantry shortages by visiting Northwest Europe and Italy. Upon his return to Ottawa, he informed the Cabinet that the situation was far worse than he had been led to believe; front-line infantry regiments were so short of manpower that wounded men were being pulled out of hospitals and sent back to the front lines. The manpower shortages were especially serious in French-speaking regiments, due to a lack of volunteers.

Further contributing to the crisis were heavy losses being taken by the First Canadian Army in the Battle of the Scheldt, the most difficult and bloody fought by the Canadians in northwest Europe. In October 1944, the Black Watch and Royal Hamilton Light Infantry regiments both suffered 50% casualty rates fighting on the Scheldt river banks. As more and more Canadians were killed or wounded during the battle without anyone to replace them, the survivors were required to do more with less, inflicting major psychological strain on frontline infantry units. Many soldiers were psychologically broken by the bloody fighting during the offensive, falling victim to battle exhaustion and refusing to move, making manpower shortages even worse. Such were the shortages that the Army refused to provide proper treatment for men suffering from battle exhaustion, allowing only the shortest possible period of rest and treatment before sending them back to the front, a policy criticized by the Army&#x27;s psychiatrists as inhumane. One officer, Major Ben Dunkelman of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles Regiment, wrote at the time: &quot;We knew why leaves were so scarce. Thanks to Prime Minister Mackenzie King&#x27;s handling of the Conscription issue at home&quot;. Another serving in Italy, Brigadier Bill Murphy, wrote to his wife: &quot;I personally will never cast another Liberal vote as long as King as anything to do with the party. Of the armies in Italy, only that of Canada has no provisions for home leave&quot;, the reason for which was &quot;that there are no men to replace them-except the Zombie Army. And to preserve the Zombies&#x27; precious skins the volunteers just have to take it&quot;.

On 13 October 1944, Ralston telegraphed King from Europe: &quot;I regret to say that conditions and prospects of which I have learned will I fear necessitate reassessment in light of the future particularly regarding infantry involving, I fear, grave responsibilities&quot;. King wrote in his diary that Ralston&#x27;s cable was &quot;an intimation that he was coming back with the intention of making proposals which may involve the whole question of conscription&quot;. King added that sending any conscripts overseas would be a &quot;criminal thing&quot; that would cause a Canadian civil war, and lead to the United States stepping in to annex Canada. On 19 October, Ralston formally informed King of the need for more men in Europe and on 24 October, the matter was first discussed at the Cabinet, where the defence minister said: &quot;I feel that there is no alternative but for me to recommend the extension of service of NRMA personnel overseas&quot;.

Ralston informed the Cabinet that in order to continue combat operations, the overseas Canadian Army needed 15,000 new infantrymen immediately, and that the only way to get these replacements was to draw from the 60,000 Zombies guarding both the Pacific coast against an unlikely Japanese invasion and the Atlantic coast against an equally unlikely German invasion. Ralston argued that the only other way to prevent the Canadian Army from bleeding to death was to pull it out of the front, which would have been humiliating for the Canadian people. King objected to Ralston&#x27;s assessment, saying that the imminent Allied victory precluded the need to send the Zombies overseas, and that he could not care less about the manpower shortage problems in the overseas Canadian Army. The cabinet was badly divided on the issue; some ministers supported Ralston, while others were behind King.

An additional concern for King was that Ralston was from Nova Scotia, as were Angus MacDonald, junior Defence minister in charge of the navy, and Finance Minister J.L. Ilsley. The three politicians from Nova Scotia were close friends; fellow minister C.D. Howe commented that &quot;the three Nova Scotians were a sub-cabinet in themselves&quot;. King worried that if three leading ministers from Nova Scotia resigned together in protest against his conscription policies, they might topple his government. Thus much of King&#x27;s time in October 1944 was spent charming MacDonald and Ilsley in an attempt to break up the Nova Scotia triumvirate. King felt that MacDonald disliked him for vetoing his plan to send Royal Canadian Navy ships to the Indian Ocean since it would mean having Canadian ships under British command. But he discovered that MacDonald was both more conciliatory than he expected and concerned about alienating French Canada from English Canada. King wrote in his diary that &quot;Angus said he saw the difficulties. Was much concerned about everything himself, but Ralston was hard to deal with&quot;. MacDonald tended to favor enacting conscription if it was necessary to win the war, but he was widely viewed as a possible future Prime Minister and wanted to avoid another 1917-style split in the Liberal Party, making him ambivalent about where he stood.

King&#x27;s first attempt at a solution was to ask the British prime minister Winston Churchill for a statement that Canada had done more than enough to win the war, and that sending the Zombies overseas was unnecessary, a request Churchill refused. King&#x27;s next move was to fire General Stuart for underreporting Canadian losses in Europe, thus providing King with a scapegoat but not really resolving the problem. King noted that Ralston and the other ministers who supported sending the Zombies overseas were all from the right wing of the Liberal Party and had also opposed his plans for a postwar welfare state, which he decided was evidence of a &quot;reactionary conspiracy&quot; to bring him down. King was convinced that there was a plot to &quot;get me out&quot; and that Ralston had provoked the crisis to make himself Prime Minister.

King&#x27;s paranoia about a plot to force him out was sparked by the fact that the Canadian military had 1.1 million people, out of a total population of 11 million, serving in its ranks, of whom half had &quot;gone active&quot;. This made the Army&#x27;s inability to find 15,000 men simply inconceivable to King. Historian Desmond Morton wrote that King&#x27;s rationale was legitimate, but the answers were far more complex than a conspiracy of right-wing cabinet ministers working to oust him in conjunction with the military.
The reasons behind the shortages of infantry were the following:
* The Royal Canadian Air Force, the most glamorous and relatively luxurious of the three services, had attracted far more volunteers than it needed. The RCAF used the volunteers for its gargantuan air training program, taking away men who could have been used for the Army.
* In 1943, over the objections of McNaughton and the rest of the generals, King had sent the I Canadian Corps to Italy while keeping the II Canadian Corps in Britain, thereby requiring two different administrative organizations that tied up considerable manpower.
* In the summer of 1944, the I Canadian Corps was thrown into an offensive against the Gothic Line without any troops to provide a diversionary attack, and took very heavy losses, right after the bloody Battle of the Liri Valley in May 1944.
* In spite of having five years to prepare for combat, the II Canadian Corps was not as well trained as it could have been when it was sent to France, and thereby suffered heavy casualties.
* Despite expectations, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group had failed to win the war in 1944 as he had promised, and by launching Operation Market Garden, he had allowed the Germans to move the 15th Army into the upper banks of the river Scheldt to make the port of Antwerp unusable. As long as Antwerp was closed, the Allies lacked the necessary deepwater port near to Germany to support an offensive into the &quot;Reich&quot;. By not securing the Scheldt in September 1944 as Montgomery could have, and instead launching the ill-timed Battle of Arnhem, the third-largest port in Europe remained closed, causing enough logistical problems to shut down the entire Allied advance. This ensured that none of the Allied armies, from the North Sea to Switzerland, could advance deep into Germany in the fall of 1944, pushing the end of the war into 1945. Morton noted that if Montgomery had decided to forego Operation Market Garden and instead cleared the Scheldt, Antwerp would have been opened earlier, enabling Allied offensives into Germany and potentially ending the war. Opening Antwerp required that the II Canadian Corps fight the very bloody and difficult Battle of the Scheldt, in which Montgomery for a time placed the First Canadian Army last in supply allocations, forcing the Canadians to ration ammunition in the Scheldt.
* The Army&#x27;s casualty replacement system was based upon the British one developed in North Africa, where the Luftwaffe often struck well beyond the front lines, leading to more or less equal number of replacements needed among the infantry, armour, artillery, service corps, engineers, etc. By contrast, in northwest Europe, the Luftwaffe was no longer an effective force, and the Canadian infantry took almost all of the casualties.
* Knowing what King had wanted to hear, General Kenneth Stuart had suppressed news of mounting losses in Europe. This allowed for a mood of complacency to emerge in Ottawa; King was told there were enough volunteers to replace all of the losses in the European theatre.

The French-Canadian ministers in the Cabinet, and Quebec in general, did not trust Defence Minister Ralston, and King felt it was politically sensible to replace him as Minister of National Defence with the anti-conscription General Andrew McNaughton in November 1944. When the Cabinet met on the morning of 1 November 1944, King, who had only informed his Quebec lieutenant Louis St. Laurent in advance, suddenly announced that he now accepted Ralston&#x27;s resignation, which had been submitted back in April 1942. Ralston had been effectively fired as Defence minister. King took a gamble by firing Ralston, because other right-wing, pro-conscription Liberal cabinet ministers like C. D. Howe and J. L. Ilsley could have resigned in protest, thereby splitting the Liberal Party like the Grits in 1917. Much to King&#x27;s relief, Ralston walked out of the cabinet room and no one followed him. Ralston&#x27;s ally, Navy Minister Angus Macdonald, ripped pieces of paper in frustration, but remained seated with the rest of the cabinet.

Though asked to resign as commander of the First Canadian Army in 1943 after his disastrous Operation Spartan wargame performance, General McNaughton was a popular and well-respected war hero (the official story had been that he had retired for health reasons). McNaughton was opposed to sending the Zombies overseas, and from King&#x27;s viewpoint, he had an additional benefit: he and Ralson hated one another. McNaughton believed he could persuade a sufficient number of Zombies to fight overseas through the sheer force of his personality, a policy that failed. One Zombie was quoted in the press as saying, &quot;If Mackenzie King wants me to go overseas, he&#x27;ll have to send me. I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;ll volunteer to help out this government&quot;. McNaughton was unable to produce large numbers of volunteers for the army, though there were numerous volunteers for the navy and air force. Historians Jack Granatstein and Desmond Morton noted that &quot;news of Ralston&#x27;s sacking put the conscription crisis on the front pages in screaming headlines. To King&#x27;s horror and to McNaughton&#x27;s distress, the publicity created a firestorm of reaction against the once-popular general. Audiences booed and jeered when he tried to rally the country behind the no-conscription policy&quot;. In Vancouver, General George Pearkes, commanding officer of the Pacific command, called a press conference to explain why the Army was asking the Zombies to &quot;go active&quot;, which led King, who distrusted all of his generals, to write in his diary: &quot;These men in uniform have no right to speak in ways that will turn people against civil power&quot;.

Members of King&#x27;s cabinet threatened to resign and bring down the government if the Zombies were not sent overseas. J. L. Ilsley, C. D. Howe, Angus Macdonald, Colin W. G. Gibson, Thomas Crerar, and William Pate Mulock all threatened resignation if King persisted with his current policies. On the morning of 22 November 1944, General John Carl Murchie told McNaughton that his policies had failed and that hardly any Zombies were volunteering to &quot;go active&quot;, which McNaughton recalled &quot;was like a blow to the stomach&quot;. Later on 22 November 1944, McNaughton telephoned King to say, as the latter wrote in his diary, &quot;The Headquarters staff here had all advised him that the voluntary system would not get the men...It was the most serious advice that could be tended&quot;. King added that at once &quot;there came to mind the statement that I had made to Parliament in June [1942] about the action the government would necessarily take if we were agreed that the time had come when conscription was necessary&quot;. But King chose to misrepresent McNaughton&#x27;s statement as some sort of military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, which in his own words were variously a &quot;general&#x27;s revolt&quot;, a &quot;palace revolution&quot;, and &quot;the surrender of civil government to the military&quot;. Morton wrote that Murchie&#x27;s statement about the failure of McNaughton&#x27;s recruiting drive was &quot;irrefutable&quot;, adding that &quot;It was no act of mutiny to tell the truth. Yet to King, the notion of a &#x27;general&#x27;s revolt&#x27; was too useful to ignore. It fitted his view of the military. It superseded the mutiny that really mattered – the imminent resignation of the pro-conscription ministers. It would frighten the anti-conscriptists&quot;. King&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant Louis St. Laurent chose to accept &quot;this fiction&quot; that King was being forced by the military to send the Zombies overseas against his will, but Air Minister Charles &quot;Chubby&quot; Power would not, resigning in protest at the violation of the government&#x27;s promises to the people of Quebec.

King finally agreed to a one-time levy of 17,000 NRMA conscripts for overseas service in November 1944. Many of the Zombies deserted rather than fight in the war. General McNaughton, never having been elected to the House of Commons, on 23 November 1944, had to go to the bar of the House of Commons to announce that 16,000 Zombies would go overseas if the House gave its approval. When word of the decision reached soldiers stationed in Terrace, British Columbia, it resulted in the short-lived Terrace Mutiny. A brigade of Zombies in Terrace mounted guns on the railroad linking Terrace to Prince Rupert, announcing that they were now on &quot;strike&quot; as they had no desire to fight in the war. General George Pearkes headed north to Terrace, and soon restored order by telling the mutineers that the penalty for mutiny was death, but promising that if the men laid down their arms, no one would be tried for the mutiny. The following debates in the House of Commons were very bitter, but on 8 December 1944, a motion of no-confidence in the government was defeated 143 to 70, though 34 Quebec Liberal MPs voted for the motion. The no-confidence vote marked the end of the crisis. The population of Quebec was outraged that NRMA men were being sent overseas, but as King had done everything possible to put this off, the political damage was limited. Furthermore, of the national parties in Canada, the CCF was too left-wing for Catholic and conservative Quebec, while the pro-conscription views of the Conservatives limited their appeal in &quot;la belle province&quot;, which as King noted at the time, meant the Liberals were the only party capable of forming a government Quebec could vote for.

The First Canadian Army&#x27;s heavy losses and exhaustion from the Battle of the Scheldt in October–November 1944 led to a three-month rest period for the field army, which prevented further losses. In addition, the transfer of the I Canadian Corps from Italy provided the First Canadian Army further manpower as it joined the 21st Army Group in February 1945 to advance into the Netherlands and northwest Germany, securing the left flank of the 2nd British Army as it advanced deep into the &quot;Reich&quot;. No further combat deployment was made until February 1945, when 12,908 men were sent overseas, most of whom were from the home service conscripts drafted under the NRMA, rather than from the general population.

Few conscripts saw combat in Europe: only 2,463 men reached units on the front lines. Out of these, 69 died. Politically, this was a successful gamble for King, as he avoided a drawn-out political crisis and remained in power until his retirement in 1948. However, King&#x27;s refusal to commit the Zombies to action led to considerable bitterness among those who volunteered to &quot;go active&quot;. In his war memoirs, Farley Mowat recalls savagely disliking those in uniform who refused to make the same sacrifices he and his brothers-in-arms were called on to make in Italy and northwest Europe. The Zombies wore a black tie and collared shirts as part of their uniforms, while volunteers for overseas duties did not. In April 1945, the men of the First Canadian Army were informed that henceforth they would now wear the Zombie black tie and collared shirt. Mowat, serving with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, wrote that &quot;the black tie itself was known as the Zombie tie, and the resentment of the volunteers, who were now ordered to wear this symbol of shame, was most outspoken.&quot;

==Postscript to the crisis==
In the federal election on June 11, 1945, Progressive Conservative leader John Bracken proposed conscription for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, which badly hurt his chances. By contrast, Mackenzie King promised to commit one division, the 6th, to be recruited from veterans still wanting to fight in Japan. King handily won the election, as Canadian public opinion was unwilling to support conscription for a campaign that would cause heavy losses. The invasion of Japan, scheduled in two stages for late 1945 and early 1946, was widely expected to be a bloody campaign; the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa were seen as &quot;dress rehearsals&quot; for the invasion. Moreover, it was believed the invasion would take at least a year, if not longer.

Mackenzie King was caught between his promise to the United States that Canada would fully commit to the planned invasion of Japan, and his promise that only volunteers would fight there. An unexpected naval incident appeared to foreshadow the looming crisis, when the crew of the Royal Canadian Navy cruiser HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot;, operating off the coast of Japan, announced that it had only volunteered to &quot;go active&quot; against Germany and had no desire to &quot;go active&quot; against Japan, forcing the Royal Canadian Navy, much to its embarrassment, to send the &quot;Uganda&quot; home in the summer of 1945. A few days later, on 6 August 1945, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; a second was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. On 14 August, Emperor Hirohito addressed his subjects by radio to ask them to &quot;bear the unbearable&quot; (i.e. surrender). The Japanese decision to surrender instead of fighting on to the bitter end, as widely expected, saved Mackenzie King from what was emerging as a new conscription crisis.

<text>The Spingarn Medal is awarded annually by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for an outstanding achievement by an African American. The award was created in 1914 by Joel Elias Spingarn, chairman of the board of directors of the NAACP. It was first awarded to biologist Ernest E. Just in 1915, and has been given most years thereafter.

At its annual convention, the NAACP presents the award after deciding from open nominations. Should the organization end, it would be managed by Howard or Fisk Universities. The gold medal is valued at $100, and Spingarn left $20,000 () in his will for the NAACP to continue giving it indefinitely.

<text>The suffix -onym (from ) is a bound morpheme, that is attached to the end of a root word, thus forming a new compound word that designates a particular &quot;class&quot; of names. In linguistic terminology, compound words that are formed with suffix -onym are most commonly used as designations for various onomastic classes. Most onomastic terms that are formed with suffix -onym are classical compounds, whose word roots are taken from classical languages (Greek and Latin).

For example, onomastic terms like toponym and linguonym are typical classical (or neoclassical) compounds, formed from suffix &quot;-onym&quot; and classical (Greek and Latin) root words ( / place; / language). In some compounds, the &quot;-onym&quot; morpheme has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the &quot;o&quot;. In the compounds like &quot;ananym&quot; and &quot;metanym&quot;, the correct forms (&quot;anonym&quot; and &quot;metonym&quot;) were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as &quot;hypernym&quot; and &quot;characternym&quot;, are typically redundant neologisms, for which there are more traditional words formed with the full &quot;-onym&quot; (&quot;hyperonym&quot; and &quot;charactonym&quot;).

The English suffix &quot;-onym&quot; is from the Ancient Greek suffix (&quot;ōnymon&quot;), neuter of the suffix (&quot;ōnymos&quot;), having a specified kind of name, from the Greek (&quot;ónoma&quot;), Aeolic Greek ὄνυμα (&quot;ónyma&quot;), &quot;name&quot;. The form &quot;-ōnymos&quot; is that taken by &quot;ónoma&quot; when it is the end component of a bahuvrihi compound, but in English its use is extended to tatpuruṣa compounds.

The suffix is found in many modern languages with various spellings. Examples are: Dutch &quot;synoniem&quot;, German &quot;Synonym&quot;, Portuguese &quot;sinónimo&quot;, Russian синоним (&quot;sinonim&quot;), Polish &quot;synonim&quot;, Finnish &quot;synonyymi&quot;, Indonesian &quot;sinonim&quot;, Czech &quot;synonymum&quot;.

According to a 1988 study of words ending in &quot;-onym&quot;, there are four discernible classes of &quot;-onym&quot; words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, occurring in particular in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) nonce words. Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., &quot;eponym&quot; and &quot;cryptonym&quot;). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernible (e.g., &quot;necronym&quot; and &quot;penthonym&quot;). New words are sometimes created, the meaning of which duplicating existing terms. On occasion, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles.

* taxonym: a name used for classification or identification purposes, usually signifying a relationship to something. Taxonyms include binomens, names of clades or taxas, demonyms, ethnonyms, and eponyms. Examples include &quot;canine&quot;, &quot;hominid&quot;, and &quot;Dryad&quot;.
* teknonym: a name that refers to a parent by the name of one of their children.
* textonym: a word that is generated by a single sequence of numerals keyed in to a mobile telephone; for example, &quot;726&quot; produces &quot;pam&quot;, &quot;ram&quot;, &quot;sam&quot;, and &quot;ran&quot;. Also called homonumeric words.
* theonym: a name of a god or a goddess. The names societies give their gods at times is useful in understanding the origin of their language as well as their view of a particular deity. Analysis of theonyms has been useful in understanding the connections of Indo-European languages, and possibly their religions, in particular. In Abrahamic faiths the origin and meaning of the Tetragrammaton is sometimes deemed to have important historical or even metaphysical meaning.

For example, &quot;to duel&quot; is a troponym of &quot;to fight&quot;; &quot;to write&quot; is a troponym of &quot;to communicate&quot;; etc. The concept of &quot;troponym&quot; is to verbs as that of &quot;hyponym&quot; is to nouns.
* urbanonym: a name of an urban element (street, square etc.) in towns and cities.
* zoonym: a name of an animal.

She voiced the lead character Fa Mulan in the Mandarin version of the 1998 Disney Film &quot;Mulan&quot;, and sang its theme song &quot;Reflection&quot;. 

She was the first Asian singer to have music released globally, making her the first Chinese singer to break into the western market. Her album &quot;Just No Other Way&quot;, released in 1999, was the first ever English-language album recorded by an Asian singer. Her globally-released single &quot;Do You Want My Love&quot; received international success, appearing on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Breakouts Chart at No. 4 and entered Top 50 of the US Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart while also peaking at No. 14 on the Official Australian Singles Chart and No. 20 on the Official Chart in New Zealand. 

Lee’s 2000 song &quot;A Love Before Time&quot; was nominated by the Academy Award for Best Original Song of the movie &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; she also performed the song at the 73rd Academy Awards, becoming the first, and so far only, Chinese performer to perform at the Academy Awards. She was also the first Asian-American singer to sing the US National Anthem at an NBA game, the first Asian singer to hold a concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles California, the first non-mainland Chinese singer to win the Chinese singing reality show &quot;I Am A Singer&quot;, and the first Asian brand ambassador for Chanel. 

She died in Hong Kong at the age of 48.

==Early life==
Ferren Lee was born on 17 January 1975 in Hong Kong or Wuhan. She was born after her father&#x27;s death due to illness, making her a posthumous child. She also had physical defects in her left leg, which affected her throughout her life and contributed to her later challenges. After her father&#x27;s death, Lee&#x27;s mother moved the family to Hong Kong to seek support from relatives. They faced difficult times there before immigrating to the USA when CoCo was 9 years old. She had two elder sisters, Carol and Nancy. Nancy would become Coco&#x27;s manager early on in her career. She was raised in Hong Kong and had a lot of pleasant memories there. Lee and her family moved to San Francisco when she was around 10. She attended Redding Elementary School, Presidio Middle School and Raoul Wallenberg Traditional High School there. Lee won the title of Miss Teen Chinatown San Francisco in 1991 at age 16, marking a significant step toward her later success in the entertainment industry.

Lee won a local singing contest twice at 17. During the first time she won, she joined in to pay for the damage she did to her mom&#x27;s car. The second time, she entered it again just because it was so enjoyable. After graduating from high school in 1993, she entered a TVB competition in Hong Kong and was offered a recording contract. Lee attempted to juggle her singing career in Hong Kong with her pre-medical studies at the University of California, Irvine but eventually left after her first year to concentrate on her pop career. During an interview in 1997, Lee said she never intended to become a star. Her goal in life was to become a surgeon because her mother was a successful doctor, although completing all of her medical training might take another decade.

==Career==
===Career beginnings and Sony Music: 1993–1998===
In 1993, Lee returned to Hong Kong to see her sisters, who had participated in the Miss Hong Kong Pageant in 1992. While there, she took part in the 12th Annual New Talent Singing Awards (1993) and was the first runner-up, singing Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Run to You&quot;. The following day, Capital Artists offered her a recording contract.

Lee made her debut on compilation albums including &quot;Red Hot Hits &#x27;93 Autumn Edition&quot; (火熱動感93勁秋版). In 1994, she released her first solo albums in Mandarin in Taiwan, &quot;Love from Now On&quot; (愛就要趁現在) and &quot;Promise Me&quot; (答應我), with Fancy Pie Records. Her English language cover album, &quot;Brave Enough to Love&quot; (勇敢去愛), and her third Mandarin album, &quot;Woman in Love&quot; (被愛的女人), were released the following year.

In 1996, Lee signed with Sony Music Entertainment. Her next Mandarin album, &quot;CoCo Lee&quot; (往日情·愛我久一點), became the best-selling album of 1996 in Asia. Later that year she released an English cover album &quot;CoCo&#x27;s Party&quot; (CoCo&#x27;s Party). The following year, she released her Mandarin album &quot;Sincere&quot; (每一次想你) as well as a self-titled Cantonese album, &quot;COCO&quot; (COCO). That was her first and only solo Cantonese album. In 1998, the Mandarin album &quot;Di Da Di&quot; (Di Da Di·暗示) was released, selling 1 million copies in less than 3 months.

===International collaborations and English debut: 1998–2005===
From her next album &quot;&quot; (Sunny Day·好心情), &quot;Colors of the World&quot; (颜色) was used for the opening of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and the song &quot;The Answer&quot; (答案) for the Chinese movie &quot;Bishonen&quot;. In 1998, she was hired by Walt Disney Pictures to sing the theme song &quot;Reflection&quot; (自己; translation: Myself) and voice Fa Mulan in the Mandarin version of &quot;Mulan&quot; (花木蘭). In the same year, she sang &quot;Missing You in 365 Days&quot; (想你的365天), one of the theme songs of the film &quot;Lotus Lantern&quot;, the first commercial animated feature film in Mainland China.

In August 1998, Coco performed in Taiwan to a concert audience of more than 50,000 fans, the second-largest concert audience in Taiwan, exceeded only by Michael Jackson. She also performed in Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Michael Jackson and friends&quot; charity concert. In 1999, Lee released the Mandarin album &quot;From Today Till Forever&quot; (今天到永遠). Later that year, under 550 Music, she made her debut &quot;Just No Other Way&quot;, which included the hit, &quot;Do You Want My Love&quot;. The song reached No 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Breakouts chart in December 1999, marking her success as the first Chinese singer to break into the American market. Her love song &quot;Before I Fall in Love&quot; (originally performed by Canadian female singer Joanna Pennock in 1995 on her self named only album, Joanne) was included in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. She also recorded a duet called &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Over&quot; with singer Kelly Price. Lee recorded the charity singles &quot;We Meet the Future&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; for SARS with other artists including Wang Leehom, Stefanie Sun, Elva Hsiao, and Jolin Tsai. In Asia, she released a Mandarin album &quot;True Lover You &amp; Me&quot; (真情人·You &amp; Me). By 2000 she had released 20 albums in Asia and had sold 7.5 million copies of her albums on that continent.

In 2001, Lee sang the song &quot;A Love Before Time&quot; for the movie &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, which she performed at the Oscars. The song was introduced by the actress Julia Stiles as an “evocative love ballad” that combined &quot;the flavor and texture of Eastern music with the orchestral color and sensitive lyrics of Western culture&quot; in the ceremony. Her album &quot;Promise Coco&quot; (Promise) was released in October 2001. She recorded a Mandarin Chinese cover titled &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; (Baby 對不起) as the lead single of the album. Her version&#x27;s lyrics were co-written by Lee along with Lou Nanwei while the music is still the same original composition by Alfanno. A music video was released on the same year by Sony Music Entertainment Her version placed at number 35 on the Taiwan Yearly Singles Top 100 chart in 2001. In 2002, Lee released her remix album &quot;D. Is Coco&quot; (&quot;Dance Is Coco&quot;). She sang an anti-tobacco song called &quot;From the Beginning &#x27;til the End&quot; (煙絲萬縷) with singer Jacky Cheung. In the same year, at the NBA (National Basketball Association) debut of Yao Ming Lee performed the US national anthem and became the first Chinese-American singer to sing at an NBA game. She also sang the anti-racism song &quot;A Dream of One&quot; with Korean singer Jin Young Park. In 2003, she performed with Shaggy at the &quot;MTV Asia Awards&quot; in Singapore and also presented the show with him.

Lee co-starred in the Chinese comedy movie &quot;Master of Everything&quot; (自娱自乐) with John Lone, which won the Best Foreign Film award in the 2005 Beverly Hills Film Festival.

===Second English album and Warner Music: 2005–2011===

In 2005, Sony BMG released her second English album, &quot;Exposed&quot;. The album was banned in Mainland China for sexy lyrics in a few songs such as &quot; Touch&quot; or &quot;So Good&quot;. Lee&#x27;s next Mandarin album, &quot;&quot; (要定你), was released on 22 September 2006. In 2008, Lee was chosen to sing one of the 2008 Summer Olympics&#x27; songs, &quot;Forever Friends&quot;, opposite Sun Nan.

As the first Asian singer to perform at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Lee had a solo concert there in July 2009, singing some of Michael Jackson&#x27;s songs in homage to her idol. On 14 August 2009, she released her new Mandarin album &quot;East to West&quot; (CoCo的東西) with Warner Music Group. It contains the songs &quot;Party time&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot; (流轉) which is on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;The Legend of Silk Boy&quot; for the Shanghai World Expo 2010 and &quot;BYOB&quot; (&quot;Bring Your Own Bag&quot;) a song to encourage people to bring and recycle their own shopping bags to save the environment. She recorded the song &quot;Smile Shanghai&quot; (微笑上海) with other artists including JJ Lin, Andy Lau, Jam Hsiao, and Jane Zhang for Shanghai World Expo 2010. On 27 March 2010, Lee began her &quot;East2West&quot; World Tour Concert in Taipei at Taipei Arena. She performed at the Encore Theatre in Wynn Casino in Las Vegas on 3 and 4 July, then in Singapore Indoor Stadium in Singapore on 2 October, and in Nanning on 16 December. In March 2011, Lee was one of many artists who participated in the recording of &quot;Artistes 311 Love Beyond Borders&quot; official theme song called &quot;Succumb not to sorrow&quot; (不要輸給心痛) for the Cantonese version. On 7 April 2011, her song &quot;Dreams on oriental seas&quot; (梦在东方的海上) featuring Sun Nan was broadcast. It was named as the theme for the 14th FINA World Championships, which took place in Shanghai on 16 July 2011.

===New album and final projects before death: 2011–2023===

On 8 June 2011, Lee announced that had she set up her own studio. On 25 June, her song ″Four seas alliance″ (四海盟約), the theme song for the 2011 China television drama &quot;All Men are Brothers&quot;, was broadcast. On 17 December 2011, she performed at &quot;Booey Lehoo Concert&quot; in Beijing with will.i.am and apl.de.ap from The Black Eyed Peas, John Legend, and Shunza. On 9 February 2012, she performed at the TRANS4M Boyle Heights benefit at Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles with will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas.

Her album &quot;Illuminate&quot; (盛開) was released on 31 May 2013 with Universal Music. She was a judge on the 2015 version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in China.

In 2016, she competed in the fourth season of the Chinese reality show &quot;I Am A Singer&quot;, although she admitted that losing her voice to bronchitis in 2014 had affected her singing ability. However, she recovered and participated, going on to win the competition, making her the first non-mainland Chinese singer to do so. Lee later returned as a guest singer for two more seasons (now rebranded with the new title &quot;Singer&quot;); on the fifth season during the biennial concert, and on the sixth season as with a guest performer for Jessie J, the eventual winner of that season. In 2020, Coco Lee announced that she was going to re-record the Mandarin end-credits version of the song Reflection for the live adaptation of Mulan, as she had already done in 1998.

In 2023 she was digitally animated using motion capture for the virtual reality interactive concert &quot;Millennium Realm&quot; (千禧之境) on the Pico VR video platform.

==Personal life==

Lee married Hong Kong-based Canadian businessman Bruce Rockowitz on 27 October 2011 in Hong Kong in a Jewish ceremony. The wedding included performances by Bruno Mars, Alicia Keys, and Ne-Yo. For her wedding, she recorded the song &quot;I Just Wanna Marry U&quot; (Chinese and English version), which was released on 24 October 2011. In March 2018, she mentioned in a brand event that she was undergoing IVF in New York. She had no biological children but had two stepdaughters from her husband&#x27;s previous marriage. Rockowitz is alleged to have cheated on Lee. There were reports saying they had separated before Lee died and were due to sign the divorce papers in July 2023.

==Health issues==
Lee was born with an abnormality in her left leg. At the age of two, she underwent surgery which failed to correct the problem, causing her to rely more heavily on her right leg for most of her life.

Lee received a diagnosis of depression in 2019. Her sister said the condition deteriorated drastically the few months before her death although she had sought professional help.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2022 and had a tumor removed. In December 2022, the singer reported her weight as 42  kg (92lbs), sparking concerns for her health. On 8 March 2023, she disclosed on social media that she had surgery on her pelvis and thigh in Hong Kong the previous month, after triggering an old leg injury during a dance rehearsal in October 2022. She shared videos of herself learning to walk again with the aid of a walker as well as a nurse. Lee had to take muscle relaxant medication after the surgery, an insider said.

==Death==
Lee attempted suicide on 29 June 2023. She spent one night in a private hospital, before moving to her sisters&#x27; house at the Peak. She attempted suicide again on 2 July 2023 and was taken to the hospital, where she died three days later, on 5 July 2023, at the age of 48. The news of her death received much attention in China, getting almost 1.4 billion views on Weibo in one day.

The family asked Hong Kong authorities to investigate Lee&#x27;s death, and an autopsy has been requested to determine the cause.

===Services and tributes===

Lee&#x27;s sister Nancy has urged the government of Hong Kong to officially recognize the late star&#x27;s contributions. A vigil for Lee was held on 31 July at Hong Kong Funeral Home in North Point, with a public memorial service. There were eight pallbearers for the funeral, including her brother-in-law Billy Ho; singer Jenny Tseng; lyricist and music producer Chien Yao; Jonathan Serbin, the co-president of Asia at Warner Music; fan and television host Yang Yang; Grace Lee, Lee&#x27;s high school classmate in San Francisco; Lily Pang and Colleen Yu Fung, Lee&#x27;s good friends. The private funeral service was on 1 August.

Rockowitz&#x27;s name was missing from multiple announcements made by Lee&#x27;s sisters. It was reported that towards the end of the funeral service on 31 July, Nancy suddenly became emotional when hugging a friend and was heard shouting repeatedly in Cantonese: &quot;He took my sister away!&quot; Carol, the eldest sister, was also heard shouting: &quot;She&#x27;s saying he caused my sister to die!&quot; Their cries did not name any person and lasted for some time before the audio was muted. On 1 August, when asked to say something to Coco outside the crematorium, Rockowitz, who was being mobbed by Lee&#x27;s angry fans, said, &quot;I love her. My whole life.&quot; He has come under criticism after Lee&#x27;s death and has sought to dispel various allegations against him.

On October 21, 2023, Lee&#x27;s ashes were buried at the Shimen Peak Memorial Park in Wuhan, China. According to her sister, it was their mother&#x27;s wish that the ashes of Lee, who had never met her father when she was little, be laid to rest next to his.

She was remembered by the New York Times as &quot;a Chinese American singer and songwriter best known for performing an Oscar-nominated song in the hit film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”

===Aftermath===
====Leaked clips and &quot;Sing! China&quot;====
On 17 August 2023, a nine-minute audio clip featuring Lee, a coach during the season 7 of the show &quot;Sing! China&quot;, came to light. In the recording, she commented on her humiliation at the hands of the production team during the show&#x27;s final episode in October 2022. This humiliation followed her questioning of the competition format in September 2022.

Lee, who was about to undergo surgery on her left leg, alleged that she was subjected to a sudden placement change during a performance with Wang Zepeng, a contestant on her team. Wang, who was supposed to accompany Lee on stage to assist her due to her fragile condition, had his back turned to her, causing Lee to stand alone and fall during their duet. She described this experience as &quot;humiliating,&quot; especially since her health issues had been largely concealed from the public.

Wang later supported Lee&#x27;s claims by sharing screen captures of their private text messages, where Lee accused the director of intentionally undermining her. There was also a leaked video of a staff member on set attempting to remove Lee from the stage as she repeatedly said, &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me.&quot;

In the nine-minute audio clip, Lee stated that the production team threatened her, saying they would not give contestant Feige a chance to return to the stage unless she wrote a Weibo post. She complied to ensure Feige had an opportunity to showcase his talent.

&#x27;Jammy&#x27; Li Jiajie, one of the contestants in season 8 (2023) agreed with Lee after the clips&#x27; leakage. He said in his Weibo post that &quot;the price of 500,000 yuan per seat, in his opinion, is certainly not a baseless rumor... the top ten places in the finals are all available for purchase.&quot; His posts were mysteriously removed, and Li later said that his allegations were made without basis. People were surprised by the posts&#x27; removal and his &quot;apologies&quot;. They left comments asking him if he was threatened.

The controversy led to a significant debate among netizens, with calls to boycott the show&#x27;s sponsors. By 25 August 2023, the stock price of Star China Media, the parent company of &quot;Sing! China,&quot; plummeted by more than 50 percent, resulting in a loss of approximately $3 billion in value. On the same day (25 August), Zhejiang Satellite TV announced that the program had been frozen from broadcasting briefly pending an investigation over the alleged mistreatment of Lee and other issues raised by netizens and viewers.

In September, Sing! China’s producer Can Xing Media (a subsidiary of Star China Media) filed a suit against the management company of Lee, Warner Music China (HK) Limited. The company was accused of being shameless by some netizens for filing the suit.

==Legacy==
Lee is remembered by millennials who grew up during a time when Mandopop boomed and enjoyed listening to her songs in English and Mandarin. She is considered the ‘Asian Mariah Carey’ due to her impressive voice and dance. She was one of the first Asian singers to be widely recognized on both sides of the Pacific. Because of her multilingual and multicultural background, Lee has been compared to Ricky Martin. She has also been credited for breaking down international barriers and bridging the gap between East Asia and the West.

==Philanthropy==
Lee was actively involved in the work of UNICEF as a youth ambassador, promoting children&#x27;s right and their well-being. She supported the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants children with critical illness their wishes. She was also an ambassador for the Organisation for World Peace in China, Cancer Fund&#x27;s Pink Ambassador at Hong Kong&#x27;s first breast cancer survivors&#x27; fashion show in 2016 and Youth AIDS ambassador at a global AIDS conference in Bangkok, Thailand in 2004. As the Youth AIDS ambassador, she attended the conference as the representative of the Asian artists to meet various youth groups discussing what she could do to educate them about AIDS.

== Artistry ==
Lee was inspired by musicians such as Whitney Houston, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey. Because techniques employed by R&amp;B singers in English would change the pitch and meaning of words in Cantonese, she taught herself Mandarin, which allows for more tonal flexibility.

<text>Abraham Kuyper ( , ; 29 October 1837 – 8 November 1920) was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands between 1901 and 1905, an influential neo-Calvinist pastor and a journalist. He established the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, which upon its foundation became the second largest Reformed denomination in the country behind the state-supported Dutch Reformed Church.

In addition, he founded the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Anti-Revolutionary Party, and a newspaper. In religious affairs, he sought to adapt the Dutch Reformed Church to challenges posed by the loss of state financial aid and by increasing religious pluralism in the wake of splits that the church had undergone in the 19th century, rising Dutch nationalism, and the Arminian religious revivals of his day which denied predestination. He vigorously denounced modernism in theology as a fad that would pass away. In politics, he dominated the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) from its founding in 1879 to his death in 1920. He promoted pillarisation, the social expression of the anti-thesis in public life, whereby Protestant, Catholic and secular elements each had their own independent schools, universities and social organisations.

== Early life ==
Abraham Kuyper was born on 29 October 1837 in Maassluis, Netherlands. His father Jan Frederik Kuyper served as a minister for the Dutch Reformed Church in Hoogmade, Maassluis, Middelburg and Leiden.

Kuyper was home-schooled by his father. The boy received no formal primary education, but received secondary education at the Gymnasium of Leiden. In 1855, he graduated from the Gymnasium and began to study literature, philosophy and theology at Leiden University. He received his propaedeuse in literature in 1857, summa cum laude, and in philosophy in 1858, also summa cum laude. He also took classes in Arabic, Armenian and physics.

In 1862 he was promoted to Doctor in theology on the basis of a dissertation entitled &quot;Disquisitio historico-theologica, exhibens Johannis Calvini et Johannis à Lasco de Ecclesia Sententiarum inter se compositionem&quot; (Theological-historical dissertation showing the differences in the rules of the church, between John Calvin and John Łaski). In comparing the views of John Calvin and Jan Łaski, Kuyper showed a clear sympathy for the more liberal Łaski. During his studies Kuyper was a member of the modern tendency within the Dutch Reformed Church.

== Religious life ==
In May 1862, he was declared eligible for the ministry and 1863 he accepted a call to become minister for the Dutch Reformed Church for the town of Beesd. In the same year he married Johanna Hendrika Schaay (1842–1899). They had five sons and three daughters. In 1864 he began corresponding with the anti-revolutionary MP Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, who heavily influenced his political and theological views (see below).

Around 1866, he began to sympathise with the orthodox tendency within the Dutch Reformed Church. He was inspired by the robust reformed faith of Pietje Baltus, a single woman in her early 30s, the daughter of a miller. He began to oppose the centralization in the church, the role of the King and began to plead for the separation of church and state.

In 1867, Kuyper was asked to become minister for the parish in Utrecht and he left Beesd. In 1870 he was asked to come to Amsterdam. In 1871 he began to write for the &quot;De Heraut&quot; (&quot;The Herald&quot;).

In 1872, he founded his own paper, &quot;De Standaard&quot; (&quot;The Standard&quot;). This paper laid the foundation for the network of Reformed organisation (the Reformed pillar), which Kuyper founded.

=== Doleantie ===
In 1886, Kuyper led an exodus from the Dutch Reformed Church. He grieved the loss of Reformed distinctives within the State Church, which no longer required office bearers to agree to the Reformed standards which had once been foundational.

Kuyper and the consistory of Amsterdam insisted that both ministers and church members subscribe to the Reformed confessions. This was appealed to Classis, and Kuyper, along with about 80 members of the Amsterdam consistory, were suspended in December 1885. This was appealed to the provincial synod, which upheld the ruling in a 1 July 1886 ruling.

Refusing to accept his suspension, Kuyper preached to his followers in an auditorium on Sunday, 11 July 1886. Because of their deep sorrow at the state of the Dutch Reformed Church, the group called itself the (grieving ones).

By 1889, the churches had over 200 congregations, 180,000 members, and about 80 ministers.

Kuyper, although at first antagonistic towards them, soon began to seek union with the churches of the Secession of 1834, the (Christian Reformed Church). These churches had earlier broken off from the Dutch Reformed Church. This union was effected in 1892, and the (Reformed Churches in the Netherlands) was formed. This denomination has its counterpart in the Christian Reformed Church in North America.

=== Anti-modernism ===
He vigorously ridiculed modernism in theology as a new-fangled fad based on a superficial view of reality. He argued that modernism missed the reality of God, of prayer, of sin, and of the church. He said modernism would eventually prove as useless as &#x27;A Squeezed Out Lemon Peel,&#x27; while traditional religious truths would survive. In his lectures at Princeton in 1898 he argued that Calvinism was more than theology—it provided a comprehensive worldview and indeed had already proven to be a major positive factor in the development of the institutions and values of modern society.

== Political life ==
=== Member of Parliament ===
In 1873, Kuyper stood as candidate in the general election for parliament for the constituency of Gouda, but he was defeated by the incumbent member of parliament, the conservative Jonkheer . When De Brauw died the next year, Kuyper stood again in the by-election for the same district. This time he was elected to parliament, defeating the liberal candidate Herman Verners van der Loeff.

Kuyper subsequently moved to The Hague, without telling his friends in Amsterdam. In parliament he showed a particular interest in education, especially the equal financing of public and religious schools. In 1876, he wrote &quot;Our Program&quot; which laid the foundation for the Anti-Revolutionary Party. In this programme he formulated the principle of antithesis, the conflict between the religious (Reformed and Catholics) and non-religious. More broadly, this programme articulated his broader political philosophy, emphasizing the proper role of government among the other spheres of life, including the family and the church. Kuyper argued that government&#x27;s authority, like all human authority, derived from God&#x27;s authority. In 1877, he left parliament because of problems with his health, suffering from overexertion.

In 1878, Kuyper returned to politics, he led the petition against a new law on education, which would further disadvantage religious schools. This was an important impetus for the foundation of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1879, of which Kuyper was chairman between 1879 and 1905. He was the undisputed leader of the party between 1879 and 1920. His followers gave him the nickname &quot;Abraham de Geweldenaar&quot; (Abraham the Masterful). In 1880, he founded the Free University in Amsterdam and he was made professor of Theology there. He also served as its first rector magnificus. In 1881, he also became professor of literature. In 1886, he left the Dutch Reformed Church, with a large group of followers. The parish in Amsterdam was made independent of the church, and kept their own building. Between 1886 and 1892, they were called the &quot;Dolerenden&quot; (those with grievances). In 1892, those Dolerenden founded a new denomination called The Reformed Churches in the Netherlands after merging with other orthodox Reformed people who had seceded from the Dutch Reformed Church in 1834.

In the general election of 1894, Kuyper was re-elected to the House of Representatives for the district of Sliedrecht. He defeated the liberal Van Haaften and the anti-takkian anti-revolutionary Beelaerts van Blokland. He also ran as a candidate in Dordrecht and Amsterdam, but was defeated there. In the election he joined the so-called Takkians, in a conflict between the liberal minister Tak, and a majority House of Representatives. Tak wanted to reform the census-suffrage, but a majority in parliament rejected his proposal. Kuyper favoured the legislation because he expected the enfranchised lower class voters would favour his party. This orientation towards the lower classes gave him the nickname &quot;The bellringer of the common people&quot; (). His position on suffrage also led to a conflict within the ARP: a group around Alexander de Savornin Lohman was opposed on principle to universal suffrage because they rejected popular sovereignty; they left the ARP to found the CHU in 1901. The authoritarian leadership of Kuyper also played an important role in this conflict. Lohman opposed party discipline and wanted MPs to make up their own mind, while Kuyper favoured strong leadership. After the elections Kuyper became chair of the parliamentary caucus of the ARP. In his second term as MP he concentrated on more issues than education, like suffrage, labour, and foreign policy. In foreign affairs especially the Second Boer War was of particular interest to him, in the conflict between the Dutch-speaking reformed farmers and the English-speaking Anglicans he sided with the Boers, and heavily opposed the English. In 1896, Kuyper voted against the new suffrage law of Van Houten, because according to Kuyper the reforms did not go far enough. In the 1897 elections, Kuyper competed in Zuidhorn, Sliedrecht and Amsterdam. He was defeated by liberals in Zuidhorn and Amsterdam, but he defeated the liberal Wisboom in Sliedrecht. In Amsterdam he was defeated by Johannes Tak van Poortvliet. As an MP, Kuyper kept his job as journalist, and he even became chair of the Dutch Circle of Journalists in 1898; when he left in 1901 he was made honorary president. In the same year, at the invitation of B.B. Warfield, Kuyper delivered the &quot;Stone Lectures&quot; at Princeton Seminary, which was his first widespread exposure to a North American audience. These lectures were given 10–11 October 14 and 19–21 in 1898. He discusses the relationship of Calvinism with philosophy, religion, politics, science, art and the future. He also received an honorary doctorate in law there. During his time in the United States, he also traveled to address several Dutch Reformed congregations in Michigan and Iowa and Presbyterian gatherings in Ohio and New Jersey.

=== Prime minister ===

In the 1901 elections, Kuyper was re-elected in Sliedrecht, defeating the liberal De Klerk. In Amsterdam he was defeated again, now by the freethinking liberal Nolting. He did not take his seat in parliament however but was instead appointed formateur and later prime minister of the Dutch cabinet. He also served as minister of Home Affairs. He originally wanted to become minister of labour and enterprise, but neither Mackay or Heemskerk, prominent anti-revolutionaries, wanted to become minister of Home Affairs, forcing him to take the portfolio. During his time as prime minister he showed a strong leadership style: he changed the rules of procedure of cabinet in order to become chair of cabinet for four years (before him, the chairmanship of the cabinet had rotated among its members).

The portfolio of home affairs at the time was very broad: it involved local government, industrial relations, education and public morality. The 1903 railway strike was one of the decisive issues for his cabinet. Kuyper produced several particularly harsh laws to end the strikes (the so-called &quot;worgwetten&quot;, strangling laws), and pushed them through parliament. He also proposed legislation to improve working conditions; however only those on fishing and harbour construction passed through parliament. In education Kuyper changed several education laws to improve the financial situation of religious schools. His law on higher education, which would make the diplomas of faith-based universities equal to that of the public universities, was defeated in the Senate. Consequently, Kuyper dissolved the Senate and, after a new one was elected, the legislation was accepted. He was also heavily involved in foreign policy, giving him the nickname &quot;Minister of Foreign Travels&quot;.

=== Minister of State ===
In 1905, his ARP lost the elections and was confined to opposition. Between 1905 and 1907, Kuyper made a grand tour around the Mediterranean. In 1907, Kuyper became honorary doctor at the Delft University of Technology. In 1907, he was re-elected chair of the ARP, a post which he held until his death in 1920. In 1907, Kuyper wanted to return to parliament. In a by-election in Sneek he needed the support of the local CHU. They refused him support. This led to a personal conflict between Kuyper and De Savorin Lohman. In 1908, he came into conflict with Heemskerk, who had not involved him in the formation of the CHU/ARP/Catholic General League cabinet, thereby denying him the chance to return as minister. In 1908, Kuyper received the honorary title of minister of state. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the district of Ommen in the by-elections in the same year, defeating the liberal De Meester. He also ran in Sneek where he was elected as sole candidate. Kuyper took the seat for Ommen. In 1909, he was made chair of the committee that prepared the new orthography of the Dutch language. In the same year he also received an honorary doctorate at the Catholic University of Leuven. In the 1909 elections he was re-elected in Ommen, defeating the liberal Teesselink, but he was defeated in Dordrecht by the liberal De Kanter.

In 1909, he came under heavy criticism in the so-called decorations affairs (&quot;lintjeszaak&quot;). While minister of home affairs, Kuyper allegedly received money from one Rudolf Lehman, to make him Officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau. A parliamentary debate was held on the subject and a committee was instituted to research the claim. In 1910, the committee reported that Kuyper was innocent. Between 1910 and 1912, he was member of the committee headed by Heemskerk, which prepared a revision of the constitution. In 1912, he resigned his seat in parliament for health reasons, but he returned to politics in the following year, this time as a member of the Senate for the province of South Holland. He retained this seat until his death. In 1913, he was made commander in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. During the First World War Kuyper sided with the Germans, because he had opposed the English since the Boer wars. In 1918, Kuyper played an important role in the formation of the first cabinet led by Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck. In 1920, at the age of 83 Kuyper died in The Hague and was buried amid great public attention.

== Views ==
Kuyper&#x27;s theological and political views are linked. His orthodox Protestant beliefs heavily influenced his anti-revolutionary politics.

=== Theological views ===

In 1905 there was a higher education law enacted, but Kuyper was against this and became part of the opposition.

Theologically Kuyper has also been very influential. He opposed the liberal tendencies within the Dutch Reformed Church. This eventually led to secession and the foundation of Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. He developed the so-called neo-Calvinism, which goes beyond conventional Calvinism on a number of issues. Furthermore, Kuyper made a significant contribution to the formulation of the principle of common grace in the context of a Calvinist world-view.

Most important has been Kuyper&#x27;s view on the role of God in everyday life. He believed that God continually influenced the life of believers, and daily events could show his workings. Kuyper famously said, &quot;Oh, no single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest, and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over &quot;all&quot;, does not cry: &#x27;Mine! God continually re-creates the universe through acts of grace. God&#x27;s acts are necessary to ensure the continued existence of creation. Without his direct activity, creation would self-destruct.

=== Political views ===
Kuyper&#x27;s political ideals were orthodox-Protestant and anti-revolutionary.

The concept of sphere sovereignty was very important for Kuyper. He rejected the popular sovereignty of France in which all rights originated with the individual, and the state-sovereignty of Germany in which all rights derived from the state. Instead, he wanted to honour the &quot;intermediate bodies&quot; in society, such as schools and universities, the press, business and industry, the arts etc., each of which would be sovereign in its own sphere. In the interest of a level playing field, he championed the right of every faith community (among whom he counted humanists and socialists) to operate their own schools, newspapers, hospitals, youth movements etc. He sought equal government finances for all faith-based institutions. He saw an important role for the state in upholding the morality of the Dutch people. He favoured monarchy, and saw the House of Orange as historically and religiously linked to the Dutch people. His commitment to universal suffrage was only tactical; he expected the Anti-Revolutionary Party would be able to gain more seats this way. In actuality, Kuyper wanted a Householder Franchise where fathers of each family would vote for his family. He also favoured a Senate representing the various interest, vocational and professional groups in society.

With his ideals, he defended the interests of a group of middle class orthodox reformed, who were often referred to as &quot;the little people&quot; (). He formulated the principle of antithesis: a divide between secular and religious politics. Liberals and socialists, who were opposed to mixing religion and politics, were his natural opponents. Catholics were a natural ally, for not only did they want to practice religiously inspired politics, but they also were no electoral opponent, because they appealed to different religious groups. Socialists, who preached class conflict, were a danger to the reformed workers. He called for workers to accept their fates and be happy with a simple life because the afterlife would be much more satisfying and revolution would only lead to instability. At the same time, he argued that the system of unrestricted free enterprise was in need of &quot;architectonic critique&quot; and he urged government to adopt labour legislation and to inspect workplaces.

== Legacy ==
Kuyper&#x27;s political views and acts have influenced Dutch politics. Kuyper stood at the cradle of pillarisation, the social expression of the anti-thesis in public life. His championing of parity treatment for faith-based organisations and institutions created the basis for the alliance between Protestants and Catholics that has dominated Dutch politics to the present day. One of the major political parties of the Netherlands, the CDA, is still heavily influenced by Kuyper&#x27;s thought. His greatest theological act, the founding of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands was largely undone in 2004 with the creation of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands which united the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. There is still a small federation named the Continued Reformed Churches in the Netherlands which remains loyal to the foundations laid by Kuyper.

In North America, Kuyper&#x27;s political and theological views have had a significant impact, especially in the Reformed community. He is considered the father of Dutch Neo-Calvinism and had considerable influence on the thought of philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd. Others that have been influenced by Kuyper include Auguste Lecerf, Francis Schaeffer, Cornelius Van Til, Alvin Plantinga, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Albert M. Wolters, Vincent Bacote, Anthony Bradley, Chuck Colson, Timothy J. Keller, James Skillen, R. Tudur Jones, Bobi Jones, and the hip-hop artist Lecrae.

Institutions influenced by Kuyper include Cardus (formerly The Work Research Foundation), Calvin College, The Clapham Institute, Dordt College, Institute for Christian Studies, Redeemer University College, The Coalition for Christian Outreach, Covenant College, The Center for Public Justice, and the Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation, &amp; Culture. In 2006, Reformed Bible College, located in Grand Rapids, Michigan was renamed in honor of Abraham Kuyper and is now Kuyper College.

As well as Kuyper&#x27;s profound influence upon European Christian-Democrat politics up to the present, his political theology was also crucial in the history of South Africa. His legacy in South Africa is arguably even greater than within the Netherlands. There, his Christian-National conception, centred upon the identification of the Afrikaner Calvinist community as the , became a rallying position for the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa. As Christian nationalists, Kuyper&#x27;s adherents in South Africa were instrumental in the building of Afrikaner cultural, political and economic institutions to restore Afrikaner fortunes following the Boer War, which ultimately led to apartheid.

Saul Dubow notes that Kuyper advocated &quot;the commingling of blood&quot; as &quot;the physical basis for all higher development&quot; in the Stone Lectures (1898). Harinck argues that &quot;Kuyper was not guided by the cultural racism of his day, but by his Calvinistic creed of human equality&quot;.

Kuyper&#x27;s legacy includes a granddaughter, Johtje Vos, who is noted for having sheltered many Jews in her home in the Netherlands from the Nazis. After World War II she moved to New York City.

<text>There are a number of common mathematical meanings of the term digital sum:

== Values ==

* The digit sum - add the digits of the representation of a number in a given base. For example, considering 84001 in base 10 the digit sum would be 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 13.
* The digital root  - repeatedly apply the digit sum operation to the representation of a number in a given base until the outcome is a single digit. For example, considering 84001 in base 10 the digital root would be 4 (8 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 13, 1 + 3 = 4).

== Operations ==

The mathematical operation digital sum in base b can also be called the digital sum. This is where each place is summed independently, ignoring digit carry. For example, 84001 + 56734 = (8 + 5 = 13)(4 + 6 = 10)(0 + 7 = 7)(0 + 3 = 3)(1 + 4 = 5) = 30735.</text><links>

<doc id="306161" wikidata="Q7729550" url="?curid=306161" title="The Deep Blue Sea (play)">
<text>The Deep Blue Sea is a British stage play by Terence Rattigan from 1952. Rattigan based his story and characters in part on his secret relationship with Kenny Morgan, and the aftermath of the end of their relationship. The play was first performed in London on 6 March 1952, directed by Frith Banbury, and won praise for actress Peggy Ashcroft, who co-starred with Kenneth More. In the US, the Plymouth Theater staged the play in October 1952, with Margaret Sullavan. The play with Sullavan subsequently transferred to Broadway, with its Broadway premiere on 5 November 1953, and running for 132 performances.

Prior to Rattigan&#x27;s coding of his relationship with Morgan into the heterosexual relationship between Hester and Freddie, his first draft of the play more specifically treated the relationship between the lead characters as a homosexual relationship, and also hinted that the reason for the striking off of Miller, the ex-doctor in the play, from the medical register was Miller&#x27;s homosexuality.

==Plot summary==
Taking place over the course of one day, the play begins with the discovery of Hester Collyer in her flat by her neighbours, after Hester has failed in an attempt to take her own life by gassing herself. In flashback, sometime before, Hester left her husband, Sir William Collyer, a respectable High Court judge, for a semi-alcoholic former RAF pilot, Freddie Page. Their relationship was physical and passionate, but his ardour eventually cooled, leaving her emotionally stranded and desperate. Initially unemployed, Freddie eventually takes a post in South America. The aftershocks of her attempted suicide unravel even the remnants of this relationship. By the end of the day, Hester is brought to a hard decision to live, partly through the intercession of another resident of the tenement house, Mr. Miller, an ex-doctor who has been struck off the register for an undisclosed reason. These two outcasts find a curious kinship.

<doc id="306162" wikidata="Q2348731" url="?curid=306162" title="Cessna 152">
<text>The Cessna 152 is an American two-seat, fixed-tricycle-gear, general aviation airplane, used primarily for flight training and personal use. It was based on the earlier Cessna 150 incorporating a number of minor design changes and a slightly more powerful engine with a longer time between overhaul.

The Cessna 152 has been out of production for forty years, but many are still airworthy and are in regular use for flight training.

==Development==

First delivered in 1977 as the 1978 model year, the 152 was a modernization of the proven Cessna 150 design. The 152 was intended to compete with the new Beechcraft Skipper and Piper Tomahawk, both of which were introduced the same year. Additional design goals were to improve useful load through a gross weight increase to , decrease internal and external noise levels and run better on the then newly introduced Avgas fuel.

As with the 150, the great majority of 152s were built at the Cessna factory in Wichita, Kansas. A number of aircraft were also built by Reims Aviation of France and given the designation F152/FA152.

Production of the 152 was ended in 1985 when Cessna ended production of all of their light aircraft; by that time, a total of 7,584 examples of the 152, including A152 and FA152 Aerobat aerobatic variants, had been built worldwide.

In 2007 Cessna announced that it would build a light-sport successor, designated the Model 162 Skycatcher, although production ended in 2013.

==Design==

===Powerplant===
All Cessna 152s were manufactured with a Lycoming O-235 engine which has been in production since 1942. The Lycoming provided not only an increase in engine power over the Cessna 150, but also was more compatible with the newer 100LL low-lead fuel.

Cessna 152s produced between 1977 and 1982 were equipped with Lycoming O-235-L2C engines producing at 2,550 rpm. This engine still suffered some lead-fouling problems in service. In 1983, it was succeeded by the O-235-N2C which featured a different piston design and a redesigned combustion chamber to reduce this problem. The N2C engine was used until 152 production ended in 1985.

===Airframe===
The airframe is mainly of metal construction, being primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy with riveted skin. Components such as wingtips and fairings are made from glass-reinforced plastic. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque with vertical bulkheads and frames joined by longerons running the length of the fuselage. The wings are of a strut-braced design and have a 1 degree dihedral angle. The tapered (outboard) portion of each wing has one degree of washout (the chord of the tip section has one degree lower angle of attack than the chord at the end of the constant-width section). This allows greater aileron effectiveness during a stall.

The 1978 model has a one piece cowling nose bowl that requires removing the propeller to remove it. The 1979 model introduced a split-nose cowling nose bowl that can be removed without removing the propeller.

===Flying controls===
Dual controls are available as optional equipment on the Cessna 152 and almost all 152s have this option installed.

The Cessna 152 is equipped with differential ailerons that move through 20 degrees upwards and 15 degrees downwards. It has single-slotted fowler flaps which are electrically operated and deploy to a maximum of 30 degrees. The rudder can move 23 degrees to either side and is fitted with a ground-adjustable trim tab. The elevators move up through 25 degrees and down through 18 degrees. An adjustable trim tab is installed on the right elevator and is controlled by a small wheel in the center of the control console. The trim tab moves 10 degrees up and 20 degrees down relative to the elevator chordline.

===Landing gear===
The Cessna 152 is equipped with fixed tricycle landing gear. The main gear has tubular steel legs surrounded by a full-length fairing with a step for access to the cabin. The main gear has a wheelbase.

The nosewheel is connected to the engine mount and has an oleo strut to dampen and absorb normal operating loads. The nosewheel is steerable through 30 degrees either side of neutral and can castor under differential braking up to 30 degrees. It is connected to the rudder pedals through a spring linkage.

The braking system consists of single disc brake assemblies fitted to the main gear and operated by a hydraulic system. Brakes are operated by pushing on the top portion of the rudder pedals. It is possible to use differential braking when taxiing and this allows very tight turns to be made.

The 152 is also fitted with a parking brake system. It is applied by depressing both toe brakes and then pulling the &quot;Park Brake&quot; lever to the pilot&#x27;s left. The toe brakes are then released but pressure is maintained in the system thereby leaving both brakes engaged.

The standard tires used are 600 X 6 on the main gear and 500 X 5 on the nosewheel.

===Modifications===

There are hundreds of modifications available for the Cessna 152. The most frequently installed include:

====Tailwheel landing gear====
Taildragger conversions are available and have been fitted to some 152s. It involves strengthening the fuselage for the main gear being moved further forward, removing the nosewheel and strengthening the tail area for the tailwheel. This greatly improves short field performance and is claimed to give up to a cruise speed increase.

====STOL kits====
The wings can be modified using a number of STOL modification kits, some improving high speed/cruise performance but most concentrating on STOL performance. Horton&#x27;s STOL kit is one of the better-known of the latter. It involves fitting a more cambered leading edge cuff to increase the maximum coefficient of lift, fitting fences at the aileron/flap intersection and fitting drooped wingtips. Stalls with these modifications are almost off the airspeed indicator, since instrument error is high at high angles of attack. It has been said that landings can be achieved in two fuselage lengths with the kit installed in addition to a taildragger modification, by balancing power against drag. Takeoff performance is also improved by varying degrees depending on the surface.

====Engine====
The engine&#x27;s power can be increased by various modifications, such as the &quot;Sparrow Hawk&quot; power package, increasing it to . The disadvantage of the &quot;Sparrow Hawk&quot; conversion is that it uses pistons from the O-235-F series engine and therefore the engine recommended time between overhauls is reduced from 2,400 hours to 2,000 hours.

====Other modifications====

Other popular modifications include:
* Flap gap seals to reduce drag and increase rate of climb.
* Different wingtips, some of which claim various cruise speed increases and stall speed reductions.
* Auto fuel STCs, which permit the use of automobile fuel instead of the more expensive aviation fuel.
* Auxiliary fuel tanks for greater range.
* Door catches to replace the factory ones that often fail in service.
* Belly fuel drain valves to drain fuel from the lowest point in the fuel system.

==Variants==

Cessna 152 has only 4 model variants: 152, F152, A152, FA152 (all equipped with the Lycoming O-235):

;152:Two-seat light touring aircraft, fitted with a fixed tricycle landing gear, powered by a Lycoming O-235-L2C piston engine, 6628 built.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On May 9, 1989, a man who had murdered his ex-wife earlier that evening stole a Cessna 152T at gunpoint from an employee at Beverly Municipal Airport. During the flight, which lasted over three hours, Alfred James Hunter III fired a semi-automatic AK-47 rifle at the ground below, buzzed the South Postal Annex in Boston several times, and briefly touched down at Logan International Airport before taking off again. He was arrested when he finally landed with just five minutes&#x27; worth of fuel remaining.
*On 24 May 2001, a Cessna 152 violated Israeli airspace and was shot down by an IAF AH-64 Apache. Estephan Nicolian, a Lebanese student pilot, was shot down after ignoring repeated warnings by Israeli ATC to turn back. This is one of the two only-known operational air-to-air kills using an AGM-114 Hellfire missile.
*On 20 August 2024, Cessna 152 (VT-TAJ) aircraft used as a trainer aircraft by Alchemist Aviation lost contact with Jamshedpur Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower around 11:10 am, shortly after taking off from Sonari aerodrome at 10:32 am. An investigation on the incident was launched. On 21 August, search operations were initiated by local authorities, forest department and an NDRF team. On 22 August, the bodies of instructor pilot Captain Jeet Satru (2,000 hours flying experience) and trainee pilot Shubhrodeep Dutta (80+ hours flying experience) were recovered from reservoir of Chandil Dam. As of 25 August, the search ops are on for the lost airframe. A search and rescue team of the Indian Navy has joined the search efforts from Visakhapatnam on 22 August upon request. Eyewitnesses said that the aircraft crashed into the water body itself. The aircraft had 80 litres of fuel and 4 hours and 30 minutes of endurance - the schedule was for 1 hour. However, it was not clear why the Emergency Location Transmitter (ELT) did not turn on. The aircraft having a total lifespan of 30,000 hours utilised only 16,000 hours. On 26 August, the 20-member diving and hydrographic survey team of Eastern Naval Command recovered the debris of aircraft after a 5-day long search operation.

<doc id="306169" wikidata="Q407473" url="?curid=306169" title="Ethylene oxide">
<text>Ethylene oxide is an organic compound with the formula . It is a cyclic ether and the simplest epoxide: a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide is a colorless and flammable gas with a faintly sweet odor. Because it is a strained ring, ethylene oxide easily participates in a number of addition reactions that result in ring-opening. Ethylene oxide is isomeric with acetaldehyde and with vinyl alcohol. Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by oxidation of ethylene in the presence of a silver catalyst.

The reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide&#x27;s hazards also makes it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a very flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas.

Ethylene oxide is a surface disinfectant that is widely used in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so flammable and extremely explosive that it is used as a main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.

==History==
Ethylene oxide was first reported in 1859 by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, who prepared it by treating 2-chloroethanol with potassium hydroxide:

Wurtz measured the boiling point of ethylene oxide as , slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals. Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896, when Georg Bredig found that ethylene oxide is not an electrolyte. That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in the addition reactions typical of unsaturated compounds — had long been a matter of debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.

Wurtz&#x27;s 1859 synthesis long remained the only method of preparing ethylene oxide, despite numerous attempts, including by Wurtz himself, to produce ethylene oxide directly from ethylene. Only in 1931 did French chemist Theodore Lefort develop a method of direct oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver catalyst. Since 1940, almost all industrial production of ethylene oxide has relied on this process. Sterilization by ethylene oxide for the preservation of spices was patented in 1938 by the American chemist Lloyd Hall. Ethylene oxide achieved industrial importance during World War I as a precursor to both the coolant ethylene glycol and the chemical weapon mustard gas.

==Molecular structure and properties==

The epoxy cycle of ethylene oxide is an almost regular triangle with bond angles of about 60° and a significant angular strain corresponding to the energy of 105 kJ/mol. For comparison, in alcohols the C–O–H angle is about 110°; in ethers, the C–O–C angle is 120°. The moment of inertia about each of the principal axes are &quot;IA&quot;=, &quot;IB&quot;= and &quot;IC&quot;=.

The relative instability of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the molecule is revealed by the comparison in the table of the energy required to break two C–O bonds in the ethylene oxide or one C–O bond in ethanol and dimethyl ether:
This instability correlates with its high reactivity, explaining the ease of its ring-opening reactions (see Chemical properties).

==Physical properties==
Ethylene oxide is a colorless gas at and is a mobile liquid at – viscosity of liquid ethylene oxide at 0 °C is about 5.5 times lower than that of water. The gas has a characteristic sweet odor of ether, noticeable when its concentration in air exceeds 500ppm. Ethylene oxide is readily soluble in water, ethanol, diethyl ether, and many organic solvents.

Main thermodynamical constants are:
* The surface tension of liquid ethylene oxide, at the interface with its own vapor, is at and at .
* The boiling point increases with the vapor pressure as follows: (), (), and ().
* Viscosity decreases with temperature with the values of 0.577kPa·s at , 0.488 kPa·s at , 0.394kPa·s at , and 0.320kPa·s at .

Between , vapor pressure &quot;p&quot; (in mmHg) varies with temperature (&quot;T&quot; in °C) as

==Chemical properties==
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with diverse compounds with opening of the ring. Its typical reactions are with nucleophiles which proceed via the SN2 mechanism both in acidic (weak nucleophiles: water, alcohols) and alkaline media (strong nucleophiles: OH−, RO−, NH3, RNH2, RR&#x27;NH, etc.). The general reaction scheme is

and more specific reactions are described below.

===Addition of water and alcohols===
Aqueous solutions of ethylene oxide are rather stable and can exist for a long time without any noticeable chemical reaction. However adding a small amount of acid, such as strongly diluted sulfuric acid, immediately leads to the formation of ethylene glycol, even at room temperature:
: (CH2CH2)O + H2O → HO–CH2CH2–OH

The reaction also occurs in the gas phase, in the presence of a phosphoric acid salt as a catalyst.

The reaction is usually carried out at about with a large excess of water, in order to prevent the reaction of the formed ethylene glycol with ethylene oxide that would form di- and triethylene glycol:

: 2 (CH2CH2)O + H2O → HO–CH2CH2–O–CH2CH2–OH
: 3 (CH2CH2)O + H2O → HO–CH2CH2–O–CH2CH2–O–CH2CH2–OH

The use of alkaline catalysts may lead to the formation of polyethylene glycol:

: n (CH2CH2)O + H2O → HO–(–CH2CH2–O–)n–H

Reactions with alcohols proceed similarly yielding ethylene glycol ethers:

: (CH2CH2)O + C2H5OH → HO–CH2CH2–OC2H5

: 2 (CH2CH2)O + C2H5OH → HO–CH2CH2–O–CH2CH2–OC2H5

Reactions with lower alcohols occur less actively than with water and require more severe conditions, such as heating to and pressurizing to and adding an acid or alkali catalyst.

Reactions of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols proceed in the presence of sodium metal, sodium hydroxide, or boron trifluoride and are used for the synthesis of surfactants.

===Addition of carboxylic acids and their derivatives===
Reactions of ethylene oxide with carboxylic acids in the presence of a catalyst results in glycol mono- and diesters:
: (CH2CH2)O + CH3CO2H → HOCH2CH2–O2CCH3
: (CH2CH2)O + (CH3CO)2O → CH3CO2CH2CH2O2CCH3

The addition of acid amides proceeds similarly:
: (CH2CH2)O + CH3CONH2 → HOCH2CH2NHC(O)CH3

Addition of ethylene oxide to higher carboxylic acids is carried out at elevated temperatures (typically ) and pressure () in an inert atmosphere, in presence of an alkaline catalyst (concentration 0.01–2%), such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium. The carboxylate ion acts as nucleophile in the reaction:
: (CH2CH2)O + RCO2− → RCO2CH2CH2O−
: RCO2CH2CH2O− + RCO2H → RCO2CH2CH2OH + RCO2−

===Adding ammonia and amines===
Ethylene oxide reacts with ammonia forming a mixture of mono-, di-, and tri- ethanolamines. The reaction is stimulated by adding a small amount of water.

: (CH2CH2)O + NH3 → HO–CH2CH2–NH2

: 2 (CH2CH2)O + NH3 → (HO–CH2CH2)2NH

: 3 (CH2CH2)O + NH3 → (HO–CH2CH2)3N

Similarly proceed the reactions with primary and secondary amines:
: (CH2CH2)O + RNH2 → HO–CH2CH2–NHR

Dialkylamino ethanols can further react with ethylene oxide, forming amino polyethylene glycols:

: n (CH2CH2)O + R2NCH2CH2OH → R2NCH2CH2O–(–CH2CH2O–)n–H

Trimethylamine reacts with ethylene oxide in the presence of water, forming choline:
: (CH2CH2)O + (CH3)3N + H2O → [HOCH2CH2N (CH3)3]+OH−

Aromatic primary and secondary amines also react with ethylene oxide, forming the corresponding arylamino alcohols.

===Halide addition===
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with aqueous solutions of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydroiodic acids to form halohydrins. The reaction occurs easier with the last two acids:
: (CH2CH2)O + HCl → HO–CH2CH2–Cl

The reaction with these acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, there is always a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of diethylene glycol. For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.

Ethylene fluorohydrin is obtained differently, by boiling hydrogen fluoride with a 5–6% solution of ethylene oxide in diethyl ether. The ether normally has a water content of 1.5–2%; in absence of water, ethylene oxide polymerizes.

Halohydrins can also be obtained by passing ethylene oxide through aqueous solutions of metal halides:
: 2 (CH2CH2)O + CuCl2 + 2 H2O → 2 HO–CH2CH2–Cl + Cu(OH)2↓

===Metalorganic addition===
Interaction of ethylene oxide with organomagnesium compounds, which are Grignard reagents, can be regarded as nucleophilic substitution influenced by carbanion organometallic compounds. The final product of the reaction is a primary alcohol:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + RMgBr -&gt; R-CH2CH2-OMgBr -&gt;[\ce{H2O}]
\overset{primary~alcohol}{R-CH2CH2-OH}&lt;/chem&gt;

Similar mechanism is valid for other organometallic compounds, such as alkyl lithium:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + \overset{alkyl~lithium}{RLi} -&gt; R-CH2CH2-OLi -&gt;[\ce{H2O}] R-CH2CH2-OH&lt;/chem&gt;

===Other addition reactions===

====Addition of hydrogen cyanide====
Ethylene oxide easily reacts with hydrogen cyanide forming ethylene cyanohydrin:
: (CH2CH2)O + HCN → HO–CH2CH2–CN

A slightly chilled (10–20 °C) aqueous solution of calcium cyanide can be used instead of HCN:
: 2 (CH2CH2)O + Ca(CN)2 + 2 H2O → 2 HO–CH2CH2–CN + Ca(OH)2

Ethylene cyanohydrin easily loses water, producing acrylonitrile:
: HO–CH2CH2–CN → CH2=CH–CN + H2O

====Addition of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans====
When reacting with the hydrogen sulfide, ethylene oxide forms 2-mercaptoethanol and thiodiglycol, and with alkylmercaptans it produces 2-alkyl mercaptoetanol:
: (CH2CH2)O + H2S → HO–CH2CH2–HS
: 2 (CH2CH2)O + H2S → (HO–CH2CH2)2S
: (CH2CH2)O + RHS → HO–CH2CH2–SR

The excess of ethylene oxide with an aqueous solution of hydrogen sulfide leads to the tris-(hydroxyethyl) sulfonyl hydroxide:
: 3 (CH2CH2)O + H2S → [(HO–CH2CH2)3S+]OH−

====Addition of nitrous and nitric acids====
Reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous solutions of barium nitrite, calcium nitrite, magnesium nitrite, zinc nitrite, or sodium nitrite leads to the formation of 2-nitroethanol:

:2 (CH2CH2)O + Ca(NO2)2 + 2 H2O → 2 HO–CH2CH2–NO2 + Ca(OH)2

With nitric acid, ethylene oxide forms mono- and dinitroglycols:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + \overset{nitric\atop acid}{HNO3} -&gt; HO-CH2CH2-ONO2 -&gt;[\ce{+HNO3}] [\ce{-H2O}] O2NO-CH2CH2-ONO_2&lt;/chem&gt;

====Reaction with compounds containing active methylene groups====
In the presence of alkoxides, reactions of ethylene oxide with compounds containing active methylene group leads to the formation of butyrolactones:

====Alkylation of aromatic compounds====
Ethylene oxide enters into the Friedel–Crafts reaction with benzene to form phenethyl alcohol:

Styrene can be obtained in one stage if this reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures () and pressures (), in presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst.

====Synthesis of crown ethers====
A series of polynomial heterocyclic compounds, known as crown ethers, can be synthesized with ethylene oxide. One method is the cationic cyclopolymerization of ethylene oxide, limiting the size of the formed cycle:

: &quot;n&quot; (CH2CH2)O → (–CH2CH2–O–)&quot;n&quot;

To suppress the formation of other linear polymers the reaction is carried out in a highly dilute solution.

Reaction of ethylene oxide with sulfur dioxide in the presence of caesium salts leads to the formation of an 11-membered heterocyclic compound which has the complexing properties of crown ethers:

===Isomerization===
When heated to about , or to in the presence of a catalyst (Al2O3, H3PO4, etc.), ethylene oxide isomerizes into acetaldehyde:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O -&gt;[\ce{200^\circ C}] [\ce{Al2O3}] \overset{acetaldehyde}{CH3CHO}&lt;/chem&gt;

The radical mechanism was proposed to explain this reaction in the gas phase; it comprises the following stages:



In reaction (), M refers to the wall of the reaction vessel or to a heterogeneous catalyst.
The moiety CH3CHO* represents a short-lived (lifetime of 10−8.5 seconds), activated molecule of acetaldehyde. Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the binding energy of the C-C bond in acetaldehyde.

In absence of a catalyst, the thermal isomerization of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from acetaldehyde yields significant amount of by-products (see section Thermal decomposition).

===Reduction reaction===
Ethylene oxide can be hydrogenated into ethanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as nickel, platinum, palladium, boranes, lithium aluminium hydride, and some other hydrides.
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + H2 -&gt;[{}\atop\ce{Ni, Pt, Pd, BH3, LiAlH4}\text{ or other hydrides}] [\ce{80^\circ C}] \underset{ethanol}{C2H5OH}&lt;/chem&gt;

Conversely, with some other catalysts, ethylene oxide may be &quot;reduced&quot; by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%. The reduction catalysts include mixtures of zinc dust and acetic acid, of lithium aluminium hydride with titanium trichloride (the reducing agent is actually titanium dichloride, formed by the reaction between LiAlH4 and TiCl3) and of iron(III) chloride with butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran.
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + H2 -&gt;[{}\atop\ce{{Zn} + CH3COOH}] \underset{ethylene}{CH2=CH2} + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

===Oxidation===
Ethylene oxide can further be oxidized, depending on the conditions, to glycolic acid or carbon dioxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + O2 -&gt;[\ce{AgNO3}] \overset{glycolic\ acid}{HOCH2CO2H}&lt;/chem&gt;

Deep gas-phase reactor oxidation of ethylene oxide at {{convert|800-1000|K|}} and a pressure of {{convert|0.1–1|MPa||abbr=on}} yields a complex mixture of products containing O2, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, and CH3CHO.

===Dimerization===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethylene oxide dimerizes to afford dioxane:

The reaction mechanism is as follows:

The dimerization reaction is unselective. By-products include acetaldehyde (due to isomerization). The selectivity and speed of dimerization can be increased by adding a catalyst, such as platinum, platinum-palladium, or iodine with sulfolane. 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane is formed as a side product in the last case.

===Polymerization===
Liquid ethylene oxide can form polyethylene glycols. The polymerization can proceed via radical and ionic mechanisms, but only the latter has a wide practical application. Cationic polymerization of ethylene oxide is assisted by protic acids (HClO4, HCl), Lewis acids (SnCl4, BF3, etc.), organometallic compounds, or more complex reagents:
: formula_2

The reaction mechanism is as follows. At the first stage, the catalyst (MXm) is initiated by alkyl-or acylhalogen or by compounds with active hydrogen atoms, usually water, alcohol, or glycol:

: MXm + ROH → MXmRO−H+

The resulting active complex reacts with ethylene oxide via the SN2 mechanism:
: (CH2CH2)O + MXmRO−H+ → (CH2CH2)O•••H+O−RMXm
: (CH2CH2)O•••H+ O−RMXm → HO–CH2CH2+ + MXmRO−2

: HO–CH2CH2+ + n (CH2CH2)O → HO–CH2CH2–(O–CH2CH2)n+

The chain breaks as

: HO–CH2CH2–(O–CH2CH2)n+ + MXmRO− → HO–CH2CH2–(O–CH2CH2)n–OR + MXm

: H(O–CH2CH2)n–O–CH2–CH2+ + MXmRO− → H(O–CH2CH2)n–O–CH=CH2 + MXm + ROH

Anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide is assisted by bases, such as alkoxides, hydroxides, carbonates, or other compounds of alkali or alkaline earth metals. The reaction mechanism is as follows:

: (CH2CH2)O + RONa → RO–CH2CH2–O−Na+

: RO–CH2CH2–O−Na+ + n (CH2CH2)O → RO–(CH2CH2–O)n–CH2CH2–O−Na+

: RO–(CH2CH2–O)n–CH2CH2–O−Na+ → RO–(CH2CH2–O)n–CH=CH2 + NaOH

: RO–(CH2CH2–O)n–CH2CH2–O−Na+ + H2O → RO–(CH2CH2–O)(n+1)OH + NaOH

===Thermal decomposition===
Ethylene oxide is relatively stable to heating – in the absence of a catalyst, it does not dissociate up to {{convert|300|C|}}, and only above {{convert|570|C|}} there is a major exothermic decomposition, which proceeds through the radical mechanism. The first stage involves isomerization, however high temperature accelerates the radical processes. They result in a gas mixture containing acetaldehyde, ethane, ethyl, methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ketene, and formaldehyde. High-temperature pyrolysis ({{convert|830–1200|K|}}) at elevated pressure in an inert atmosphere leads to a more complex composition of the gas mixture, which also contains acetylene and propane. Contrary to the isomerization, initiation of the chain occurs mainly as follows:
: (CH2CH2)O → •CH2CH2O• → CH2O + CH2:

When carrying the thermal decomposition of ethylene oxide in the presence of transition metal compounds as catalysts, it is possible not only to reduce its temperature, but also to have ethyl as the main product, that is to reverse the ethylene oxide synthesis reaction.

===Other reactions===
Thiocyanate ions or thiourea transform ethylene oxide into thiirane (ethylene sulfide):
: (CH2CH2)O + (NH2)2C=S → (CH2CH2)S + (NH2)2C=O

Reaction of phosphorus pentachloride with ethylene oxide produces ethylene dichloride:
: (CH2CH2)O + PCl5 → Cl–CH2CH2–Cl + POCl3

Other dichloro derivatives of ethylene oxide can be obtained by combined action of sulfuryl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine and of triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride.

Phosphorus trichloride reacts with ethylene oxide forming chloroethyl esters of phosphorous acid:

: (CH2CH2)O + PCl3 → Cl–CH2CH2–OPCl2

: 2 (CH2CH2)O + PCl3 → (Cl–CH2CH2–O)2PCl

: 3 (CH2CH2)O + PCl3 → Cl–CH2CH2–O)3P

The reaction product of ethylene oxide with acyl chlorides in the presence of sodium iodide is a complex iodoethyl ester:
: (CH2CH2)O + RCOCl + NaI → RC(O)–OCH2CH2–I + NaCl

Heating ethylene oxide to 100 °C with carbon dioxide, in a non-polar solvent in the presence of &quot;bis&quot;-(triphenylphosphine)-nickel(0) results in ethylene carbonate:

In industry, a similar reaction is carried out at high pressure and temperature in the presence of quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts as a catalyst.

Reaction of ethylene oxide with formaldehyde at 80–150 °C in the presence of a catalyst leads to the formation of 1,3-dioxolane:

Substituting formaldehyde by other aldehydes or ketones results in a 2-substituted 1,3-dioxolane (yield: 70–85%, catalyst: tetraethylammonium bromide).

Catalytic hydroformylation of ethylene oxide gives hydroxypropanal which can be hydrogenated to propane-1,3-diol:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + CO + H2 -&gt; CHO-CH2CH2-OH -&gt;[\ce{+H2}] HO-CH2CH2CH2-OH&lt;/chem&gt;

==Laboratory synthesis==

===Dehydrochlorination of ethylene and its derivatives===
Dehydrochlorination of 2-chloroethanol, developed by Wurtz in 1859, remains a common laboratory route to ethylene oxide:

: &lt;chem&gt;Cl-CH2CH2-OH + NaOH -&gt; (CH2CH2)O + NaCl + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction is carried out at elevated temperature, and beside sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or carbonates of alkali or alkaline earth metals can be used.

With a high yield (90%) ethylene oxide can be produced by treating calcium oxide with ethyl hypochlorite; substituting calcium by other alkaline earth metals reduces the reaction yield:
: &lt;chem&gt;2 CH3CH2-OCl + CaO -&gt; 2 (CH2CH2)O + CaCl2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

===Direct oxidation of ethylene by peroxy acids===
Ethylene can be directly oxidized into ethylene oxide using peroxy acids, for example, peroxybenzoic or &quot;meta&quot;-chloro-peroxybenzoic acid:

Oxidation by peroxy acids is efficient for higher alkenes, but not for ethylene. The above reaction is slow and has low yield, therefore it is not used in the industry.

===Other preparative methods===
Other synthesis methods include reaction of diiodo ethane with silver oxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;I-CH2CH2-I + Ag2O -&gt; (CH2CH2)O + 2AgI&lt;/chem&gt;

and decomposition of ethylene carbonate at {{convert|200–210|C|}} in the presence of hexachloroethane:

==Industrial synthesis==

===History===
Commercial production of ethylene oxide dates back to 1914 when BASF built the first factory which used the chlorohydrin process (reaction of ethylene chlorohydrin with calcium hydroxide). The chlorohydrin process was unattractive for several reasons, including low efficiency and loss of valuable chlorine into calcium chloride. More efficient direct oxidation of ethylene by air was invented by Lefort in 1931 and in 1937 Union Carbide opened the first plant using this process. It was further improved in 1958 by Shell Oil Co. by replacing air with oxygen and using elevated temperature of {{convert|200–300|C||sigfig=2}} and pressure ({{convert|1–3|MPa||abbr=on}}). This more efficient route accounted for about half of ethylene oxide production in the 1950s in the US, and after 1975 it completely replaced the previous methods.
The production of ethylene oxide accounts for approximately 11% of worldwide ethylene demand.

===Chlorohydrin process of production of ethylene oxide===
Although the chlorohydrin process is almost entirely superseded in the industry by the direct oxidation of ethylene, the knowledge of this method is still important for educational reasons and because it is still used in the production of propylene oxide. The process consists of three major steps: synthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin, dehydrochlorination of ethylene chlorohydrin to ethylene oxide and purification of ethylene oxide. Those steps are carried continuously. In the first column, hypochlorination of ethylene is carried out as follows:

: Cl2 + H2O → HOCl + HCl

: CH2=CH2 + HOCl → HO–CH2CH2–Cl

: CH2=CH2 + Cl2 → Cl–CH2CH2–Cl

To suppress the conversion of ethylene into the ethylene dichloride (the last reaction), the concentration of ethylene is maintained at about 4–6%, and the solution is heated by steam to the boiling point.

Next, aqueous solution of ethylene chlorohydrin enters the second column, where it reacts with a 30% solution of calcium hydroxide at {{convert|100|C|}}:

: 2 HO–CH2CH2–Cl + Ca(OH)2 → 2 (CH2CH2)O + CaCl2 + 2H2O

The produced ethylene oxide is purified by rectification. The chlorohydrin process allows to reach 95% conversion of ethylene chlorohydrin. The yield of ethylene oxide is about 80% of the theoretical value; for {{convert|1|t|}} of ethylene oxide, about {{convert|200|kg||abbr=on}} of ethylene dichloride is produced. But, the major drawbacks of this process are high chlorine consumption and effluent load. This process is now obsolete.

===Direct oxidation of ethylene===

====Usage in global industry====
Direct oxidation of ethylene was patented by Lefort in 1931. This method was repeatedly modified for industrial use, and at least four major variations are known. They all use oxidation by oxygen or air and a silver-based catalyst, but differ in the technological details and hardware implementations.

Union Carbide (currently a division of Dow Chemical Company) was the first company to develop the direct oxidation process.

A similar production method was developed by Scientific Design Co., but it received wider use because of the licensing system – it accounts for 25% of the world&#x27;s production and for 75% of world&#x27;s licensed production of ethylene oxide. A proprietary variation of this method is used by Japan Catalytic Chemical Co., which adapted synthesis of both ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol in a single industrial complex.

A different modification was developed Shell International Chemicals BV. Their method is rather flexible with regard to the specific requirements of specific industries; it is characterized by high selectivity with respect to the ethylene oxide product and long lifetime of the catalyst (3 years). It accounts for about 40% of global production.

Older factories typically use air for oxidation whereas newer plants and processes, such as METEOR and Japan Catalytic, favor oxygen.

====Chemistry and kinetics of the direct oxidation process====
Formally, the direct oxidation process is expressed by the following equation:

: &lt;chem&gt;2CH_2=CH2 + O2 -&gt;[\ce{Ag}] 2(CH2CH2)O&lt;/chem&gt;, ΔH=−105 kJ/mol

However, significant yield of carbon dioxide and water is observed in practice, which can be explained by the complete oxidation of ethylene or ethylene oxide:

: CH2=CH2 + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O, ΔH=−1327{{nbsp}}kJ/mol
: (CH2CH2)O + 2.5 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O, ΔH=−1223{{nbsp}}kJ/mol

According to a kinetic analysis by Kilty and Sachtler, the following reactions describe the pathway leading to EO. In the first step, a superoxide (O2−) species is formed:
: O2 + Ag → Ag+O2−
This species reacts with ethylene
: Ag+O2− + H2C=CH2 → (CH2CH2)O + AgO
The resulting silver oxide then oxidizes ethylene or ethylene oxide to CO2 and water. This reaction replenishes the silver catalyst. Thus the overall reaction is expressed as

: 7 CH2=CH2 + 6 O2 → 6 (CH2CH2)O + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O

and the maximum degree of conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide is theoretically predicted to be 6/7 or 85.7%, although higher yields are achieved in practice.

The catalyst for the reaction is metallic silver deposited on various matrixes, including pumice, silica gel, various silicates and aluminosilicates, alumina, and silicon carbide, and activated by certain additives (antimony, bismuth, barium peroxide, etc.). The process temperature was optimized as {{convert|220–280|C||sigfig=2}}. Lower temperatures reduce the activity of the catalyst, and higher temperatures promote the complete oxidation of ethylene thereby reducing the yield of ethylene oxide. Elevated pressure of {{convert|1-3|MPa||abbr=on}} increases the productivity of the catalyst and facilitates absorption of ethylene oxide from the reacting gases.

Whereas oxidation by air is still being used, oxygen (&gt; 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and no need of separating nitrogen in the reaction products.

===Process overview===
The production of ethylene oxide on a commercial scale is attained with the unification of the following unit processes:
* Main reactor
* Ethylene oxide scrubber
* Ethylene oxide de-sorber
* Stripping and distillation column
* CO2 scrubber and CO2 de-scrubber

Main Reactor: The main reactor consists of thousands of catalyst tubes in bundles. These tubes are generally {{convert|6|to|15|m|abbr=on|round=5}} long with an inner diameter of {{convert|20|to|50|mm|abbr=on|1}}. The catalyst packed in these tubes is in the form of spheres or rings of diameter {{convert|3|to|10|mm|abbr=on}}. The operating conditions of {{convert|200-300|C||sigfig=2}} with a pressure of {{convert|1-3|MPa||abbr=on}} prevail in the reactor. To maintain this temperature, the cooling system of the reactor plays a vital role. With the aging of the catalyst, its selectivity decreases and it produces more exothermic side products of CO2.

Ethylene oxide scrubber: After the gaseous stream from the main reactor, containing ethylene oxide (1–2%) and CO2 (5%), is cooled, it is then passed to the ethylene oxide scrubber. Here, water is used as the scrubbing media which scrubs away majority of ethylene oxide along with some amounts of CO2, N2, CH2=CH2, CH4 and aldehydes (introduced by the recycle stream). Also, a small proportion of the gas leaving the ethylene oxide scrubber (0.1–0.2%) is removed continuously (combusted) to prevent the buildup of inert compounds (N2, Ar, and C2H6), which are introduced as impurities with the reactants.

Ethylene oxide de-sorber: The aqueous stream resulting from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the bottom product obtained is known as the &quot;glycol bleed&quot;. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously bled off.

Stripping and distillation column: Here, the ethylene oxide stream is stripped off its low boiling components and then distilled in-order to separate it into water and ethylene oxide.

CO2 scrubber: The recycle stream obtained from the ethylene oxide scrubber is compressed and a side-stream is fed to the CO2 scrubber. Here, CO2 gets dissolved into the hot aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (i.e., the scrubbing media). The dissolution of CO2 is not only a physical phenomenon, but a chemical phenomenon as well, for, the CO2 reacts with potassium carbonate to produce potassium hydrogen carbonate.
: K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 KHCO3

CO2 de-scrubber: The above potassium carbonate solution (enriched with CO2) is then sent to the CO2 de-scrubber where CO2 is de-scrubbed by stepwise (usually two steps) flashing. The first step is done to remove the hydrocarbon gases, and the second step is employed to strip off CO2.

===World production of ethylene oxide===
The world production of ethylene oxide was {{convert|20|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2009, {{convert|19|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2008 and {{convert|18|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2007. This places ethylene oxide 14th most produced organic chemical, whereas the most produced one was ethylene with {{convert|113|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}}. SRI Consulting forecasted the growth of consumption of ethylene oxide of 4.4% per year during 2008–2013 and 3% from 2013 to 2018.

In 2004, the global production of ethylene oxide by region was as follows:

The world&#x27;s largest producers of ethylene oxide are Dow Chemical Company ({{convert|3-3.5|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2006), Saudi Basic Industries ({{convert|2000-2500|t|ST}} in 2006), Royal Dutch Shell ({{convert|1.328|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2008–2009), BASF ({{convert|1.175|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2008–2009), China Petrochemical Corporation (~{{convert|1|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2006), Formosa Plastics (~{{convert|1|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2006), and Ineos ({{convert|0.92|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2008–2009).

==Applications==
Ethylene oxide is one of the most important raw materials used in large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of ethylene glycols, including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines, and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as antifreeze, in the production of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate (PET – raw material for plastic bottles), liquid coolants, and solvents.

Polyethyleneglycols are used in perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, lubricants, paint thinners, and plasticizers. Ethylene glycol ethers are part of brake fluids, detergents, solvents, lacquers, and paints. Ethanolamines are used in the manufacture of soap and detergents and for purification of natural gas. Ethoxylates are reaction products of ethylene oxide with higher alcohols, acids, or amines. They are used in the manufacture of detergents, surfactants, emulsifiers, and dispersants.

Whereas synthesis of ethylene glycols is the major application of ethylene oxide, its percentage varies greatly depending on the region: from 44% in the Western Europe, 63% in Japan, and 73% in North America to 90% in the rest of Asia, and 99% in Africa.

===Production of ethylene glycol===
Ethylene glycol is industrially produced by non-catalytic hydration of ethylene oxide at a temperature of {{convert|200|C|}} and a pressure of {{convert|1.5-2|MPa||abbr=on}}:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + H2O -&gt; HOCH2CH2OH&lt;/chem&gt;

By-products of the reaction are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and polyglycols with the total of about 10%, which are separated from the ethylene glycol by distillation at reduced pressure.

Another synthesis method is the reaction of ethylene oxide and CO2 (temperature {{convert|80–120|C|}} and pressure of {{convert|5.2|MPa||abbr=on}}) yielding ethylene carbonate and its subsequent hydrolysis with decarboxylation:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + CO2 -&gt; \overset{ethylene\ carbonate}{(O-CH2CH_2-O)C=O} -&gt;[\ce{+H2O}] [\ce{-CO2}] HOCH2CH2OH&lt;/chem&gt;

Modern technologies of production of ethylene glycol include the following. Shell OMEGA technology (Only Mono-Ethylene Glycol Advantage) is a two-step synthesis of ethylene carbonate using a phosphonium halide as a catalyst. The glycol yield is 99–99.5%, with other glycols practically absent. The main advantage of the process is production of pure ethylene glycol without the need for further purification. The first commercial plant which uses this method was opened in 2008 in South Korea. Dow METEOR (Most Effective Technology for Ethylene Oxide Reactions) is an integrated technology for producing ethylene oxide and its subsequent hydrolysis into ethylene glycol. The glycol yield is 90–93%. The main advantage of the process is relative simplicity, using fewer stages and less equipment.

Conversion to ethylene glycol is also the means by which waste ethylene oxide is scrubbed before venting to the environment. Typically the EtO is passed over a matrix containing either sulfuric acid or potassium permanganate.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Production of glycol ethers===
The major industrial esters of mono-, di-, and triethylene glycols are methyl, ethyl, and normal butyl ethers, as well as their acetates and phthalates. The synthesis involves reaction of the appropriate alcohol with ethylene oxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + ROH -&gt; HOCH2CH2OR&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + HOCH2CH2OR -&gt; HOCH2CH2OCH2CH2OR&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + HOCH2CH2OCH2CH2OR -&gt; HOCH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CH2OR&lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction of monoesters with an acid or its anhydride leads to the formation of the esters:

: &lt;chem&gt;CH3CO2H + HOCH2CH2OR -&gt; ROCH2CH2OCOCH3 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

===Production of ethanolamines===
In the industry, ethanolamines (mono-, di-, and triethanolamines) are produced by reacting ammonia and ethylene oxide in anhydrous medium at a temperature of {{convert|40-70|C||-1}} and pressure of {{convert|1.5-3.5|MPa||abbr=on}}{{nbsp}}MPa:
: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + NH3 -&gt; HOCH2CH2NH2&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;2 (CH2CH2)O + NH3 -&gt; (HOCH2CH2)2NH&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;3 (CH2CH2)O + NH3 -&gt; (HOCH2CH2)3N&lt;/chem&gt;

All three ethanolamines are produced in the process, while ammonia and part of methylamine are recycled. The final products are separated by vacuum distillation. Hydroxyalkylamines are produced in a similar process:

: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + RNH2 -&gt; HOCH2CH2NHR&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;2 (CH2CH2)O + RNH2 -&gt; (HOCH2CH2)2NR&lt;/chem&gt;

Monosubstituted products are formed by reacting a large excess of amine with ethylene oxide in presence of water and at a temperature below {{convert|100|C|}}. Disubstituted products are obtained with a small excess of ethylene oxide, at a temperature of {{convert|120–140|C||-1}} and a pressure of {{convert|0.3-0.5|MPa||abbr=on|round=5}}.

===Production of ethoxylates===
{{Main|Ethoxylation}}

Industrial production of ethoxylates is realized by a direct reaction of higher alcohols, acids, or amines with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkaline catalyst at a temperature of {{convert|120–180|C||-1}}. Modern plants producing ethoxylates are usually based on the BUSS LOOP reactors technology, which is based on a three-stage continuous process. In the first stage, the initiator or catalyst of the reaction and the feedstock are fed into the container, where they are mixed, heated, and vacuum dried. Then reaction is carried out in a special insulated reactor in an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) to prevent a possible explosion of ethylene oxide. Finally, the reaction mixture is neutralized, degassed, and purified.

===Production of acrylonitrile===
Currently, most acrylonitrile (90% in 2008) is produced by the SOHIO method, which is based on the catalytic oxidation of propylene in the presence of ammonia and bismuth phosphomolybdate. However, until 1960 a key production process was addition of hydrogen cyanide to ethylene oxide, followed by dehydration of the resulting cyanohydrin:

: {{chem2|(CH2CH2)O + HCN → HOCH2CH2CN}} {{underset|−{{chem2|H2O}}|→}} {{chem2|CH2\dCH\sCN}}

Addition of hydrocyanic acid to ethylene oxide is carried out in the presence of a catalyst (sodium hydroxide and diethylamine), and dehydration of cyanohydrin occurs in the gas phase upon the catalytic action of aluminium oxide.

==Non-industrial uses==

The direct use of ethylene oxide accounts for only 0.05% (2004 data) of its global production. Ethylene oxide is used as a sterilizing agent, disinfecting agent and fumigant as a mixture with carbon dioxide (8.5–80% of ethylene oxide), nitrogen, or dichlorodifluoromethane (12% ethylene oxide). It is applied for gas-phase sterilization of medical equipment and instruments, packaging materials, clothing, and surgical and scientific equipment; for processing of storage facilities (tobacco, packages of grain, sacks of rice, etc.), clothing, furs, and valuable documents.

===Healthcare sterilant===

Ethylene oxide is one of the most commonly used sterilization methods in the healthcare industry because of its non-damaging effects for delicate instruments and devices that require sterilization, and for its wide range of material compatibility. It is used for instruments that cannot tolerate heat, moisture, or abrasive chemicals, such as electronics, optical equipment, paper, rubber, and plastics. It was developed in the 1940s as a sterilant by the US military, and its use as a medical sterilant dates to the late 1950s, when the McDonald process was patented for medical devices. The Anprolene system was patented in the 1960s by Andersen Products, and it remains the most commonly used system in several niche markets, notably the veterinary market and some international markets. It relies on the use of a flexible sterilization chamber and an EtO cartridge for small volume sterilization, and where environmental and/or portability considerations dictate the use of a low dose. It is therefore referred to as the &quot;flexible chamber sterilization&quot; method, or the &quot;gas diffusion sterilization&quot; method.

In the United States, the operation of EtO sterilization is overseen by the EPA through the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP).

===Niche uses===
Ethylene oxide is used as a fungicide and as an accelerator of maturation of tobacco leaves. Ethylene oxide is also used as a main component of thermobaric weapons (fuel-air explosives).

==Identification of ethylene oxide==
Gas chromatography is the principal method for analysis and detection of ethylene oxide.

An inexpensive test for ethylene oxide exploits its precipitation of solid hydroxides of metals when it is passed through aqueous solutions of their salts:

: &lt;chem&gt;2 (CH2CH2)O + MnCl2 + 2 H2O -&gt; 2 HO-CH2CH2-Cl + Mn(OH)2 v&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly, ethylene oxide is detected by the bright pink color of the indicator when passing air through aqueous solutions of some salts of sodium or potassium (chlorides, iodides, thiosulfates, etc.) with the addition of phenolphthalein:

: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O + NaCl + H2O -&gt; HO-CH2CH2-Cl + NaOH&lt;/chem&gt;

Other methods of ethylene oxide detection are color reactions with pyridine derivatives and hydrolysis of ethylene glycol with periodic acid. The produced iodic acid is detected with silver nitrate.

{{anchor|Fire and explosion hazards}}

==Accidents==
Ethylene oxide is extremely flammable, and its mixtures with air are explosive. When heated it may rapidly expand, causing fire and explosion. Several industrial accidents have been attributed to ethylene oxide explosion.

The autoignition temperature is {{convert|429|C|}}, decomposition temperature of {{convert|571|C|}} at {{convert|101.3|kPa||abbr=on}}, minimum inflammable content in the air is 2.7%, and maximum limit is 100%. The NFPA 704 rating is Health, 3; Flammability, 4; Instability 2. Ethylene oxide in presence of water can hydrolyze to ethylene glycol and form polyethylene oxide, which then eventually is oxidized by air and leads to hotspots that can trigger explosive decomposition.

Fires caused by ethylene oxide are extinguished with conventional media including foam, carbon dioxide, or water. Suppression of this activity can be done by blanketing with an inert gas until total pressure reaches the nonexplosive range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by its ability to continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1.

===La Canonja, Spain accident===
On 14 January 2020 in an industrial estate near Tarragona, an explosion of an ethoxylation reactor owned by the chemical company Industrias Quimicas de Oxido de Etileno (IQOXE, part of the CL Industrial Group) occurred. The accident launched substantial debris over a radius of about two and a half kilometers, one piece penetrating a distant home and killing an occupant. It is reported that at least three people were killed and seven injured as a direct result of the explosion.

The company was, until the time of the explosion the only producer of ethylene oxide in Spain with an installed capacity of 140,000 tons/year. Half of that production was used to manufacture ethylene glycol for PET production. The accident will be investigated under EU regulations within the context of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work.

===2020 sesame seeds contamination===
In September 2020, high levels of pesticides were found in 268 tonnes of sesame seeds from India. The contamination had a level of 1000 to 3500 times the limit of 0.05 milligrams per kilogram for ethylene oxide allowed in Europe. This pesticide is forbidden in Europe, where it is recognized to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. A product recall was made, half of the products had an organic certification.

In September, alert was raised by Belgium by RASFF, but the product has also been sold in other EU single market countries such as France and Ireland.

==Physiological effects==

===Effect on microorganisms===
Exposure to ethylene oxide gas causes alkylation to microorganisms at a nuclear level. The disinfectant effect of ethylene oxide is similar to that of sterilization by heat, but because of limited penetration, it affects only the surface. ETO sterilization can take up to 12 hours due to its slow action upon microorganisms, and lengthy processing and aeration time.

===Effects on humans and animals===
Ethylene oxide is an alkylating agent; it has irritating, sensitizing, and narcotic effects. Chronic exposure to ethylene oxide is also mutagenic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies ethylene oxide into group 1, meaning it is a proven carcinogen. Ethylene oxide is classified as a class 2 carcinogen by the German MAK commission and as a class A2 carcinogen by the ACGIH. A 2003 study of 7,576 women exposed while at work in commercial sterilization facilities in the US suggests ethylene oxide is associated with breast cancer incidence. A 2004 follow up study analyzing 18,235 men and women workers exposed to ethylene oxide from 1987 to 1998 concluded &quot;There was little evidence of any excess cancer mortality for the cohort as a whole, with the exception of bone cancer based on small numbers. Positive exposure-response trends for lymphoid tumors were found for males only. Reasons for the sex specificity of this effect are not known. There was also some evidence of a positive exposure-response for breast cancer mortality.&quot; An increased incidence of brain tumors and mononuclear cell leukemia was found in rats that had inhaled ethylene oxide at concentrations of {{convert|10|,|33|or|abbr=on|100|mL/m3}} over a period of two years. An increased incidence of peritoneal mesotheliomas was also observed in the animals exposed to concentrations of {{convert|33|and|100|mL/m3|abbr=on|4}}. Results of human epidemiological studies on workers exposed to ethylene oxide differ. There is evidence from both human and animal studies that inhalation exposure to ethylene oxide can result in a wide range of carcinogenic effects.

Ethylene oxide is toxic by inhalation, with a US OSHA permissible exposure limit calculated as a TWA (time weighted average) over 8 hours of 1{{nbsp}}ppm, and a short term exposure limit (excursion limit) calculated as a TWA over 15 minutes of 5{{nbsp}}ppm. At concentrations in the air about 200 parts per million, ethylene oxide irritates mucous membranes of the nose and throat; higher contents cause damage to the trachea and bronchi, progressing into the partial collapse of the lungs. High concentrations can cause pulmonary edema and damage the cardiovascular system; the damaging effect of ethylene oxide may occur only after 72 hours after exposure. The maximum content of ethylene oxide in the air according to the US standards (ACGIH) is {{convert|1.8|mg/m3||abbr=on}}. NIOSH has determined that the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health level (IDLH) is 800 ppm.

Because the odor threshold for ethylene oxide varies between 250 and 700 ppm, the gas is already at toxic concentrations when it can be smelled. Even then, the odor of ethylene oxide is sweet and aromatic and can easily be mistaken for the aroma of diethyl ether, a common laboratory solvent of very low toxicity. In view of these insidious properties, continuous electrochemical monitoring is standard practice, and it is forbidden to use ethylene oxide to fumigate building interiors in the EU and some other jurisdictions.

Ethylene oxide causes acute poisoning, accompanied by a variety of symptoms. Central nervous system effects are frequently associated with human exposure to ethylene oxide in occupational settings. Headache, nausea, and vomiting have been reported.{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=&quot;50 years of reports and/or 50 years of symptoms post-exposure?&quot;}} Peripheral neuropathy, impaired hand-eye coordination and memory loss have been reported in more recent case studies of chronically-exposed workers at estimated average exposure levels as low as 3 ppm (with possible short-term peaks as high as 700{{nbsp}}ppm). The metabolism of ethylene oxide is not completely known. Data from animal studies indicate two possible pathways for the metabolism of ethylene oxide: hydrolysis to ethylene glycol and glutathione conjugation to form mercapturic acid and meththio-metabolites.

Ethylene oxide easily penetrates through ordinary clothing and footwear, causing skin irritation and dermatitis with the formation of blisters, fever, and leukocytosis.

Toxicity data for ethylene oxide are as follows:
* Eye exposure: {{convert|18|mg||abbr=on}}/6 hours (rabbit)
* Oral: {{convert|72|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (rat, LD50), {{convert|1186|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (rat, TDLo), {{convert|5112|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (rat, TD)
* Inhalation: 12,500 ppm (human, TCLo), 960 ppm/4 hours (dog, LC50) 33–50 ppm (rat or mouse, TC), 800 ppm/4 hours (rat or mouse, LC50)
* Subcutaneous injection: {{convert|100|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (cat, LDLo), {{convert|292|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (mouse, TDLo) {{convert|900-2600|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (mouse, TD), {{convert|187|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (rat, LD50).
* Intraperitoneal injection: {{convert|750|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (mouse, TDLo), {{convert|175|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (mouse, LD50)
* Intravenous injection: {{convert|175|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (rabbit, LD50), {{convert|290|mg/kg||abbr=on}} (mouse, LD50)
* The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimated in 2016 that for low doses, the inhalation of ethylene oxide for a lifetime could increase an individual&#x27;s lifetime cancer risk by as much as 3.0{{nbsp}}×{{nbsp}}10−3 per μg/m3 (without considering that early-life exposures are likely more potent). The USEPA estimated the slope of the dose-response declines at higher doses, and extra cancer risk estimates for several occupational exposure scenarios are calculated.

==Global demand==
Global EO demand has expanded from {{convert|16.6|Mt|e6ST|lk=in|abbr=unit}} in 2004 to {{convert|20|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2009, while demand for refined EO expanded from {{convert|4.64|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2004 to {{convert|5.6|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}} in 2008. In 2009, demand is estimated to have declined to about {{convert|5.2|Mt|e6ST|abbr=unit}}. Total EO demand registered a growth rate of 5.6% per annum during the period 2005 to 2009 and is projected to grow at 5.7% per annum during 2009 to 2013.

==Health and safety regulations==
According to Merck Life Science UK 2020 Safety Data Sheet provided to the European Chemicals Agency&#x27;s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)—a 2006 European Union regulation, ethylene oxide is &quot;presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans.&quot;

The United States EPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 12 December 2019 Federal Register seeking to limit EtO emissions. Over the next couple of years, information was collected and a proposed air toxics rule published in the 13 April 2023 Federal Register. Following a 60 day comment period that could be extended, due to many comments requesting an extension, the EPA rules that could reduce EtO emissions, both direct and fugitive, by over 80% could be implemented within 18 months of publishing the final rule in the Federal Register. Laboratory EtO emitters would still be exempt from the stricter compliance. Additionally, while effectively curbing EtO emissions in the USA, many industrial emitters may simply shift their EtO production to nearby less strict countries: Canada, Mexico, etc.

In 2024, U.S. probed claims that popular Indian curry brands MDH and Everest Spices carried ethylene oxide after Hong Kong and Singapore found the contamination in the products and took enforcement actions against them.

<text>St Catharine&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1473 as Katharine Hall, it adopted its current name in 1860. The college is nicknamed &quot;Catz&quot;. The college is located in the historic city-centre of Cambridge, and lies just south of King&#x27;s College and across the street from Corpus Christi College. The college is notable for its open court (rather than closed quadrangle) that faces towards Trumpington Street.

==Governance and community==
St Catharine&#x27;s college community consists of approximately 1000 Fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, and staff. The college is led by a Master, and the college is run by a governing body comprising the official and professorial Fellows of the college, chaired by the Master. The college has had 40 Masters since its foundation in 1473. The current Master, Sir John Benger took up office on 1 October 2023.

==History==

===Foundation===

Robert Woodlark, Provost of King&#x27;s College, had begun preparations for the founding of a new college as early as 1459 when he bought tenements on which the new college could be built. The preparation cost him a great deal of his private fortune (he was suspected of diverting King&#x27;s College funds), and he was forced to scale down the foundation to only three fellows. He stipulated that they must study theology and philosophy only. The college was established as &quot;Lady Katharine Hall&quot; in 1473. The college received its royal charter of incorporation in 1475 from Edward IV. Woodlark may have chosen the name in homage to the mother of Henry VI who was Catherine of Valois, although it is more likely that it was named as part of the Renaissance cult of Catherine of Alexandria, a patron saint of learning. The college was formally founded on St Catherine&#x27;s day (25 November) 1473. The Catharine wheel, a symbol of the saint&#x27;s martyrdom, appears on the college arms.
The initial foundation was not well-provided for. Woodlark was principally interested in the welfare of fellows and the college had no undergraduates for many years. By 1550, however, there was a number of junior students and the focus of the college changed to that of teaching undergraduates.

===The Robinson vote===
In 1861, the master, Henry Philpott became Bishop of Worcester, and stood down. Two of the five Fellows of the college stood for election: Charles Kirkby Robinson and Francis Jameson. Jameson voted for his rival; however, Robinson voted for himself and won the election. The episode brought the college into some disrepute for some years. Robinson&#x27;s long tenure as master only ended with his death in 1909.

===Expansion and modern day===
As the college entered the 17th century, it was still one of the smallest colleges in Cambridge. However, a series of prudent masters and generous benefactors were to change the fortunes of the college and expand its size. Rapid growth in the fellowship and undergraduate population made it necessary to expand the college, and short-lived additions were made in 1622. By 1630 the college began to demolish its existing buildings which were decaying, and started work on a new court. In 1637 the college came into possession of the George Inn (later the Bull Hotel) on Trumpington Street. Behind this Inn was a stables which was already famous for the practice of its manager, Thomas Hobson, not to allow a hirer to take any horse other than the one longest in the stable, leading to the expression &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot;, meaning &quot;take it or leave it&quot;.

The period of 1675 to 1757 saw the redevelopment of the college&#x27;s site into a large three-sided court, one of only six at Oxbridge colleges; the others are at Sidney Sussex, Jesus and Downing at Cambridge, and Trinity College and Worcester, St Catharine&#x27;s sister college, at Oxford. Proposals for a range of buildings to complete the fourth side of the court have been made on many occasions.
The college was granted new statutes in 1860 and adopted its current name. In 1880, a movement to merge the college with King&#x27;s College began. The two colleges were adjacent and it seemed a solution to King&#x27;s need for more rooms and St Catharine&#x27;s need for a more substantial financial basis. However, the Master (Charles Kirkby Robinson) was opposed and St Catharine&#x27;s eventually refused.

In 1966 a major rebuilding project took place under the mastership of Professor E. E. Rich. This saw the creation of a new larger hall, new kitchens and an accommodation block shared between St Catharine&#x27;s and King&#x27;s College. Pressure on accommodation continued to grow, and in 1981 further accommodation was built at St Chad&#x27;s on Grange Road, with further rooms added there in 1998. In 2013 the college completed the building of a new lecture theatre, college bar and JCR.

In 1979, the membership of the college was broadened to welcome female students, and in 2006 the first woman was appointed as Master of the college, Dame Jean Thomas.

A history of the college was written by W. H. S. Jones in 1936.

In 2015, St Catharine&#x27;s became the first college in Cambridge to implement a gender-neutral dress code for formal hall.

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, St Catharine&#x27;s, in collaboration with Cambridge Women&#x27;s Aid, allowed women who were escaping domestic abuse to stay in college accommodation. Between 27 April and 3 September, women and children were provided with accommodation for a combined 1,456 nights.

Between September 2020 and August 2022, the facilities at the Trumpington Street site of St Catharine&#x27;s were renovated as part of the &quot;Central Spaces project&quot;. A temporary hall was erected on the main court and named &quot;Catzebo&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Catz&quot; and &quot;gazebo&quot; for its tent-like appearance. The name was chosen by the Head Porter following an advisory student vote in which &quot;Catzebo&quot; was put forward by Robson Tebbutt, a student. The official opening for the newly built areas occurred in early October 2022, and the overall cost was stated to be around £16 million.

==Academics==
Historically, St Catharine&#x27;s has generally been placed in the top third of the Tompkins Table (the annual league table of Cambridge colleges), though its position tends to vary year on year. In 2014, its position slipped to 21st, but rose to 13th in 2015 with more than 25% of students gaining First-class honours, and it has further risen to 10th in 2018 with more than 30% gaining a First. The first time the college had been placed at the top of the Tompkins Table was in 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the college averaged 9th of 29 colleges.

==Student life==

The college maintains a friendly rivalry with Queens&#x27; College after the construction of the main court of St Catharine&#x27;s College on Cambridge&#x27;s former High Street relegated one side of Queens&#x27; College into a back alley. A more modern rivalry with Robinson College resulted from the construction in the 1970s of a modern block of flats named St Chad&#x27;s (in which the rooms are octagonal to resemble the wheel on the college crest) by the University Library.

The college has a strong reputation in hockey and racquet sports, in part due to its facilities for these sports including grass tennis courts and an astroturf hockey pitch. The football club is one of the largest sporting clubs at the college. In 2018 the first team were in the 2nd division and the second team were in the 4th division. The team enjoyed its most dominant years in the late 1970s winning Cuppers four times consecutively from 1975 to 1978, although a recent merger with St Edmund&#x27;s College Hockey Club (SECHC) saw them return to the winner&#x27;s list in 2024. St Catharine&#x27;s College Boat Club, the college boat club, hosts the Cardinals Regatta each year, in which teams compete along a short course in fancy dress with an emphasis on bribery to secure victory. The college&#x27;s Boat Club is moderately strong, with both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s 1st boats generally residing in the middle of the 1st division of the May Bumps races.

The college hosts several other notable societies. The Shirley Society is the college literary society, the oldest in Cambridge; it hosts significant figures from the arts. The college-based girls&#x27; choir is the first of its kind in a UK university and is composed of girls aged 8–14 from local schools.

<text>Milton Ernest &quot;Robert&quot; Rauschenberg (October 22, 1925 – May 12, 2008) was an American painter and graphic artist whose early works anticipated the Pop art movement. Rauschenberg is well known for his Combines (1954–1964), a group of artworks which incorporated everyday objects as art materials and which blurred the distinctions between painting and sculpture. Rauschenberg was primarily a painter and a sculptor, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking and performance.

Rauschenberg received numerous awards during his nearly 60-year artistic career. Among the most prominent were the International Grand Prize in Painting at the 32nd Venice Biennale in 1964 and the National Medal of Arts in 1993.

Rauschenberg lived and worked in New York City and on Captiva Island, Florida, until his death on May 12, 2008.

==Life and career==
Rauschenberg was born Milton Ernest Rauschenberg in Port Arthur, Texas, the son of Dora Carolina (née Matson) and Ernest R. Rauschenberg. His father was of German and his mother of Dutch descent. Rauschenberg incorrectly claimed that his paternal grandmother Tina “Tiny” Jane Howard was Cherokee. His father worked for Gulf States Utilities, a light and power company. His parents were Fundamentalist Christians. He had a younger sister named Janet Begneaud.

At 18, Rauschenberg was admitted to the University of Texas at Austin where he began studying pharmacology, but he dropped out shortly after due to the difficulty of the coursework—not realizing at this point that he was dyslexic—and because of his unwillingness to dissect a frog in biology class. He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1944. Based in California, he served as a neuropsychiatric technician in a Navy hospital until his discharge in 1945 or 1946.

Rauschenberg subsequently studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and the in Paris, France, where he met fellow art student Susan Weil. At that time he also changed his name from Milton to Robert. In 1948 Rauschenberg joined Weil in enrolling at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.

At Black Mountain, Rauschenberg sought out Josef Albers, a founder of the Bauhaus in Germany, whom he had read about in an August 1948 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He hoped that Albers&#x27; rigorous teaching methods might curb his habitual sloppiness. Albers&#x27; preliminary design courses relied on strict discipline that did not allow for any &quot;uninfluenced experimentation.&quot;

Rauschenberg became, in his own words, &quot;Albers&#x27; dunce, the outstanding example of what he was not talking about&quot;. Although Rauschenberg considered Albers his most important teacher, he found a more compatible sensibility in John Cage, an established composer of avant-garde music. Like Rauschenberg, Cage had moved away from the teachings of his instructor, Arnold Schoenberg, in favor of a more experimentalist approach to music. Cage provided Rauschenberg with much-needed support and encouragement during the early years of his career, and the two remained friends and artistic collaborators for decades to follow.

From 1949 to 1952 Rauschenberg studied with Vaclav Vytlacil and Morris Kantor at the Art Students League of New York, where he met fellow artists Knox Martin and Cy Twombly.

Rauschenberg married Susan Weil in the summer of 1950 at the Weil family home in Outer Island, Connecticut. Their only child, Christopher, was born July 16, 1951. The two separated in June 1952 and divorced in 1953. Thereafter, Rauschenberg had romantic relationships with fellow artists Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns, among others. His partner for the last 25 years of his life was artist Darryl Pottorf, his former assistant.

In the 1970s he moved into NoHo in Manhattan in New York City.

Rauschenberg purchased the Beach House, his first property on Captiva Island, on July 26, 1968. However, the property did not become his permanent residence until the fall of 1970.

Rauschenberg died of heart failure on May 12, 2008, on Captiva Island, Florida.

==Artistic contribution==
Rauschenberg&#x27;s approach was sometimes called &quot;Neo-Dadaist,&quot; a label he shared with the painter Jasper Johns. Rauschenberg famously stated that &quot;painting relates to both art and life,&quot; and he wanted to work &quot;in the gap between the two.&quot; Like many of his Dadaist predecessors, Rauschenberg questioned the distinction between art objects and everyday objects, and his use of readymade materials reprised the intellectual issues raised by Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917). Duchamp&#x27;s Dadaist influence can also be observed in Jasper Johns&#x27; paintings of targets, numerals, and flags, which were familiar cultural symbols: &quot;things the mind already knows.&quot;
At Black Mountain College, Rauschenberg experimented with a variety of artistic mediums including printmaking, drawing, photography, painting, sculpture, and theatre; his works often featured some combination of these. He created his &quot;Night Blooming&quot; paintings (1951) at Black Mountain by pressing pebbles and gravel into black pigment on canvas. In the very same year he made full body blueprints in collaboration with Susan Weil in his New York apartment, which &quot;they hope to turn [...] into screen and wallpaper designs&quot;.

From the fall of 1952 to the spring of 1953, Rauschenberg traveled in Italy and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly. There, he created collages and small sculptures, including the &quot;Scatole Personali&quot; and &quot;Feticci Personali&quot;, out of found materials. He exhibited them at galleries in Rome and Florence. To Rauschenberg&#x27;s surprise, a number of the works sold; many that did not he threw into the river Arno, following the suggestion of an art critic who reviewed his show.

Upon his return to New York City in 1953, Rauschenberg began creating sculpture with found materials from his Lower Manhattan neighborhood, such as scrap metal, wood, and twine. Throughout the 1950s, Rauschenberg supported himself by designing storefront window displays for Tiffany &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller, first with Susan Weil and later in partnership with Jasper Johns under the pseudonym Matson Jones.
In a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg requested a drawing from the Abstract Expressionist painter Willem de Kooning for the express purpose of erasing it as an artistic statement. This conceptual work, titled &quot;Erased de Kooning Drawing,&quot; was executed with the elder artist&#x27;s consent.

In 1961, Rauschenberg explored a similar conceptual approach by presenting an idea as the artwork itself. He was invited to participate in an exhibition at the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris, where artists were to present portraits of Clert, the gallery owner. Rauschenberg&#x27;s submission consisted of a telegram declaring &quot;This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so.&quot;

By 1962, Rauschenberg&#x27;s paintings were beginning to incorporate not only found objects but found images as well. After a visit to Andy Warhol&#x27;s studio that year, Rauschenberg began using a silkscreen process, usually reserved for commercial means of reproduction, to transfer photographs to canvas. The silkscreen paintings made between 1962 and 1964 led critics to identify Rauschenberg&#x27;s work with Pop art.

Rauschenberg had experimented with technology in his artworks since the making of his early Combines in the mid-1950s, where he sometimes used working radios, clocks, and electric fans as sculptural materials. He later explored his interest in technology while working with Bell Laboratories research scientist Billy Klüver. Together they realized some of Rauschenberg&#x27;s most ambitious technology-based experiments, such as &quot;Soundings&quot; (1968), a light installation which responded to ambient sound. In 1966, Klüver and Rauschenberg officially launched Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a non-profit organization established to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.
In 1969, NASA invited Rauschenberg to witness the launch of Apollo 11. In response to this landmark event, Rauschenberg created his &quot;Stoned Moon Series&quot; of lithographs. This involved combining diagrams and other images from NASA&#x27;s archives with his own drawings and handwritten text.
From 1970, Rauschenberg worked from his home and studio in Captiva, Florida. The first works he created in his new studio were &quot;Cardboards&quot; (1971–72) and &quot;Early Egyptians&quot; (1973–74), for which he relied on locally sourced materials such as cardboard and sand. Where his previous works had often highlighted urban imagery and materials, Rauschenberg now favored the effect of natural fibers found in fabric and paper. He printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the &quot;Hoarfrost&quot; (1974–76) and &quot;Spread&quot; (1975–82) series; the latter featured large stretches of collaged fabric on wood panels. Rauschenberg created his &quot;Jammer&quot; (1975–76) series using colorful fabrics inspired by his trip to Ahmedabad, India, a city famous for its textiles. The imageless simplicity of the Jammer series is a striking contrast with the image-filled Hoarfrosts and the grittiness of his earliest works made in New York City.

International travel became a central part of Rauschenberg&#x27;s artistic process after 1975. In 1984, Rauschenberg announced the start of his Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) at the United Nations. Almost entirely funded by the artist, the ROCI project consisted of a seven-year tour to ten countries around the world. Rauschenberg took photographs in each location and made artworks inspired by the cultures he visited. The resulting works were displayed in a local exhibition in each country. Rauschenberg often donated an artwork to a local cultural institution.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Rauschenberg focused on silkscreening imagery onto a variety of differently treated metals, such as steel and mirrored aluminum. He created many series of so-called &quot;metal paintings,&quot; including: &quot;Borealis&quot; (1988–92), &quot;Urban Bourbons&quot; (1988–1996), &quot;Phantoms&quot; (1991), and &quot;Night Shades&quot; (1991). In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques. As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, in his late painting series he transferred digital inkjet photographic images to a variety of painting supports. For his &quot;Arcadian Retreats&quot; (1996) he transferred imagery to wet fresco. His &quot;Love Hotel [Anagram (A Pun)]&quot; from 1998, and made out of vegetable dye transfer on polylaminate, is included in the permanent collection of the Pérez Art Museum Miami, in Florida, the artist&#x27;s home state for nearly forty years. In keeping with his commitment to the environment, Rauschenberg used biodegradable dyes and pigments, and water rather than chemicals in the transfer process.

===The &quot;White Paintings&quot;, black paintings, and &quot;Red Paintings&quot;===
In 1951 Rauschenberg created his &quot;White Painting&quot; series in the tradition of monochromatic painting established by Kazimir Malevich, who reduced painting to its most essential qualities for an experience of aesthetic purity and infinity. The &quot;White Paintings&quot; were shown at Eleanor Ward&#x27;s Stable Gallery in New York in fall 1953. Rauschenberg used everyday white house paint and paint rollers to create smooth, unembellished surfaces which at first appear as blank canvas. Instead of perceiving them to be without content, however, John Cage described the &quot;White Paintings&quot; as &quot;airports for the lights, shadows and particles&quot;; surfaces which reflected delicate atmospheric changes in the room.
Rauschenberg himself said that they were affected by ambient conditions, &quot;so you could almost tell how many people are in the room.&quot;
Like the &quot;White Paintings&quot;, the black paintings of 1951–1953 were executed on multiple panels and were predominantly single color works. Rauschenberg applied matte and glossy black paint to textured grounds of newspaper on canvas, occasionally allowing the newspaper to remain visible.

By 1953 Rauschenberg had moved from the &quot;White Painting&quot; and black painting series to the heightened expressionism of his &quot;Red Painting&quot; series. He regarded red as &quot;the most difficult color&quot; with which to paint, and accepted the challenge by dripping, pasting, and squeezing layers of red pigment directly onto canvas grounds that included patterned fabric, newspaper, wood, and nails. The complex material surfaces of the &quot;Red Paintings&quot; were forerunners of Rauschenberg&#x27;s well-known Combine series (1954-1964).

===Combines===

Rauschenberg collected discarded objects on the streets of New York City and brought them back to his studio where he integrated them into his work. He claimed he &quot;wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing.&quot;

Rauschenberg&#x27;s comment concerning the gap between art and life provides the departure point for an understanding of his contributions as an artist. He saw the potential beauty in almost anything; he once said, &quot;I really feel sorry for people who think things like soap dishes or mirrors or Coke bottles are ugly, because they&#x27;re surrounded by things like that all day long, and it must make them miserable.&quot; His Combine series endowed everyday objects with a new significance by bringing them into the context of fine art alongside traditional painting materials. The Combines eliminated the boundaries between art and sculpture so that both were present in a single work of art. While &quot;Combines&quot; technically refers to Rauschenberg&#x27;s work from 1954 to 1964, Rauschenberg continued to utilize everyday objects such as clothing, newspaper, urban debris, and cardboard throughout his artistic career.

His transitional pieces that led to the creation of Combines were &quot;Charlene&quot; (1954) and &quot;Collection&quot; (1954/1955), where he collaged objects such as scarves, electric light bulbs, mirrors, and comic strips. Although Rauschenberg had implemented newspapers and patterned textiles in his black paintings and &quot;Red Paintings&quot;, in the Combines he gave everyday objects a prominence equal to that of traditional painting materials. Considered one of the first of the Combines, &quot;Bed&quot; (1955) was created by smearing red paint across a well-worn quilt, sheet, and pillow. The work was hung vertically on the wall like a traditional painting. Because of the intimate connections of the materials to the artist&#x27;s own life, &quot;Bed&quot; is often considered to be a self-portrait and a direct imprint of Rauschenberg&#x27;s interior consciousness. Some critics suggested the work could be read as a symbol for violence and rape, but Rauschenberg described Bed as &quot;one of the friendliest pictures I&#x27;ve ever painted.&quot; Among his most famous Combines are those that incorporate taxidermied animals, such as &quot;Monogram&quot; (1955–1959) which includes a stuffed angora goat, and &quot;Canyon&quot; (1959), which features a stuffed golden eagle. Although the eagle was salvaged from the trash, Canyon drew government ire due to the 1940 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.

Critics originally viewed the Combines in terms of their formal qualities: color, texture, and composition. The formalist view of the 1960s was later refuted by critic Leo Steinberg, who said that each Combine was &quot;a receptor surface on which objects are scattered, on which data is entered.&quot; According to Steinberg, the horizontality of what he called Rauschenberg&#x27;s &quot;flatbed picture plane&quot; had replaced the traditional verticality of painting, and subsequently allowed for the uniquely material-bound surfaces of Rauschenberg&#x27;s work.

===Performance and dance===
Rauschenberg began exploring his interest in dance after moving to New York in the early 1950s. He was first exposed to avant-garde dance and performance art at Black Mountain College, where he participated in John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Theatre Piece No. 1&quot; (1952), often considered the first Happening. He began designing sets, lighting, and costumes for Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor. In the early 1960s he was involved in the radical dance-theater experiments at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and he choreographed his first performance, &quot;Pelican&quot; (1963), for the Judson Dance Theater in May 1963. Rauschenberg was close friends with Cunningham-affiliated dancers including Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, and Steve Paxton, all of whom featured in his choreographed works. Rauschenberg&#x27;s full-time connection to the Merce Cunningham Dance Company ended following its 1964 world tour. In 1966, Rauschenberg created the &quot;Open Score&quot; performance for part of &quot;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering&quot; at the 69th Regiment Armory, New York. The series was instrumental in the formation of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.).

In 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in thirteen years to create &quot;Travelogue&quot; (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs. Rauschenberg did not choreograph his own works after 1967, but he continued to collaborate with other choreographers, including Trisha Brown, for the remainder of his artistic career.

===Commissions===
Throughout his career, Rauschenberg designed numerous posters in support of causes that were important to him. In 1965, when &quot;Life&quot; magazine commissioned him to visualize a modern Inferno, he did not hesitate to vent his rage at the Vietnam War and other contemporary sociopolitical issues, including racial violence, neo-Nazism, political assassinations, and ecological disaster.

In 1969 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City commissioned Rauschenberg to create a piece in honor of its centennial. He learned that the museum&#x27;s original goals were detailed in a certificate from 1870 and created his &#x27;Centennial Certificate&#x27; based on that object, with images of some of the best-known pieces in the museum and the signatures of the board at that time. Copies of the Centennial Certificate exist in numerous museums and private collections.

On December 30, 1979, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; printed 650,000 copies of &quot;Tropic,&quot; its Sunday magazine, with a cover designed by Rauschenberg. In 1983, he won a Grammy Award for his album design of Talking Heads&#x27; album &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;. In 1986 Rauschenberg was commissioned by BMW to paint a full size BMW 635 CSi for the sixth installment of the famed BMW Art Car Project. Rauschenberg&#x27;s car was the first in the project to feature reproductions of works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as well as his own photographs.

In 1998, the Vatican commissioned a work by Rauschenberg in honor of the Jubilee year 2000 to be displayed in the Padre Pio Liturgical Hall, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. Working around the theme of the Last Judgement, Rauschenberg created &quot;The Happy Apocalypse&quot; (1999), a twenty-foot-long maquette. It was ultimately rejected by the Vatican on the grounds that Rauschenberg&#x27;s depiction of God as a satellite dish was an inappropriate theological reference.

==Works==
==Exhibitions==
Rauschenberg had his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery in spring 1951. In 1953, while in Italy, he was noted by Irene Brin and Gaspero del Corso and they organized his first European exhibition in their famous gallery in Rome. In 1953, Eleanor Ward invited Rauschenberg to participate in a joint exhibition with Cy Twombly at the Stable Gallery. In his second solo exhibition in New York at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1954, Rauschenberg presented his &quot;Red Paintings&quot; (1953–1953) and Combines (1954–1964). Leo Castelli mounted a solo exhibition of Rauschenberg&#x27;s Combines in 1958. The only sale was an acquisition by Castelli himself of &quot;Bed&quot; (1955), now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Rauschenberg&#x27;s first career retrospective was organized by the Jewish Museum, New York, in 1963. In 1964 he became one of the first American artists to win the International Grand Prize in Painting at the Venice Biennale (James Whistler and Mark Tobey had previously won painting prizes in 1895 and 1958 respectively). A mid-career retrospective was organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, D.C., and traveled throughout the United States between 1976 and 1978.

In the 1990s a retrospective was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1997), which traveled to museums in Houston, Cologne, and Bilbao through 1999. An exhibition of Combines was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2005; traveled to Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and Moderna Museet, Stockholm, through 2007). Rauschenberg&#x27;s first posthumous retrospective was mounted at Tate Modern (2016; traveled to Museum of Modern Art, New York, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art through 2017).

Further exhibitions include: &quot;Robert Rauschenberg: Jammers,&quot; Gagosian Gallery, London (2013); &quot;Robert Rauschenberg: The Fulton Street Studio&quot;, &quot;1953–54&quot;, Craig F. Starr Associates (2014); &quot;A Visual Lexicon,&quot; Leo Castelli Gallery (2014); &quot;Robert Rauschenberg: Works on Metal&quot;, Gagosian Gallery, Beverly Hills (2014); &quot;Rauschenberg in China&quot;, Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2016); and &quot;Rauschenberg: The 1/4 Mile&quot; at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2018–2019).

==Legacy==
Rauschenberg believed strongly in the power of art as a catalyst for social change. The Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) began in 1984 as an effort to spark international dialogue and enhance cultural understanding through artistic expression. A ROCI exhibition went on view at the National Gallery of Art, D.C., in 1991, concluding a ten-country tour: Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, U.S.S.R., Germany, and Malaysia.

In 1970, Rauschenberg created a program called Change, Inc., to award one-time emergency grants of up to $1,000 to visual artists based on financial need. In 1990, Rauschenberg created the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RRF) to promote awareness of the causes he cared about, such as world peace, the environment and humanitarian issues. In 1986, Rauschenberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1993. In 2000, Rauschenberg was honored with amfAR&#x27;s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS.

RRF today owns many works by Rauschenberg from every period of his career. In 2011, the foundation presented &quot;The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg&quot; in collaboration with Gagosian Gallery, featuring selections from Rauschenberg&#x27;s personal art collection. Proceeds from the exhibition helped fund the foundation&#x27;s philanthropic activities. Also in 2011, the foundation launched its &quot;Artist as Activist&quot; project and invited artist Shepard Fairey to focus on an issue of his choice. The editioned work he made was sold to raise funds for the Coalition for the Homeless. RRF continues to support emerging artists and arts organizations with grants and philanthropic collaborations each year. The RRF has several residency programs that take place at the foundation&#x27;s headquarters in New York and at the late artist&#x27;s property in Captiva Island, Florida.

In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Open Score&quot; (1966) seventh in his list of the all-time greatest performance art works.

The Bob Rauschenberg Gallery at Florida Southwestern State College was renamed in 2004 (from The Gallery of Fine Art, founded 1979) in Rauschenberg&#x27;s honor and with his blessing.

==Art market==
In 2010 &quot;Studio Painting&quot; (1960‑61), one of Rauschenberg&#x27;s Combines originally estimated at $6 million to $9 million, was bought from the collection of Michael Crichton for $11 million at Christie&#x27;s, New York. In 2019, Christie&#x27;s sold the silkscreen painting &quot;Buffalo II&quot; (1964) for $88.8 million, shattering the artist&#x27;s previous record.

===Lobbying for artists&#x27; resale royalties===
In the early 1970s, Rauschenberg lobbied U.S. Congress to pass a bill that would compensate artists when their work is resold on the secondary market. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties (droit de suite) after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his collection of Abstract Expressionist and Pop art works for $2.2 million. Scull had originally purchased Rauschenberg&#x27;s paintings &quot;Thaw&quot; (1958) and &quot;Double Feature&quot; (1959) for $900 and $2,500 respectively; roughly a decade later Scull sold the pieces for $85,000 and $90,000 in a 1973 auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.

Rauschenberg&#x27;s lobbying efforts were rewarded in 1976 when California governor Jerry Brown signed into law the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. The artist continued to pursue nationwide resale royalties legislation following the California victory.

<text>The Mên-an-Tol (Cornish: &quot;Men an Toll&quot;) is a small formation of standing stones in Cornwall, England (). It is about three miles northwest of Madron. It is also known locally as the &quot;Crick Stone&quot;.

==Location==
The Mên-an-Tol stands near the Madron to Morvah road in Cornwall. Other antiquities in the vicinity include the Mên Scryfa inscribed stone about 300 metres to the north and the Boskednan stone circle less than 1 kilometre to the northeast.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Men an Toll&quot; in Cornish means &quot;the stone of the hole&quot;.

==Description==
The Mên-an-Tol consists of three upright granite stones: a round stone with its middle holed out with two standing stones to each side, in front of and behind the hole.

The two side stones are both about 1.2 metres high. The westernmost stone was moved and brought into a straight line with the other two stones sometime after 1815. The holed stone is roughly octagonal in outline. It is 1.3 metres wide and 1.1 metres high; the circular hole is 0.5 m in diameter. The only other holed stone in Cornwall of this type is the Tolvan holed stone which can be seen in a garden near Helston.

There is one other standing stone nearby, and six recumbent stones, some of which are buried. A cairn exists as a low stony mound just to the southeast. There are two other early Bronze Age barrows or cairns between 120 and 150 metres to the north.

==Interpretation==
The Mên-an-Tol is thought to date to either the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. The holed stone could originally have been a natural occurrence rather than deliberately sculpted.

The distribution of the stones around the site has led to the suggestion that the monument is actually part of a stone circle. If so, then it is likely that the stones have been rearranged at some point, and the two standing stones either side of the holed stone may have been moved from their original positions. It has also been suggested that the holed stone could have been a capstone for the nearby cairn before being moved to its present position.

==History==
In 1749 the site was first archaeologically investigated by William Borlase, who also drew a plan. This shows that the megaliths were not in a line like today, but formed an angle of about 135°. Borlase also reported that farmers had taken away some stones from the area. From him comes the first written record of the myths and rituals.

In the 19th Century the local antiquary John Thomas Blight published several drawings of the site, and made the first suggestion that the stones could be the remains of a stone circle. In 1872 William Copeland Borlase, a descendant of the earlier Borlase, gave a more detailed description of the area.

In 1932 Hugh O&#x27;Neill Hencken wrote the first modern archaeological report. He believed that the position of the stones was not the prehistoric arrangement, but had been significantly changed. He also thought that the holed stone might be part of a destroyed tomb. He was even told that local farmers with back or limb complaints would crawl through the hole to relieve their pain.

In 1993, the Cornwall &quot;Historic Environment Service&quot; published a detailed report with the latest research results. They suggested that the standing stones originated from a stone circle which consisted of 18 to 20 stones. The holed stone, however, could be part of a nearby portal tomb. It also possible that the holed stone stood at the center of the stone circle and served to frame specific points on the horizon. Such a use of a holed stone is not known in other sites, although the nearby stone circle of Boscawen-Un does have a central standing stone.

==In folklore==

Mên-an-Tol is supposed to have a fairy or piskie guardian who can make miraculous cures. In one story, a changeling baby was put through the stone in order for the mother to get the real child back. Evil piskies had changed her child, and the ancient stones were able to reverse their evil spell. Another legend is that passage through the stone will cure a child of rickets (osteomalacia). For centuries, children with rickets were passed naked through the hole in the middle stone nine times.

== Popular culture ==

Many of the visitors to Mên-an-Tol have their photograph taken placing their heads through the central hole.

The Cornish poet D. M. Thomas referred to Mên-an-Tol as &quot;the wind&#x27;s vagina&quot;.

The song &quot;Men-An-Tol&quot; appears on the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; album by the Levellers.

The Men-An-Tol also features prominently in the novel &quot;The Little Country&quot; by Charles de Lint.

&quot;Mén-An-Tol&quot; is the name of a level in the 2017 game &quot;Monument Valley 2&quot;.

&quot;Mén-An-Tol&quot; is a song on the 2018 album &quot;The Four Worlds&quot; by Mark Pritchard.

&quot;Men an Toll&quot; is a piece on the 2022 Cornish language album &quot;Tresor&quot; by Gwenno.

<doc id="306185" wikidata="Q2504236" url="?curid=306185" title="List of current ships of the Royal Canadian Navy">
<text>The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) is tasked to provide maritime security along the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic coasts of Canada, exercise Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over the Arctic archipelago, and support Canada&#x27;s multi-national and bilateral interests overseas. It comprises the Pacific Fleet at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt, and the Atlantic Fleet at CFB Halifax. CFB Esquimalt is on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, and is home to 15 vessels and 6,000 staff, the headquarters for Maritime Forces Pacific, His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian (HMC) Dockyard Esquimalt, Fleet Maintenance Facility – Cape Breton (FMF-CB), Fire Fighting and Damage Control School, the Naval Officer Training Centre (NOTC Venture), and extensive housing. CFB Halifax is home port for the 18 vessels of the Canadian Atlantic Fleet and situated in Halifax, Nova Scotia. CFB Halifax employs 7,000 civilians and military staff, and hosts the Canadian Atlantic Fleet headquarters, HMC Dockyard Halifax, FMF Cape Scott, extensive maritime research facilities, an ammunition depot, and the four maritime squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force that deploy helicopters aboard ships. The Canadian Armed Forces are currently constructing a new naval facility at Nanisivik, Baffin Island, to provide a summer port for RCN patrols in the Canadian Arctic.

With the loss of area air defence capabilities in 2015 (and, temporarily, at-sea replenishment capabilities), the RCN was, at that time, classified as a Rank 5 navy (offshore regional coastal defence) on the Todd-Lindberg navy classification system, dropping from Rank 3 (multiregional power projection). Commissioned vessels are designated as &#x27;His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship&#x27; (HMCS), minor ships as &#x27;Patrol Craft Training&#x27; (PCT) and auxiliaries as &#x27;Canadian Forces Auxiliary Vessel&#x27; (CFAV).

==Submarines==

The &quot;Victoria&quot; class are British-built diesel-electric fleet submarines designed in the late 1970s to supplement the Royal Navy&#x27;s nuclear submarine force. They were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War. In 1998, Canada purchased the submarines to replace the aging s. Refit for Canadian service included the removal of sub-Harpoon missile firing and mine-laying capabilities, installation of torpedo launch systems and upgrades to weapons and fire control systems. Each vessel holds 53 crew.

==Frigates==

The s are multi-role vessels with anti-submarine, anti-aircraft and anti-ship capability. In response to recent global security interests, the role of the class has shifted from open ocean to littoral engagement. Innovations in operational tactics have allowed the vessels of this class to adapt to new asymmetric surface threats. To ensure effective long-term capacity in this new threat environment the ships underwent a refit, including passive and active weapons, radars, and new combat architecture to meet the modern requirements. As of 2018, all twelve ships had been refitted. Each holds a complement of 225 officers and crew. All ships of the class are named after major Canadian cities.
== Offshore patrol ships ==
The s are warships from the Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ship (AOPS) procurement project, part of the National Shipbuilding Strategy. In July 2007 the federal government announced plans for acquiring six to eight icebreaking warships for the RCN. The class is based on the Norwegian Coast Guard ship , and is named after Vice Admiral Harry DeWolf. The class is equipped with a hangar and flight deck and can operate the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone. The ships can deploy with multiple payloads, including shipping containers, underwater survey equipment or landing craft and have a crane for loading and unloading. They are for use in the Arctic regions of Canada for patrol and support within Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone.
==Maritime coastal defence vessels==

The s are multi-role vessels built and launched from the mid- to late-1990s and are crewed by a combination of Naval Reserve and Regular-Force personnel. Each vessel displaces 970 t and runs with a complement of between 31 and 47 officers and crew. Their main missions are counter narcotics, coastal surveillance, sovereignty patrol, route survey, and training. The ships&#x27; capabilities include a mechanical minesweeping system, a route survey system, and a bottom object inspection vehicle.
==Patrol &amp; training vessels==

s are primarily used for one-to-six-week long &#x27;at sea&#x27; naval officer training. Regular force boatswains, engineers and naval communicators serve in these ships to train junior officers and non-commissioned sailors. They also patrol coastal waters for pollution infractions and fishing violations, and are frequently tasked for search and rescue operations. They operate year-round in the coastal waters of British Columbia.

*CFAV &quot;Black Duck&quot; (YAG 660)

==Development and procurement==
The National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy will invest more than $60 billion into the development of Arctic capable patrol vessels, frigate-class surface warships, and long-range auxiliary supply vessels. Delivery has been initiated on a class of six &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot;-class vessels under the Arctic Patrol Ship Project (AOPS). (A further two AOPS are planned for the Canadian Coast Guard).

=== Submarines ===
Canada has been encouraged to invest in new submarines. In July 2024, Canada launched the process to acquire up to 12 conventional attack submarines.

Potential suppliers:

* Germany and Norway offered to Canada a collaboration on the Arctic defence and the Type 212CD submarine. Canada signed a letter of intent to establish a maritime partnership, but it does not commit Canada to the purchase of the Type 212CD.
* South Korea approached Canada to supply its submarine to Canada.
* Sweden with Saab expressed interest in participating to a potential competition.

=== Frigates ===
While up to 15 warships of the program is in the test module construction phase (with the first three ships having been ordered in 2024), the RCN has upgraded all current frigates with advanced systems and life extension maintenance to maximize operational capability into the 2030s.

=== Auxiliary fleet ===

==== Supply ship ====
The commercial containership is currently in service as a fleet supply vessel, to meet operational requirements until the two new s are completed.

==== Tugboats ====
On 29 April 2019 Ocean Industries was awarded a contract to build four tugboats to replace both the Fire-class fireboat (one retired in 2014) and Glen-class tugs to be delivered beginning in 2021.

=== Aircraft ===

==== Unmanned aerial vehicles ====
In May 2019, it was announced that the Skeldar V-200 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) would be acquired for both the RCN and Canadian Special Forces. As a light helicopter UAV, it will be capable of operating from a range of RCN vessels. In addition, in 2024 the Teal 2 small quadcopter for light intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) tasks was acquired, while the RCN ISTAR project is expected to introduce a larger, longer-range UAV.

<doc id="306189" wikidata="Q14910" url="?curid=306189" title="Schwäbisch Hall">
<text>Schwäbisch Hall (; &#x27;Swabian Hall&#x27;; from 1802 until 1934 and colloquially: &quot;Hall&quot; ) is a city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg located in the valley of the Kocher river, the longest tributary (together with its headwater Lein) of the Neckar river. The closest larger city is Heilbronn, and Schwäbisch Hall lies north-east of the state capital of Stuttgart. It is the seat of the district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Schwäbisch Hall.

Unlike its name might suggest, Schwäbisch Hall lies in the region of Heilbronn-Franconia, the East Franconian-speaking northeasternmost part of Baden-Württemberg, which is culturally and linguistically more closely related to the adjoining region of Franconia in neighbouring Bavaria than to the Alemannic-speaking regions of Württemberg, Baden, Switzerland, Bavarian Swabia, Vorarlberg, Alsace and Liechtenstein.

The city&#x27;s main landmarks are the market square with St Michael&#x27;s Church (St. Michaelskirche), Comburg Castle (a former Benedictine monastery) with St Nicholas&#x27; Church (St. Nikolaus und St. Maria), and the Hallian-Franconian Museum (Hällisch-Fränkisches Museum), dedicated to the art and history of Schwäbisch Hall and surrounding Heilbronn-Franconia.

Schwäbisch Hall was a Free Imperial City within the Holy Roman Empire for five centuries until it was annexed by Württemberg in 1802.

==Etymology==
&quot;Schwäbisch&quot; refers to the Swabian League (German: &quot;Schwäbischer Bund&quot;). The origin of the second part of the name, &quot;Hall&quot;, is unclear. It might be derived from a West Germanic word family that means &quot;drying something by heating it&quot;, possibly referring to the open-pan salt making method used there until the saltworks closed down in 1925.

==History==
===Early history===
Salt was produced from brine by the Celts at the site of Schwäbisch Hall as early as the fifth century BCE.
The town was first mentioned in a document called &quot;Öhringer Stiftungsbrief&quot; dating from 1063. The village probably belonged first to the &quot;Counts of Comburg-Rothenburg&quot; and went from them to the Imperial house of Hohenstaufen (ca 1116). It was probably Emperor Frederick I who founded the imperial mint and started the coining of the so-called &quot;Heller&quot;. Hall flourished through the production of salt and coins. Since 1204 it has been called a town.

After the fall of the house of Hohenstaufen, Hall defended itself successfully against the claims of a noble family in the neighbourhood (the &quot;Schenken von Limpurg&quot;). The conflict was finally settled in 1280 by Rudolph I of Habsburg; this allowed the undisturbed development into a Free Imperial City (&quot;Reichsstadt&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian granted a constitution that settled internal conflicts (&quot;Erste Zwietracht&quot;) in 1340. After this, the city was governed by the inner council (&quot;Innerer Rat&quot;) which was composed of twelve noblemen, six &quot;middle burghers&quot; and eight craftsmen. The head of the council was the &quot;Stättmeister&quot; (mayor). A second phase of internal conflicts 1510–12 (&quot;Zweite Zwietracht&quot;) brought the dominating role of the nobility to an end. The confrontation with the noble families was started by Stättmeister &quot;Hermann Büschler&quot;, whose daughter &quot;Anna Büschler&quot; is the subject of a popular book by professor Steven Ozment (&quot;The Bürgermeister&#x27;s Daughter: Scandal in a sixteenth-century German city&quot;). The leading role was taken over by a group of families who turned into a new ruling class. Amongst them where the &quot;Bonhöffers&quot;, the ancestors of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

===Middle ages===
From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Hall systematically acquired a large territory in the surrounding area, mostly from noble families and the Comburg monastery. The wealth of this era can still be seen in some gothic buildings like St. Michael&#x27;s Church (rebuilt 1427–1526) with its impressive stairway (1507). The city joined the Protestant Reformation very early. Johannes Brenz, a follower of Martin Luther, was made pastor of St. Michael&#x27;s Church in 1522 and quickly began to reform the church and the school system along Lutheran lines.

Hall suffered severely during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, though it was never besieged or scene of a battle. However, it was forced to pay enormous sums to the armies of the various parties, especially to the imperial, Swedish and French troops, who also committed numerous atrocities and plundered the city and the surrounding area. Between 1634 and 1638 every fifth inhabitant died of hunger and disease, especially from the bubonic plague. The war left the city an impoverished and economically ruined place. But with the help of reorganizations of salt production and trade and a growing wine trade, there was an astonishingly fast recovery.

===17th century to early 20th century===
Fires were a constant threat to the mostly wooden houses. The great fires of 1680 and especially of 1728 destroyed much of the city, which led to new buildings in the Baroque style, such as the city hall.

The Napoleonic wars brought the history of Hall as a Free Imperial City to an end. Following the Treaty of Lunéville (1801), the duke of Württemberg was allowed by Napoleon to occupy the city and several other minor states as a compensation for territories on the Left Bank of the Rhine that fell to France. This took place in 1802 — Hall lost its territory and its political independence and became a (seat of an , comparable to a county). Ownership of the salt works was handed over to the state. A long economic crisis during the 19th century forced many citizens to move to other places in Germany or to emigrate overseas, mostly to the United States. While other towns like Heilbronn grew steadily due to the Industrial Revolution, the population of Hall stagnated. The economic situation improved during the second half of the 19th century — a main factor was the railway line to Heilbronn (1862) — but was not followed by a significant growth of the city. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that new settlements were built on the heights surrounding the old town. Hall also grew through the incorporation of Steinbach (1930) and Hessental (1936).

In 1827, a health spa was established on one of the islands in the Kocher river. Especially after the building of the railway (1862) it became a considerable economical factor. The well-preserved old town also brought a rising number of tourists. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Hall has developed many festivities. Especially well known are the theatre productions which are performed every year in the centre of the city on the steps of St. Michael.

===Nazi Germany and World War II===
In 1934, Hall was officially named &quot;Schwäbisch Hall&quot;. During the Third Reich a Luftwaffe air base was built at Hessental. During Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, local Nazis burned the synagogue in Steinbach and devastated shops and houses of Jewish citizens. Approximately 40 Jewish citizens of Schwäbisch Hall fell victim to the Holocaust in extermination camps in Eastern Europe. In 1944 a concentration camp was established next to the train station Hall-Hessental. The train station at Hall was targeted by an American air raid on February 23, 1945, but the devastation was mostly limited to the suburbs of St. Katharina and Unterlimpurg. The city was occupied by US Army troops on April 17, 1945, without serious resistance; though several buildings were destroyed or damaged, the historical old town suffered comparatively little.

===Post World War II===
In 1960, Schwäbisch Hall reached the status of a . This means that the city took over some tasks of the district. From the end of World War II until the end of the Cold War, Dolan Barracks and Schwäbisch Hall Army Air Field was a kaserne which hosted a series of US Army aviation units and ordnance units until it was turned back over to German control in 1993.

==Demographics==
As of December 31, 2009, Schwäbisch Hall has a population of 36,799. The residents come from over 100 countries. As of December 31, 2008, there are 18,838 Protestants, 7,375 Roman Catholics and 10,234 who are either in another religion or not religious. In 2017 Schwäbisch Hall had a population of over 39,000.

==Climate==
==Architecture==
Schwäbisch Hall has a mix of historic and modern buildings. The older are mostly medieval, and with Timber Frame, Gothic and Baroque styles dominating the city centre. The more modern are on the outskirts and suburbs, helping preserve the history of the city.


==Culture==
There is an outdoor summer theatre which performs on the open-air staircase at St. Michael&#x27;s Church and at the Globe Theatre. The &quot;Hällisch-Frankische Museum&quot; and the Hohenloher Freilandmuseum (Wackershofen open air museum) shows the history of the region starting from the Middle Ages.

The &quot;Kunsthalle Würth&quot;, a modern art gallery, can be explored to see paintings, graphic art, and sculptures dating from the 19th century onward. Schwäbisch Hall and the surrounding area offer a plenty of leisure activities which includes sports flying, swimming, hiking and cycling.

Other parts of the city&#x27;s culture includes the Salt Festival where the historical salt economy of the city is celebrated, the Summer Night Festival, the Baker&#x27;s Oven Festival and the Christmas Market which includes traditional handicrafts.

==Education==
Schwäbisch Hall has a long tradition as a city of learning.

Schwäbisch Hall offers education opportunities through vocational schools and various technical schools. Programs are offered in schools such as Schwäbisch Hall Evangelical School of Social Work, Social Service Department of Social Professions, Protestant vocational school for the elderly, School of Alternative Education Nursing, School of Nursing and the Ayurvedic teaching and training institute, the Institute of Ayurveda and Yoga.

Due to a branch of the Goethe-Institut at Schwäbisch Hall, the city attracts up to 2,000 students a year, coming from countries around the world to study the German language. The programs are especially popular during the summer, as college students attend the program over their break to earn credits and improve their German.

The City Archives Hall is a documentation centre, which allows for historical research and memory management. The duties of the City Archives Hall are the ordering, preparing, evaluating and management of its archives and collections, to support historical research, to collaborate in exhibitions and to publish its own or other publications on the history of Schwäbisch Hall.

The archive keeps official records and files of the present city administration and its predecessors, and of collection items of different type and origin, which refer to the city, such as photographs, posters, graphics, paintings, maps and plans, or a newspaper clipping collection. There are also extensive library collections in the literature on the history of Schwäbisch Hall and the region, as well as valuable historical prints.

==Politics==
The Lord Mayor of Schwäbisch Hall is Daniel Bullinger, elected in July 2021. He succeeded Hermann-Josef Pelgrim, who had been in office since 1997. The city administration was an early mover in the migration from Microsoft Windows to Linux and open source software in the early years of the 21st century.

===Next scheduled elections for citizens of Schwäbisch Hall===

==Economy==
Schwäbisch Hall is the most important regional economic hub between Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Nuremberg. Formerly, salt was important to Schwäbisch Hall, but today the economy is shaped by a group of medium-sized companies, focusing mainly on trade and services sectors. A number of businesses dealing in property finance, solar energy and telecommunications sectors also have their headquarters in Schwäbisch Hall. Notable companies are &quot;Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall AG&quot;, a housing credit company, founded in 1944 and RECARO Aircraft Seating, an aircraft seats manufacturer.

Annually, there are up to 600 overnight stays in Schwäbisch Hall hotels by Goethe-Institut students.

===Transport===

====Roads====
Schwäbisch Hall has an exit on the Autobahn 6 (Heilbronn–Nürnberg). Federal highways 14 (Stuttgart–Nürnberg) and 19 (Ulm–Aalen–Schwäbisch Hall–Würzburg) also run through the city.

====Railways====
Schwäbisch Hall-Hessental station is at the junction of the Waiblingen–Schwäbisch Hall railway and the Crailsheim–Heilbronn railway and Schwäbisch Hall station (the city station) is on the Crailsheim–Heilbronn railway.

====Aviation====
The city is served by two aerodromes, very close to each other, but neither offers commercial air transport. To the North of Tüngentaler Strasse is the recreational grass airfield of Weckrieden (EDTX), to the South is Adolf Würth Airport (EDTY), closely associated with the Würth group of companies and hosting their own business jet operations.

==Health==
Schwäbisch Hall has a history with brine. The first brine bath started in 1827. Diakonie-Krankenhaus, with 574 beds, is the main hospital in Schwäbisch Hall. There are 100 general practitioners, medical specialists and physiotherapists in Schwäbisch Hall. There are health fairs such as Well-Vital Health Fair and the Haller Gesundheits- und Naturheiltagen in Schwäbisch Hall.

==Sports==
The sports played in Schwäbisch Hall include swimming, light athletics, tennis, shooting, soccer, baseball, handball and American football. There are 22 sports halls and 25 outdoor playing fields.

<doc id="306190" wikidata="Q1145222" url="?curid=306190" title="Tony Gwynn">
<text>Anthony Keith Gwynn Sr. (May 9, 1960 – June 16, 2014), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Padre&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder, who played 20 seasons (1982–2001) in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres. The left-handed hitting Gwynn won eight batting titles in his career, which is tied for the most in National League (NL) history. He was a 15-time All-Star and won seven Silver Slugger Awards and five Gold Glove Awards. Gwynn stayed with the Padres his entire career, and played in the only two World Series appearances in San Diego franchise history. Having hit over .300 for 19 straight seasons, Gwynn retired with a .338 career batting average, the highest mark since Ted Williams retired in 1960; Gwynn also holds the highest adjusted batting average of all time with .342. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007 in his first year of eligibility, and is widely considered the best pure hitter of his generation.

Gwynn attended San Diego State University (SDSU), where he played both college baseball and basketball for the Aztecs. He was an all-conference player in both sports in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), and was also honored as an All-American in baseball. Gwynn was selected by the Padres in the third round of the 1981 MLB draft as the 58th overall pick. He made his major-league debut the next year and won his first batting title in 1984, when San Diego advanced to its first-ever World Series. Gwynn was a poor fielder in college and the minor leagues, but improved over time and received his first Gold Glove in 1986. The next year, he won the first of three consecutive batting titles. From 1990 to 1994, Gwynn endured four injury-shortened seasons, then had four straight batting titles starting in 1994, when he batted a career-high .394 in a strike-shortened season. Gwynn played in his second World Series in 1998 and reached the 3,000-hit milestone the following year. He played two more seasons, hampered by injuries in both, and retired after the 2001 season with 3,141 career hits.

A contact hitter, Gwynn frequently hit the ball to the opposite field. After first meeting Hall of Famer Ted Williams in 1992, Gwynn modified his hitting approach and became more adept at pulling the ball and using the entire field, as well as hitting for more power. In his early career years, he was also a threat to steal bases. In an era before MLB teams used video for scouting, Gwynn pioneered the practice of recording and studying video to improve his hitting, for which he received the nickname &quot;Captain Video&quot;. Widely considered the greatest player in Padres history, Gwynn regularly accepted less money to remain with the small-market team; he became a civic icon for the city of San Diego.

During his later playing years and throughout retirement, Gwynn was an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. After he retired from playing, the Padres retired his No. 19 in 2004. Gwynn became the head baseball coach at his alma mater university and also spent time as a baseball analyst. Gwynn developed a decades-long addiction to smokeless tobacco as a young adult, and was diagnosed with salivary gland cancer in 2010; Gwynn died of the cancer in 2014 at the age of 54. His death increased awareness regarding tobacco usage in MLB, leading to the 2016 league-wide ban on the substance for new players.

==Early life and family==
===Family background===
Gwynn was born in Los Angeles, California, to Charles and Vendella Gwynn, who originated from Gallatin, Tennessee. Charles excelled at sports, preferring football and baseball which he played in high school, and was also very passionate about history and politics; he spent the majority of his young adulthood in the 1950s serving for the U.S. Army. Vendella grew up in a large family and house upon several acres of land that functioned as a small farm; she was also athletically inclined, particularly in basketball and volleyball. The pair met and married in the mid-1950s. In 1958, Gwynn&#x27;s older brother Charles Jr. was born and sometime thereafter, Charles was discharged from the Army. In 1959, Charles decided to move the family west from Tennessee under the belief that doing so would provide additional economic opportunity for a young black family.

===Childhood===
The family&#x27;s first residence in California was a two-bedroom apartment and they had one car, a Chrysler 300. Gwynn&#x27;s favorite meals were Friday dinner because he&#x27;d get to eat fish, and any meals on Saturday and Sunday because that&#x27;s when the whole family was together. Shortly after younger brother Chris was born in late 1964, the family moved to a larger apartment, a second-floor duplex that included a small grass backyard unlike the previous apartment. In the yard, Gwynn and Charles Jr. frequently played basketball games such as &quot;Twenty-one&quot; and &quot;H-O-R-S-E&quot; using a trash can against the building&#x27;s back wall as the basket. Gwynn&#x27;s &quot;big thrill&quot; was regularly going to the store to get RC Cola for his father using the latter&#x27;s borrowed money. On one of these occasions when Gwynn returned from the store with the cola, he was also chewing a wad of gum; his father noticed this and asked Gwynn where the gum came from, and he confessed to shoplifting the gum. His father responded by taking Gwynn downstairs to a bush out in front of the apartment building, and pulling a switch from it to punish him with.

Gwynn&#x27;s favorite time of year was the annual summer family vacation to go visit his grandparents in Tennessee for six days, traveling in the family car. He personally liked his paternal grandparents more, but preferred to stay with his maternal grandparents because their residence (where his mother grew up) had acres of open land and a farm, which Gwynn said was &quot;like a paradise&quot;. He gathered eggs from the chicken coop every morning and cooked breakfast with them, and also played baseball using black walnuts that had fallen. Through these visits, Gwynn grew an affinity for his grandmother Callie&#x27;s Southern cooking.

At age nine, Gwynn received a Sting-Ray bike with a banana seat from his parents coupled with the expectation that he was to use it to fetch groceries from the store. Gwynn refused to have a bicycle basket installed, insisting that it was only for &quot;sissies&quot;, so he hauled groceries home using his arms. He was also allowed to use the bike for play; one time while doing so near the family&#x27;s parked car, he crashed the bike into Chris who appeared out of nowhere. Chris bled from his face from hitting the cement, and had to get hospitalized with five stitches. Gwynn&#x27;s parents initially threatened to whip Gwynn upon learning about the incident, but later changed their minds after discussing it with Chris, believing it was impossible for the boys to see each other before the crash.

A few weeks after the bike crash, his parents decided they would move from their apartment and buy a house in nearby Long Beach, a location they chose because of its schools, parks, and youth sports options throughout the year. Gwynn joined a Little League team in Long Beach at the age of nine. When the coach asked him which position he wished to play, Gwynn indicated that he wanted to be the first baseman since he was left-handed, but the coach said that spot was occupied by a returning left-handed player, and instead offered the center fielder position to Gwynn. Gwynn&#x27;s parents were civil servants and tag-team parents. Gwynn&#x27;s father worked at a warehouse from 7:30a.m. to 5:00p.m., and he also coached Pop Warner football and Little League Baseball; his mother worked at the post office from 5:30p.m. to 3:00a.m. His mother and father instilled in him the value of being prepared. He played mostly basketball, then his favorite sport. Gwynn seldom played tennis, but readily defeated his older brother Charles Jr. (who regularly practiced the sport) when challenged.

Gwynn&#x27;s father encouraged his sons to play ball in the makeshift baseball field that he assembled in their backyard. The setup was a narrow strip of grass that was longer than it was wide. Pulling the ball too much resulted in it being lost over the neighbor&#x27;s fence, but left field being short ruled out hitting it to the opposite field. Once the brothers&#x27; supply of wiffle balls was out, they resorted to using a sock rolled in rubber bands, a wad of tape, or a hardened fig from a neighbor&#x27;s tree. Gwynn could pull the ball in his backyard, but he would naturally hit it the other way during regular games. Growing up, he attended Los Angeles Dodgers games and watched his hero, Willie Davis; the Dodgers outfielder had twice as many stolen bases as home runs (398 SB, 182 HR) in his career. Gwynn admired Davis for being black, left-handed, and &quot;aggressive but under control&quot;; he respected Davis&#x27;s work habits as well. Unlike other kids who tracked home run hitters, Gwynn checked the box scores in the newspaper every morning to follow high-average hitters like Pete Rose, George Brett, and Rod Carew. By age thirteen, Gwynn had joined an adult baseball league.

===High school years===
Gwynn attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, a high-profile sports school. In high school, Gwynn considered himself to be &quot;kind of a nerd&quot; and also shy, particularly with girls. His friends often attended parties with drugs and alcohol on Friday nights, but Gwynn abstained from such activities to avoid disappointing his parents and squandering future opportunities. Gwynn worked during the summers. One year, he got a job as a softball coach at Silverado Park after his name was chosen in a lottery drawing for the position; some of his responsibilities included managing the field, painting the foul lines, and picking up trash from the field. Another year, he was on a crew that painted athletic facilities in Long Beach public schools. Gwynn also played summer baseball for the Long Beach Jets (coached by 1964 Olympic high jumper John Rambo) in the Joe DiMaggio Summer League at Blair Field. Gwynn was the center fielder and his younger brother Chris was on the team. One year, Gwynn and the Jets won the local league and advanced to the state tournament in San Rafael of Northern California; they were defeated in the championship game.

He was a two-sport star in basketball and baseball. In his final two years, his Jackrabbits baseball team was a combined 3–25–2 in the league, while his basketball team went a combined 53–6 and twice reached the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF)&#x27;s Southern Section 4A championship game. Gwynn had considered quitting baseball as a senior to concentrate on basketball, but his mother talked him out of it. &quot;She said it might be something down the road and that I might be sorry later if I didn&#x27;t play,&quot; recalled Gwynn.
As a junior, he was the starting point guard on Poly&#x27;s basketball team, which went 30–1 and won the Southern Section 4A title that year. The final was played for more than 10,000 fans at the Long Beach Arena, where Gwynn scored 10 points in the 69–50 victory over Buena of Ventura. His teammates included Michael Wiley, who became a professional player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In Gwynn&#x27;s senior year, Poly was 23–7, and again advanced to the championship round, despite finishing third in the Moore League. Their bid for a second straight title ended with a 57–50 loss to Pasadena. Gwynn averaged 10.3 points and totaled 178 assists for the season, and he was named to the All-CIF Southern Section Second Team. After the season, he switched to baseball, which was already well underway for the year. Despite his shortened season, he earned first-team All-Southern Section honors after batting .563. Poly&#x27;s baseball team&#x27;s struggles taught him to remain focused, continue executing, and stay productive.

Gwynn received scholarship offers to play college basketball but none for college baseball. He also went unselected in the 1977 MLB draft, which Gwynn attributed to his limited playing time. He wanted to play both sports for Cal State Fullerton, which was fine with basketball coach Bobby Dye, but baseball coach Augie Garrido did not believe that an athlete could handle both sports in college. San Diego State basketball coach Tim Vezie wanted Gwynn to commit to two years of basketball before playing baseball. Gwynn also had an offer from Texas Christian University (TCU), but he was told that he would be their first black player in 30 years, which ruled them out from his consideration. He chose to attend SDSU, calling it &quot;the best option I had.&quot;

==College career==

Gwynn was a two-sport star with San Diego State, playing three seasons of baseball and four of basketball. He was a recreation major. He was an All-American outfielder in his final two seasons, when he led the team in hitting. A skilled playmaker in basketball, he set multiple school records for assists. He was the first player in the history of the WAC to earn all-conference honors in basketball and baseball. Gwynn was not allowed to play baseball as a freshman. He was overweight at , and Vezie wanted him to get in shape for the next basketball season.

By the following season in 1979, Gwynn still had not heard from Aztecs baseball coach Jim Dietz about joining the team after the basketball season. However, an opportunity arose after two outfielders riding bicycles were struck by an automobile and injured, leaving Dietz in need of replacements. Freshman shortstop Bobby Meacham, who played against Gwynn in high school, convinced the coach to give Gwynn a chance. Dietz had never seen Gwynn play but contacted him mostly because he trusted Meacham. Vezie by then had been fired, and his successor, Smokey Gaines, allowed Gwynn to play baseball. Were it not for the accident, Gwynn doubted he would have ever played baseball with SDSU. &quot;Knowing what I now do about Coach Dietz ... [h]e&#x27;s too loyal to his athletes to have allowed me to walk over after basketball season and join the team,&quot; remarked Gwynn.

In baseball, Gwynn was primarily a left fielder and designated hitter (DH) at San Diego State. He hit .301 in his first season but said he &quot;stunk defensively.&quot; After his first season of baseball with the Aztecs, Gwynn played collegiate summer baseball for the Boulder Collegians while also enrolling in 10 transferable summer school units at the University of Colorado Boulder. During a game with the Collegians, he tripped while rounding first base trying to stretch a single into a double, and went down in pain having dislocated his ankle. Coach Jim Dietz chose to pop Gwynn&#x27;s ankle back into place, because Dietz believed that having surgery done instead would&#x27;ve harmed Gwynn&#x27;s chances of playing professional baseball; Gwynn was sent home for the remainder of the summer. In 1980, Gwynn hit .423 with six home runs and 29 runs batted in (RBI), and was named third-team All-American by &quot;Baseball News&quot;. The following season, he was a first-team All-American after batting .416 with 11 home runs and 62 RBI. He also was named a first-team All-WAC outfielder. In his three years, he had a career average of .398, and the team went 146–61–4.

Playing basketball, Gwynn set Aztecs basketball records for assists in a game (18), season (221), and career (590). He was twice named to the All-WAC Second Team, and he averaged 8.8 points per game his senior year. Playing point guard developed Gwynn&#x27;s baseball skills, as the dribbling strengthened his wrists—avoiding what he called &quot;slow bat syndrome&quot;—and basketball taught him to be quick, which improved his baserunning. He could dunk a basketball, though he was unable to palm the ball with his small hands. He had a quick first step in either sport and was able to run in 6.7 seconds.

Gwynn indirectly received exposure from scouts who were interested in Meacham, who would become a first-round pick in 1981. Gwynn had started the baseball season late in 1981, as the basketball team was still competing, and some scouts had already seen enough of Meacham and stopped following SDSU. Also on the Aztecs baseball team was Casey McKeon, son of Jack McKeon, who was the San Diego Padres general manager at the time. Given his son&#x27;s involvement, McKeon often went to Aztec games. He was initially interested in seeing Meacham but became more impressed by Gwynn after seeing him at an exhibition game between the Aztecs and Padres; Gwynn had re-joined the baseball team five days earlier.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues (1981–1982)===
The Padres selected Gwynn in the third round of the 1981 MLB draft with the 58th pick. The Padres scout credited for discovering Gwynn was Cliff Ditto from the Los Angeles area; his scouting report was the only one the Padres had for Gwynn. The Houston Astros had also scouted Gwynn and wanted to select him, but since the team had no picks in the first two rounds, their first possible chance was in the third round after the Padres&#x27; third round pick when Gwynn was taken. He had attended Padres games while he was at San Diego State and thought they had the &quot;ugliest uniforms I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Those uniforms again came to his mind after he was drafted. McKeon had wanted to take Gwynn with the Padres&#x27; first pick, but they chose two other players in the first round and another in the second. McKeon threatened to walk out of the draft room had San Diego not selected him in the third. Later that day, Gwynn was also selected by the San Diego Clippers in the 10th round of the NBA draft. According to then-Clippers general manager Ted Podleski, Gwynn might have gone as high as the sixth round if he was not a baseball player. Gwynn chose to play baseball with the Padres in what he termed a &quot;practical&quot; decision, citing his physical battles pushing and fighting against larger players, such as Charles Bradley, while playing WAC basketball.

Coming out of college, Gwynn was initially worried about the transition from using an aluminum bat to a wooden one, but his concerns were allayed once he found a bat comparable to the size he had used with the Aztecs. He led the Northwest League with a .331 batting average, and added 12 homers and 17 stolen bases in just 42 games for the Walla Walla Padres, San Diego&#x27;s Class A minor league affiliate, earning him the league&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) award in 1981. In his professional debut on Opening Day, Gwynn went 3-for-5 with a triple, a walk, two steals, two runs, and a strikeout. His salary in Walla Walla was $500 per month. In the summer of 1981, Gwynn was promoted to the Padres&#x27; Reno affiliate but was unable to travel there due to the ongoing air traffic controller strike, so he got sent to Amarillo instead. He finished the season in Class AA with the Amarillo Gold Sox for 23 games, while batting .462.

===San Diego Padres (1982–2001)===

====1982–1983====
Gwynn participated at spring training with San Diego in 1982 and hit .375. However, the Padres were set in the outfield with veterans Gene Richards, Ruppert Jones, and Sixto Lezcano, and Gwynn began the season with the Hawaii Islanders of Triple-A. He was batting .328 in 93 games with the Islanders when he was promoted and debuted for the Padres on July 19, 1982. He started in center field against the Philadelphia Phillies in place of a slumping Jones. In his fourth at-bat, Gwynn got his first major league hit—a double—against reliever Sid Monge. Pete Rose, the Phillies&#x27; first baseman who later became the major-league all-time hit leader, told Gwynn, &quot;Congratulations. Don&#x27;t catch me in one night.&quot; Five weeks later against Pittsburgh, Gwynn injured his left wrist after diving for a ball and hitting the hard artificial turf at Three Rivers Stadium, and missed three weeks while on the disabled list (DL). He finished his rookie season batting .289 in 54 games, the only season he hit below .300. His 15-game hitting streak was the longest on the team that season.

Gwynn reinjured his wrist playing winter ball in Puerto Rico and started 1983 on the DL. He missed the first two months of the season and struggled after his return. His average fell as low as .229 by July 29. He asked his wife to record the games before a road trip, and he began using video recording to review his at-bats. After looking at the tapes and correcting his swing during batting practice, Gwynn became a believer in using video. He said video &quot;turned around my career&quot;. He heated up to a .309 average for his shortened season, and his 25-game hitting streak set a Padres record. For the second straight season, San Diego finished with a .500 record.

====1984–1986====
In his first full season in 1984, San Diego won their first NL West title. Gwynn was elected to start in his first All-Star Game, and he won his first batting title with a .351 average along with 71 RBIs, and 33 stolen bases; he had only 23 strikeouts in 606 at-bats. He finished third in the balloting for the National League MVP behind Chicago Cubs winner Ryne Sandberg and runner-up Keith Hernandez of the New York Mets. He had 213 hits, breaking the Padres record of 194 set by Gene Richards in 1980. Gwynn hit second in the Padres batting order behind Alan Wiggins, and benefited from the higher number of fastballs opposing pitchers threw in response to the speedy leadoff hitter (70 SB) being on base. Wiggins&#x27; speed also disrupted the defense and opened up holes that Gwynn was able to exploit for hits. He hit above .400 when Wiggins was on base ahead of him. &quot;Anybody can hit a fastball&quot;, said Gwynn. The duo was one of the biggest reasons behind San Diego&#x27;s success. They could score fast with Wiggins getting on first, stealing second, and Gwynn singling him home. Gwynn batted .410 with runners in scoring position, and manager Dick Williams said his records indicated that Gwynn had the best &quot;RBI percentage&quot; on the team.

In the playoffs, the Padres won the first NL pennant in its team history, defeating the Cubs in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) before losing the World Series to the Detroit Tigers. Gwynn batted .368 in the NLCS, and his one-out single in the bottom of the ninth in Game 4 set up Steve Garvey&#x27;s game-winning homer. Gwynn hit .263 (5-for-19) in the World Series, and flied out to Tigers left fielder Larry Herndon for the final out of the fall classic. During the offseason, Gwynn took less money to stay in San Diego by signing a six-year, $4.6 million contract with the Padres. Still, his new salary of more than $500,000 salary for 1985 represented a sizable raise over the $180,000 he would have received, or the $100,000 he had received in 1984.

Wiggins entered drug rehab in 1985 and was traded later in the season to the Baltimore Orioles, resulting in Gwynn seeing fewer fastballs and more breaking balls. Gwynn said it took him a month to realize the opponents&#x27; strategy change and a while to adjust. His average was under .300 into June when he got hot but then sprained his wrist on June 27 in a collision with Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia. Still, Gwynn was named with seven other Padres to the 1985 All-Star Game. San Diego then led the NL West but finished the season in third place. After Gwynn&#x27;s wrist healed, he hit .339 after the start of August and finished the season with the fourth-highest average in the NL (.317). Without an adequate replacement for Wiggins batting leadoff, his RBIs fell to 46.

Gwynn played a career-high 160 games in 1986, when he led NL position players in Wins Above Replacement (WAR). He scored 100 runs for the first time and tied for the NL lead (107). He set then-career highs for doubles (33), homers (14), and steals (37). On September 20 against the Houston Astros, he had four hits and became the fifth NL player that century with five stolen bases in a game. He finished third in hitting (.329) after leading for most of the season. He hit only .296 in September, and he regretted paying too much attention to Tim Raines and Steve Sax, who were previously trailing him. Gwynn won his first Gold Glove after leading the league in total chances and putouts (337). His 19 outfield assists that year—one short of the league-high—were highlighted by the three Mets he threw out in one game.

====1987–1989====
Despite his financial problems and bankruptcy in 1987, Gwynn remained unfazed on the field. In the Padres&#x27; home opener, Marvell Wynne, Gwynn, and John Kruk hit back-to-back-to-back homers to start the game for San Diego, the first time an MLB team had led off a game with three consecutive home runs. In June, he had 44 hits in 93 at-bats for a .473 average, the best month in his career. He finished fifth among NL outfielders voting for the All-Star Game, which Padres manager Larry Bowa called &quot;a joke&quot;. However, Gwynn was unperturbed: &quot;People put a premium on the home-run hitters. I know what I am. I&#x27;m a contact hitter and not a home-run hitter ... I&#x27;m not going to try to be something I&#x27;m not.&quot;

That year, Gwynn had two five-hit games, the first of eight in his career. He won his second batting title that season after hitting .370. It was the highest average in the NL since Stan Musial hit .376 in 1948. He also stole 56 bases and became the first NL player to hit .370 and steal 50 bases. Gwynn never went more than eight at-bats without recording a hit, and he had a hit in 82 percent of the 155 games he batted. His 218 hits also led the league. He led the league in WAR, and was second in stolen bases, triples (13), and on-base percentage (OBP) (.447); he also ranked fourth in runs scored (119) and 10th in walks with a career-high 82. His average, hits, runs, and triples were all Padre records. Although he only hit seven homers, Gwynn was second in the league with 26 intentional walks. He finished eighth in the voting for NL MVP but resisted altering his hitting style to hit more home runs to earn more respect. The same year, Wade Boggs in the American League (AL) won his fourth batting title in five years, hitting .363 with 24 home runs, but finished ninth in MVP voting. Fox Sports baseball writer Rob Neyer believes that Gwynn may have been MLB&#x27;s best player during his 1987 season, and sportswriter Joe Posnanski called Gwynn&#x27;s 1987 season &quot;otherworldly&quot; while opining that &quot;he probably should have won the MVP award&quot;.

During the last three months of the 1987 season, a finger on Gwynn&#x27;s left hand would lock when he gripped a bat. It would open barely enough for the bat to slip out of his grip. He had surgery on the hand during spring training the following season. Early in 1988, Gwynn was on the DL for 21 days after spraining his thumb after tripping rounding first base in Pittsburgh. He hit .246 as late as July 2, 1988, but won the batting title with a .313 average. Gwynn batted .406 in July and .367 in the last 73 games of the season. He denied that injuries impacted his hitting, instead attributing his struggles to &quot;mechanics&quot;. He struck out a career-high 40 times that season, while his .313 average was the lowest to win a title in NL history. In the 112 years before, only nine batting leaders hit below .330, the previous low being Larry Doyle&#x27;s .320 in 1915. For the 25 years ending in 1988, batting leaders averaged .343. Gwynn hit 119 points higher with runners on base (.382) than with the bases empty (.263), the largest differential in the NL that season. He tied Pedro Guerrero for the highest average with runners in scoring position (.371). During the season, McKeon replaced Bowa as Padres manager and moved Gwynn from right to center field. Gwynn also reached 1,000 career hits on April 22 with a single off Nolan Ryan of the Astros. On September 17, he passed Dave Winfield as the Padres&#x27; career leader in hits with his 1,135th off Jim Acker of the Atlanta Braves.

In the 1989 season, he was hurting in September while in the race for another batting title. His right toe made it hard for him to put a shoe on, and his left Achilles tendon was sore, preventing him from pushing off properly when swinging. His batting average dropped, but he insisted on playing until his manager forced him to sit out for two games. The Padres were battling the San Francisco Giants for the division title in September, but they were eliminated from contention the game before hosting a season-ending three-game series with the Giants. Although the race for the division was over, Gwynn was still trailing San Francisco&#x27;s Will Clark for the batting title, .333 to .332. Gwynn went 3-for-4 in the last two games, finishing at .336 to claim his third title. &quot;I lost to the best&quot;, Clark said. Gwynn became the first NL player to win three consecutive batting titles since Musial (1950–1952). In December 1989, Gwynn fell to being the seventh-highest-paid Padre at $1 million a year and questioned the team&#x27;s salary structure. He felt he deserved more money than players like Jack Clark, who signed a lucrative deal with the New York Yankees before being traded to San Diego. Gwynn&#x27;s request for a contract renegotiation was denied.

====1990–1992====

Gwynn in 1990 was accused by some teammates of being selfish and caring more about his batting average than winning. First baseman Jack Clark, most notably, stated that Gwynn should be swinging with runners in scoring position instead of bunting and protecting his batting average. Clark did not approve of Gwynn bunting with runners on first and second with nobody out, believing he was trying to either bunt for a hit or get credit for a sacrifice if he failed. On the other hand, Gwynn felt he was advancing runners for the team&#x27;s &quot;game changers&quot;—Clark and Joe Carter—which was consistent with McKeon&#x27;s style. Gwynn said he resorted to bunting to advance the runners because he was not a good pull hitter. &quot;No one bothers Tony Gwynn because he wins batting titles, but the Padres finish fourth or fifth every year&quot;, said Clark, who also stirred controversy on his prior teams. Teammates Mike Pagliarulo and Garry Templeton sided with Clark, who also said Gwynn was &quot; overweight&quot;, leading to his lower stolen base total.

Stung by the criticism, Gwynn was miserable the rest of the season and became withdrawn and distrustful among his teammates. Conscious of being perceived as selfish, he altered his hitting style by attempting to pull the ball to move runners in situations where he would normally hit to the opposite field. Rumors that he might be traded affected his play. In September, Gwynn was upset when a figurine of his likeness was hanging in effigy in the Padres&#x27; dugout, and race became an issue due to the undercurrent of lynchings being evoked with Gwynn being African-American and Clark being Caucasian. The Padres said a groundskeeper was responsible, but Gwynn believed it was a cover-up. Clark denied any involvement. After breaking his right index finger mid-month in Atlanta while trying to make a catch at the wall, Gwynn missed the final 19 games of the season. He left the team for the season to avoid contact with the media and teammates. He was further upset that neither management nor other teammates came to his defense at the time. He later regretted saying he wanted to avoid his teammates in general instead of being more specific which ones he was referring to. &quot;It just involved one great guy, and that&#x27;s Tony Gwynn, and anything they want to say about Tony Gwynn is going to be news. It got all blown out of proportion&quot;, Carter said. Gwynn countered, &quot;I&#x27;ve been doing the same things my whole career, playing the same way. Now, why is it an issue? Because Jack Clark says it is.&quot; Gwynn finished the season batting .309, ranking sixth in the league but the lowest average of any full season in his career; he had entered the season with a .332 career average. However, his 72RBI that season were a then-career high. He also began experiencing soreness and swelling in his left knee. The cartilage under his kneecap was wearing out, which doctors attributed to his playing basketball and baseball year-round for seven years from high school through college.

Gwynn and Clark said they could continue to play together, but Clark signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent in the offseason. Gwynn felt appreciated after he was signed to a three-year contract extension for $12.25 million, including a $1 million signing bonus. McKeon praised Gwynn, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s one of the most unselfish players I&#x27;ve ever managed. In &#x27;89, when he was going for a batting title, he was giving himself up to move runners along.&quot; Dick Williams, who managed Gwynn from 1982 through 1985, said of Gwynn, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a player who worked harder, cared more and was more deserving of his awards.&quot; Clark continued criticizing him, which Gwynn attributed to jealousy. In response, Gwynn knocked Clark: &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about him walking 104 times, being a No. 4 hitter. Let&#x27;s talk about his not flying on team flights. Let&#x27;s talk about him getting booted out of games on a called strike three.&quot; In 1992, Gwynn sympathized with Clark, who filed for bankruptcy after bad loans by his agent. &quot;I really appreciated the things Tony said about my situation&quot;, Clark said.
Gwynn, in 1991, passed Gene Richards as the Padres&#x27; all-time leader in steals and triples. He reached a season-high batting average of .373 in June, and late in the month was among the league leaders in RBIs. His left knee began causing him problems before the All-Star break, and he had been suffering from shin splints as well. He injured his left knee on August 5 at Houston while sliding into second base. He played through the injury, missing just one game over the next weeks. He had fluid drained from his knee on August 31 and played just once in the week that followed while surgery was discussed. He attempted to finish the season but lasted just five more games. He underwent arthroscopic surgery to clean out the knee and smooth the articular cartilage, missing the final 21 games of the year. Gwynn led the league in hitting at .326 late in August and had enough plate appearances already to qualify for the title, when many people—including his father and Padres announcer Jerry Coleman—advised him to take care of his knee and secure another batting title. However, Gwynn was still reeling from Clark&#x27;s criticism of his conditioning and selfishness and wanted to continue playing. Gwynn finished the season ranked third in batting at .317, behind Terry Pendleton (.319) and Hal Morris (.318). After the All-Star Game, he hit just .243.

In 1992, Gwynn ended the season on the DL for the third straight year. On September 8, in a 16-inning game in San Francisco, he had the third five-hit game of his career and his first since 1987. In the same game, he sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and played just four more innings the rest of the season. He required arthroscopic surgery on the knee. Gwynn met Hall of Famer Ted Williams for the first time during the 1992 All-Star Game, which was hosted at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (known later as Qualcomm Stadium). At the time, Gwynn considered himself to be an accomplished hitter, content to hit singles and doubles. Williams called Gwynn &quot;a big guy&quot; and challenged him to hit for more power. He chided Gwynn for using a &quot;toothpick&quot; for a bat. His encounter with Williams spurred him to think more about hitting, and he began to hit for more power. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a home run guy, never been a big RBI guy, but from that point to the end of my career, I was much better at it&quot;, said Gwynn.

====1993–1997====
Gwynn entered the 1993 season anticipating that he would be better after his past two surgeries, and he had also incorporated Williams&#x27; advice into his swing. The Padres lost 101 games that year for the team&#x27;s worst record during his career. They finished last in the division, behind even the Colorado Rockies, who were an expansion team in their inaugural season. San Diego that season had traded most of its star players—including Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, and Tony Fernández—in fire sales. Gwynn finished with a .358 average, the then-second best average of his career, but Colorado&#x27;s Andrés Galarraga won the title at .370. Gwynn batted .587 on pulled balls, compared to his .315 in 1991 before Williams&#x27; pointers. He was affected early in the season by a sprained thumb, but he hit .400 (76-for-190) over the second half of the season. On June 10, Gwynn missed the opportunity to hit for the cycle when manager Jim Riggleman replaced him in the seventh inning of a 14–2 rout against the Dodgers after he had hit for a home run, double, and triple in his three prior at-bats. Riggleman was not aware that he needed a single to complete the cycle. Still wary of Clark&#x27;s earlier criticism that he was selfish, Gwynn did not contest his removal, which angered his manager when he found out after the game. On August 4 against the Giants, Gwynn had the only six-hit game of his career. He might have gone 7–for–7 if not for an excellent play at first base by Will Clark. Gwynn recorded his 2,000th hit with a single off Colorado lefthander Bruce Ruffin on August 6. His last game was September 5 before undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clear &quot;loose bodies&quot; from his knee. It was the fourth consecutive year his season ended early, and the third straight season it was due to left knee surgery.

After the season, Gwynn&#x27;s father, Charles, died of heart problems at the age of 57. Two days earlier, Charles had argued with Gwynn that he should leave San Diego, questioning the Padres&#x27; commitment to winning. Gwynn eventually concluded, &quot;No, I like it here, I should stay.&quot; He contemplated leaving baseball after his father&#x27;s death; however, he recalled his father always telling him to &quot;never be a quitter, work hard&quot;.

For years during Gwynn&#x27;s career, media preseason predictions declared that &quot;this season&quot; he would become the first player to hit .400 since Williams in 1941. Relatively healthy in 1994, Gwynn batted .394, his career-high and the highest in the National League since Bill Terry hit .401 in 1930. He also had a league-leading .454 OBP. From April 22 through the 24 against Philadelphia, he had eight consecutive hits and reached base nine straight times, tying Padres records held by Winfield and Bip Roberts, respectively. Gwynn was batting .383 at the All-Star break; however, talk of a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) was looming, and he wanted to get to .400 before that date. At the 1994 All-Star Game in front of the national television audience, Gwynn scored the game-winning walkoff run for the NL during the bottom of the 10th inning to seal the 8–7 victory, sliding into home plate from first base to barely beat the throw and tag following a Moises Alou double. He hit .423 over 28 games in the second half, and heated up to .475 through 10 games in August, when the season ended prematurely on August 11 due to the baseball strike. He was 6-for-9 in the last two games and 3-for-5 in the eventual finale, falling short of batting .400 by three hits. Fans were awaiting an end to the strike and for Gwynn to resume his quest for .400, but hopes of the season restarting were dashed when the World Series was canceled. He later commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not unhappy or bitter that the strike came. I look at it this way: I would have sooner fell short due to the strike than if I would have hit .400 and then the strike came. Then people would have thought I would have collapsed down the stretch, instead of being at .390 when the strike came and being so close.&quot; That year, Gwynn pulled the ball with greater regularity. He was 10th in the league with a slugging percentage of .568, which was also his career-high. His 12 homers in 419 at-bats was a higher rate than in 1986, when he hit a then-career high 14 homers in 642 at-bats. He won another batting title (.368) in 1995. For the second straight year, he did not go longer than two games without a hit. He led the NL in batting with runners in scoring position (.394), and he had a then-career high 90 RBI. Gwynn hit in 15 straight games in July, his longest hitting streak since his 18-game run in 1988. He hit 28-for-65 (.431) with 15 RBI during the streak. Although he missed batting .400 in 1994, he batted .403 during a 179-game stretch between July 3, 1993, and May 9, 1995.

In 1996, the Padres won the division with 91 wins and returned to the playoffs for the first time in 12 years. Gwynn called it the worst injury season of his career. His hurt heel in April was diagnosed as an inflamed bursa sac. He tried multiple shoes to alleviate the pain, and was on the DL for a month at midseason. He played the rest of the year in pain, and surgery after the season revealed a 40 percent tear (or fraying) at the top of his right Achilles&#x27; tendon. On September 28, Gwynn hit a patented single between third base and shortstop to score two runs and break a 2–2 tie in the eighth against the Dodgers, clinching a playoff berth for the Padres. He called it his most memorable regular-season hit until his 3,000th career hit. Gwynn&#x27;s brother, Chris, also played for San Diego that season and hit the game-winner in the season finale in extra innings, completing a three-game sweep over Los Angeles to win the division. Chris had only hit .169 entering the game, and some fans were convinced that he was on the team only because of his brother. Earlier in the week, Gwynn had criticized fans for booing his brother. &quot;Today, I&#x27;m just Chris Gwynn&#x27;s anonymous brother,&quot; said Gwynn, who also won his seventh batting title that day. Although he was four plate appearances (PAs) short of the minimum to qualify for the title, MLB Rule 10.22(a)—which also came to be known as the Tony Gwynn rule—allowed hitless at-bats to be added to his record to qualify. Gwynn, who batted .353 in 498 PAs, would have dropped to .349 with the extra at-bats, still five points better than second-place Ellis Burks&#x27; .344. In the postseason, the Padres were swept by the St. Louis Cardinals in the opening round.
In April 1997, Gwynn signed a three-year contract extension for $12.6 million. Recovered from his Achilles problem the year before, he was able to plant his front foot to pull inside pitches. That season, Gwynn reached career highs with 17 home runs and 119 RBIs. He batted .372 for his eighth batting title, second only to Ty Cobb (12). He led the NL in hits for the seventh time, tying Rose&#x27;s record. The 220 hits led the majors and was a new team record. Gwynn led the majors with a .459 average with runners in scoring position. In his 16th season, he became the oldest major leaguer at age 37 to reach 100 RBIs for the first time. His RBI total was the second-highest in club history. He also hit a Padres record of 49 doubles, ranking second in the league, and established a career-best of 324 total bases. On June 7, Gwynn hit his 100th career home run off of Donne Wall of Houston, becoming the third Padre to reach the mark. He was batting .402 on July 14, the latest in the season he had ever been at .400. However, his average tailed off as he suffered from kidney stones later in the month, and he also battled problems with his left knee that required postseason surgery.

====1998–2001====
In 1998, Gwynn batted .321 and helped the Padres win a franchise-record 98 games and their second pennant. He began the year with his first-ever opening-day home run, and continued his trend of hitting for more power with 16 homers for the season. The Padres reached the World Series in 1998 after defeating Houston and Atlanta in the playoffs. However, the Padres lost to the Yankees in a four-game sweep, despite Gwynn hitting .500 (8-for-16) in the series; the rest of the team batted only .203. Gwynn hit a home run off the second-deck facade in the opening game at Yankee Stadium against pitcher David Wells, which he called his favorite hit and highlight of his career. &quot;That&#x27;s the biggest game in the world, a World Series game. And the fact that it was in New York in Yankee Stadium. I&#x27;ll remember that forever&quot;, he proclaimed.

Calf injuries forced Gwynn to miss 44 games in the first half of 1999. At the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park in Boston, he escorted Williams to the mound, and steadied his friend in throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. It was Gwynn&#x27;s most memorable All-Star moment in his career. As he approached 3,000 career hits in July, two unidentified Padres said there was too much focus on reaching the milestone. Additionally, Jim Leyritz, after being traded from the Padres to the Yankees, said Gwynn lacked the &quot;intangibles&quot; of a team player. In the next game in San Diego, Padres fans gave Gwynn a standing ovation after he was removed for a pinch runner following his 2,994th hit. He approached 3,000 hits on the road, first playing in a series against the Cardinals. On August 4, he collected three hits, including a grand slam, to reach 2,998 hits, receiving a standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd after each hit. The following day, Gwynn collected hit number 2,999 in the same game that the Cardinals&#x27; Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run. Gwynn got his 3,000th hit on August 6 with a single in the first inning off Montreal Expos pitcher Dan Smith. He had four hits in the game. His 2,000th hit was also on August 6, which is also the birthday of Gwynn&#x27;s mother. He was the 11th player to collect all 3,000 hits with one team. George Brett of the Kansas City Royals and Robin Yount of the Milwaukee Brewers had been last to achieve the milestone with a single team in 1992. Gwynn&#x27;s chase was prolonged by a left calf injury that season which sent him to the DL twice, forcing him to miss 44 games. He reached 3,000 in 2,284 games, the third-fewest games among the 22 players to reach the mark behind Ty Cobb (2,135) and Nap Lajoie (2,224). No player born after 1900 got there in fewer games or at-bats (8,874) than Gwynn.
Gwynn, who turned 40 in 2000, had a left knee injury that required his knee to be drained seven times before he underwent season-ending surgery. He was limited to playing just 36 of the Padres&#x27; first 71 games, and he started only 26 games in right field. He batted .408 from May 19 to June 23 to raise his average from .196 and finish the season at .323. Gwynn had microfracture surgery performed on his knee, which involved tiny holes being created to promote cartilage growth.

The Padres bought out their $6 million option on Gwynn for 2001, paying him $2 million instead, and he became a free agent for the first time. Gwynn received offers from a few different teams, and he was pressured by his son Tony Jr. to sign with a team that had a strong chance of winning a World Series championship, which included the Cleveland Indians. After weeks of negotiation that were at times bitter, Gwynn re-signed with the Padres for 2001, agreeing to a one-year, $2 million contract with a chance to earn another $3.7 million in performance incentives. However, he was hampered that season by problems to his right leg, which had been his &quot;good leg&quot;, and was limited to just 17 games on the field. In the first half of the season, he missed 64 games due to a right hamstring that resulted in two stints on the DL. After returning, he began having problems with his right knee. He was limited to pinch-hitting duties and started only one game after mid-July due to a torn meniscus in the right knee. Gwynn formally announced on June 28 that he would retire at the end of the season, and subsequently received an ovation at each stadium the Padres visited. He was honored as a non-playing squad member at the 2001 All-Star Game. During the game, he and Cal Ripken, who had announced his retirement nine days before Gwynn, were presented the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award by Commissioner Bud Selig. On October 6, 2001, at Qualcomm Stadium, Gwynn had a pinch-hit RBI double off Gabe White of Colorado for the final hit of his career. He considered starting the next day in the final game of the season, but he was not confident he could handle a fly ball. In his final appearance, he pinch hit in the ninth inning, grounding out to shortstop; earlier in the same game, teammate Rickey Henderson joined Gwynn in the 3,000 hit club. Although he was limited to only 112 plate appearances, Gwynn finished the season with a .324 average, his 19th consecutive season batting at least .300.

==Player profile==
===Batting style===
Gwynn was an aggressive hitter who was able to expand his hitting zone and frequently hit bad balls that were out of the strike zone. He rarely struck out and generally did not draw many walks. His philosophy was to &quot;see the ball and react&quot;. He was less concerned with getting a hit in a particular at-bat and was more focused with being comfortable at the plate, having a fluid swing, and making solid contact. Over the course of the season, he figured it would result in success. Gwynn was known for his pitch recognition and ability to adjust his hitting based on defensive alignments, using his peripheral vision to anticipate plays. He would identify gaps in the defense based on where fielders were positioned, and then wait for a pitch which allowed him to hit the ball where he wanted. Gwynn particularly enjoyed hitting with a runner on first base because it meant the second baseman or shortstop had to play closer to second base to prepare for a double play or stolen base attempt, thereby opening a larger gap between infielders that Gwynn was more easily able to exploit. Gwynn&#x27;s eye and pitch recognition also contributed to a low amount of times being hit by a pitch in his career (24) because he was usually able to dodge incoming pitches quickly enough.
Among Gwynn&#x27;s primary strengths was his patience in allowing the ball to reach the strike zone before starting his swing. His bats were as small as anyone used during his career, and their lightness allowed him to wait longer before committing to his swing; he was rarely fooled by a pitch. According to Adam Dunn, Gwynn was the only left-handed batter who could successfully hit Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson&#x27;s slider. Gwynn started with a 34-inch, 32-ounce aluminum bat in college. As a junior, he had to replace it after it got dented, and came across a 32-inch, 31-ounce model that was more to his liking. At his first minor league stop at Walla Walla, the shortest bat they had was 34 inches. To Gwynn&#x27;s surprise, he uncharacteristically started hitting home runs. On their first road trip to Eugene, Oregon, he acquired a couple of 32-inch bats that he could better handle. In the first 12 years of his MLB career, Gwynn used a 32½-inch, 31-ounce bat. In his final eight years, he employed a 33-inch, 30½-ounce bat. Gwynn&#x27;s preferred bat material was wide-grain ash wood. Gwynn wanted his wooden bats light like his aluminum ones in college. Instead of having the barrel of his bats shaved, as many batters do, he had them &quot;cupped&quot;, with the end of the barrel hollowed out like the bottom of a wine bottle. His small hands required that he use thin-handled bats. His bat control made him a good hit-and-run batter, although some former teammates complained he would swing for a hit even when a player was trying to steal, depriving his teammate of a stolen base.

Gwynn was able to hit the ball to all fields, but liked to hit balls the opposite way to the left, between third base and shortstop. He dubbed it the &quot;5.5 hole&quot;, since baseball scorekeeping designates third base using a 5 and shortstop with a 6. Gwynn preferred an outside pitch, waiting as long as possible and using his strong wrists to quickly hit the ball. He was not considered a home run hitter, reaching double-figures just five times, but he was a gap hitter with power to drive hits between outfielders. Opposing outfielders typically played him deep. Gwynn became a complete hitter after following Ted Willams&#x27; advice to drive inside pitches instead of finessing them, which Gwynn learned he could do without sacrificing his average. He initially thought that home runs were &quot;boring&quot;, and he concentrated on his craft of making contact. However, Williams said Gwynn was &quot;wasting an opportunity&quot;, and convinced him to turn on inside fastballs more and capitalize on his strength and power pitchers pitching him inside. Applying Williams&#x27; approach, Gwynn employed the entire field, and was no longer satisfied with mostly hitting to left field. His home runs increased, and he drove in more runs. Forty-three of his 135 career home runs were in his final three full seasons (1997–1999). Gwynn credited his later improvement to Williams and his book &quot;The Science of Hitting&quot;, which he said that he read &quot;four or five times a year&quot;. He and Williams became friends, and they often talked for hours about hitting. Gwynn lamented not having met Williams earlier and possibly adjusting his hitting approach sooner. Gary Sheffield, who was traded to the Padres in 1992, credited Gwynn&#x27;s hitting instruction for raising his season batting average to .330 (up from a previous high of .294) and hence winning a batting title over his teammate Gwynn that year.

===Physique===
Gwynn&#x27;s physical appearance belied his athleticism. He stood , thick around the middle and thighs. His weight was listed as during his junior year of university, and when he was in the minor leagues in 1981. Even at his athletic prime when he could really run, he weighed around and was considered pudgy. His roly-poly frame was a self-described &quot;body by Betty Crocker&quot;, a reference to the food product brand. Towards the end of his breakout season in 1984, he conceded that his &quot;extra weight hasn&#x27;t helped me. My bat&#x27;s slower than it has been all year.&quot; At the time, he attributed his weight gain to soft drinks: &quot;It&#x27;s killing me. It&#x27;s always been a weakness. I&#x27;ve gotta cut down on the soda pop.&quot; Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined in 1993 that Gwynn&#x27;s &quot;deceptive&quot; looks and failing to &quot;look the part&quot; contributed to his regularly being overlooked in the voting for league MVP.

Gwynn was sensitive about his weight, sometimes getting angry when a reporter discussed or asked about it. His knee injuries over his career prompted the Padres organization, media, and fans to question his weight, conditioning, and eating habits. However, he rejected the notion that his weight led to his injuries. Gwynn contended that his weight was only a topic when he was struggling, and not when he was performing. He also believed that the criticism stemmed mainly from his not fitting people&#x27;s profile of what an athlete should look like. He said he had &quot;a football player&#x27;s body&quot;, with his father, grandfather and brothers also being big. Gwynn said his hitting style put a lot of torque on his knees. He started experiencing problems with his legs in 1986, when he suffered from shin splints. In his career, he had 13 operations, including eight involving his knees. Padres hitting coach Merv Rettenmund blamed the fields at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, and Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati (which he said were &quot;like cement&quot;) for causing extreme swelling on Gwynn&#x27;s left knee which necessitated draining gallons of cartilage liquid. Citing discussions with people in the sports medical community, San Diego sportswriter Tom Krasovic believed that the health problems on Gwynn&#x27;s legs caused by the heavy bodyweight load were an obstacle to greater success; Krasovic posited that if Gwynn had sustained his lower early career weight, he would&#x27;ve challenged Pete Rose&#x27;s career hits record. Limited by injuries, he played over 135 games just once in his final 11 seasons. Towards the end of his career, Gwynn had to have his knee drained twice per week to be in a condition to play. Gwynn used to run a great deal to keep in shape, but his last five years were mostly limited to working out in the gym. His actual weight is generally thought to have been under-reported during the latter part of his career, when it was officially listed between .

===Base stealing and fielding===
Gwynn was a leading base stealer in the first half of his career. He was also able to hit triples, reaching double figures four times. As he became slower in later years while his body grew and his injuries mounted, Gwynn would anticipate pitchers&#x27; moves and would sometimes steal bases by breaking for second base before the pitcher started delivering the ball to the hitter. Defensively, he improved considerably and was among the best right fielders at quickly going to the line, cutting the ball off, and throwing to second base. He worked on his defense, constantly checking right field walls in ballparks to study how balls bounced off them. His running ability also helped him on defense. When he entered the majors, Gwynn was not a very good right fielder nor an accurate thrower; in college, he could not even throw the ball from center field to second base without it hopping first. Dave Dravecky, Gwynn&#x27;s teammate in the Padres minor league farm system, said that when Gwynn began his tenure with the Double-A Amarillo Gold Sox, he had &quot;some of the worst throwing mechanics I have ever seen&quot;, and that &quot;his throws from the outfield were limp balloons.&quot; For a long time, he worked on his defense harder than he did his hitting. Early on in Gwynn&#x27;s major league tenure, Clyde McCullough coached Gwynn on fielding every night to strengthen his arm; McCullough repeatedly had Gwynn practice picking up the ball in right field and throwing it to second base. Pitching coach Tom House taught Gwynn the proper grip and throwing motion, and Rob Picciolo hit several ground balls and fly balls to Gwynn. While with the Padres, Gwynn returned to SDSU in the fall every offseason to work on his fielding with an emphasis on foot positioning; he had the assistant coaches hit fly balls to him in the outfield, and he also fielded from the outfield during the team&#x27;s live batting practice. He was most proud of his five Gold Gloves, calling his first one from 1986 his most treasured piece of memorabilia. He became a perennial leader in outfield assists. Although his arm was not particularly strong, Gwynn learned to use his body to build momentum into his throws.

===Work ethic===
Gwynn was hard-working and known for his work ethic and devotion to extra batting practice; on the day of a night game, Gwynn would commence batting practice at the ballpark in the early afternoon between twelve and two o&#x27;clock, and also do batting practice in the batting cage after the game. On the road, he stayed in his hotel room, studying video of his at-bats or playing video games. In an era before laptops and tablets, Gwynn bought his own video equipment and lugged it from town to town along with tapes of his games. His wife traveled with a Betamax video cassette recorder that was the size of a suitcase to tape his at-bats. Still, the Padres were the last MLB team to hire a video coordinator. Gwynn later invested in close to $100,000 in video equipment that he shared with his teammates. Few hitters were as meticulous as Gwynn with his detailed notebooks and videotape, which he spent hours studying. He studied pitchers, watching them in the bullpen and on television or video, to learn their tendencies on every count. Gwynn spent hours watching video and analyzing his swing frame by frame. He had one tape of each team, which included his at-bats against that team in the season. Gwynn also used video to scout umpires, studying the size and shape of each individual umpire&#x27;s strike zone. &quot;Tony taught me more about hitting than I ever taught him&quot;, said Merv Rettenmund, his hitting coach for nine years with the Padres. Gwynn was also not averse to lending advice to opponents, as Hall of Fame player Todd Helton remarked how Gwynn guided him during his second year with the Colorado Rockies, about the ideal way to look for the ball being thrown by the pitcher; similarly, after Gwynn&#x27;s former teammate John Kruk was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, when the Padres and Phillies faced each other and Gwynn reached base with the opportunity to chat with Kruk (who was the first baseman), Gwynn offered Kruk verbal scouting reports for new pitchers on Kruk&#x27;s NL East divisional opponents. Gwynn was also involved in the Padres&#x27; front office affairs as a player; general manager Kevin Towers usually consulted Gwynn for input on potential trades, particularly regarding whether the incoming players&#x27; character would be a good fit for the team. In this capacity, Gwynn researched and interviewed people as necessary.

===Personality===

Gwynn was friendly and accessible to both the media and fans. Even on the occasions that he began an interview tight-lipped, he almost inevitably opened up and offered abundant material. He spoke with a twang in his high-pitched voice, often filled with loud, infectious, childlike laughter; Chris Berman of ESPN called Gwynn&#x27;s laugh the &quot;best sound I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life&quot;. Gwynn possessed a cheerful personality, being friendly towards others while being critical of himself. He considered himself &quot;a good player ... but I knew my place. I was not a game-changer. I was not a dominant player&quot;. His demeanor was even-keeled; Rettenmund said, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t tell if [Gwynn had] gone 3-for-3 or 0-for-3.&quot; Gwynn disliked arrogant people, and was uncomfortable with receiving praise and flattery. Gwynn was unimpressed by other people&#x27;s social standing, wealth, or fame; he received offers to appear on Jay Leno&#x27;s talk show on several occasions and declined all of them. Another time, he was invited to a White House dinner with the President and personally didn&#x27;t care to attend, only obliging at his wife Alicia&#x27;s insistence because she really wanted to go. After his father died in 1993, Gwynn followed his advice and became more outspoken and more of a team leader.

===Views on performance-enhancing drugs===

In 1989, Gwynn first expressed his concerns regarding the increasing usage of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in baseball with Bob Nightengale, the Padres reporter for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In 1995 when very few in the baseball world were outspoken about the matter, Gwynn went public with his opposition to PEDs, and consequently received pushback for doing so from veteran players, including his own teammates. In 2003, Gwynn stated that half of position players in the league used amphetamines; this influenced MLB and the players&#x27; union to add &quot;greenies&quot; (a type of amphetamine) to their list of banned substances in 2005. In 2013, Gwynn also advocated harsher penalties for players caught using PEDs, saying that first-time offenders should have their contracts fully voided instead of merely receiving a 50-game suspension; he believed that such punishments would act as a deterrent to curb PED use around the league. Gwynn however, supported Mark McGwire&#x27;s inclusion into the Hall of Fame, defending his stance with the rationale that the league had &quot;no rules&quot; regarding the use of PEDs throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s; he also said that McGwire &quot;dominated an era&quot; from an on-field standpoint.

==Legacy==
Gwynn was a 15-time All-Star, voted 11 times by fans to be a starter. He accumulated 3,141 hits and a career batting average of .338, and hit .371 in two World Series. Gwynn was often lauded for his artistry at the plate, and his Hall of Fame plaque refers to him as &quot;an artisan with the bat&quot;. ESPN senior writer Jayson Stark labeled Gwynn as &quot;the greatest bat artiste of his generation&quot; and further remarked that Gwynn achieving a .338 lifetime batting average during his era is &quot;the equivalent of bicycling to the moon&quot;. Walter Leavy of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine called Gwynn a &quot;legendary artist&quot;, likening him to Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, and Rembrandt. Leavy referred to the baseball field as Gwynn&#x27;s canvas; his bat as his paintbrush; and his collection of batting titles, All-Star Game selections, and .300+ batting average seasons as his masterpieces. Leavy offered serious consideration of Gwynn as the greatest hitter of all-time. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; senior writer Jason Quick recalled that in his half-hour interview with Gwynn about hitting, the latter was &quot;describing art in the most passionate and beautiful way possible…It was like hearing Picasso talk about art. Beethoven talk about music. And Maya Angelou about poetry.&quot; Tim Kurkjian of ESPN also referred to Gwynn as an artist and said that &quot;his bats were his magic brushes&quot;. &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; sportswriter David Jones stated that Gwynn had &quot;unmatched hitting prowess&quot;, analogizing it to the artistry of musical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and painter Claude Monet; &quot;The Denver Post&quot; sportswriter Troy Renck said that when he encountered Gwynn practicing his hitting, &quot;it was as if I had stumbled into the recording studio to find Mozart.&quot;

Gwynn has the highest adjusted batting average of all-time with .342. Barry Bonds, MLB&#x27;s all-time home run leader, called Gwynn &quot;the best hitter of my generation&quot;; similar sentiments were echoed by ESPN senior writer Jayson Stark, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; sportswriter Berry Tramel, &quot;The Holland Sentinel&quot; sportswriter Dan D&#x27;Addona, and &quot;Esquire&quot; news editor Ben Collins. The Associated Press called him &quot;arguably the best pure hitter of his generation&quot;. Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux, against whom Gwynn had more hits than any other pitcher, called him &quot;the best pure hitter in the game. Easily&quot;. A 1997 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover declared Gwynn as &quot;The Best Hitter Since Ted Williams&quot;.

Gwynn won eight NL batting titles, tying him with Honus Wagner for the league record— second only to all-time Major League leader Ty Cobb, who won 12 AL titles. He finished in the top 10 in batting for 15 consecutive seasons. From 1984 though 1997, he finished in the top five in all but one season (1990), when he missed it by one hit. He recorded five of the 14 highest season averages since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. Gwynn hit above .300 in an NL-record 19 consecutive seasons, exceeded only by Cobb (23). The only season Gwynn failed to bat .300 was his first, when he hit .289 in 54 games. Seven times he batted over .350, the most of any player since World War II. He was just the fourth player in MLB history to hit above .350 for five consecutive years. During that span (1993–1997), which was preceded by his first meeting with Williams, Gwynn averaged .368 while leading the league each season except 1993, when he hit .358 to finish second. The four consecutive NL batting titles he won starting in 1994 had not been matched since Rogers Hornsby won six straight beginning in 1920. Gwynn is the only major leaguer to win four batting titles each in two separate decades, and he batted .351 over his final 10 seasons. Six times he led the NL in both batting average and hits in a season, and five times he reached the 200-hit milestone.

Gwynn placed in the top 10 in voting for the National League MVP seven times in his career, including his only top-five finish in 1984, when he ended up third. In 2005, &quot;Sporting News&quot; ranked Gwynn No. 57 on the list of their 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2019, he was listed at No. 95 on writer Joe Posnanski&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest baseball players, published by &quot;The Athletic&quot;. Using a methodology that combined &quot;career WAR, Hall of Fame status, peak performance, and overall contributions to the game&quot;, ESPN ranked Gwynn No. 44 on its list of &quot;Top 100 MLB players of all time&quot; in 2022. Gwynn&#x27;s significance is muted by the non-traditional measurements in sabermetrics, which tends to favor power and the ability to get on base over batting average. As of 2014, his career 65.0 WAR ranked 34th among outfielders, and a few above him had not yet been voted into the Hall of Fame. While he had an on-base percentage of .388, he was one of only four players to hit .335 or more who did not have career .400 OBP. During his career, he finished in the top-10 in the NL in OBP 10 times. Gwynn&#x27;s run production was another rap against him. He exceeded 90 RBIs in a season just once, when he had 119 in 1997, but he batted .349 in his career with runners in scoring position. &quot;He was devastating with runners in scoring position. Impossible&quot;, former player Eric Davis said.

Gwynn&#x27;s .338 career average ranks 17th all-time. It is the highest of any player who began his career after World War II, and the highest since Williams retired in 1960 with a .344 career average. They are the only ones of the top-17 to play after 1938. Gwynn had the fourth-highest career average of any player with 3,000 hits, and the highest of anyone who was born after 1900. Ever since MLB began tracking the statistic in the early 1990s, Gwynn holds the highest two-strike batting average at .302, which is 40 points above second-place Wade Boggs with .262. Playing in an era when around 75 batters struck out 100 times in a season, Gwynn never struck out more than 40 times a year. He had eight seasons, including six consecutive, when he had fewer than 20 strikeouts. Ten times in his career he finished the season as the hardest player in the NL to strike out. Since 1975, Gwynn is one of only two players that batted .300 in a season while striking out at most once every 25 at-bats. He struck out only 434 times in his whole career, which averaged out to just once every 21 at-bats, or 29 times per 162 games. He became more difficult to strike out later in his career, even as pitchers were growing bigger and stronger and throwing harder. He struck out three times in a game just once in his career, compared to his 297 career three-hit games. Gwynn is one of five players with more than 500 doubles and fewer than 500 strikeouts in their career and the only Hall of Famer since 1965 to finish his career with more doubles than strikeouts. He did not draw many walks, but drew more walks than strikeouts in every season but his rookie year. Though he was not considered a power hitter, opposing managers chose to intentionally walk him nonetheless. He drew 203 intentional passes during his career, which was 50 percent more than his career home run total.

On defense, Gwynn won five Gold Gloves in a six-year span. He stole 318 bases in his career, with a high of 56 and a four-year stretch when he averaged 40. Only four players in MLB history had 300 steals and a career batting average of at least .338; Gwynn was the only one of the four to have played since 1928. He was also just the 10th player to retire with over 3,000 hits and 300 steals. Gwynn in 1999 was the first National League player to reach 3,000 hits since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American Leaguers reached the mark after Brock and before Gwynn; all but one played at least 400 games as a designated hitter. An NL player could not be a DH until 1997, when it was allowed for the few interleague games that were played in AL parks. Just six of Gwynn&#x27;s first 3,000 hits came as a designated hitter. &quot;If you want to do it in the National League, you have to play a position&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s been 20 years since anybody has been able to do it. That tells you how tough it is to do it in this league.&quot;
Gwynn played his entire career for San Diego, a rarity for his generation in an era of free agency, and earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Padre&quot;. &quot;In this era it doesn&#x27;t happen. It takes a little bit of loyalty and luck. It also takes the organization wanting a player to stay with the club&quot;, said Gwynn. He regularly took less money to keep his family rooted in San Diego, which prompted criticism from the MLBPA for his setting a lower market value for other star hitters. Gwynn earned $47 million as player, but never received more than $6.3 million in a season, nor signed a contract valued over $12.25 million. Only 17 MLB players have played at least 20 seasons with one club. He is widely considered the greatest Padres player ever. &quot;There&#x27;s simply no bigger figure in baseball that San Diego&#x27;s ever had&quot;, said former teammate Trevor Hoffman. &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; placed Gwynn No. 1 in their 2014 ranking of the city&#x27;s most influential sports figures. He eschewed the added fame that might have come from playing elsewhere, opting instead to stay with the small-market team that had just seven winning seasons and three playoff appearances during his two decades with them. Gwynn became a civic icon. &quot;It&#x27;s rare, and becoming rarer, that one man is so identified with a franchise and a city as Tony is with San Diego and the Padres&quot;, said political columnist and baseball writer George Will. &quot;Grantland&quot; called him &quot;quite simply, one of the most beloved figures in the history of the city of San Diego.&quot;

Gwynn&#x27;s career paralleled that of Wade Boggs, who also debuted in the major leagues in 1982. Gwynn and Boggs were the premier contact hitters in an era dominated by home runs. They both won multiple batting titles—Gwynn&#x27;s eight to Boggs&#x27;s five—and each won four straight to join Cobb, Hornsby, and Carew as the only players to do so. Gwynn and Boggs each hit over .350 in four straight seasons, the only players to do so since 1931. They joined Brock and Carew as the only players whose careers ended after World War II who finished with 3,000 hits and fewer than 160 home runs. Gwynn, though, had a career slugging percentage of .459, higher than comparable contemporaries such as Boggs, Brock, Carew, and Rose. Among that group, he had more RBIs (1,138) than everyone but Rose.

Nicknamed &quot;Captain Video&quot;, Gwynn used video to study his swing before it became common in baseball. When he began the practice in 1983, MLB teams were years away from using video for scouting. Hoffman said that Gwynn &quot;revolutionized video in baseball&quot;; likewise, Padres manager and general manager Jack McKeon called Gwynn the &quot;father of the video in baseball&quot;. Gwynn prospered during the steroid era of baseball. While other players were transforming their physiques over a single offseason, his body grew pudgier and rounder. Though no longer the base stealer or defensive player he was early in his career, he continued to excel as a hitter. From 1995 through 2001, Gwynn hit a major league leading .350 while power hitters were recording the six highest single-season home run totals in MLB history.
Gwynn was known for his dignity and modesty. He received the 1995 Branch Rickey Award, the 1998 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award and the 1999 Roberto Clemente Award, which &quot;USA Today&quot; called &quot;baseball&#x27;s Triple Crown of humanity and kindness&quot;. Tom Verducci of SI.com called Gwynn &quot;an ambassador not just for the game of baseball but for mankind&quot;. Commissioner Selig called Gwynn &quot;the greatest Padre ever and one of the most accomplished hitters that our game has ever known, whose all-around excellence on the field was surpassed by his exuberant personality and genial disposition in life&quot;. Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux referred to Gwynn as &quot;the greatest ambassador baseball ever had&quot;.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame===

On January 9, 2007, Gwynn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, being selected on 532 out of 545 ballots (97.61%), the seventh highest percentage in Hall of Fame voting history. Upon receiving the news of being elected, Gwynn broke down into tears; his wife Alicia said this was the first time she ever saw him cry. He was relieved that he did not exceed Tom Seaver&#x27;s record of 98.8 percent. Gwynn considered his selection to be validation for the value of contact hitters, who are not as celebrated as power hitters. He was inducted alongside Cal Ripken Jr. on July 29, 2007. Ripken and Gwynn are two of the 46 players in the Hall of Fame who played their entire major league career for only one team. Both were elected almost unanimously in their first year of eligibility.
The Gwynn-Ripken induction weekend set a number of attendance records, which were announced during the ceremony. About 14,000 people visited the Hall of Fame Museum on July 28, a record number for a single-day. Baseball attendance for all games played on July 28 also set a single-day record. The induction ceremony also had the greatest collection of Hall of Famers present, 53 of the 61 living members. A record crowd estimated at 75,000 attended the induction ceremony, shattering the previous record of 25,000 in 1999. A week before his induction, Gwynn appeared on a Wheaties box. Additionally, a giant 1984 replica Tony Gwynn Padres jersey measuring tall and wide was draped on the tower of the San Diego County Administration Building to commemorate the occasion.

===Other honors and tributes===

In 1989, Gwynn was inducted into the San Diego State Aztecs Hall of Fame. In 1997, SDSU&#x27;s baseball facility, Smith Stadium, was extensively renovated with $4 million from Padres owner John Moores. At Moores&#x27;s request, the stadium was renamed Tony Gwynn Stadium.

Gwynn was inducted into the Padres Hall of Fame in 2002, and the team retired his No. 19 in 2004. In 2002, Gwynn was also inducted into the Breitbard Hall of Fame, which honors athletes in San Diego. He was posthumously inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2016.

In 2007, a 9½-foot (), bronze statue of Gwynn was unveiled in the park just beyond Petco Park&#x27;s outfield in an area named Tony Gwynn Plaza. The address of Petco Park is 19 Tony Gwynn Drive.

In 2014, the Mountain West Conference posthumously renamed its baseball Player of the Year Award to the Tony Gwynn Award. In 2015, a segment of Interstate 15 in San Diego County was designated with road signage as &quot;Tony Gwynn Memorial Freeway&quot;. At the 2016 All-Star Game in San Diego, MLB announced that the annual winner of the NL batting title would be known henceforth as the &quot;Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion&quot;. On May 9, 2017, a memorial statue in his honor was unveiled at Lake Poway.

==Post-playing career==
Following his playing career, Gwynn was the baseball head coach at SDSU for 12 seasons, compiling a 363–363 record including three Mountain West Conference championships and three NCAA tournament appearances. During his last season playing for the Padres in 2001, he lobbied for the coaching position after Jim Dietz announced he would step down after the 2002 season. In September 2001, Gwynn signed a three-year contract with his alma mater to be an unpaid volunteer coach for 2002 with a base salary of $100,000 starting in 2003. Gwynn successfully lobbied for the SDSU Aztecs to play the first baseball game at Petco Park after the ballpark opened in 2004. The opponent was the Houston Cougars as a homage to the alma mater of Padres owner John Moores. The game drew a crowd of over 40,000 which set a record for the most attendees at a college baseball game; the Aztecs won.

In the five-year period 2007–2011, the baseball team was penalized with a reduction in scholarships for failing to meet the NCAA&#x27;s Academic Progress Rate. However, Gwynn&#x27;s teams improved their academic performance for the five years ending in 2012. The Aztecs finished .500 or better in five of Gwynn&#x27;s final seven seasons, and they qualified for the NCAA tournament three times in his final six seasons. As the Aztecs&#x27; coach, Gwynn oversaw the development of future major leaguers such as Justin Masterson and Stephen Strasburg, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2009; under Gwynn&#x27;s coaching, Strasburg won the 2009 Dick Howser Trophy, which is awarded annually to the nation&#x27;s best college baseball player. During his coaching tenure, Gwynn attracted uncharacteristically large crowds to games and other events, with most people coming mainly to see Gwynn (rather than the team and players) and possibly seek out his autograph; for this, &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; sportswriter Kirk Kenney said that Gwynn had &quot;rock star status&quot;.

Gwynn&#x27;s bout with cancer caused him to miss time intermittently. He missed the start of the 2012 season after undergoing surgery, and missed games in 2013 while involved with a clinical trial. Days before his death in June 2014, he was given a one-year contract extension although he had been on a leave of absence since March while recovering from cancer treatment.

Gwynn was also a broadcaster, working as a game and studio analyst for ESPN. He also worked postseason games on TBS, and served as an expert analyst for Yahoo! Sports. He also served as color analyst for Padres games on Channel 4 in San Diego and later Fox Sports San Diego.

In May 2012, Gwynn joined a group led by movie producer Thomas Tull to bid on purchasing the Padres from Moores. Gwynn had no financial stake in the group, and Tull withdrew his bid in June.

==Personal life==
Despite being born and raised in Southern California, Gwynn&#x27;s family was from Tennessee, and his voice was characterized as having a &quot;country accent&quot;, &quot;Southern-esque drawl&quot;, and &quot;Arkansas accent&quot;. Gwynn (along with his father) was fond of jazz music; he regularly listened to the genre prior to his baseball games, as well as during his 2010 radiation treatments to soothe his fear, anxiety, and unease. Kirk Whalum and Boney James were among the specific musicians he listened to. When Gwynn and Darrin Jackson were teammates on the Padres between 1989 and 1992, the pair frequently did golfing, fishing, and ping-pong together. Gwynn had vanity plates printed with &quot;TGwynn&quot; and &quot;Padre19&quot;. Gwynn had a fear of flying.

Gwynn married Alicia Cureton on June 6, 1981 at a small Baptist church in Long Beach. Alicia grew up in Southern California after having been born in Beaufort, South Carolina. When Gwynn played for the Padres, she frequently cooked her homemade family fried chicken recipe which the team ate in the clubhouse. When he coached at SDSU, she also cooked some for the fans, among whom it was popular. She later launched a food truck brand called &quot;Gwynn Foods&quot; centered around that recipe. Gwynn was the father of R&amp;B singer Anisha Nicole and major league outfielder Tony Gwynn Jr., whose major league debut (with the Milwaukee Brewers) and first major league hit on July 19, 2006, came 24 years to the day after his father&#x27;s first major league hit—each Gwynn hit a double. Gwynn&#x27;s brother, Chris, was also a major league outfielder. Both Chris and Tony Jr. played with the Padres during their careers. Until Gwynn&#x27;s death he split time between homes in Poway, California, and Fishers, Indiana. During the baseball offseason, Gwynn enjoyed the relative obscurity he had in Indiana where he could live an ordinary life while virtually nobody in public knew or recognized him. He was a fan of the Indiana Pacers professional basketball team, often attending their games; he first got season tickets for them in the mid-1990s, two rows behind the Pacers bench.

In 1997, Gwynn noticed forgeries of his signature on Padres memorabilia in an official team store in Encinitas, California. After alerting MLB management, he assisted the FBI in verifying his signature and identifying fake autographs during their nationwide Operation Bullpen, which hunted down rings of memorabilia forgers.

===Tobacco usage and health problems===

While he was a member of the SDSU Aztecs baseball team, Gwynn started using smokeless tobacco (particularly dipping tobacco) on a regular basis, marking the beginning of his long-term addiction. The Gwynn family&#x27;s legal case asserted that Gwynn was &quot;deluged&quot; with free samples from tobacco company campus sales representatives throughout his college baseball tenure. Over the next three decades, he consumed approximately two tins of the substance per day; the National Institute of Health stated that Gwynn&#x27;s tobacco usage was equivalent to smoking roughly four or five cigarette packs per day.

Gwynn had three procedures to remove noncancerous growths from his parotid gland beginning in 1997. In 2010, he was diagnosed with cancer of a salivary gland and had lymph nodes and tumors from the gland removed; the cancerous location was the spot where Gwynn had placed his dipping tobacco daily for the prior three decades. The operation left his face partially paralyzed on the right side, leaving him unable to smile. Later that year, he underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He was declared cancer-free afterwards, and also regained his ability to smile. Additional surgery was performed in 2012 to remove more cancerous growth and address nerve damage. Gwynn and his family attributed the cancer to his long-term dipping tobacco habit. A few doctors stated that studies had not linked parotid cancer with use of chewing tobacco.

After his playing career ended, Gwynn&#x27;s weight peaked at , and he underwent adjustable gastric banding surgery in 2009, in an attempt to lose weight. He did not closely adhere to the diet, and his weight loss began to stall. In 2010, his weight problem led to a slipped disc in his back that affected a nerve down his leg. He needed a walker before he had the damaged disc removed to cure the pain while walking. Later, he experienced a loss of taste for food during radiation therapy for his cancer. During that time, he was limited to a liquid diet and lost , all of which he regained after he resumed eating solid foods.

===Death===
During another round of cancer treatments in April 2014, a mishap occurred in which Gwynn lost oxygen and was barely able to move. He was sent to rehabilitation to learn how to walk again. On June 16, 2014, Gwynn died at Pomerado Hospital in Poway of complications from his cancer. He was 54 years old. The night before, on Father&#x27;s Day, he had gone into cardiac arrest, and he was rushed from his home to the hospital.

A public memorial service was held for Gwynn at Petco Park on June 26, 2014. The service was attended by 23,229 fans, who heard tributes to Gwynn from baseball and civic leaders, and from Gwynn&#x27;s family. He was interred at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway.

In 2018, Gwynn&#x27;s family reached a confidential settlement with the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company after filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the company in 2016, charging that Gwynn had become &quot;hopelessly addicted&quot; to its products.

====Impact on tobacco usage in MLB====
Gwynn was referred to as the &quot;poster player for banning smokeless tobacco.&quot; Weeks before he died, Gwynn authored and endorsed a video message addressed to major and minor league players that warned of the health dangers of smokeless tobacco and urged them to quit or refrain from using the substance; Gwynn wanted to speak the part, but was physically unable to use his voice due to his cancer condition, so someone else spoke the message on his behalf. Gwynn&#x27;s death brought the previously obscure issue of ubiquitous tobacco usage in MLB to the forefront of public awareness, prompting calls for a league-wide ban on the substance. A total of nine major anti-tobacco health organizations co-wrote a letter to MLB commissioner Bud Selig and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) executive director Tony Clark; the letter included the following statements: This ultimately led to a prohibition on smokeless tobacco for incoming players being written into the 2016 labor agreement, with existing players receiving a grandfather exemption. Of the change, Gwynn&#x27;s widow Alicia said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a victory, and a positive step in the right direction.&quot; Additionally, veteran players Addison Reed and Stephen Strasburg (who were both coached by Gwynn at SDSU), and Chris Sale all chose to quit using tobacco upon learning about Gwynn&#x27;s death.

<text>Vineland is a 1990 novel by Thomas Pynchon, a postmodern fiction set in California, United States in 1984, the year of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s reelection. Through flashbacks by its characters, who have lived the sixties in their youth, the story accounts for the free spirit of rebellion of that decade, and describes the traits of the &quot;fascistic Nixonian repression&quot; and the War on Drugs that clashed with it; and it articulates the slide and transformation that occurred in U.S. society from the 1960s to the 1980s.

== Plot ==

The story is set in California, United States, in 1984, the year of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s re-election. After a scene in which former hippie Zoyd Wheeler dives through a window, something he is required to do yearly to keep receiving mental disability checks, the action of the novel opens with the resurfacing of federal agent Brock Vond, who (through a platoon of agents) forces Zoyd and his 14-year-old daughter Prairie out of their house. They hide from Brock, and from Hector Zuñiga (a drug-enforcement &quot;federale&quot; from Zoyd&#x27;s past, who Zoyd suspects is in cahoots with Brock) with old friends of Zoyd&#x27;s, who recount to the mystified Prairie the story of Brock&#x27;s motivation for what he has done.

This hinges heavily on Frenesi Gates, Prairie&#x27;s mother, whom she has not seen since she was an infant. In the &#x27;60s, during the height of the hippie era, the fictive College of the Surf (located in equally fictive Trasero County, said to be located between Orange County and San Diego County in Southern California) seceded from the United States and became its own nation of hippies and dope smokers, called the People&#x27;s Republic of Rock and Roll (PR³). Brock Vond, a federal prosecutor, intends to bring down PR³, and finds a willing accomplice in Frenesi. She is a member of 24fps, a militant film collective (other members of which are the people telling Prairie their story in the present), that seeks to document the &quot;fascists&#x27;&quot; transgressions against freedom and hippie ideals. Frenesi is uncontrollably attracted to Brock and the sex he provides, and ends up working as a double agent to bring about the killing of the de facto leader of PR³, Weed Atman (a mathematics professor who accidentally became the subject of a cult of personality).

Her betrayal caused Frenesi to flee, and she has been living in witness protection with Brock&#x27;s help up until the present day. Now she has disappeared. The membership of 24fps, Brock Vond, and Hector Zuñiga are all searching for her, for their various motives. The book&#x27;s theme of the ubiquity of television (or the Tube) comes to a head when Hector, a Tube addict who has actually not been working with Brock, finds funding to create his pet project of a movie telling the story of the depraved sixties, with Frenesi Gates as the director, and the pomp and circumstance surrounding this big-money deal create a net of safety that allows Frenesi to come out of hiding. 24fps finds her and achieves their goal of allowing Prairie to meet her, at an enormous reunion of Frenesi&#x27;s family. Weed Atman is also present at the reunion as one of many Thanatoids in the book—people who are in a state that is &quot;like death, but different.&quot;

Brock, nearly omnipotent with D.E.A. funds, finds Prairie with a surveillance helicopter, and tries to snatch her up to get to Frenesi, but while he is hovering above her on a ladder, the government abruptly cuts all his funding due to a loss of interest in funding the war on drugs because people have begun playing along willingly with the antidrug ideal, and his helicopter pilot flies him away. Later he tries to come after Prairie and Frenesi again, but is killed when he crashes his helicopter. The family reunion allows everyone to tie up all their loose ends, and the book ends with Prairie looking into the beginning of a life no longer controlled by the fall-out of the past.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Vineland&quot; received mixed reviews. Author Tobias Meinel asserted in a 2013 essay that the novel &quot;has led many critics to focus on its shift in style and content and to read it either as &#x27;Pynchon Lite&#x27; or as a critical commentary on contemporary American culture.&quot; Salman Rushdie wrote a positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; following the book&#x27;s 1990 release, praising it as &quot;free-flowing and light and funny and maybe the most readily accessible piece of writing the old Invisible Man ever came up with.&quot; He called it &quot;that rarest of birds&quot; that, &quot;at the end of the Greed Decade,&quot; is &quot;a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself, to its children, all these many years.&quot; Although he praised Pynchon&#x27;s light-yet-deadly touch at tackling the nightmares of the present rather than the past, Rushdie acknowledged that the book &quot;either grabs you or it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

British literary critic Frank Kermode was disappointed by the book, feeling that it lacked the &quot;beautiful ontological suspense&quot; of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; or the &quot;extended fictive virtuosity&quot; of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. He did acknowledge that it was &quot;recognisably from the same workshop&quot; as Pynchon&#x27;s previous outings but found it to be more incomprehensible. Brad Leithauser concurred, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;Vineland&quot; was &quot;a loosely packed grab bag of a book&quot; that recalled what was weakest about the author&#x27;s canon and failed to extend or improve upon it. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, James McManus posited that while inveterate Pynchon readers likely would unfavorably compare the book to &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, it was a manageable book with strong prose that succeeded as an arch and blackly amusing assault on the desires of Republican America.

Film critic Terrence Rafferty admired the novel, and in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;the oldest story in the world—the original sin and the exile from Paradise,&quot; but author Sean Carswell later contended that aside from Rafferty and Rushdie, initial reviews of &quot;Vineland&quot; &quot;run the gamut from slightly miffed to outright hostile.&quot; Edward Mendelson&#x27;s review in &quot;The New Republic&quot; was mostly positive, however; although he found the plot to be tangled and tedious, he praised Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;intellectual and imaginative energy&quot; and called the work &quot;a visionary tale&quot; whose world was &quot;richer and more various than the world of almost any American novel in recent memory.&quot; He also commended the book&#x27;s &quot;comic extravagance,&quot; claiming that &quot;no other American writer moves so smoothly and swiftly between the extremes of high and low style.&quot;

Mendelson additionally noted that &quot;Vineland&quot; was more integrated with its emotions and feelings than Pynchon&#x27;s previous novels, and Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; that it was the author&#x27;s most hopeful work yet. That hopefulness was also mentioned by Rushdie, who believed that the book suggested community, individuality, and family as counterweights to the repressive Nixon-Reagan era, but Dan Geddes opined in 2005 in &quot;The Satirist&quot; that the book&#x27;s &quot;happy ending&quot; was surprising, given its overarching warning about a growing police state. Contrarily, Rushdie found that the shocking final scene lent itself to a morally ambiguous ending, and he felt that the novel expertly held a balance between light and dark throughout its entire duration.

== Adaptation ==
Paul Thomas Anderson has spoken many times of his love for, and desire to adapt, the novel. As of February 2024, it is rumored that he has finally begun filming this adaptation set in modern times, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Zoyd Wheeler. After the film was shown in a test screening, it was confirmed that the film is loosely based on &quot;Vineland&quot;, but in a contemporary setting. The film, &quot;One Battle After Another&quot;, is scheduled for release in August 2025.

<text>The Net is a 1995 American action thriller film directed by Irwin Winkler and starring Sandra Bullock, Jeremy Northam, and Dennis Miller. The film was released on July 28, 1995.

In the film, a systems analyst with few personal contacts learns that all records about her life have been deleted, that her house has also been emptied, and she must now find a way to reclaim her original identity.

==Plot==
United States Under Secretary of Defense Michael Bergstrom commits suicide after being informed that he has tested positive for HIV.

Angela Bennett is a freelance systems analyst worker in Venice, California. All of her relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother, who is institutionalized with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and often forgets who she is.

Bennett&#x27;s co-worker, Dale, in San Francisco, sends her a floppy disk of the band website &quot;Mozart&#x27;s Ghost&quot; with a backdoor labeled &quot;π&quot; that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called &quot;Gatekeeper&quot; sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg.

Dale and Bennett agree to meet the next morning, as he is planning on taking his own plane, but the navigation system in Dale&#x27;s private aircraft malfunctions and the plane crashes into a tower, killing him.

Bennett travels to Cozumel, Mexico, on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin. After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a mugger to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the bushes, catches the mugger, and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting the mugger dead.

He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin&#x27;s wallet, Bennett&#x27;s dinghy collides with rocks. She is unconscious in the hospital for three days.

When Bennett wakes up, she finds that the disk was ruined by the sun and all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room in Cancun, her car is no longer at the airport parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett&#x27;s home is now empty and listed for sale.

Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett&#x27;s Social Security number is now assigned to a &quot;Ruth Marx&quot;, for whom Devlin has entered an arrest record by using the Gatekeeper backdoor to hack the police computer system.

When Bennett calls her own desk at Cathedral Software, an impostor answers and offers Bennett her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion. He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the FBI, and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety.

Using her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin&#x27;s wallet, Bennett logs into the Bethesda Naval Hospital&#x27;s computers and learns that Under Secretary of Defense Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper&#x27;s use by the federal government, was murdered by altering the results of his HIV test leading to a misdiagnosis. Fellow hacker &quot;Cyberbob&quot; connects π with the &quot;Praetorians&quot;, a notorious group of cyberterrorists linked to recent computer failures around the country. Bennett and Cyberbob plan to meet, but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Bennett escapes from Devlin—a contract killer for the cyberterrorists, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Bennett is arrested by the California Highway Patrol, a man identifying himself as Champion&#x27;s FBI friend frees her from jail. She realizes he is an impostor and escapes again, resulting in the impostor&#x27;s death in a car crash.

Now wanted for murder and thought to be Ruth Marx, Bennett hitchhikes to Cathedral&#x27;s office where, using her impostor&#x27;s computer, she connects the cyberterrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme: once the Praetorians sabotage an organization&#x27;s computer system, Gregg sells Gatekeeper to it and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Bennett emails evidence of the backdoor and Gregg&#x27;s involvement with the Praetorians to the FBI from the Moscone Center and tricks Devlin into releasing a virus into Gregg&#x27;s mainframe, destroying Gatekeeper and undoing the erasure of her identity. During a battle on the catwalks of the convention center, Devlin accidentally kills the Bennett impostor from Cathedral Software (who turns out to be the real Ruth Marx per a TV report), but Bennett ambushes him with a fire extinguisher, causing him to fall to his death. Bennett regains her identity, home, and life. She then reunites with her mother, and the conspiracy is exposed, with Jeff Gregg being arrested by the FBI, live on television.

==Cast==
==Production==
In October 1994, Bullock committed to filming &quot;The Net&quot; from mid-January through April 10, 1995. &quot;The Net&quot; was filmed in San Francisco&#x27;s Moscone Center on Thursday, January 5, 1995, during&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/3160745&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Macworld&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/3160324&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drainmag/computer-aids&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at Washington, D.C., locations in April 1995.

==Reception==

===Box office===
With an estimated budget of $22 million and a release date of , &quot;The Net&quot; grossed $50.7 million in the United States and Canada. Including foreign markets, the film grossed $110.6 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
Based on 58 reviews, it has an average score of 5.3 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes with 43% of critics giving positive reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The premise isn&#x27;t without potential and Sandra Bullock is as likable as ever, but &quot;The Net&quot; lacks sufficient thrills – or plausible plot points – to recommend catching.&quot; Metacritic, using a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, describing &quot;The Net&quot; as basically an update of an Alfred Hitchcock trope (&quot;Innocent Person Wrongly Accused&quot;), which was in parts contrived but carried by Bullock&#x27;s naturalistic performance. 
Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, complimented Sandra Bullock&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;Bullock pulls you into the movie. Her overripe smile and clear, imploring eyes are sometimes evocative of Julia Roberts&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Sequel and spin-off TV series==
A sequel named &quot;The Net 2.0&quot;, starring Nikki DeLoach as Hope Cassidy and directed by Charles Winkler, son of Irwin Winkler, was announced in February 2005. It was released direct-to-video in 2006, and was about a young systems analyst who arrives in Istanbul for her new job, to find that her identity has been stolen.

The film spawned an American spinoff television series of the same name, starring Brooke Langton as Angela Bennett.

<text>Slovenian Railways (, &quot;SŽ&quot;) is the state railway company of Slovenia, created in 1991.

Slovenia is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Slovenia is 79.

==History==
What is now Slovenia received its first railway connection in the 1840s, when the Austrian Empire built a railway connection – Südliche Staatsbahn or Austrian Southern Railway – between its capital, Vienna, and its major commercial port, Trieste. Thus, Maribor was connected by railway to Graz in 1844. The stretch was extended via Pragersko to Celje in 1846, and further via Zidani Most to Ljubljana in 1849. A double-track line was continued via Postojna, Pivka, and Divača, finally reaching Trieste in 1857.

Before World War I, numerous other railways were built. In 1860, Pragersko was connected to Ormož and further to Čakovec, Croatia, thus connecting the Austrian and the Hungarian parts of the empire. In 1862, a single-track railway (expanded into double-track in 1944) along the Sava river was built, connecting Zidani Most with Zagreb. In 1863, the &quot;Carinthian railway&quot; was built along the Drava river, connecting Maribor with Dravograd, Klagenfurt and Villach. In 1870, a railway along the upper Sava river valley was built, connecting Ljubljana with Kranj, Jesenice and Tarvisio, Italy. In 1873, a line from Pivka via Illirska Bistrica connected Rijeka, then the most important commercial port in the Hungarian part of the empire. In 1876, a line from Divača connected Pula, the Austrian naval base, via Prešnica. In 1906, Bohinj Railway was built, connecting Villach with Jesenice, along the Soča river valley to Gorizia and further to Trieste, with two over 6000 meter tunnels.

Few lines were opened after World War I. One of them connected Ormož with Ljutomer and Murska Sobota, and opened in 1924. After World War II, a single-track electrified line connecting Prešnica with Koper was built in 1967.

Slovenian Railways (, &quot;SŽ&quot;), the state railway company of Slovenia, was created in 1991 from the Ljubljana division of the former Yugoslav Railways after the breakup of Yugoslavia.

In 1999, a single-track line between Murska Sobota and Hodoš was rebuilt, offering a direct connection with the Hungarian railway system. The line was originally built in 1907 and closed down in 1968, among numerous other lines closed down during the 1960s. In April 2016 the electrification of the Pragersko - Hodoš line was completed.

Numerous ex-Yugoslav Railways steam locomotives are plinthed at stations around Slovenia and there is a railway museum at Ljubljana.

== Rolling stock of the Slovenian Railways ==

==System==

Slovenian Railways operates 1,229 km of standard gauge tracks, 331 km as double track, and reaches all regions of the country. Slovenia is well connected by rail to all surrounding countries, reflecting the fact that it used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later part of Yugoslavia. Left-hand running is used on double-track sections, unlike the remainder of the former Yugoslavian railways.

Electrification is provided by a 3 kV DC system and covers 610 km, with electrification from Pragersko to Hodoš on the Corridor V completed in April 2016. The remainder of the former Yugoslavian railways that have been electrified operate with the 25 kV AC system, so trains to Zagreb have to change engines at Dobova in the absence of dual voltage engines. The DC system was inherited from the Italian Ferrovie dello Stato on the Sežana-Pivka-Postojna and Pivka-Ilirska Bistrica-Šapjane lines, which were electrified in 1936; starting in 1962, further electrification was conducted with the same system, to preserve compatibility. This also necessitated different rolling stock compared to the rest of Yugoslavia: after World War II, the newly formed Slovenian division of Yugoslav Railways received 17 FS Class E.626 locomotives as war reparations for operation on the formerly Italian-owned lines, with newly produced electrical traction vehicles coming in 1962 after electrification was extended from Postojna to Ljubljana (JŽ class 362), 1964 (JŽ class 311), 1967 (JŽ Class 342) and 1975-1977 (JŽ class 363). Due to the Croatian sector of the national railways (as well as the sectors of the other republics of Yugoslavia) choosing the more modern 25 kV system, a voltage break was created in Dobova, which necessitates locomotive switching. Another voltage break arose in Croatia in Šapjane in 2012 after Croatia switched their own 3 kV network that ran around Rijeka to the 25 kV standard.

==Rail links to adjacent countries==
* Same gauge
** Austria  — voltage change to 15 kV AC
** Croatia  — voltage change to 25 kV 50 Hz AC
** Hungary  — voltage change to 25 kV 50 Hz AC
** Italy  — same voltage 3 kV DC

==Crossroad of Pan-European corridors==
Ljubljana is at the heart of the SŽ system. Here, the Pan-European corridors V and X intersect. These transportation corridors are being established to tie larger segments of Europe economically together: Corridor V links Venice - Trieste/Koper - Ljubljana - Maribor - Budapest - Kyiv, while Corridor X connects Salzburg - Ljubljana - Zagreb - Belgrade - Skopje - Thessalonica. The freight system to Koper, a modern and growing port near Trieste, represents the shortest connection to the Mediterranean for a large portion of the hinterland of Central and Eastern Europe.

In 2010, Slovenske Železnice joined Cargo 10, a joint venture with other railways in the region.

==Passenger trains==

===InterCity Slovenija (ICS)===

The ICS trains are modern, air-conditioned high-speed trains which provide the highest level comfort and reach speeds up to 160 km/h. They are equipped with disabled access and other facilities. The passengers can buy food on board (from Monday to Friday), the 1st class passengers are offered a drink free of charge. There are also electric sockets in the 1st class department. The train is a tilting EMU. The reservation of a seat is obligatory and is included in the price of the ticket. Also included in the price of the ticket is the obligatory ICS supplement.

The ICS trains run on the line between Maribor and Ljubljana and stop at:

*Maribor
**&quot;connection to Holmec and onwards to Austria&quot;
*Pragersko
**&quot;connection to Središče&quot;
**&quot;connection to Hodoš and onwards to Hungary&quot;
*Celje
**&quot;connection to Velenje&quot;
**&quot;connection to Sveti Rok ob Sotli&quot;
**&quot;connection to Imeno&quot;
*Zidani Most
**&quot;connection to Dobova and onwards to Croatia&quot;
*Ljubljana
**&quot;connection to Rosalnice and onwards to Croatia&quot;
**&quot;connection to Jesenice and onwards to Austria&quot;
**&quot;connection to Kamnik Graben&quot;
**&quot;connection to Kočevje&quot;

In the past ICS trains occasionally also ran on the line from Ljubljana to Koper and stopped at:
*Pivka
**&quot;connection to Ilirska Bistrica and onwards to Croatia&quot;
*Divača
**&quot;connection to Sežana&quot;
*Hrpelje-Kozina
**&quot;connection to Rakitovec and onwards to Croatia&quot;
*Koper

===InterCity (IC)===
The IC trains are quality trains serving longer distances in national and international traffic. They connect bigger towns, cities and tourist resorts. They consist of comfortable cars. They provide fast connection and call only at major stations. The train usually consists of open or compartment coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An IC supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===EuroCity (EC)===
The EC trains are high-quality trains serving important lines in international traffic. They connect important cities in Slovenia and the rest of Europe. The EC trains are even faster than the IC trains and they call at fewer stations. The majority of the EC trains include air-conditioned cars and have catering facilities on board. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An EC supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===International trains (MV)===
The MV trains (Slovene for &quot;mednarodni vlak&quot;, international train) are quality trains serving international lines. They do not call at minor stations. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An MV supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===EuroNight (EN)===
The EN trains are high-quality overnight international trains. They offer open or compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class), couchette cars and sleeping cars. Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. The EC supplement must be paid for regular seats and an additional supplement must be paid for couchettes and sleeper cars. Some EN trains use &quot;global&quot; prices with an obligatory reservation.

===Regional (RG) and local trains (LP)===
The RG and LP (Slovene for &quot;lokalni potniški&quot;, local passenger train) trains are other trains, connecting all parts of Slovenia. They serve as commuter trains. On some lines, they are the only type of trains available, for example lines to Kamnik and Imeno. The trains offer 2nd class and the new Stadler trains also offer 1st class. They are usually EMUs and DMUs on unelectrified lines.

===Supplements===
In addition to the supplements for faster trains, there is also one for tickets bought on the train instead of beforehand. It is set at €5.00, and no discount is available for children, the elderly, groups, and so on.

===Named trains===
Many trains are assigned names. The examples include:
*IC 502 / 503 &quot;Pohorje&quot;
*IC 508 / 509 &quot;Dana&quot;
*IC 518 / 519 &quot;Ptuj&quot;

<text>The national flag of the Republic of Croatia, also known in Croatian as the &quot;Tricolour&quot; (), is one of the state symbols of Croatia. It consists of three equal size, horizontal stripes in colours red, white and blue. In the middle is the coat of arms of Croatia.

==History==
The flag combines the colours of the flags of the Kingdom of Croatia (red and white), the Kingdom of Slavonia (blue and white) and partially of the Kingdom of Dalmatia (blue and yellow).

The red-white-blue tricolour has been used as the Croatian flag since 1848, and the pan-Slavic colours are widely associated with romantic nationalism. 
While the Banovina of Croatia existed within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, it had a similar flag without the modern crown above the chequy. After the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded and Croatia became the Independent State of Croatia, the crown was removed and a &quot;U&quot; was placed at the top left of the flag. Also, the first field of the Croatian chequy was white. After Nazi Germany collapsed and the SFR Yugoslavia was created, Croatia&#x27;s flag had a five-pointed red star with a yellow border in place of the coat of arms. The star was replaced by the coat of arms in May 1990, shortly after the first multiparty elections. The current flag and the coat of arms were officially adopted on 21 December 1990, about six (de facto) or ten (de jure) months before the proclamation of independence from Yugoslavia and a day before the Constitution of Croatia on 22 December 1990.

==Shield==
The shield depicts the red and white checkerboard of Croatia. Above the shield is a crown consist of shields of its various regions. From dexter to sinister they are the historical arms of Croatia, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia.

== Design ==

The following colours are specified for use in the flag:

<text>The [[coat of arms]] of the [[Republic of Croatia]] () consists of one main shield and five smaller shields which form a crown over the main shield. The main coat of arms is a checkerboard (chequy) that consists of 13 red and 12 white fields. It is also informally known in Croatian as šahovnica (&quot;chessboard&quot;, from &quot;šah&quot;, &quot;chess&quot;). The five smaller shields represent five different historical regions within Croatia. The checkerboard as a heraldic symbol of Croatia was introduced in the late 15th century, and officially since 1527 election in Cetin, replacing the original coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia.

==Official description==
Croatian law describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The coat of arms of the Republic of Croatia is the historical Croatian coat of arms in the form of a shield twice divided horizontally and vertically into twenty-five red and white (silver) fields, so that the first field in the upper left corner is red. Above the shield lies a crown with five spikes, slightly arched with its ends conjoined with upper left and right parts of the shield. Within the crown, five lesser shields with historical Croatian coats of arms, lined from left to right in the following order: the oldest known Croatian coat of arms, coats of arms of the Dubrovnik Republic, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia. The ratio of height of the field of the main shield to the height of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:2.5, and of the width of the field of the main shield to the width of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:1. The oldest known coat of arms of Croatia contains in a shield on a light blue field a yellow (golden) six-pointed star with a white (silver) crescent. Coat of arms of the Republic of Dubrovnik contains in a shield on a blue field two red bars. The Dalmatian arms contain in a shield on a light blue field three yellow (golden) crowned lion heads. The Istrian arms contain in a shield on a blue field a yellow (golden) goat facing left with red hooves and horns. The Slavonian arms contain on a light blue field two horizontal white (silver) bars, between bars a red field, on which sneaks a marten to the left. In the upper light blue field is a yellow (golden) six-pointed star. The coat of arms is lined red.&quot;

However, after recent academic publications, some of the information should be changed.

==History==

The current coat of arms of Croatia was not the first coat of arms of Croatia, dating only since the late 15th century. The first coat of arms of Croatia showcased three leopards or lions heads, which since the late 15th century began to be associated as the coat of arms of Dalmatia. In that period, due to the Ladislaus of Naples selling of Dalmatia to Republic of Venice and Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, began disintegration of the Croatian lands because of which emerged separate coat of arms for Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia (but all of them representing in general the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia).

Since the 15th century in various armorials existed also other rare variations, for example with three human heads instead, another with three running dogs (because in the German language the Slavs are also called Winden which reminds of &quot;windhund&quot;), and an arm brandishing a sword (originally of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, and later usually associated with the coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina). Sometimes the coat of arms of the Frankopan family, who at the time were one of the most powerful Croatian noble families, was also identified as the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia.

===Croatian checherboard===

The size of the checkerboard ranges from 3×3 to 8×8, but most commonly 5×5, like in the current design. Throught history, its initial field was mostly in white color and ending in red color, but existed also other examples, as until the 19th century didn&#x27;t have official standardization and description.

====Meaning====
Since the 19th century national revival in Croatia, the oldest Croatian coat of arms with three leopard/lion heads was appropriated by the Italian-Dalmatianist irredentist Autonomist Party, making the checkerboard coat of arms the preferred Croatian national symbol. As such, it sparked the need to find and prove its old age, and consequently fabrications of an early medieval origin. One tradition states it to be the arms of Stephen Držislav in the 10th century. A Split stone baptistry from the time of Peter Krešimir IV (r. 1058–1074/5) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings, and the bell tower of the medieval Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it. It was traditionally conjectured that the colours originally represented Red Croatia and White Croatia, but there is no historical evidence to support this as well. 

Recently modern scholars are arguing that the Croatian checkerboard CoA was probably created under the influence of the Habsburg dynasty, replacing the first CoA with leopard/lion heads (becoming attributed to the Dalmatia, meanwhile in Venetian Dalmatia was replaced by the Lion of Saint Mark), which chekcerboard with red-white fields stylistically to the trend of the time denotes the walls and forts as &quot;Antemurale Christianitatis&quot;.

====Use====
The checkerboard coat of arms (&quot;šahovnica&quot;) is first attested as a decorative symbol of the Kingdom of Croatia on an Innsbruck tower depicting the emblem of Maximilian I, Archduke of Austria in 1495, and Chiesa dei Domenicani in Bolzano, Italy also from the late 15th century. There&#x27;s possible analogies dating to 1426 of Swedish nobleman Heindrik Kristiernsson who served Ivan VI Frankopan, and 1491 of Senj nobleman Ludovik Perović at the Co-Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary, Senj. It officially appeared on a seal from the Cetingrad Charter that confirmed the 1527 election of Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria as new king of Croatia.

Towards the Late Middle Ages the distinction for the three crown lands (Croatia proper, Dalmatia, Slavonia) was made. The &quot;šahovnica&quot; was used as the coat of arms of Croatia proper &amp; together with the shields of Slavonia and Dalmatia was often used to represent the whole of Croatia in Austria-Hungary. It was used as an unofficial coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia adopted in 1848 and as an official coat of arms of the post-1868 Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (both unofficially known as the Triune Kingdom). The two are the same except for the position of the &quot;šahovnica&quot; and Dalmatian coat of arms which are switched around &amp; with different crowns used above the shield – the later employing St Stephen&#x27;s crown (associated with Hungarian kings).

By late 19th century &quot;šahovnica&quot; had come to be considered a generally recognized symbol for Croats and Croatia and in 1919, it was included in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) to represent Croats. When the Banovina of Croatia was formed, the &quot;šahovnica&quot; (chequy gules and argent) was retained as the official symbol.

The Ustaše regime which had ruled Croatia during the World War II superimposed their ideological symbol, the letter &quot;U&quot; above or around the &quot;šahovnica&quot; (upper left square white) as the official national symbol during their rule.

After the Second World War, the new Socialist Republic of Croatia became a part of the federal Second Yugoslavia. The &quot;šahovnica&quot; was included in the new socialist coat of arms. It was designed in the socialist tradition, including symbols like wheat for peasants and an anvil for workers, as well as a rising sun to symbolize a new morning and a red star for communism.

During the change to multiparty elections in Croatia (as part of the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s), and prior to the establishment of the current design, the &quot;šahovnica&quot;, shedding the communist symbols that were the hallmark of Croatia in the second Yugoslavia, reappeared as a stand-alone symbol as both the &#x27;upper left square red&#x27; and &#x27;upper left square white&#x27; variants. The choice of &#x27;upper left square red&#x27; or &#x27;upper left square white&#x27; was often dictated by heraldic laws and aesthetic requirements.

The first-field-white variant was adopted by the Republic of Croatia and used briefly in 1990. According to constitutional changes which came into effect on 26 June 1990 the red star in the flag of SR Croatia was to be replaced by the &quot;historical Croatian coat of arms with 25 red and white fields&quot;, without specifying order of fields. The first-field-white variant was used at the official flag hoisting ceremony on 25 July and was later occasionally used on par with the first-field-red variant until 21 December 1990 when the current coat of arms was officially adopted.

==Current design==
On 21 December 1990, the post-socialist government of Croatia, passed a law prescribing the design created by the painter and graphic artist Miroslav Šutej, under the aegis of a commission chaired by Nikša Stančić, then head of the Department of Croatian History at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb. The new design added the five crowning shields which represent Croatian historical coat of arms, out of which four regions of Croatia. They are, from left to right:

Some of the more traditional heraldic pundits have criticized the latest design for various design solutions, such as adding a crown to the coat, varying shades of blue in its even fields, adding the red border around the coat, and using red and blue together. The government has accepted their criticism insofar as not accepting further non-traditional designs for the county coats of arms, but the national symbol has remained intact.

Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of Croatia Airlines or the design of the shirt for the Croatia national football team), and partly because the Pan-Slavic colors are present in many European flags.

===Historical versions of the crown arms===
Most coats of arms used in the crown on the modern-day coat of arms differ slightly from historically accurate versions.

<text>The Chicago Seven, originally the Chicago Eight and also known as the Conspiracy Eight or Conspiracy Seven, were seven defendants – Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Lee Weiner – charged by the United States Department of Justice with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and 1960s counterculture protests in Chicago, Illinois during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Chicago Eight became the Chicago Seven after the case against codefendant Bobby Seale was declared a mistrial.

All of the defendants were charged with and acquitted of conspiracy; Davis, Dellinger, Hayden, Hoffman, and Rubin were charged with and convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; Froines and Weiner were charged with teaching demonstrators how to construct incendiary devices and acquitted of those charges. All of the convictions were later reversed on appeal, and the government declined to retry the case. While the jury deliberated, Judge Julius Hoffman convicted the defendants and their attorneys of contempt of court and sentenced them to jail sentences ranging from less than three months to more than four years. The contempt convictions were also appealed, and some were retried before a different judge.

Since the beginning of the trial in 1969, the defendants and their attorneys have been depicted in a variety of art forms, including film, music, and theater.

==Background==

===Planning for the 1968 DNC protests===
In the fall of 1967, David Dellinger was the director of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (the Mobe), and planning began during Mobe meetings for an anti-war demonstration at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A similar plan was created by SDS Vice President Vernon T. Grizzard titled &quot;Summer 1968: Possibilities for New Local Organizing&quot;. In early 1968, the Tet Offensive against American forces in Vietnam started, and in February, Walter Cronkite said the war was &quot;lost.&quot; In March, Johnson ended his campaign for the nomination.

Protests against the war continued, and Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden became directors of the Mobe office in Chicago. A counterculture group known as Yippies, including Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, also planned a &quot;Festival of Life&quot;, announced at a press conference on March 17, as a response to what they described as the Democratic &quot;Convention of Death&quot;. In January, the Yippies had issued a statement that included: &quot;Join us in Chicago in August for an international festival of youth music and theater ... Come all you rebels, youth spirits, rock minstrels, truth seekers, peacock freaks, poets, barricade jumpers, dancers, lovers and artists ... We are there! There are 500,000 of us dancing in the streets, throbbing with amplifiers and harmony. We are making love in the parks ...&quot; In a March meeting at Lake Villa, Illinois, coordination of demonstrations was discussed by representatives from various groups; Hayden and Davis drafted a proposal that included &quot;the campaign should not plan violence and disruption against the Democratic National Convention. It should be nonviolent and legal.&quot;

Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, there were riots in Chicago and other cities. In June 1968, Robert Kennedy was assassinated.

Most of the permits applied for by the Mobe and the Yippies for protest-related activities were denied. Rennie Davis sought help from the Justice Department, and argued permits would lower the risk of violence between protesters and police, but was unsuccessful. A week before the start of the convention, Mobe organizers sued in federal court to obtain permits to use the parks, but were denied on August 23.

===The 1968 DNC protests===

A variety of groups convened in Chicago to protest during the convention week, including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (the Mobe) and the Yippies. The Black Panther Party and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference also sent representatives to protest racism.

On Friday, August 23, the Yippies nominated their own candidate for president: a 145-pound pig they called Pigasus, who according to Frank Kusch, was &quot;released to the public&quot; at the Civic Center Plaza and promptly &quot;arrested&quot; by police as he was &quot;interviewed&quot; by journalists. Five Yippies were taken to jail, including Jerry Rubin and Phil Ochs, while Pigasus was released to the Chicago Humane Society, and the Yippies were released after they each posted a $25 bond.

By the weekend before the convention, about 2,000 demonstrators had set up camp in Lincoln Park. On Saturday, August 24, Lincoln Park was cleared almost without incident, with Allen Ginsberg leading many protesters out of the park before the 11 p.m. curfew. According to Frank Kusch, police cleared the park and arrested eleven people for failing to disperse, while a crowd outside of the park suddenly ran toward the main street in Old Town yelling &quot;Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!&quot; and then marched for ten blocks before police arrived and the demonstrators quickly blended into the regular crowds on the sidewalks.

For the convention, the 11,900 members of the Chicago Police Department were put on twelve-hour shifts, and nearly 6,000 members of the National Guard were sent to the city, with an additional 5,000 National Guard on alert, and approximately 1,000 FBI and military intelligence officers, and 1,000 Secret Service agents were in the city. The 4,865 city firefighters were ordered to work extra shifts beginning on the Sunday before the convention, and the Chicago Police Department placed 1,500 uniformed officers outside the International Amphitheatre, where the Democratic convention was held, including snipers.

The number of demonstrators in Chicago was estimated to be about 10,000. From inside the International Amphitheatre, CBS evening news anchor Walter Cronkite reported: &quot;The Democratic convention is about to begin in a police state. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be any other way to say it.&quot; 

On Sunday, August 25, protest leaders allegedly told people to &quot;test the curfew&quot;, while there were several thousand people in Lincoln Park, around bonfires, beating drums, and chanting. When the park was officially closed at 11 p.m., Chicago police used tear gas and moved in with billy-clubs to forcibly remove them from the park. Police formed a skirmish line and cleared the park, ending up on Stockton Drive, with about 200 police facing about 2,000 protesters. Protesters, journalists, photographers, and bystanders were clubbed and beaten by the police.

On August 26, demonstrators gathered in Grant Park and climbed on a statue of General Logan on a horse, which led to violent skirmishes with police. Police hauled a young man down and arrested him, breaking his arm in the process. The only permit granted to the Mobe for the convention week was for a rally at the Grant Park band shell for the afternoon of August 28, and it was granted on August 27, after the convention began. David Dellinger told members of the media, &quot;We&#x27;ll march with or without a permit&quot;, and that Grant Park was only a &quot;staging area for the march&quot;.

On the morning of August 28, Abbie Hoffman was arrested for writing the word &quot;FUCK&quot; on his forehead. In the afternoon, Dellinger, Seale, Davis, and Hayden addressed thousands of demonstrators at the band shell in Grant Park. After the rally at the Grant Park bandshell, several thousand protesters attempted to march to the International Amphitheatre, but were stopped in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where the presidential candidates and campaigns were headquartered, by what David Taylor and Sam Morris of &quot;The Guardian&quot; describe as &quot;a phalanx of National Guard armed with M1 rifles, backed by machine guns and jeeps with cages on top and barbed wire frames in front.&quot; In a sit down protest, the crowd chanted &quot;the whole world is watching&quot;.

Film and videotape reports from &quot;The Battle of Michigan Avenue&quot;, described by Neil Steinberg of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; as &quot;a 17-minute melee in front of the Conrad Hilton&quot;, were broadcast on television, interrupting the live coverage of the third evening of the convention. The police violence extended to protesters, bystanders, reporters and photographers, while tear gas reached Hubert Humphrey in his hotel suite. Police pushed protesters through plate-glass windows, then pursued them inside and beat them as they sprawled on the broken glass. 100 protesters and 119 police officers were treated for injuries, and 600 protesters were arrested. Police brutality and demonstrators chanting &quot;The whole world is watching&quot; were filmed by national news outlets and broadcast on the same night that Humphrey won the presidential nomination.

Paul Cowan of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reports that by Thursday, Tom Hayden was in disguise by Grant Park, Jerry Rubin was in jail, and Rennie Davis was recovering from a beating by the police. After a speech by Eugene McCarthy in Grant Park that afternoon, a march was joined by delegates and McCarthy supporters but was stopped at 18th Street and Michigan Avenue by the National Guard. Arrests were followed by tear gas and mace, while marchers chanted &quot;The whole world is watching&quot; and retreated to Grant Park. In the park, demonstrators sang &quot;God Bless America&quot;, &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and waved &quot;V&quot; signs above their heads, asking soldiers to join in. They never did. Phil Ochs sang &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marchin&#x27; Any More&quot;, and demonstrators chanted &quot;join us&quot; softly. Five hours later, police officers raided a party organized by McCarthy workers in the Hilton hotel, and beat them viciously. According to the McCarthy workers, all telephones on their floor had been disconnected a half hour before, and they had no way to call for help.

===Investigation of the violence===
Investigations were conducted by the City of Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice, the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), and the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. On September 6, 1968, the Daley administration issued a report that focused on &quot;outside agitators&quot; with an &quot;avowed purpose of a hostile confrontation with law enforcement.&quot;

Bruce Ragsdale writes that the HUAC chair, Richard Ichord, &quot;suspected communist involvement in the demonstrations&quot;, but the hearings &quot;devolved into a bizarre preview of the conspiracy trial when a shirtless, barefooted Jerry Rubin burst into the hearing room with a bandolier of bullets and a toy gun.&quot; In October 1968, Abbie Hoffman was arrested for wearing an American flag shirt while trying to attend a HUAC meeting after being subpoenaed to appear. Tom Hayden also testified during the hearings.

On September 4, 1968, Milton Eisenhower, chair of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, announced the commission would investigate and report its findings to President Lyndon Johnson. Supervised by Daniel Walker, more than 200 investigators conducted interviews of more than 1,400 witnesses and reviewed FBI reports and film. The Walker Report was released on December 1, 1968, and described the violence as a &quot;police riot&quot;. The report summary included:
:That some policemen lost control of themselves under exceedingly provocative circumstances can perhaps be understood; but not condoned. If no action is taken against them, the effect can only be to discourage the majority of policemen who acted responsibly, and further weaken the bond between police and community. 
The Walker Report also acknowledged provocation and violence by some protesters and stated the &quot;vast majority of the demonstrators were intent on expressing by peaceful means their dissent.&quot;

The Department of Justice investigation did not support prosecution of demonstrators. Attorney General Ramsey Clark asked the U.S. attorney in Chicago to investigate the Chicago police.

== Grand jury and indictment ==

On September 9, 1968, a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois began to investigate demonstration organizers for federal law violations and police officers for civil rights violations. On March 20, 1969, the grand jury indictments of eight demonstrators and eight police officers were publicly announced. Seven police officers were charged with assault and one police officer was charged with perjury. In addition, Enid Roth, an NBC News producer, was indicted on two counts of electronic eavesdropping, which were related to hidden microphones found in closed meetings of the Democratic party platform committee.

The charges against the demonstrators were the first prosecutions under the anti-riot provisions of Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. All were charged with conspiring to use interstate commerce with intent to incite a riot. David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale were also charged with crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot. John Froines and Lee Weiner were charged with teaching demonstrators how to construct incendiary devices that would be used in civil disturbances.

Eighteen others were named by the grand jury as alleged co-conspirators, but not indicted: Wolfe B. Lowenthal, Stewart E. Albert, Sidney M. Peck, Kathy Boudin, Corina F. Fales, Benjamin Radford, Thomas W. Neumann, Craig Shimabukuro, Bo Taylor, David A. Baker, Richard Bosciano, Terry Gross, Donna Gripe, Benjamin Ortiz, Joseph Toornabene, Sara C. Brown, Bradford Fox(my king, the best substitute teacher in Maine), and Richard Palmer.

==Trial==
The original eight defendants were Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The defense attorneys were William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as well as Michael Kennedy, Michael Tigar, Charles Garry, Gerald Lefcourt, and Dennis Roberts. The presiding judge was Julius Hoffman (no relation to Abbie), and the prosecutors were Richard Schultz and Tom Foran.

===Trial begins===
The trial began on September 24, 1969. In his opening statement, when prosecutor Richard Schultz mentioned Abbie Hoffman, Abbie Hoffman stood up and blew the jury a kiss, and the judge said, &quot;The jury is directed to disregard the kiss from Mr. Hoffman.&quot;

The government called 53 witnesses, including undercover police officer Robert Pierson, who worked as a bodyguard for Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and testified that on October 8, 1969, he heard Abbie Hoffman say &quot;If they push us out of the park tonight, we&#x27;re going to break windows&quot;, and about statements made by Rubin, Seale, and Davis. Police officer William Frapolly testified about his undercover work, which included joining Students for a Democratic Society and the National Mobilization Committee. Frapolly testified he heard most of the defendants say they intended to incite police confrontations and other disturbances; he also testified that Weiner and Froines discussed incendiary devices and chemical bombs.

===Bobby Seale===
Seale was initially represented by Charles Garry, who appeared at the April 9 arraignment. Before the trial began, Seale had been indicted in Connecticut on charges of conspiracy to murder a suspected police informant and was therefore denied bail during the trial. Garry became unable to travel due to his need to recover from a surgery, and Judge Hoffman denied the request to postpone the trial start date. The judge also refused to allow Seale to represent himself, in part because Kunstler had signed an appearance for Seale on September 24 to be able to visit him in jail, so Kunstler&#x27;s request to withdraw as Seale&#x27;s attorney was an &quot;absolutely discretionary&quot; decision by the judge, and Judge Hoffman decided Seale was represented by Kunstler.

Seale protested the judge&#x27;s actions, arguing that they were not only illegal, but also racist, telling the court on September 26, &quot;If I am consistently denied this right of legal defense counsel of my choice, who is effective, by the judge of this court, then I can only see the judge as a blatant racist of the United States court.&quot; Seale had been in Chicago for less than 24 hours over two days of the convention week and had been invited shortly before the convention began as a substitute for Eldridge Cleaver, so the evidence against him was testimony from undercover police officer Robert Pierson, about a speech by Seale in Lincoln Park, where according to Pierson, Seale had urged his audience to &quot;barbecue some pork&quot;, and Judge Hoffman, over the objection of the defense, allowed Pierson to give his opinion that this meant &quot;to burn some pigs&quot;, i.e., police officers.

On the morning of October 29, after Seale called Judge Hoffman a &quot;rotten racist pig, fascist liar&quot;, the judge responded: &quot;Let the record show the tone of Mr. Seale&#x27;s voice was one of shrieking and pounding on the table and shouting&quot;, and Seale replied, &quot;If a witness is on the stand and testifies against me and I stand up and speak out in behalf of my right to have my lawyer and to defend myself and you deny me that, I have a right to make those requests. I have a right to make those demands on my constitutional rights. I have a constitutional right to speak, and if you try to suppress my constitutional right to speak out in behalf of my constitutional rights, then I can only see you as a bigot, a racist, and a fascist, and I have said before and clearly indicated on the record.&quot;

In the afternoon session of October 29, Judge Hoffman ordered Seale to be bound, gagged, and chained to a chair. According to John Schultz, when the jury was allowed into the courtroom, juror Jean Fritz began weeping, and other jurors &quot;squirmed hard in their seats at the sight.&quot;

On three days, Seale appeared in court bound and gagged before the jury, struggling to get free, and at times managing to loudly insist on his right to defend himself. On October 30, in open court, Kunstler declared, &quot;This is no longer a court of order, your Honor; this is a medieval torture chamber.&quot; On November 5, the judge declared a mistrial for Seale, and the Chicago Eight became the Chicago Seven, with Seale&#x27;s case severed for a later trial that never occurred.

===A political trial===
On October 15, when the first Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam was observed across the country, the defendants attempted to place American and South Vietnamese flags on the defense table, but Judge Hoffman demanded them removed, stating, &quot;Whatever decoration there is the courtroom will be furnished by the government and I think things look alright in this courtroom.&quot; On November 15, the second day of the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, Abbie Hoffman brought a Viet Cong flag into the courtroom and then wrestled over it with deputy marshal Ronald Dobroski.

Abbie Hoffman and Rennie Davis testified at the trial. On December 29, when asked about his arrest on August 28 for writing &quot;FUCK&quot; on his forehead, Abbie Hoffman testified, &quot;I put it on for a couple of reasons, one was that I was tired of seeing my picture in the paper and having newsmen come around, and I know if you got that word on your forehead they ain&#x27;t going to print your picture in the paper. Secondly, it sort of summed up my attitude about the whole thing—what was going on in Chicago.&quot; When asked whether he entered into an agreement with Dellinger, Froines, Hayden, Rubin, Weiner or Davis, to come to Chicago for the purpose of encouraging and promoting violence during the Convention week, Abbie Hoffman replied, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t agree on lunch.&quot; When asked by the prosecution about whether it was &quot;a fact that one of the reasons why you came to Chicago was simply to wreck American society&quot;, he replied:
: My feeling at the time, and still is, that society is going to wreck itself. I said that on a number of occasions, that our role is to survive while the society comes tumbling down around us; our role is to survive. We have to learn how to defend ourselves, given this type of society, because of the war in Vietnam, because of racism, because of the attack on the cultural revolution—in fact because of this trial.

The trial lasted for months, with more than 100 witnesses called by the defense, including singers Phil Ochs, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and Country Joe McDonald; comedian Dick Gregory; writers Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg; and activists Timothy Leary and Jesse Jackson.

Phil Ochs, who helped organize some of the demonstrations, told the court he had acquired the pig, called Pigasus, to nominate as the Yippie presidential candidate before being arrested with Rubin and other participants. Judy Collins attempted to sing &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; during her testimony, before Judge Hoffman forbade it, so Collins recited the lyrics instead. Allen Ginsberg recited poetry and chants, including O-o-m-m-m-m-m, while providing testimony about his participation in the demonstrations.

On January 28, 1970, Ramsey Clark, the U.S. Attorney General under President Lyndon Johnson during the 1968 Democratic Convention, was barred by the judge from testifying before the jury after Clark testified outside the presence of the jury. Judge Hoffman upheld the prosecution&#x27;s objections to 14 of Kunstler&#x27;s 38 questions, but Clark did testify that he had told Foran to investigate through Justice Department lawyers &quot;as is generally done in civil rights cases&quot;, rather than through a grand jury.

On February 5, Abbie Hoffman shouted, &quot;Your idea of justice is the only obscenity in this court, Julie&quot;, at Judge Hoffman and then yelled &quot;shande fur de goyim&quot; at him, after Rubin told the judge, &quot;Every kid in the world hates you because they know what you represent. You are synonymous with Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler equals Julius Hitler.&quot; These insults had followed Judge Hoffman stating that he intended to continue using the revocation of bail in response to the use of &quot;vile epithets&quot; in the courtroom, while the defense attorneys were arguing against the revocation of Dellinger&#x27;s bail the day before, after Dellinger shouted a &quot;barnyard vulgarity&quot; at a government witness.

On February 6, Abbie Hoffman and Rubin wore judicial robes to court, then threw them down and stepped on them.

On February 14, the case went to the jury, and the jury returned its verdict on February 18.

==Contempt citations==
During the proceedings, all of the defendants and nearly all of their attorneys were cited for contempt of court by Judge Hoffman.

===Pre-trial===
Attorneys Michael Kennedy, Dennis Roberts, Michael Tigar, and Gerald Lefcourt assisted the defense with pretrial motions. Before the trial began, Judge Hoffman held them all in contempt after they attempted to withdraw from the case, issued bench warrants for their arrest, and had Tigar and Lefcourt jailed. After two of the warrants were invalidated by the United States District Court in San Francisco, and while the court was being picketed by protesting attorneys, Judge Hoffman permitted the withdrawal of the attorneys from the case.

===Bobby Seale===
On November 5, 1969, after declaring a mistrial in the prosecution of Bobby Seale, Judge Hoffman convicted Seale on 16 charges of contempt, and sentenced Seale to three months in prison on each count—a total of four years, which may have been the longest contempt sentence in U.S. history at the time.

===Post-trial===

On February 14 and 15, 1970, while the jury deliberated on the verdict for the remaining defendants, Judge Hoffman convicted all the defendants—and their attorneys Kunstler and Weinglass—on a total of 159 counts of criminal contempt.
The sentences for the defendants and their attorneys were as follows:
* Dellinger: 29 months and 16 days on 32 counts 
* Davis: 25 months and 14 days on 23 counts 
* Froines: 5 months and 15 days on 10 counts 
* Hayden: 14 months and 14 days for 11 counts 
* Hoffman: 8 months for 24 counts 
* Rubin: 25 months and 23 days for 16 counts 
* Weiner: 2 months and 18 days on 7 counts
* Weinglass: 20 months and 16 days on 14 counts
* Kunstler: 48 months and 13 days on 24 counts

Six of the seven defendants remanded to jail received haircuts in the Cook County Jail; John Kifner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that David Dellinger did not, and the others were &quot;shorn of their long hair for what jail officials announced were &#x27;sanitary reasons, while the lawyers&#x27; sentences were stayed until May 4, to allow them to work on the appeal. After the haircuts, Cook County Sheriff Joseph I. Woods showed pictures of the defendants to an audience on February 23, 1970, that Kifner reports consisted of &quot;about 100 laughing and applauding members of the Elk Grove Township Republican organization at a meeting in the suburban Mount Prospect Country Club.&quot;

The defendants were released from jail on February 28, 1970.

==Verdict==
On February 18, 1970, the jury acquitted all seven defendants of conspiracy and acquitted Froines and Weiner on all charges. The jury found Davis, Dellinger, Hayden, Hoffman, and Rubin guilty of traveling across state lines with intent to incite a riot.

In a separate trial, seven of the indicted police officers were acquitted by the jury, and the case against the eighth indicted police officer was dismissed by the prosecution.

==Sentencing==
On February 20, 1970, in the sentencing phase of the trial, the defendants made statements, including David Dellinger, who said:

:[W]hatever happens to us, however unjustified, will be slight compared to what has happened already to the Vietnamese people, to the black people in this country, to the criminals with whom we are now spending our days in the Cook County jail. I must have already lived longer than the normal life expectancy of a black person born when I was born, or born now. I must have already lived longer, 20 years longer, than the normal life expectancy in the underdeveloped countries which this country is trying to profiteer from and keep under its domain and control ... [S]ending us to prison, any punishment the Government can impose upon us, will not solve the problem of this country&#x27;s rampant racism, will not solve the problem of economic injustice, it will not solve the problem of the foreign policy and the attacks upon the underdeveloped people of the world. The Government has misread the times in which we live, just like there was a time when it was possible to keep young people, women, black people, Mexican-American, anti-war people, people who believe in truth and justice and really believe in democracy, which it is going to be possible to keep them quiet or suppress them.

Rennie Davis told Judge Hoffman, &quot;You represent all that is old, ugly, bigoted, and repressive in this country, and I will tell you that the spirit of this defense table will devour your sickness in the next generation.&quot;

The statement by Tom Hayden included: 
:We have known all along what the intent of the Government has been. We knew that before we set foot in the streets of Chicago. We knew that before we set foot on the streets of Chicago. We knew that before the famous events of August 28, 1968. If those events didn&#x27;t happen, the Government would have had to invent them as I think it did for much of its evidence in this case, but because they were bound to put us away. They have failed. Oh, they are going to get rid of us, but they made us in the first place. We would hardly be notorious characters if they had left us alone in the streets of Chicago last year, but instead we became the architects, the masterminds, and the geniuses of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. We were invented. We were chosen by the Government to serve as scape goats for all that they wanted to prevent happening in the 1970s.

The statement of Abbie Hoffman included a discussion of early American history, and:

:In 1861 Abraham Lincoln in his inaugural address said, and I quote &quot;When the people shall grow weary of their constitutional right to amend the government, they shall exert their revolutionary right to dismember and overthrow that government.&quot; If Abraham Lincoln had given that speech in Lincoln Park, he would be on trial right here in this courtroom, because that is an inciteful speech. That is a speech intended to create a riot. I don&#x27;t even know what a riot is. I thought a riot was fun. Riot means you laugh, ha, ha. That is a riot. They call it a riot.

:I didn&#x27;t want to be that serious. I was supposed to be funny. I tried to be, I mean, but it was sad last night. I am not made to be a martyr. I tried to sign up a few years, but I went down there. They ran out of nails. What was I going to do? So I ended up being funny. It wasn&#x27;t funny last night sitting in a prison cell, a 5 x 8 room, with no light in the room. I could have written a whole book last night. Nothing. No light in the room. Bedbugs all over. They bite. I haven&#x27;t eaten in six days. I&#x27;m not on a hunger strike; you can call it that. It&#x27;s just that the food stinks and I can&#x27;t take it.

:Well, we said it was like Alice in Wonderland coming in, now I feel like Alice in 1984, because I have lived through the winter of injustice in this trial. And it&#x27;s fitting that if you went to the South and fought for voter registration and got arrested and beaten eleven or twelve times on those dusty roads for no bread, it&#x27;s only fitting that you be arrested and tried under the civil rights act. That&#x27;s the way it works.

Judge Hoffman sentenced each convicted defendant to five years in prison, as well as a $5,000 fine and costs of prosecution.

==Appeal==
A United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit panel composed of Walter Cummings, Thomas Fairchild, and Wilbur Pell heard the appeals related to the criminal convictions and contempt convictions.

On May 11, 1972, the panel dismissed some contempt charges against the lawyers, and reversed all of the other contempt convictions for retrial with a different judge. Judge Edward Gignoux presided over the retrial and found Dellinger, Hoffman, Kunstler, and Rubin guilty of some of the charges but did not sentence any of them to jail or fines. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed four of the contempt convictions against Bobby Seale, remanded the other 12 for retrial before another judge, and the government declined to prosecute the remaining contempt charges.

On November 21, 1972, all of the criminal convictions were reversed by the panel. The majority opinion of the court unanimously found several errors by Judge Hoffman and censured Judge Hoffman and the prosecutors for their conduct during the trial. The court noted, &quot;the demeanor of the judge and the prosecutors would require reversal even if errors did not.&quot; Pell wrote a separate opinion concurring with the reversal of the convictions, and finding Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, known as the Anti-Riot Act, to be an unconstitutional infringement of freedom of speech; this was not part of the majority opinion and therefore did not invalidate the statute. The U.S. Department of Justice announced in January 1973 that it would not retry the defendants.

==Cultural representations==

===Art===
* On September 25, 1969, Richard Avedon made his first wall-sized mural portrait of the Chicago Seven. It was first exhibited at the Minneapolis Institute of Art in the summer of 1970 and has since been exhibited in museums around the world. Avedon called the group of defendants &quot;heroic&quot;. According to Froines and Weiner, an Avedon photo was used in thank you cards, holiday greetings, and fundraising requests sent to supporters.
* During the trial, a poster created by Sharon Avery and featuring a photograph by Michael Abramson, that said &quot;make a new year&#x27;s revolution, kids! it&#x27;ll bring you closer together&quot; depicting Lee Weiner and his girlfriend at the time, Sharon Avery, nude and with Christmas tree lights in their hair, was distributed &quot;to the young people waiting out on the cold to sit in on our trial to thank them for supporting us&quot;, according to Weiner.
* Robert Crumb drew the poster for The Conspiracy Stomp, a benefit for the Chicago Eight held at the Aragon Ballroom on November 28, 1969.
* David Hammons, in &#x27;Injustice Case&#x27;, depicted an African-American man bound to a chair and gagged that &quot;[recalls] how Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was bound and gagged in a Chicago courtroom.&quot;

===Film===
* In Haskell Wexler&#x27;s 1969 film &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that Wexler &quot;uses some of the real events of [1968] ... as backgrounds that are extensions of the fictional characters.&quot;
*In 1970, the BBC produced &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot;, with Ronny Cox as Jerry Rubin, Cliff Gorman as Abbie Hoffman, and Al Freeman Jr. as Bobby Seale; the re-creation of the trial was aired in the US by PBS in July 1975.
*In 1970, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, of the Dziga Vertov Group, made a parody film of the Chicago 8 trial called &quot;Vladimir and Rosa&quot;.
*In the 1971 Peter Watkins film &quot;Punishment Park&quot;, fictional members of the counterculture are put on trial for similar &quot;crimes&quot;. 
*In the 1971 film &quot;Bananas&quot;, Woody Allen makes a reference to the binding and gagging of Bobby Seale during the Chicago 8 trial. Allen&#x27;s character, Fielding Melish, is on trial and defending himself. The judge orders Melish bound and gagged. While bound and gagged, he cross-examines a prosecution witness.
* The 1971 Kerry Feltham film &quot;The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus&quot; was based on the trial transcript and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.
*The 1987 Jeremy Kagan made-for-HBO movie &quot;&quot; was adapted from the Ron Sossi and Frank Condon play &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot;, is based on the courtroom transcripts, and includes brief interviews with participants in the trial.
*The 2000 Robert Greenwald film &quot;Steal This Movie&quot; is mostly about Abbie Hoffman (played by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio), and looks at the trial.
*In the 2007 Brett Morgen film &quot;Chicago 10&quot;, archival footage, including Chicago in August 1968, is mixed with animated scenes based on the trial transcript.
*The 2010 documentary &quot;Phil Ochs: There but for Fortune&quot; features interviews with a variety of Ochs&#x27; associates, including Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, and Abbie Hoffman. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes, &quot;Ochs&#x27;s involvement with the civil rights and antiwar movements and his presence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention make &quot;There but for Fortune&quot; not only a biography but also a running history of the period&#x27;s left-wing activism, replete with film clips of that decade&#x27;s tragic events&quot;.
* The 2011 Pinchas Perry film &quot;The Chicago 8&quot; includes dialogue from some of the trial transcripts.
* The 2020 Aaron Sorkin film &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; was distributed by Netflix. The cast features Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, John Carroll Lynch, Eddie Redmayne, Noah Robbins, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong as the Chicago Seven with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, and Mark Rylance in other roles.

===Music===
* Phil Ochs released his 1969 album &quot;Rehearsals for Retirement&quot; with an image of his own tombstone on the cover, inscribed: &quot;Born: El Paso, Texas 1940&quot; and &quot;Died: Chicago, Illinois 1968&quot;, which according to Ryan Smith of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, is an &quot;obvious reference&quot; to Ochs&#x27; role in the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests; the album also includes the song &quot;William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park&quot;, which describes Chicago during the convention. During the convention protests, Ochs described playing his song &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot; at a demonstration in Grant Park as &quot;the highlight of [his] career.&quot; Ochs brought his guitar and was prepared to sing &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot; during his testimony at the trial of the Chicago Seven, but was denied the opportunity by the judge.
* The 1969 song &quot;Someday (August 29, 1968)&quot; from the first Chicago (then Chicago Transit Authority) self-titled album.
* The 1970 song &quot;Peace Frog&quot; by the Doors includes the line &quot;Blood in the streets/ in the town of Chicago&quot;.
* The 1971 song &quot;Chicago&quot; by Graham Nash, on Nash&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; was inspired by the anti-Vietnam protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the trial of the Chicago Eight, and the song opens with a reference to Bobby Seale, who was gagged and chained in the courtroom. 
* Researcher Justin Brummer, founding editor of the Vietnam War Song Project has catalogued over 25 songs that reference the Chicago Seven/Eight and/or the demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, including &quot;Telling It Straight in &#x27;68&quot; by country artist Jim Hartley, &quot;Where Were You in Chicago&quot; by Phil Ochs, &quot;Circus &#x27;68 &#x27;69&quot; (1970) by Charlie Haden, &quot;Christmas in My Soul&quot; (1970) by Laura Nyro, &quot;Free Bobby Now&quot; (1970) by Black Panther group The Lumpen (about Bobby Seale), &quot;Chicago&#x27;s 7&quot; by Walt Wilder, &quot;Chicago 7&quot; by Warren Farren, &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; (1971) by blues artist Memphis Slim, and &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy&quot; (1972) by David Peel.

===Theatre and plays===
*The 1970 off-Broadway play &quot;The Chicago 70&quot; was an improvised drama by the Toronto Workshop Company based on the Chicago Seven trial transcripts and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.
*In 1972, playwright and screenwriter David Petersen&#x27;s play &quot;Little Orphan Abbie&quot; based on the transcript of the trial, opened in Seattle, directed by Jody Briggs and starring Glenn Mazen. It was slated for production in New York by director Joe Papp, but had to be postponed and finally cancelled due to extended runs of other plays. It was later produced in Los Angeles, first on stage at the Burbage Theater, directed by Ron Hunter. It was later shot for television by Telemedia Productions, directed by Dick Studebaker. The television version used stock footage of the events in the parks and on the streets of Chicago during the riots.
* In 1979, &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot; by Ron Sossi and Frank Condon was staged by the Odyssey Theater Ensemble and is based on the trial transcripts. The 15th anniversary production by the Odyssey Theater Ensemble featured Allan Miller (William Kunstler), Albie Selznick (Leonard Weinglass), Paul Provenza (Abbie Hoffman) and George Murdock (Judge Hoffman).
* The 1993 John Goodchild play &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot; is based on the trial transcripts and produced by L.A. Theatre Works, the BBC and WFMT.

<text>Tate St Ives is an art gallery in St Ives, Cornwall, England, exhibiting work by modern British artists with links to the St Ives area. The Tate also took over management of another museum in the town, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, in 1980.

The Tate St Ives was built between 1988 and 1993 on the site of an old gasworks and looks over Porthmeor beach. In 2015, it received funding for an expansion, doubling the size of the gallery, and closed in October 2015 for refurbishment. The gallery re-opened in October 2017 and is among the most visited attractions in the UK.

== History ==
In 1980, Tate group started to manage the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, dedicated to the life and work of the renowned St Ives artist. The group decided to open a museum in the town, to showcase local artists, especially those already held in their collection.

In 1988, the group purchased a former gasworks and commissioned architects Eldred Evans and David Shalev, to design a building for the gallery in a similar style to the gas works. The building began in 1991, funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the Henry Moore Foundation and donations from the public. It included a rotunda at the centre of the gallery, looking over Porthmeor Beach and was completed in 1993. The gallery opened in June 1993, the second of the Tate&#x27;s regional galleries after Tate Liverpool, receiving more than 120,000 visitors before the end of the year. 

In 1999, to celebrate the solar eclipse (as St Ives was predicted to be the first British town to witness the event), Tate St Ives held an exhibition called &quot;As Dark as Light&quot;, exhibiting work from Garry Fabian Miller, Gia Edzveradze and Yuko Shiraishi alongside art from local schoolchildren.

In 2012, Tate St Ives ran a competition for a design team to build a major extension, which was won by Jamie Fobert Architects. In January 2015, the Tate St Ives received £3.9 million to contribute towards the new extension, with the intention of doubling the available space in order to accommodate tourists throughout the year, without having to close between exhibitions. The building contract was awarded to BAM Construct UK, who would be adding a extension designed by Jamie Fobert, with the original architect&#x27;s involvement in works to the existing building. The Tate St Ives was closed in October 2015 for these works and remained closed for two years.

Tate St Ives reopened in October 2017, with the inaugural exhibition in the new 500m2 gallery a solo show by contemporary sculptor Rebecca Warren, &#x27;All that heaven allows&#x27;.

In July 2018, Tate St. Ives won the Art Fund Museum of the Year Prize, beating the other shortlisted museums (the Brooklands Museum, the Ferens Art Gallery, Glasgow Women&#x27;s Library and the Postal Museum, London) to the £100,000 prize. Later that month, the Royal Institute of British Architects announced that the new Tate building had reached the shortlist for the 2018 Stirling Prize. It was beaten by the Bloomberg Building in London, by Foster + Partners. In 2019, Tate St Ives won a Civic Trust Award.

<text>FreeWill Co is a company whose website, FreeWill.com, has online software which helps people write wills for free and make charitable contributions, and it reports each person&#x27;s planned bequests to charities which pay subscription fees. It also helps people write advance healthcare directives and living trusts in California.

==Background==
FreeWill is a public benefit corporation founded at Stanford University in 2017 by Jennifer Xia Spradling and Patrick Schmitt. It has two social missions: The first is to create access to estate planning for all individuals regardless of their backgrounds or ability to pay. The second is to make it easy for people to leave money to charity. As a public benefit corporation, they are legally obligated to pursue their social missions in addition to seeking financial return.

The idea originated from Schmitt&#x27;s work with the Democratic National Committee in fundraising. After working on his own estate planning, he figured that a website could be created that could simplify the process and that doing so could help raise money for charitable causes.

&quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine ranked the founding of FreeWill as one of the top 50 Philanthropic efforts of 2019.

==Business model==
Charities pay a fee to FreeWill to have the charity&#x27;s name included in the software, and they receive reports of the name, address, assets, and planned bequest for each donor who agrees. Donors are not required to leave money to charity.

The company&#x27;s products include wills, durable financial power of attorney, qualified charitable distributions, stock donations. and living wills (also known as advance healthcare directives or healthcare power of attorney). FreeWill offers a living trust only in California.

After entering all will information, users have options to download the will, get more information, or see a lawyer, in which case the site offers the American Bar Association directory of all lawyers.

==Market==
As of June 2021, 295,000 people have prepared wills on the platform, 19% have included bequests to charities, and bequests average $111,000. The planned bequests total $3 billion. The largest numbers of donations
have been for the American Red Cross,
United Way, 
Defenders of Wildlife
and Disabled American Veterans.
The average user is 57 years old.

==Privacy==
FreeWill is not a law firm and does not have an attorney-client relationship with customers. Privacy statements let the company store information on assets, children bequests, medical and religious preferences and use them to target ads and fundraising appeals.

FreeWill says it uses modern security protocols. They acknowledge that information can escape in security breaches, for which they do not accept liability.

==Dispute resolution==
FreeWill disclaims liability for errors and omissions in their software; they also note that laws change rapidly. If people nevertheless have disputes with the company, the users and company agree to use small claims courts or individual arbitration in New York City under &quot;Commercial Arbitration Rules that contemplate in-person hearings.&quot; The company&#x27;s offices are in New York City, and it is incorporated in Delaware.

<text>Thomas Stevenson Drew (August 25, 1802 – January 1879) was the third Governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas.

==Biography==
He was born in Wilson County, Tennessee. Drew moved with his family to Louisiana and then, in 1818, to Arkansas. He worked as a traveling salesman and school teacher. Drew first settled in Clark County and was appointed Clark County Clerk in 1823. In 1827 he moved to Pocahontas, Arkansas, and married Cinderella Bettis, daughter of the prosperous founder of that town, Ransom Bettis. His father-in-law gave the newlyweds of bottom land in Cherokee Bay, where the town of Biggers lies in what is now Randolph County (then Lawrence County.) The Drews prospered, and their plantation included 20 African-American slaves.

In 1832, Drew was elected County Judge of Lawrence County. In 1835, Drew and Bettis convinced the Arkansas Territorial Legislature to create Randolph County out of Lawrence County. In 1836, Drew and Bettis held an infamous free bar-b-que complete with free liquor for the entire county in Pocahontas (then known as Bettis Bluff). The grateful attendees the next day chose Pocahontas as the county seat in an upset election over the more populated community of Columbia. That same year, Drew gave the county land in downtown Pocahontas where a courthouse was constructed.

In 1836 he was chosen as a delegate to the Arkansas Constitutional Convention. He was elected Governor in 1844 as a Democrat, supported by the Conway-Sevier Faction that ruled Arkansas from territorial days to the 1850s. His administration concentrated on the state&#x27;s financial solvency and attempted to repair the state&#x27;s credit and party disunity. Other achievements of his first administration were Arkansas becoming the first southern state to declare Thanksgiving to be a state holiday, and, at Cinderella&#x27;s urging, he had legislation passed so that Arkansas became the first southern state to declare the property a woman brought to a marriage to be her own and not her husband&#x27;s.

Drew was reelected in 1848. In 1849 he dispatched a militia to Marion County to put down the Tutt-Everett War. Drew only served a year of his second term before resigning due to the low salary provided for the governor. He retired from politics and worked to try and recover from financial losses. He was living in Sebastian County, Arkansas, in 1860. but eventually moved to Texas, initially to Weatherford, and later to Hood County. Drew died in January 1879 at Lipan, Texas.

Drew was originally buried in the Old Baptist Cemetery in Lipan, but his body was removed in 1923 by Arkansas officials and moved to the Masonic Cemetery in Pocahontas, where he rests today along with Bettis, Cinderella, and several of the Drew children.

Drew County, Arkansas was named for him.

<doc id="306244" wikidata="Q410153" url="?curid=306244" title="Intrinsic factor">
<text>Intrinsic factor (IF), cobalamin binding intrinsic factor, also known as gastric intrinsic factor (GIF), is a glycoprotein produced by the parietal cells (in humans) or chief cells (in rodents) of the stomach. It is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 later on in the distal ileum of the small intestine. In humans, the gastric intrinsic factor protein is encoded by the &quot;CBLIF&quot; gene. Haptocorrin (transcobalamin I) is another glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands which binds to vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is acid-sensitive and in binding to haptocorrin it can safely pass through the acidic stomach to the duodenum. 

In the less acidic environment of the small intestine, pancreatic enzymes digest the glycoprotein carrier and vitamin B12 can then bind to intrinsic factor. This new complex is then absorbed by the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the ileum. Inside the cells, vitamin B12 dissociates once again and binds to another protein, transcobalamin II; the new complex can then exit the epithelial cells to be carried to the liver.

== Site of secretion ==
Intrinsic factor is secreted by parietal cells within the stomach, and so is present in the gastric juice as well as in the gastric mucous membrane. The optimum pH for its action is approximately 7. Its concentration does not correlate with the amount of HCl or pepsin in the gastric juice, e.g., intrinsic factor may be present even when pepsin is largely absent. The site of formation of the intrinsic factor varies in different species. In pigs it is obtained from the pylorus and beginning of the duodenum; in human beings it is present in the fundus and body of the stomach.

The limited amount of normal human gastric intrinsic factor limits normal efficient absorption of B12 to about 2 μg per meal, a nominally adequate intake of B12.

== Insufficiency ==
In pernicious anemia, which is usually an autoimmune disease, autoantibodies directed against intrinsic factor or parietal cells themselves lead to an intrinsic factor deficiency, malabsorption of vitamin B12, and subsequent megaloblastic anemia. Atrophic gastritis can also cause intrinsic factor deficiency and anemia through damage to the parietal cells of the stomach wall. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can interfere with normal dissociation of vitamin B12 from its binding proteins in the small intestine, preventing its absorption via the intrinsic factor complex. Other risk factors contributing to pernicious anemia are anything that damages or removes a portion of the stomach&#x27;s parietal cells, including bariatric surgery, gastric tumors, gastric ulcers, and excessive consumption of alcohol.

Mutations in the &quot;GIF&quot; gene are responsible for a rare inheritable disease called &quot;intrinsic factor deficiency&quot; which results in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

=== Treatment ===

In most countries, intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 are used to treat pernicious anemia. Orally administered vitamin B12 is absorbed without intrinsic factor, but at levels of less than one percent than if intrinsic factor is present. Despite the low amounts absorbed, oral vitamin B12 therapy is effective at reducing symptoms of pernicious anemia. 

Vitamin B12 can also be given sublingually, but there is no evidence that this route of administration is superior to the oral route, and only Canada and Sweden routinely prescribe this route of administration.

Because vitamin B12 absorption is a multistep process that involves the stomach, pancreas and small intestine, and is mediated by two carriers: Haptocorrin and intrinsic factor, and because Haptocorrin (transcobalamin I) binds to vitamin B12, and Vitamin B12 is acid-sensitive, when vitamin B12 binds to Haptocorrin it can safely pass through the acidic stomach to the duodenum, given time in the mouth.
